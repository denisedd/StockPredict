{"Headline": "The Jobs Americans Do", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "The Future of WorkPopular ideas about the working class are woefully out of date. Here are nine people who tell a truer story of what the American work force does today \u2014 and will do tomorrow.Supported byThe decline of the old working class has meant both an economic triumph for the nation and a personal tribulation for many of the workers. Technological progress has made American farms and factories more productive than ever, creating great wealth and cutting the cost of food and most other products. But the work no longer requires large numbers of workers. In 1900, factories and farms employed 60 percent of the work force. By 1950, a half-century later, those two sectors employed 36 percent. In 2014, they employed less than 10 percent.For more than a century, since the trend was first documented, people have been prophesying a dire future in which the working class would no longer work. In 1964, a group of prominent liberals wrote President Johnson to warn of a \u201ccybernation revolution\u201d inexorably creating \u201ca permanent impoverished and jobless class established in the midst of potential abundance.\u201dMachines have taken the jobs of millions of Americans, and there is every indication that the trend will continue. In October, Budweiser successfully tested a self-driving truck by delivering beer more than 120 miles to a warehouse in Colorado. In December, Amazon opened a small convenience store near its Seattle headquarters that has no cashiers. Customers \u2014 for now, Amazon employees only \u2014 are billed automatically as they leave the store. In January, Bank of America opened branches in Denver and Minneapolis that are staffed by a lone employee, A.T.M.s and video terminals. And Americans are making a growing share of purchases online: about 8.4 percent of retail sales in 2016. These changes are driven by consumer preferences, not just by corporate cost-cutting imperatives. People like shopping in bed in the middle of the night. People like that computers make fewer mistakes. And people grow accustomed to computers. A few years ago, I watched a woman walk up to a bank teller and ask where she could find an A.T.M. The teller asked if she could help. No, the woman said, she just needed to withdraw some money.But the forecasters were wrong in the most important respect. Workers continue to find work, but now the jobs are in service. Taking care of aging baby boomers, in particular, has become by far the largest driver of job growth in the American economy. Among the occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects to grow most rapidly over the next decade: physical-therapy assistants, home health aides, occupational-therapy assistants, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, occupational-therapy aides, physician assistants. ... You get the idea. Nine of the 12 fastest-growing fields are different ways of saying \u201cnurse.\u201dIn 1950, service work made up about 40 percent of working-class labor in the United States. By 2005, that share had climbed to 56 percent, according to data from a 2013 analysis by the economists David Autor at M.I.T. and David Dorn at the University of Zurich. The available evidence, Autor said, suggests that this trend has continued \u201cvery rapidly\u201d over the last decade, increasing the share of American workers who work in the service industries.The rise of service-sector employment reflects the fact that Americans on average have more money to spend and that we are spending relatively less of that money on physical goods, because those goods have become cheaper. It took 10.5 hours of work at average wages to buy a bicycle in 1979; it took just four hours in 2015. Most Americans don\u2019t want a second and third bicycle, so that leaves more money for other purposes. And increasingly, the money is spent on services: help around the home, entertainment and vacations and, most of all, education and health care.These jobs are difficult to mechanize or to perform with greater efficiency. Convalescents cannot be trained to eat more quickly. A phlebotomist cannot draw blood from two arms at once. Robots, as yet, cannot change diapers. Moreover, consumers may have an emotional investment in seeing this caring work performed by people rather than machines. They may be willing to pay for a personal touch.Another limitation on our ability to program computers to do the work of people is summarized by the observation of the Hungarian scientist Michael Polanyi that \u201cwe can know more than we can tell.\u201d Consider the work of a security guard, who is basically tasked with sounding the alarm if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Technology improves security, but it is not easy to write a formula approximating intuition.The Cassandras, however, were right to warn about poverty in the midst of abundance. Personal-service providers \u2014 \u201cservants,\u201d as they once were called \u2014 tend to be poorly paid. There is little job security; the benefits are meager; the work is physically demanding and emotionally draining. It is not particularly surprising that women and immigrants have been more likely to take these jobs than native-born men. For many of the caretaking service jobs, less than 10 percent of the work force is male.The wages of service work increasingly determine the welfare of the American working class and, to a substantial degree, the broader economy. But politicians have paid little attention. That\u2019s partly because Americans continue to view service work as a way station, not a way of life. Teenagers get their first job at McDonald\u2019s; mothers dip back into the work force as receptionists; seniors make a little extra money as Walmart greeters. The reality is that these are the kinds of jobs millions of Americans hold for their entire working lives. And increasingly, these are the jobs their children will perform, too.\u2014Binyamin Appelbaum Santa Clara, Calif. \u2022 The Home Health AideBy Elise CraigNine years later, at age 69, Bersabe is among nearly a million Americans who work as home health aides, a field that is expected to grow 38 percent by 2024, faster than most other occupations, thanks in large part to the aging baby-boom population. Already a senior herself, Bersabe works 65 hours a week caring for two elderly clients with dementia. She spends five 12- and 14-hour night shifts in her clients\u2019 homes, providing companionship, reminders to take medicine and light housekeeping for one client, and everything from bathing and dressing to diaper changing for the other.Having two jobs is partly a necessity and partly a hedge; should one of her clients die, she can still rely on income from the other. She also needs the money. Because she is a member of the Service Employees International Union Local 2015, the agencies that Bersabe works for pay her $16.13 and $11 an hour. California\u2019s current minimum wage is $10.50, but the living wage for someone like Bersabe is $11.29.Bersabe is grateful for the money and has no complaints about her wages, but she acknowledges that making a living in the Bay Area\u2019s technology bubble is tough. She lost her house after the 2008 layoff, and she and her husband, who works nights as a security guard, now share a three-bedroom apartment rental behind Levi\u2019s Stadium, where the 49ers play, with two other elderly couples.The gratitude Bersabe\u2019s clients show her \u2014 one kisses her when she arrives \u2014 is incredibly fulfilling, she said, but the work is hard. Dementia patients can be very unpredictable. \u201cI have a very tame cat, and when they start to have sun-downing\u201d \u2014 the late-afternoon confusion that can be a symptom of dementia \u2014 \u201cI have a wild tiger,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the person herself, it\u2019s the sickness.\u201d Once, when a client began to get agitated and yell at Bersabe, she sneaked around to the front door and rang the doorbell. The client welcomed Bersabe as an old friend that she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.Bersabe expects to work through her 70s and 80s and maybe even into her 90s. \u201cI\u2019ll work as long as I can stand on my own two legs,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as I can drive and walk and God permits me, I\u2019ll enjoy the job I love.\u201d Bersabe has no intention of being a burden to her three children, who have families of their own and are scattered from Kentucky to the Philippines. \u201cHonestly, I am thinking, when the time comes, who is going to take care of me?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bother my kids. I want them to see me as a kicking woman, like I was before.\u201dElise Craig is a freelance writer and editor based in San Francisco.Brooklyn \u2022 The Hair BraiderBy Jazmine HughesUfot, 38, has known how to braid since she was 15; she picked up the skill in Warri, Nigeria, where she was born. A family friend owned a braiding shop, and she visited every day, watching the women do their work and, eventually, persuading them to let her practice on their customers\u2019 heads. She majored in economics at Delta State University in Nigeria, but while she was at school, she found out she had thyroid cancer and eventually moved to the United States for treatment. She started braiding hair for the money and never returned to economics. \u201cThere\u2019s more money doing hair,\u201d she told me. And because she\u2019s in such high demand, Ufot can work 12 to 15 hour days, sometimes seven days a week, depending on appointments. She charges between $100 to $250 for each style, depending on its intricacy. She hasn\u2019t gone on vacation in five years.Unlike most people trained in cosmetology, braiders, many of whom are immigrants, don\u2019t use chemicals, sharp objects or heat; just a comb, oil, water and their hands. Individual states legislate the requirements for becoming a licensed hair braider; in several, braiders \u2014 even those with a pre-existing knowledge of braiding \u2014 are required to complete more than 2,000 hours of training at cosmetology schools, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars and whose classes have almost nothing to do with styling black women\u2019s hair. Many cosmetology schools don\u2019t even offer braiding instruction.In 2016, Iowa ended its cosmetology-license requirement for hair braiders, allowing them instead to pass basic health-and-sanitation exams with the state; Nebraska, too, recently ended its laborious stipulation of 2,100 hours of cosmetology training for natural hair braiders. In New York, braiders are required to obtain a natural-hair license, which allows the stylists to perform the chemical-free techniques of styling black hair \u2014 for example, shampooing hair, applying extensions, making dreadlocks, braiding \u2014 and not much else. It costs about $70 and mandates schooling, which costs more. But many braiders operate without licenses.Ufot wants to go to cosmetology school; her goal is to enroll by year\u2019s end, if she can get enough financial aid. She figures it will cost her about $15,000, so she\u2019ll continue braiding and attend night classes as long she can get someone to look after her 6-year-old daughter. She told me that she wants to learn how to do all types of hair \u2014 dyeing, perms \u2014 and dreams of owning her own shop. \u201cI want to get my cosmetology license so I\u2019m able to do all of the things,\u201d she told me, laughing. \u201cI want to be able to cut white people\u2019s hair!\u201dJazmine Hughes is an associate editor for the magazine.Cicero, Ill. \u2022 The Fast-Food WorkerBy Ben AustenA few weeks after meeting the organizer, Alvarez said, she and her co-workers handed in a petition demanding that the store manager show them more respect in front of customers. Not only did the yelling stop, she said, but they soon received a raise of as much as 75 cents. \u201cPushing works,\u201d Alvarez says she learned. In March 2014, she joined her first rally, a multicity coordinated Fight for $15 day of action.Alvarez is now 24 and still works at the same McDonald\u2019s. Nationally, jobs in retail and food services outnumber those in manufacturing by more than two to one. The country\u2019s largest private employers include Walmart, McDonald\u2019s, Kroger and the conglomeration of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. These chains are no longer places just for teenagers to work part time: The average age of a fast-food employee has climbed to 29; like Alvarez, a third of them have spent some time in college.Fight for $15 doesn\u2019t operate like a traditional union: There are no contracts with employers, and Alvarez and others pay no dues. The Service Employees International Union has been its primary source of funding from its inception in New York City, in 2012. Yet Fight for $15 organizers take credit for winning wage increases for 22 million workers in America. Although the federal minimum wage of $7.25 hasn\u2019t budged since 2009, numerous cities and states since 2012 have raised their base pay to $12, $13 and even $15 an hour. Under President Trump, the effort is sure to face additional hurdles. But Fight for $15 helped lead the campaign to derail Trump\u2019s first pick for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, organizing workers from his fast-food chains to march on their stores and to share their stories of wage theft. Low pay is an issue that crosses party lines: Two of every five U.S. workers earn less than $15 an hour.Today Alvarez makes $11 an hour at McDonald\u2019s. She has never been put on the schedule for a full 40-hour week; she receives no benefits, health coverage or overtime. Yet the raise has allowed her to replace the moldering floorboards in her basement apartment. And Alvarez has been transformed in other ways by the labor fight. She has emerged as one of its spokeswomen, and the job has taken on a new significance. \u201cWhen people say we should go back to school, I say the adjunct professors who joined us went to school,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cHow come they\u2019re not doing better? I\u2019m not just serving customers. I\u2019m also serving these innocent ladies\u201d \u2014 her co-workers \u2014 \u201cwho might not be conscious of their rights. I\u2019m like their protector.\u201dBen Austen is working on a book about Chicago\u2019s Cabrini-Green public-housing complex.Brooklyn Park, Minn. \u2022 The Delivery DriverBy Jaime LoweIn recent years, online giants like Amazon have pushed for ever-faster delivery times, sometimes delivering orders on the same day. As consumers increase their online shopping \u2014 total retail sales in the United States increased only 2.9 percent last year, but online sales rose 15.1 percent \u2014 distribution networks have adapted by integrating more and more consumer destinations into their systems. Mark Merz, a spokesman for O\u2019Reilly, attributes part of the company\u2019s success to \u201chaving inventory immediately available when a customer needs those parts.\u201dThough O\u2019Reilly extended its reach to 4,829 stores in 47 states last year and revenue surpassed $8.5 billion, that growth hasn\u2019t led to an expansion of its work force or changed the nature of its jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been short-staffed for over six months,\u201d Culver says. \u201cGuys are doing extra work and taking on extra stores for their routes.\u201d Culver, who belongs to the Teamsters Local 120, says he is not paid by the amount of time it takes him to complete his deliveries but according to the route driven, which varies from year to year. Culver says he made roughly $53,000 last year, earning almost $23 an hour. \u201cOur wages haven\u2019t really gone up in the same way that other jobs\u2019 wages have gone up,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to go to special school to get my license, and how we\u2019re treated and looked at hasn\u2019t really changed in 20 years.\u201dCulver, who is 56, doesn\u2019t expect that technology will eliminate work like his. \u201cI don\u2019t see how automatic truck drivers are going to work,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many variables.\u201d O\u2019Reilly still needs people to operate the electric pallet jacks and hydraulic liftgates at the rear of their delivery trucks, still relies on backs and arms to unload and inspect orders. Despite the toll the work has taken on Culver \u2014 two operations to fuse vertebrae in his neck and a lower-back operation \u2014 he says he likes the job. \u201cI\u2019m happy doing this, I enjoy what I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope I can make it to 65.\u201dJaime Lowe is a freelance writer and a frequent contributor to the magazine.Las Vegas \u2022 The Customer-Service RepBy Eric SteuerNot long after landing in Las Vegas, Dolan started looking for a job. She found a call-center opening with Zappos, the online shoe-and-apparel retailer. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know anything about the company,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after I was hired, I started talking to locals, and people were like: \u2018You have no idea, do you? We all tried to get in there.\u2019\u2009\u201dZappos has more than 500 people on its customer-service team, about a third of the company\u2019s total staff. Most employees work together in the company\u2019s headquarters, a 10-story building downtown that used to be Las Vegas\u2019s city hall. Employees like Dolan, who work the phones, start at $14 an hour, about a dollar less than the median wage earned by the more than 2.5 million Americans who work as customer-service representatives. But Dolan, who makes slightly more than that, points out that, unlike at many other companies, most Zappos workers are full-time employees who receive benefits like health insurance and retirement plans.At Zappos, employees are encouraged to interact with co-workers throughout the business and eat together on campus. The company frequently hosts events, ranging from product demonstrations to scavenger hunts, which are open to all employees. Dolan said this is one thing that makes her current work so much better than previous jobs. \u201cI\u2019ve been in places where I wasn\u2019t even allowed to take a break with someone if they were a different pay grade than I was,\u201d she said.Another difference from Dolan\u2019s previous call-center jobs is that Zappos reps aren\u2019t limited in the amount of time they are allowed to spend on each conversation. \u201cAt other jobs, I\u2019d be stressed because I\u2019d have to resolve each call in about five minutes in order to make my numbers,\u201d Dolan said. She knows she could be making more money somewhere else, but she wouldn\u2019t enjoy her day as much. \u201cI figured I\u2019d do this for six months just to get something local on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 so I could look for something else,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t looked for a job since I stepped foot in here. I don\u2019t plan on it.\u201dEric Steuer is a contributing writer for Wired based in San Francisco.Columbus, Ohio \u2022 The Meat CutterBy Abe StreepCentral Ohio is particularly welcoming to refugees, having resettled more than 17,000 since 1983. In November 2016, the region became a flash point for those opposed to resettlement when a Somali-born Ohio State University student was killed by police after attacking pedestrians. Still, in early February, the Columbus mayor, Andrew Ginther, signed an executive order supporting the resettlement of refugees. His reasons were economic as well as altruistic. Nearly 12 percent of Columbus is foreign-born. According to a recent study from the New American Economy, a nonprofit research-and-advocacy group, Columbus-area immigrants pay $1.2 billion a year in taxes and have an annual spending power of $3.2 billion. They work as doctors and engineers, open small businesses employing thousands, perform manual labor in warehouses and frequently do the jobs that many other Americans will not, like meatpacking.SugarCreek is one of many meatpacking businesses nationwide that have turned to refugees. Last spring, the company approached Community Refugee and Immigration Services (CRIS), a Columbus refugee- resettlement agency. \u201cThey needed people,\u201d said CRIS\u2019s Marcus Gorman, who arranges employment for the newly resettled. \u201cThey had a lot of opportunities for entry-level workers, and they were accustomed to working with folks that spoke little to no English.\u201d Now, Gorman said, about 65 of CRIS\u2019s clients work at SugarCreek. Since Sebatutsi started last November, he has opted to work every day, which he said is the best part of the job. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of overtime, and you can make money.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthat\u2019s also the worst thing.\u201d He is no longer able to join his family at church. All that pushing, slicing and packaging is repetitive, but it\u2019s far better than life in Gihembe. \u201cThe kids can ask you for something, you cannot provide,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here you work, you take care of your problems, you do something for yourself.\u201dAbe Streep is a contributing editor for Outside and a contributing writer for The California Sunday Magazine.Dalton, Ga. \u2022 The Carpet WhispererBy Lizzie O\u2019LearyGuido, who is 23 and goes by Lupe, has been working at Engineered Floors for almost two years. She has risen quickly, starting on yarn machines, before driving a Hyster forklift, working as a production clerk and now serving as a tufting scheduler. She creates orders, dictating the type of yarn to use and how much footage of carpet each job will need. \u201cWithout this person,\u201d she said of her role, \u201cthere really is no show.\u201dIn the political sphere, manufacturing work is often associated with men, and specifically white men. But women have always worked in carpets in Dalton and at Engineered Floors. And Dalton is about 50 percent Latino, which is reflected in the work force here. Many people in the city came from Mexico in the 1970s and \u201980s to work in the industry, including Guido\u2019s parents, Jose and Martina.Lupe Guido was born in Dalton and dreamed initially of becoming a lawyer. \u201cI talk a lot,\u201d she said with a laugh. But at 18, she wanted independence and her own money and went to work at Mohawk Industries, one of the largest carpet companies in the city, where her mother still works. It was not what her parents had in mind. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was always: \u2018Go to school, go to school,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. \u201c\u2009\u2018You don\u2019t want to be working how I\u2019m working.\u2019\u2009\u201dBut the carpet industry, like most of American manufacturing, has undergone radical changes. The hardest and most dangerous jobs are now performed by machines that are mostly run by computers, and those computers are watched over by people like Guido.Engineered Floors is new in comparison to Mohawk or Shaw Industries, the two companies that have dominated Dalton for decades. But Guido has been able to move up quickly. She earns $15.50 an hour, up from $11 an hour when she started in 2015. At the end of each year, she gets a $500 bonus.Guido said she would like to stay at Engineered Floors if she can. To do so requires vigilantly managing her time so that she can move up. She\u2019s awake at 6 a.m., clocks into her job at 7 and works a 10-hour shift until 5 p.m. After dinner with her fianc\u00e9, who also works in the carpet industry, Guido spends her nights studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree in human-resource management at Georgia Northwestern Technical College. One day, she wants to be a department manager or a plant manager. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve been growing and growing,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want for that to stop.\u201dLas Vegas \u2022 The Hotel CleanerBy Amanda FortiniSometimes the job is that straightforward, but often she opens the door to find what all G.R.A.s dread: a \u201ctrashed\u201d room. \u201cThey eat and they leave all the trash everywhere: cans, food,\u201d she said, gesturing with her hands. She was seated at a folding table in a trailer parked in the lot of the Las Vegas Culinary Workers Union. \u201cEspecially the bachelor party. Oh, my God, those are bad.\u201dBecause she is a member of the union, the job pays her $17.65 an hour. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226, chartered in 1935, is the largest union in Nevada, representing 57,000 men and women from 167 countries (its membership is 56 percent Latino and 81 percent people of color), among them cooks, bartenders, cocktail servers, porters, bellmen and guest-room attendants. The average wage of a culinary-union worker is $23 an hour, compared with the $10 an hour made by a nonunionized Las Vegas hospitality worker or the $6 an hour Almada, who is 42 and who moved to the United States from the Mexico border town of Agua Prieta (she got her green card when she was 11, and became a citizen when she was 22), was paid at her last job in a coffee-cup-making factory in Tucson.She said she was fired from that job for taking two months\u2019 maternity leave, which prompted her and her (now former) husband to move to Las Vegas. They had heard that there were jobs at the casinos, where 90 percent of the hospitality work force on the Strip belong to the culinary union. But it was only after they divorced and she needed to support herself and her three children that Almada applied for her job at the Aria.That was six years ago. Almada enumerates all the ways that the job and its attendant union membership has improved her life: free health insurance and pharmacy benefits; a pension; job security; and soon a $20,000 down payment she will use to buy her first house. Initially she didn\u2019t understand the benefits and regulations the union conferred. This is a common reason workers can still be taken advantage of, particularly those who don\u2019t speak English. For the past seven months, though, Almada has been on an extended, contractually allowed, union-sanctioned leave of absence to serve as an organizer at Mandalay Bay Casino; she is teaching other workers to read and understand their own contracts. \u201cI never had these rights in Arizona,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I had my little one, they fired me and nobody helped me. If I was working here with the union, that doesn\u2019t happen to me.\u201dAmanda Fortini is a contributing editor at Elle magazine and a visiting lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.Boston \u2022 The Pipe FitterBy Carlo RotellaThe fifth child of an overwhelmed single mother, Awan was kicked out of four schools and took a bullet in the shoulder before going to prison at 18 for trying to shoot a rival gang member. While serving a three-year sentence, he resolved that he would change his fate.With the help of a former prosecutor who took an interest in his rehabilitation, Awan found his way into Operation Exit, a program founded in 2014 in which the city of Boston partners with unions to channel residents with criminal backgrounds into the trades. Having sampled carpentry, sheet-metal work and other options, Awan, who had always been fascinated by welding but doesn\u2019t like heights, chose pipe fitting over iron work.There\u2019s plenty of politics in the building trades, but there\u2019s also an ethos of craft meritocracy. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you look like, it\u2019s what your clevis hangers look like,\u201d Awan said, referring to the brackets used to support pipes. \u201cAll at the same level, nothing crooked. It\u2019s about your work ethic.\u201d He\u2019s already planning to get his 5-year-old son into the local when he\u2019s old enough.Awan, who is 28 and currently a second-year apprentice making $30 an hour plus benefits, can become a journeyman in three years, and he looks forward to continuing up the scale of seniority and pay toward the top rate of $50 or so an hour. He still lives near the Four Corners section of Dorchester where he grew up, but he\u2019s shopping for a house outside the city. \u201cYou come from no money for food, nothing, to where you\u2019re buying a house, buying a car,\u201d he said. \u201cYour son needs a school uniform, you can get him one.\u201dBoston\u2019s mayor, Martin Walsh, intends Operation Exit to enable this kind of transformation of prospects and consciousness. Walsh, who also grew up in Dorchester and had his own troubles (a bullet grazed his leg) before putting his life on course in the building trades, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had 80 graduates come through this program, and we\u2019re expanding from the building trades into coding and culinary arts. Some of these guys were impact players on the street. It has an effect.\u201dPrograms that reduce crime by connecting offenders and potential offenders to meaningful work are getting more attention across the country. Some, like Operation Exit, focus on re-entry after prison; others, like the Chicago CRED initiative recently started by the Emerson Collective and Arne Duncan, the former U.S. secretary of education, try to reduce gun violence by teaching job and life skills to young men adrift from both school and the labor market.

Buffett, the billionaire investor, on Saturday lauded the \u201cmiraculous\u201d qualities of the United States economy in highlighting another stellar year for his company, Berkshire Hathaway.Mr. Buffett, whose record of beating the stock market over the past 50 years is unparalleled, is known for being persistently optimistic about the prospects of the American economy.He was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton during last year\u2019s presidential campaign and he did not mention President Trump in his letter. But his celebration of the American economy\u2019s ability to deliver growth stands in stark contrast to President Trump\u2019s darker descriptions of the country\u2019s economic prospects.That Mr. Buffett went out of his way to give credit to a \u201ctide of talented and ambitious immigrants\u201d was also worthy of note in light of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigrants.Last year was another outstanding one for the man known widely as the Oracle of Omaha. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stock price was up 23 percent in 2016, about double the return on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.Berkshire\u2019s operating companies, which include the insurance firm Geico, the railroad company BNSF and numerous others, also performed well in an improving economy, with operating earnings increasing to $17.5 billion in 2016 from $17.3 billion in 2015.Mr. Buffett also revealed in his letter that a recent bet on Apple had paid quick dividends. He owns a 1.1 percent stake in the company that he purchased at a total cost of $6.7 billion. His 61 million shares are now worth over $8 billion.Over the years, Mr. Buffett has had a complicated relationship with Wall Street. He has been a withering critic of the culture of high pay, group think and excessive fees yet he has also swooped in to buy big stakes in investment firms when they hit rough times.Underscoring his long-held thesis that, over time, highly paid hedge-fund hotshots lose out to a cheap index fund, Mr. Buffett presented the latest results of a bet he made nine years ago. Since then, a standard S & P index fund overseen by Vanguard is up 85 percent, easily outpacing the hedge funds\u2019 return of 22 percent. Annually, the gap is just as wide: 7 percent for the index fund and 2.2 percent for the hedge funds.As usual, Mr. Buffett did not mince words in expressing his astonishment as to how elite investment professionals could register such mediocre returns while raking in steep fees.\u201cI\u2019m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But the results for their investors were dismal \u2014 really dismal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the funds and funds-of-funds involved \u2014 fees that were totally unwarranted by performance \u2014 were such that their managers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Peculiar Populism of Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cPostmaterialism,\u201d they write, \u201ceventually became its own gravedigger.\u201dThe rise of postmaterialism here and in Europe, Inglehart and Norris argue,brought declining social class voting, undermining the working-class-oriented Left parties that had implemented redistributive policies for most of the 20th century. Moreover, the new noneconomic issues introduced by Postmaterialists overshadowed the classic Left-Right economic issues, drawing attention away from redistribution to cultural issues, further paving the way for rising inequality.As the Democratic Party in the United States and social democratic parties in Europe shifted their interest away from economic policies, hard-pressed members of the working and middle classes \u2014 suffering from stagnant or declining wages and lost jobs \u2014 led \u201ca backlash against the cultural changes linked with the rise of Postmaterialist and Self-expression values,\u201d Inglehart and Norris write.In effect, postwar prosperity in America and in Western Europe allowed many voters to shift their political priorities from bread-and-butter issues to less materialistic concerns, \u201cbringing greater emphasis on freedom of expression, environmental protection, gender equality, and tolerance of gays, handicapped people and foreigners.\u201dNot everyone experienced this newfound economic security, however, and the number of those left behind has grown steadily. Those who do not experience the benefits of prosperity, Inglehart and Norris write, can see \u201cothers\u201d \u2014 \u201can influx of foreigners,\u201d for example, as the culprit causing their predicament:Insecurity encourages an authoritarian xenophobic reaction in which people close ranks behind strong leaders, with strong in-group solidarity, rejection of outsiders, and rigid conformity to group norms.According to the two authors,The proximate cause of the populist vote is anxiety that pervasive cultural changes and an influx of foreigners are eroding the cultural norms one knew since childhood. The main common theme of populist authoritarian parties on both sides of the Atlantic is a reaction against immigration and cultural change. Economic factors such as income and unemployment rates are surprisingly weak predictors of the populist vote.In addition to immigration, issues related to race play a central role.Less-educated white Americans feel that they have become \u201cstrangers in their own land.\u201d They see themselves as victims of affirmative action and betrayed by \u201cline-cutters\u201d \u2014 African-Americans, immigrants, refugees and women \u2014 who jump ahead of them in the queue for the American dream. They resent liberal intellectuals who tell them to feel sorry for the line-cutters, and dismiss them as bigots when they don\u2019t.Relative \u2014 not absolute \u2014 economic insecurity plays a major role in the development of these attitudes. Inglehart and Norris observe:It is clear that strong forces have been working to increase support for xenophobic parties. This seems to reflect the fact that in recent decades, a large share of the population of high-income countries has experienced declining real income, declining job security, and rising income inequality, bringing growing insecurity. In addition, rich countries have experienced a large influx of immigrants and refugees.They cite the example of Denmark before and after the financial collapse of 2008-9:In 2004, before the crisis erupted, the overtly anti-Muslim Danish People\u2019s Party won 7 percent of the vote; in 2014, it won 27 percent, becoming Denmark\u2019s largest party. In both years, cultural backlash, rather than economic deprivation, was the strongest predictor of the vote for the Danish People\u2019s Party \u2014 but rising economic insecurity made people increasingly likely to vote for them.understand why low-density white America turned out to support a populist leader with disturbingly illiberal tendencies.In sections of the country undergoing sustained hardship \u2014 a result of automation, global trade and the residual effects of the 2007-9 recession \u2014 the march toward post-materialist values has, in Wilkinson\u2019s view, come to a dead halt.In normal circumstances, two fundamental shifts \u2014 from traditional and religious values to secular and rational values, on one hand, and from survival to self-expressive values, on the other \u2014 \u201ctend to move in the same direction over time,\u201d Wilkinson writes. \u201cIn the United States they haven\u2019t.\u201dInstead, he points out, the United States has gone in two seemingly opposite directions over the past 15 years, becoming \u201csignificantly more secular-rational, while losing ground on self-expressive values.\u201dWhites living in low density, exurban and rural areas are driving the shift back toward survival values, Wilkinson argues.The relative hardship experienced by many Trump supporters is reflected in a number of studies.Take just one measure. For most Americans, the most common form of wealth lies in the value of the homes people own. Conversely, those people who own homes valued below what they owe on their mortgages have more debt than wealth; they are, as the saying goes, \u201cunderwater.\u201dThis was especially true in the industrial Midwest where, Monnat reported,Trump did better than Romney by an average of 16.7 percent in the highest mortality counties compared to 8.1 percent in the lowest mortality counties.It\u2019s simple: the working class \u2014 and even a significant part of the non-cosmopolitan middle class that might vote for the Left \u2014 has always had a degree of cultural, ethnic and nationalist feelings, while the modern Left has bizarrely ejected all these things out of leftist politics and engaged in the deranged fantasy that these things don\u2019t matter at all.The result, in LK\u2019s view, is disastrous:The Left \u2014 as it currently exists with its toxic obsession with internationalism, multiculturalism and identity politics for everybody except the majority of people who might form its base \u2014 will simply die if it doesn\u2019t understand this.to believe that the American establishment was no longer reliably patriotic, with \u201cpatriotism\u201d defined as an instinctive loyalty to the well-being and values of Jacksonian America.While much of the elite \u201cwith cosmopolitan sympathies see their main ethical imperative as working for the betterment of humanity in general,\u201d according to Mead, Trump supporters see \u201cthe cosmopolitan elite as near treasonous \u2014 people who think it is morally questionable to put their own country, and its citizens, first.\u201dInglehart and Norris conclude their current essay on a modestly optimistic note, suggesting the possibility that there might yet be an alliance between the populist right and the Democratic left:So far, emotionally-charged cultural issues cutting across economic lines have hindered the emergence of a new coalition. But both the rise of populist movements and the growing concern for inequality, reflect widespread dissatisfaction with existing political alignments. In the long run, a coalition based on the 99 percent is likely to emerge.Wilkinson does not share this outlook:To the extent that increasing economic security is liberalizing, and stagnation and decline tend toward an illiberal, zero-sum survival mind-set, this amounts to a recipe for the political imposition of relatively illiberal policy on increasingly liberal and increasingly economically powerful cities. This is not a stable situation, and bodes ill for the future of American freedom.In practice, Wilkinson\u2019s bleak prediction depends heavily on the success or failure of President Trump\u2019s attempts to undermine the pillars of democratic government: the system of checks and balances, the rule of law and the watchdog role of the media.Trump is betting that his flamboyant strategy will take him through his first term and beyond. As atrocious as it is, who can blame him?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Japan, Another Quarter of Modest Growth Represents a Victory", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan extended its yearlong streak of modest economic growth in the last three months of 2016, data showed on Monday.Output in the country, which has the world\u2019s third-largest economy but has struggled to shake off deflation, expanded in each quarter last year, the longest uninterrupted period of growth in three years. However, the pace of expansion has been slowing, and questions about how Japan will weather a trade-skeptical Trump administration persist.Japan\u2019s gross domestic product increased by 1 percent in annualized terms in the three months through December, the government\u2019s Cabinet Office said in a preliminary estimate. That was a hair slower than forecast; economists had expected an expansion of 1.1 percent. Japan, whose growth is held back by a shrinking population, had not increased its output for four straight quarters since 2012-13. The rise in the fourth quarter was weaker than in the rest of 2016, however.Exports, mostly. It has become a familiar pattern: Global demand for Japanese cars, chemicals and other products keeps factories humming, even as domestic spending sputters. In the last three months of the year, exports surged 11 percent in annualized terms, according to Cabinet Office data. Domestic consumer spending, the biggest component of G.D.P., was essentially flat. Investment by businesses was up 3.8 percent, although much of that, too, is linked to exports as companies gear up factories to sell things abroad.President Trump has pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal Japan backed. He has repeatedly complained about America\u2019s large trade deficit with Japan, which he says is exacerbated by unfair Japanese trade policies. Retaliation, if it came, could choke off an important source of growth. That is a big reason Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been cultivating friendly ties with Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rethinking Retirement for Longer Lives With Fewer Safety Nets", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive days a week, Kim Moske makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and brown-bags it to work. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing that for 30 years and saving what I would have spent eating my lunch out someplace,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s added up to a lot of money, and truthfully, I don\u2019t care what I eat for lunch.\u201dThat is a small gesture, but it is indicative of the advantages of making daily choices to help save for a financially secure retirement.Ms. Moske, 56, lives in Delaware, Ohio, and is a project manager for a small manufacturing firm. She expects to retire in six years. But it has not been all about homemade sandwiches: She started to save and invest in her late 20s.That foresight and discipline have made it possible for her to envision a fairly traditional retirement \u2014 one that will allow her time to pursue hobbies like gardening, hiking in Hocking Hills State Park or biking along the Olentangy River near her home, and traveling.\u201cI\u2019m not one of these who has to go to Paris, but it would be fun to finish seeing all the 50 states,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve visited 30 of them.\u201dMs. Moske grew up in a family \u201cwhere we were always getting utilities shut off,\u201d she said. \u201cWe lived in fear that our car would be repossessed, and we frequently ran out of milk. I was raised by two people who were very good at wasting money and very poor at managing it. They were a financial disaster.\u201d\u201cMy father worked very hard his entire life and made a good income, yet he died penniless at age 78,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m frugal to a fault. Therefore my retirement is in pretty good shape.\u201dMs. Moske is proof that it is never too early to start working on your retirement plan. Fewer workers today have traditional pensions than in the past, life expectancies are generally longer and, with unknowns like health care costs and inflation in the coming decades, planning is more important than ever.When Ms. Moske was 26 and working full time to pay her way through college, she signed up for a class on finance and investing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a stock from a cornstalk, but I realized that I needed to take control,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband and I immediately started living on less than what we needed, saving and investing.\u201dMoney was tight during the dozen years that she stayed home to raise the couple\u2019s two children, now 20 and 22. She also missed out on those years of employer-provided retirement savings.Then, six years ago, her husband died from injuries sustained in a fall. That caused a seismic shift not only emotionally, but also financially, as she had to live on one income. But she paid off her home, now valued at around $300,000, with a portion of the money she received from her husband\u2019s life insurance policy.\u201cI will be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t go it alone: I meet with a financial planner once a year to make sure I am on track, and I check retirement calculators all the time.\u201dIn many ways, she is an anomaly.Fred Blanton, a business and marketing consultant in Houston, does not have \u201ca big golden nest egg,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be 65 in a few months, but I need an income. I have enough money if I live another 15 years, but am I going to die at 80?\u201d\u201cThe 65 retirement age for Social Security was put in place in 1933 when retirement lasted eight to 10 years,\u201d Mr. Blandin said. \u201cIn the old pension system, people didn\u2019t have to make decisions on how much to contribute to a retirement account, which investments to grow their nest egg, how big of a nest egg they would need, what to do with the nest egg when changing jobs and how much to withdraw on an annual basis in retirement.\u201dIt is essential to get a \u201csnapshot of your financial picture ASAP,\u201d Mr. Blandin said. For example, how much have you already saved for retirement? How much are you saving annually as a percentage of your income? Can you bump it up? How is it invested? Have you used a retirement calculator to run the numbers? Have you worked with a financial planner to help you create a blueprint?Even people who save conscientiously, he said, are not necessarily paying close attention to the details of the financial products they purchase, investment fees, planning for health care in retirement, inflation and other factors that will affect their future.\u201cSaving and planning for retirement among the self-employed requires a do-it-yourself approach,\u201d said Catherine Collinson, president of the Transamerica Center and executive director of the Aegon Center. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t have an employer, they typically lack access to the employer-sponsored retirement benefits that so many workers enjoy.\u201d\u201cThey also often encounter fluctuations in income,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich makes it that much more challenging to save on a consistent basis.\u201dAbout one-third of self-employed workers always make sure they are saving for retirement, according to the report. Less than a quarter say they save for retirement on an occasional basis, or that they have saved for retirement in the past but are not currently doing so.Even for those who have saved enough to retire comfortably, working for pay in retirement can help provide a safety net and peace of mind. It helps people put off dipping into retirement accounts and may even allow some to continue contributing to their retirement savings.The pay can also help provide a cushion to allow someone to delay tapping into Social Security until age 70, which increases annual Social Security income by nearly 8 percent compared with retiring at the full retirement age. The income can also help with medical bills not covered by Medicare.For Michael L. Stark, 66, chief operating officer at American Financial Network in Calabasas, Calif., the decision to stay on the job is straightforward. He loves what he does and believes that he is still on a learning curve. He has flexibility in his hours and a short commute to work, leaving him time to spend with his three grandchildren and on leisure activities like skiing and hiking.\u201cI am not wealthy by any means, but my wife and I have done O.K. saving,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have retired a couple of years ago, but I am not mentally or physically ready to retire right now.\u201dRetirement is about a lot more than just hitting financial targets. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking a more holistic approach to our longer lives,\u201d Ms. Dychtwald said. \u201cDespite the challenges, retirees are generally adaptable. They are willing to make a wide array of course corrections, trade-offs and adjustments \u2014 from continuing some form of work, to downsizing or relocating their home, to renting out a spare bedroom or living with a roommate \u2014 which offer the chance to create more financial security.\u201dAs for Ms. Moske, when she retires she plans to buy a small condo in Florida where she can go for the winter months. Thinking of her brown-bag habits, she laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll name it PB&J.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "African Nations Increasingly Silence Internet to Stem Protests", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 Julius Ikena\u2019s trade business is at a standstill because he cannot make electronic payments to his partners. Andrew Mofor cannot get access to the small fortune \u2014 800 euros, or about $850 \u2014 that his daughter sent him through an online banking system.And Angela Atabong, a 29-year-old economics student in Cameroon\u2019s capital, can no longer tap out sweet nothings on the internet messaging service WhatsApp to her fianc\u00e9, who lives six hours away.All three have been thwarted by Cameroon\u2019s government, which is the latest in sub-Saharan Africa to switch off the internet in parts or all of a nation, or to put other limits on online communication in hopes of snuffing out protests and other opposition.Officials in Cameroon and elsewhere say internet blackouts are a security measure. But they are also a hit to the fragile economies of developing nations that are increasingly reliant on online business transactions as internet access and cellphone use have exploded in recent years.Authoritarian regimes have long limited communication with the outside world during tense times. Most notably in 2011, Egyptian government officials cut internet and mobile network access to 80 million people as thousands of protesters gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Governments in Myanmar, Nepal and other countries have also shut off internet access in recent years.Now, sub-Saharan African governments are increasingly employing the tactic: Blackouts have grown most rapidly in the past two years, researchers say.In recent months, governments in several countries have turned off internet access during elections when violence broke out or was merely expected.In December in Gambia, the president at the time, Yahya Jammeh, a ruthless leader known for human rights abuses, shut off internet services and blocked international cellphone calls as votes were cast in a presidential election that eventually ousted him from office. In Gabon, officials cited security concerns for an internet blackout during presidential elections that prompted deadly demonstrations after the vote was considered by observers to be fraudulent.And in the Republic of Congo, internet access was blocked, television networks switched off and the nation\u2019s main airport closed during an election that spurred violence. Government officials were accused of using airstrikes on opposition forces.Mai Truong, program manager for the survey, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a strategy that the authorities are increasingly turning to as a method of controlling both the information landscape and citizens\u2019 ability to mobilize, in recognition of the fact that the internet has become a fundamental tool for people to realize their rights and participate meaningfully in society.\u201dNetwork blackouts also have economic consequences. Many residents of some regions of Africa where joblessness is soaring are increasingly using online or mobile transfers to receive money from relatives in urban areas or abroad. If the internet is shut off, users cannot use Wi-Fi to transfer cash and must pay for mobile data to go online. The cost is prohibitive for many people.Between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016, 81 short-term internet shutdowns in 19 countries cost at least $2.4 billion in gross domestic product globally, according to Darrell M. West, founding director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution.Mr. West estimated that the election-time shutdown last year in the Republic of Congo alone dealt an $72 million hit to the economy of the struggling nation.Cameroon\u2019s continuing internet blackout affects only English-speaking regions of the country. It followed weeks of protests from lawyers, teachers and other residents in those areas who have been agitating for better treatment from the French-speaking government, which they say has long marginalized their communities.Before independence in the early 1960s, Cameroon was colonized by the French and the British. The Constitution allows protections for both languages, but Francophones rule the government. Most official documents are offered in French and not translated, evidence that Anglophones cite as proof of their marginalization.Some demonstrations in English-speaking areas have turned violent, and security forces have fired on protesters.Yet the shutdown is a stopgap measure until another filtering system can get up and running, said one diplomat with knowledge of operations in the region, who declined to be identified because of continuing tensions there. The government is buying technology from Chinese companies that will allow officials to filter websites in the same fashion that the Chinese government has long employed to control content.Still, the blackout could have political ramifications for Cameroon\u2019s government. Bankers have largely stayed apolitical over the more than three decades since President Paul Biya has been in office. But as the shutdown starts to hurt their business, they could become a potent adversary, analysts fear.The blockage has also made it difficult for local journalists to report on what is widely viewed as an overly harsh government response to the demonstrations.Before the internet went dark, some cellphone users received ominous messages from officials.\u201cDear subscriber,\u201d one message the government circulated on WhatsApp warned. \u201cYou incur six months to two years imprisonment and 5 to 10 million fine if you publish or spread on the social media information that you can\u2019t prove.\u201dAnother message read, \u201cDo not be an accomplice of disinformation or destabilization of our country through the social media.\u201dSome citizens in blackout areas have come up with clever ways to get around the shutdown. Cellphone users type out messages and then pay drivers who gather garbage bags full of phones and take them outside the blackout boundaries. After crossing into an area where the network is up and running, they hit the send button on each phone.Since the blackout, Henry Boh has not been able to send money to Bamenda in the northwest, where his brother needs cash to take his nephew to the hospital for treatment.\u201cThis is a clear sign that the government of Yaound\u00e9 doesn\u2019t listen to its people\u2019s voices,\u201d said Mr. Boh, who lives in Yaound\u00e9, the nation\u2019s capital.Mr. Boh said the shutdown further proved the Anglophone protesters\u2019 point that the government mistreated them. In the nation\u2019s Far North region where Islamic militants from Boko Haram wage deadly attacks, they say, the internet is operational.\u201cThe government respects Boko Haram more than us,\u201d Mr. Boh said.Dionne Searcey reported from Dakar, Senegal, and Francois Essomba from Bamenda, Cameroon.Advertisement"}

Some were gang members who either converted or were radicalized in prison, while others have been swayed by local imams who studied in the Middle East, according to Muslim leaders and American officials.The young men found solace in radical Islamist websites and social media.And in the call to jihad.In contrast to the laws of many countries, it is not illegal in Trinidad to join the so-called caliphate, though the government wants to change that. One hundred to 130 people have made the trip to Syria from Trinidad, which has a population of 1.3 million, according to a former United States ambassador, John L. Estrada, and Trinidad\u2019s minister of national security, Edmund Dillon.Per capita, Trinidad has the greatest number of foreign fighters from the Western Hemisphere who have joined the Islamic State, said Mr. Estrada, who stepped down after the inauguration of President Trump last month.\u201cTrinidadians do very well with ISIL,\u201d Mr. Estrada said. \u201cThey are high up in the ranks, they are very respected and they are English-speaking. ISIL have used them for propaganda to spread their message through the Caribbean.\u201dMuch of the information about the identities of those who went abroad comes from American intelligence sources, although local imams and Islamic leaders all said they knew several people, including women, who had left.\u201cI know whole families that went,\u201d said Imtiaz Mohammed, president of the Islamic Missionaries Guild, which does charity work in Trinidad and the Middle East.Juan S. Gonzalez, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said the bulk of Islamic State fighters from Latin America originated in Trinidad and Tobago. The numbers underscore a risk of lone-wolf attacks in the region, he added.\u201cAs the United States continues to corner ISIS and defeat them, a lot of these guys aren\u2019t going to feel they have safe quarters,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cIs the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, prepared for these guys to return back to their countries? This is a real vulnerability.\u201dHe noted that people in the Caribbean enjoyed visa-free travel throughout the islands, which makes it fairly easy to travel to the Bahamas, and from there make a \u201cshort jump\u201d to South Florida.The United States, which encouraged Trinidad to tighten its laws, has hosted meetings with Muslim leaders at the embassy in Port of Spain, and paid for several to attend anti-extremism workshops in the United States.Mr. Crawford said he had been influenced by Islamic lectures and a Trinidadian Muslim leader, Ashmead Choate. Mr. Choate \u201cattained martyrdom\u201d in Ramadi, Iraq, the article said.The genesis of today\u2019s rising militancy, Mr. Crawford added in the article, can be traced to the failed 1990 coup, when a group of radical Muslims took legislators hostage in a siege of Parliament. When it was over, two dozen people were dead.Yasin Abu Bakr, 76, who led that uprising and has since been released from prison, said the government had created a climate where young Muslims did not feel safe or welcome in the military or civil service. \u201cThis is total discrimination and isolation against young Muslims in Trinidad,\u201d he said in an interview.Trinidad\u2019s attorney general, Faris Al-Rawi, said that after the coup, wearing Muslim garb \u201ctook on a certain appeal.\u201d\u201cA lot of people who were not genuinely Muslim or otherwise took on the persona to carry on their thuggery,\u201d he added.Mr. Al-Rawi said Mr. Crawford was believed to have died in Syria. His mother, Joan Crawford, said she had heard rumors that he had been badly wounded.Ms. Crawford, 62, said that her son had been falsely accused of plotting to kill the Trinidadian prime minister, and that this had diminished his professional prospects, even though he ran a fish business and had experience in plumbing.\u201cOnce you are branded a terrorist in your own country, what could you do?\u201d said Ms. Crawford, a former Spiritual Baptist who converted to Islam after her son did. \u201cI did cry, because I knew I would never see him again. I did not get to say goodbye.\u201dEfforts to combat the flow of young Muslims to overseas battlefields have been complicated by the ambivalence toward, and sometimes support for, the jihadi cause among some imams and the recruits\u2019 parents. In an interview that began and ended with a prayer, Mr. Sabur said he had welcomed his son\u2019s death as a martyr: \u201cI felt elated. Speaking about it now, I am overelated.\u201dThe Trinidadian government last week introduced a series of amendments that would criminalize membership in the Islamic State and other extremist organizations. People who traveled to certain regions would be presumed to be doing so for terrorism, and the burden to prove otherwise would be on them, Mr. Al-Rawi said.Mr. Mohammed, of the Islamic Missionaries Guild, criticized the proposed legislation, saying groups like his that make trips to the Middle East are often engaged in charity work and could be unfairly singled out.\u201cYou can\u2019t just go to a court and have a judge tell you that you are guilty with no evidence, just an assumption,\u201d he said.Mr. Mohammed has publicly denounced the Islamic State, but noted that his own United States visa and commercial pilot\u2019s license had been revoked after a terrorism suspect passed through his Islamic center.A senior intelligence official in Trinidad who was not authorized to speak publicly said he worried that the proposed legislation would make people who would have left for Syria plan attacks at home instead.He said about 15 or 20 of the Islamic State recruits spent two weeks before their trips at a mosque in Rio Claro, about 50 miles southeast of Port of Spain. There, they attended an orientation, the official said.Umar Abdullah, an Islamic activist, said he had been among those who encouraged the would-be fighters.Despite having made thinly veiled threats to Americans in the past, which led a cruise ship on its way to Trinidad to turn back, Mr. Abdullah has since denounced extremism, and now says Muslims must work with the United States to \u201cchange the narrative.\u201d It would be \u201cstupid\u201d to try to attack the United States Embassy, he said.\u201cAt one point in time I was a strong believer in that, and I still believe it to some extent,\u201d Mr. Abdullah said. \u201cBut to do something like that would put the Muslim community in harm\u2019s way. We would not be able to stand the fallout of that type of action.\u201dThe imam in Rio Claro, Nazim Mohammed, denied running an Islamic State training program, and insisted that he operated an elementary school and a weekly food program for the poor. But he acknowledged that two of his children and five of his grandchildren were in Syria, and that the adults were believed to be involved with the Islamic State.\u201cKilling and murdering is not Islamic,\u201d Nazim Mohammed, 75, said in an interview. \u201cOur program is to help people. You know how many people have come here for help?\u201dHe insisted that his children did not notify him of their plans, and he shrugged off the group\u2019s influence.\u201cWho is ISIS?\u201d he said. \u201cISIS is just a few people.\u201dPrior Beharry contributed reporting from Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Case of Shkreli and Lawyer, Finger-Pointing Comes First", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchWhen children get caught doing something wrong, they often point the finger at one another while proclaiming \u201cI didn\u2019t do it. He did.\u201dThe two men were charged with conspiracy and securities fraud, and they have asked a federal district judge to give them separate trials because they intend to blame one another for any violations. The two argue that their defenses will be mutually antagonistic when each points the finger at the other as the one responsible for any violations, so the same jury cannot decide the case fairly because the acquittal of one may mean the conviction of the other.Mr. Shkreli is accused of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he managed by misleading them about losses suffered on its investments, and then shifting money from a biopharmaceutical company, Retrophin, when he was its chief executive, to pay off the investor claims.Mr. Greebel was largely unknown to the public until the charges last year linked him to his notorious client. Mr. Greebel, who was a partner at the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman until moving to another firm in 2015, had been the lead outside counsel and corporate secretary for Retrophin when Mr. Shkreli was its chief executive.Mr. Greebel is accused only of participating in the last phase of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s conduct related to the use of Retrophin\u2019s assets, and does not face charges of making misstatements to the hedge fund investors.Where the case devolves into finger-pointing is Mr. Shkreli\u2019s claim that he only followed the advice of Retrophin\u2019s corporate lawyers, and therefore did not have any intent to defraud. His motion for a separate trial argues that Mr. Shkreli paid $10 million in legal fees to Katten Muchin \u2014 although that claim overlooks the point that it was the company actually paying the lawyers \u2014 and he \u201cfollowed faithfully\u201d the legal advice given by Mr. Greebel and other lawyers.This is a classic \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense, which requires showing that the client provided the lawyer with complete information and adhered to the directions provided for how to act. It is a difficult defense to establish because lawyers are usually unwilling to concede they provided faulty advice that led a client into wrongdoing.That is exactly the position Mr. Greebel takes, asserting that he was misled by Mr. Shkreli and used as a pawn as part of larger scheme hatched to defraud Retrophin. His own filing for a separate trial argued \u201cthat Mr. Shkreli had a plan to blame counsel, and that unfortunately he used Mr. Greebel and other counsel at Katten Muchin as part of his cover for misconduct.\u201dA court can, for example, impanel two juries for a single trial, or give instructions that allow each defendant to advance a particular claim without that evidence being considered against the other.Both Mr. Shkreli and Mr. Greebel have a stake in painting as stark a contrast between their positions as possible to obtain a severance. Thus, each asserts that accepting one\u2019s claim about his innocence will necessarily result in a conviction of the other.Mr. Greebel offers another argument for a separate trial by pointing to the potential prejudice of having to sit next to Mr. Shkreli at a joint proceeding. \u201cIt is a near certainty that Mr. Shkreli will take actions and make statements to destroy the integrity of the court proceedings,\u201d according to Mr. Greebel\u2019s brief, so that there will be a \u201ctornado of chaos swirling around Mr. Shkreli\u201d \u2014 a storm no one wants to be near.The government is usually quite happy to have defendants point fingers at one another in a joint trial because then it can simply argue that everyone is guilty, with one perhaps more responsible than the other. Prosecutors are sure to oppose the severance motions because of the threat that the \u201cempty chair\u201d in the courtroom could result in both defendants being acquitted. At separate trials, each will claim the missing party was the real culprit, hoping to persuade a jury that the lone defendant is not responsible for any violations, thus allowing each to avoid a conviction.Judges are also not eager to preside over two trials, especially when they involve complex securities fraud charges that most likely will take weeks to present to a jury. The standard rationale for requiring a joint trial is the need for \u201cjudicial economy,\u201d an argument that presenting the same evidence twice is a waste of the court\u2019s resources.Whether the defenses of Mr. Shkreli and Mr. Greebel truly are antagonistic to the degree they claim will have to be sorted out by the judge. There are thousands of emails and other communications between the two men, so prosecutors are expected to argue that each played a role in a scheme to defraud Retrophin. The jury will then sort out whether one might be less culpable than the other.Making things even more complicated is the issue of the attorney-client privilege, which prevents a lawyer from disclosing confidential communications without the client\u2019s permission. Although the case portrayed Mr. Greebel as Mr. Shkreli\u2019s personal lawyer, Retrophin was in fact the client and has control over the privilege. So the court will also have to figure out how much confidential information can be revealed by the defendants.It is uncommon for defendants to attack one another in advance of trial, each proclaiming innocence by heaping blame on the other. The challenge will be figuring out whether that antagonism is enough to warrant two trials, a prospect no judge faces happily.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Duterte Is Repeating My Mistakes", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 Illegal drugs are a matter of national security, but the war against them cannot be won by armed forces and law enforcement agencies alone. Throwing more soldiers and police at the drug users is not just a waste of money but also can actually make the problem worse. Locking up nonviolent offenders and drug users almost always backfires, instead strengthening organized crime.That is the message I would like to send to the world and, especially, to President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Trust me, I learned the hard way.We Colombians know a thing or two about fighting drugs. Our country has long been one of the world\u2019s primary suppliers of cocaine. With support from North American and Western European governments, we have poured billions of dollars into a relentless campaign to eradicate drugs and destroy cartels. I was personally involved in taking down the planet\u2019s most notorious drug trafficker, Pablo Escobar, in 1993. While we managed to make Colombia a bit safer, it came at a tremendous price.My government and every administration since threw everything at the problem \u2014 from fumigating crops to jailing every drug pusher in sight. Not only did we fail to eradicate drug production, trafficking and consumption in Colombia, but we also pushed drugs and crime into neighboring countries. And we created new problems. Tens of thousands of people were slaughtered in our antidrug crusade. Many of our brightest politicians, judges, police officers and journalists were assassinated. At the same time, the vast funds earned by drug cartels were spent to corrupt our executive, judicial and legislative branches of government.This heavy-handed approach to drugs did little to diminish the drug supply and demand in Colombia, much less in markets like Western Europe and the United States. In fact, drugs such as cocaine and heroin are as accessible as ever from Bogot\u00e1 to New York to Manila.What do we propose? Well, for one, we do not believe that military hardware, repressive policing and bigger prisons are the answer. Real reductions in drug supply and demand will come through improving public health and safety, strengthening anticorruption measures \u2014 especially those that combat money laundering \u2014 and investing in sustainable development. We also believe that the smartest pathway to tackling drugs is decriminalizing consumption and ensuring that governments regulate certain drugs, including for medical and recreational purposes.Winning the fight against drugs requires addressing not just crime, but also public health, human rights and economic development. No matter what Mr. Duterte believes, there will always be drugs and drug users in the Philippines. But it is important to put the problem in perspective: The Philippines already has a low number of regular drug users. The application of severe penalties and extrajudicial violence against drug consumers makes it almost impossible for people with drug addiction problems to find treatment. Instead, they resort to dangerous habits and the criminal economy. Indeed, the criminalization of drug users runs counter to all available scientific evidence of what works.Taking a hard line against criminals is always popular for politicians. I was also seduced into taking a tough stance on drugs during my time as president. The polls suggest that Mr. Duterte\u2019s war on drugs is equally popular. But he will find that it is unwinnable. I also discovered that the human costs were enormous. We could not win the war on drugs through killing petty criminals and addicts. We started making positive impacts only when we changed tack, designating drugs as a social problem and not a military one.A successful president makes decisions that strengthen the public good. This means investing in solutions that meet the basic standards of basic rights and minimize unnecessary pain and suffering. The fight against drugs is no exception. Strategies that target violent criminals and undermine money laundering are critical. So, too, are measures that decriminalize drug users, support alternative sentencing for low-level nonviolent offenders and provide a range of treatment options for drug abusers. This is a test that many of my Colombian compatriots have failed. I hope Mr. Duterte does not fall into the same trap.C\u00e9sar Gaviria was president of Colombia from 1990 to 1994 and the secretary general of the Organization of American States from 1994 to 2004.Advertisement"}

Germany, in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.Industry executives here often cite how Apple\u2019s iPhone quickly erased Nokia\u2019s once-dominant position in the mobile handset market, and they are determined not to let something similar happen to them.\u201cI am convinced that we are going to see more change in the next 10 or 15 years than we have seen in the last 100 years,\u201d Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the BMW management board, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe big question is always, Do we car manufacturers learn to become tech companies more quickly than a tech company learns to be an automotive player?\u201dBy contrast, Germany\u2019s automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach.To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon fiber body.Daimler also owns Car2Go, a short-term car rental service; Blacklane, an upmarket ride-hailing app; and MyTaxi, Europe\u2019s largest taxi-hailing service.Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, said the automaker\u2019s backing had allowed it to expand rapidly across Europe, where it has often teamed up with local taxi associations to combat the rise of Uber.\u201cThis is a game that requires deep pockets,\u201d Mr. Pinnington said.The German carmakers\u2019 digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals.\u201cThe future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together,\u201d said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm.Taken together, the carmakers\u2019 digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germany\u2019s vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States.But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology.The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germany\u2019s historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world.That is where Mr. Harms comes in.A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks.MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Mr. Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations.\u201cThe whole mobility market \u2014 transportation as a service \u2014 is just at the beginning,\u201d Mr. Harms said.Under Mr. M\u00fcller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least two million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service available in cities including New York and London.But for Mr. Harms, the carmakers\u2019 best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry \u2014 and other traditional sectors \u2014 to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful.\u201cA vehicle is extremely sensitive. You can\u2019t put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the ones who already know how to do it very well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Major Blind Spots in Macroeconomics", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyThere was an unusual degree of consensus among economists about what would happen if Britain voted for Brexit in the referendum on June 23 last year. The language used by the International Monetary Fund was typical: It expressed fears of an \u201cabrupt reaction,\u201d adding that this \u201cmay have already begun.\u201d The head of the organization, Christine Lagarde, said that the consequences of Brexit would range from \u201cpretty bad to very, very bad.\u201d The Bank of England warned of a recession, a contraction in gross domestic product and an increase in unemployment. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development published a paper called \u201cThe Economic Consequences of Brexit,\u201d predicting a \u201cmajor negative shock to the U.K. economy.\u201d Even pro-Brexit economists expected an immediate downturn: Gerard Lyons, former economic adviser to the prominent Brexiter Boris Johnson, said that the trajectory would resemble the \u201cNike swoosh\u201d \u2014 down then up.What happened instead was that Britain enjoyed the best growth of any major advanced economy in 2016. The doomsayers have been quick to point out that Brexit hasn\u2019t actually happened yet, so all the promised shock has been postponed rather than averted \u2014 which, for the record, is what I think, too. Still, it\u2019s all a bit embarrassing for everyone who made those overconfident forecasts. Andy Haldane, the chief economist for the Bank of England, which was one of the sources of those doomy prognostications, agrees. He compared the pitfalls of economic prediction to the single most famously wrong weather forecast in British history, made on the BBC on Oct. 15, 1987. A woman had called the BBC to say she was worried there was a hurricane on the way. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there isn\u2019t,\u201d the weatherman responded. That night, 22 people died amid hurricane-force winds.This isn\u2019t the first time Haldane has been critical of the current state of macroeconomics \u2014 that\u2019s the big-picture, whole-economy side of the profession. Last fall he gave an important, broad-ranging speech with the elegant title \u201cThe Dappled World,\u201d in which he argued that the unexpected global downturn that began in late 2007 has left behind \u201ca crisis in the economics and finance profession.\u201d Economic forecasts on the eve of the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, he says, \u201cnot just wrong but spectacularly so.\u201d The overall trajectory of precrisis forecasts was upward; the reality was a brutally deep capital V.The reason this poses a deep intellectual crisis for macroeconomics is that the entire point of the field, as it has developed since the work of John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, is to prevent just this sort of severe downturn. Keynes once spoke of a future in which economists would be \u201chumble, competent people on a level with dentists,\u201d while the brilliant up-and-coming French economist Esther Duflo recently gave an admired I.M.F. lecture called \u201cThe Economist as Plumber.\u201d It seems to me, though, that what macroeconomists do is really most like bomb disposal. Uniquely in the social sciences and humanities, macroeconomics was developed with a specific, real-world purpose, and a negative purpose to boot: to stop anything like the Great Depression from ever happening again. Given this goal \u2014 to avert systemic crises and downturns \u2014 the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, for macroeconomics, an intellectual disaster.In retrospect, the failure of the discipline to predict and prevent the crisis was based on deep conceptual faults. One of these concerned a mysterious refusal to engage with the role of the banking and finance system in the economy. Another was the assumption that the discipline makes about individual motivations, assuming that individuals \u201coptimize\u201d their decision-making to behave, in economic terms, rationally. This is a convenient intellectual shortcut for building models, but it is also a fiction, as we know not just from our own human experience but even from within economics itself, where microeconomics has recently made exciting progress in the study of human irrationality, bias and cognitive error. It is a matter of provable fact that our decision-making is not entirely rational. Economic models built on the premise of our rationality will always have a creaky underpinning.The focus of Haldane\u2019s speech is on this second point. He talks about the need for macroeconomics to learn from other disciplines in both the natural and social sciences in order to seek \u201ca different perspective on individual behavior and systemwide dynamics.\u201d He argues that the profession has \u201cborrowed too little from other disciplines\u201d and become \u201ca methodological monoculture,\u201d with the associated risk that everybody in the field can be wrong in the same way and at the same time. He finds compelling evidence in a survey of American professors of social science, who were asked whether \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d knowledge was better than knowledge \u201cobtained by a single discipline.\u201d Most social scientists sensibly thought that the answer was yes, by overwhelming margins. But 57 percent of economists disagreed or strongly disagreed. Economists literally think they have nothing to learn from anyone else. The field also suffers from its rigid hierarchies and its lack of gender and racial diversity. As Haldane puts it, \u201cIt is difficult to escape the conclusion that economics remains an insular, self-referential discipline.\u201dHaldane\u2019s proposed solution to the problem lies in an emerging new field called agent-based modeling, in which large amounts of computer power are used to build models where individual actors have their own motives and their own agency. These agents collide and overlap and interact and generate predictions through a messy process more akin to real life than the clean models of old-fashioned macroeconomics. Agent-based modeling has been shown to have promise in other fields, especially physics \u2014 and also in modeling real-world problems like the tendency for Brazil nuts to levitate toward the top of the mixed-nut package. (That might sound kooky, but Haldane points out that the nut research \u201chas since found real-world applications in industries such as pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.\u201d)Haldane isn\u2019t the only prominent nonacademic economist to think there are profound problems in macroeconomics. Paul Romer is a highly regarded macroeconomist who recently became chief economist at the World Bank. (It was Romer who is credited with having coined, in 2004, the famous slogan that \u201ca crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\u201d) Last winter he, too, issued a lacerating critique of his field, titled \u201cThe Trouble With Macroeconomics.\u201d His argument focuses on the question of \u201cidentification,\u201d which is shorthand in the field for how economists identify the cause of an event. Identification is a huge deal for economics, because if you can\u2019t tell if x, y or z caused something, you don\u2019t know which of those variables to study or measure or change. The omission of finance and the role of money from economic models is the biggest weakness in the field, Romer believes. It is hard for noneconomists to get our heads around the fact that the dominant macroeconomic models (including the ones used by central banks) made no allowance for how money works \u2014 especially not for fluctuations in how much of it is around. Such an oversight seems weird, and entirely counterintuitive. But that\u2019s what happened, and it played a big role in macroeconomists\u2019 ability to, as Romer puts it, \u201cdismiss mere facts.\u201dThe Bank of England and the World Bank are two of the most important noncommercial banks in the world. It is striking, and exhilarating and scary too, that the chief economists of these two institutions each thinks that their trade is in crisis. Not so long ago, leading macroeconomists thought that the main part of their work was basically over. The Nobel winner Robert Lucas claimed as much in his presidential address to the American Economic Association in 2003. Macroeconomics, he said, \u201chas succeeded: Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved.\u201d That now looks wildly hubristic. Maybe the field is roughly where physics was at the end of the 19th century, when some scientists thought that their own field\u2019s main problems had been solved, within a Newtonian framework that is now known to be inadequate to describe reality. Maybe, like physics in the 20th century, macroeconomics is about to have a heroic period. If it does, it will begin in the work of people like Romer and Haldane, who are unflinchingly willing to talk about its huge recent failures. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.John Lanchester has written eight books, including the novel \u201cCapital\u201d and, most recently, \u201cHow to Speak Money: What the Money People Say \u2014 and What It Really Means.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They have painted him as a symbol of everything that is wrong with corporate America.\u201cHe was part of the cadre of corporate raiders that brought our economy to its knees,\u201d Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said on the Senate floor on Monday.The Senate voted to confirm Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary.There was also no shortage of name-calling. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, referred to Mr. Mnuchin at the \u201cforeclosure king.\u201d Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, described him as \u201cgreedy\u201d and \u201cunethical\u201d while arguing the case against him.\u201cWhether illegally foreclosing on thousands of families, skirting the law with offshore tax havens or helping design tactics that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, Steve Mnuchin made a career \u2014 and millions of dollars \u2014 pioneering increasingly deceptive and predatory ways to rob hardworking Americans of their savings and homes,\u201d Ms. Duckworth said.After the hearing, Democrats on the committee accused Mr. Mnuchin of lying for saying that OneWest Bank had not engaged in the controversial foreclosure practice of \u201crobo-signing\u201d when he was its chief executive. The Democrats on the committee twice boycotted a vote on his confirmation, leading Republicans to breach protocol and push Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s vote to the full Senate on their own.Just one Democrat, Senator of Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broke with his party and supported Mr. Mnuchin. In a sign of the backlash that Democrats will face for siding with any part of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee warned that Mr. Manchin\u2019s vote would not go unnoticed.\u201cWe will ensure that Joe Manchin hears from his West Virginia constituents who disapprove of his voting with Wall Street against working families,\u201d the group said in a statement after the vote.For Republicans, the resistance was chalked up to political theater.On Monday, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, accused Democrats of making Mr. Mnuchin a political pawn and described their concerns as a stall tactic.\u201cUnder any objective standard, Mr. Mnuchin has ample experience, credentials and qualifications for this important position,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cMy colleagues have done all they can under the rules \u2014 even to the point of casting aside some longstanding customs and traditions of the Senate \u2014 in order to delay his confirmation.\u201dWhile Mr. Mnuchin struggled to show fluency with some aspects of the job during his confirmation hearing, Republicans and Democrats generally agreed that he was well versed on economic issues. He also struck a more moderate tone than Mr. Trump on issues such as trade and dealing with China. And Mr. Mnuchin left some experts dumbfounded after suggesting that \u201cthere would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class\u201d \u2014 a promise that appears to be at odds with plans presented by Mr. Trump and House Republicans.Mr. Mnuchin was not the only member of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet to be confirmed on Monday night. The Senate also voted in favor of David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. A holdover from the Obama administration, Dr. Shulkin is currently the department\u2019s under secretary of health and was approved by a unanimous vote.Things could become more complicated on Thursday, however, when Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for labor secretary, faces a committee hearing.

In the meantime, the North raced ahead with its nuclear weapons program.China has urged the United States to enter talks with North Korea to end its weapons program, apparently sensing that President Trump\u2019s desire to make deals could break the yearslong deadlock on negotiations.\u201cThe root of the North Korean nuclear and missile issue lies in the difference between North Korea and the United States and between North Korea and South Korea,\u201d Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, said on Monday. \u201cWe believe that dialogue and consultation offers the way out.\u201dChina was not alone in seeking a new direction, as it appeared to capitalize on a re-evaluation by the Trump administration of how to handle the government of Kim Jong-un.Japan must \u201ccooperate with the international community, including China,\u201d he said.And in South Korea, where the government is paralyzed while waiting for a court\u2019s decision on impeachment and where an election is likely, progressive opposition parties called for new talks, emphasizing that sanctions intended to topple the regime had failed.\u201cDialogue and diplomacy\u201d are the only proven means to end the development of nuclear weapons, said Choo Mi-ae, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party.Such talks seemed politically impossible under President Barack Obama, who favored sanctions as the prime safeguard against the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions. There is a growing sense in the region that Mr. Obama\u2019s approach to the North failed.Chinese analysts said the White House should seize the chance for a new chapter in dealing with North Korea and abandon Mr. Obama\u2019s policy of applying sanctions.\u201cWe all think that the Trump administration should talk directly with North Korea,\u201d said Lu Chao, director of the Border Study Institute at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences in Shenyang. \u201cThat would be the best approach to crack this problem.\u201dDealing directly with the North is anathema to most American officials \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 who say that would be viewed as compensation for the aggressive behavior of a government whose nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches have alarmed the world.The administration has begun to review its policy toward North Korea, apparently heeding a warning by Mr. Obama shortly after the election that the North will be the most immediate foreign policy threat.On Sunday, the North Korean missile flew 310 miles before dropping into the Sea of Japan. The test used a solid-fuel technology, which makes it easier for the country to hide its arsenal underground and roll out its missiles for a quick launch.Earlier last week, Chinese officials participated in behind-the-scenes talks with senior members of Mr. Trump\u2019s staff to arrange the first phone call between President Xi Jinping and Mr. Trump.\u201cChina wants the Americans to talk directly with North Korea,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, associate professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cChina believes the North Korean nuclear problem actually was caused by the Cold War and Pyongyang\u2019s fear of American invasion. Therefore, the blame falls squarely on the U.S., and all the negotiations should be about the U.S. talking with North Korea.\u201dAt the outset, Professor Cheng said China would not be fussy about how the Trump administration approached any talks.\u201cGenerally speaking, China is basically saying, please talk \u2014 talk whatever you want, in whatever way you like, as long as you guys could reach some consensus,\u201d he said.William J. Perry, a former United States defense secretary, said in Washington last month that the new administration at least had to give direct talks with North Korea a chance to gain China\u2019s help in addressing the nuclear threat.One American expert on North Korea suggested a clear path for how the Trump administration should proceed.\u201cTrump should start by holding back-channel talks,\u201d said John Delury, associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cIf those make enough progress, he should then send an envoy to Pyongyang, who could negotiate a nuclear freeze.\u201dAlthough China is considered the North\u2019s closest ally, Beijing has cool relations with its volatile neighbor. Some Chinese experts call the relationship a \u201cfake alliance,\u201d and Beijing has become increasingly frustrated with the North\u2019s continuing nuclear tests. The Foreign Ministry condemned the latest launch.Under the tougher sanctions, China pledged to slash its imports of coal from North Korea, the biggest currency earner for the regime.But figures from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed that Beijing had imported 14.5 percent more coal in 2016 than in the previous year, raising questions about its enforcement of the sanctions.Attempts by Washington to gain China\u2019s cooperation have consistently failed because Beijing was more interested in maintaining government stability than removing nuclear weapons, he wrote.Therefore, the United States should move toward \u201crapid, not incremental, ratcheting up of Iran-type sanctions,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect title for a North Korea expert, John Delury.

{"Headline": "Do You Need to Worry About Trump\u2019s Reforms? It Depends", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdventures in CapitalismI get it: You are freaked out. You don\u2019t like this president. Practically every day, he sets off some new crisis and, according to your Facebook feed, does something that might destroy the nation. You\u2019re wondering if you should start buying canned foods and ammunition.Among those concerns may be President Trump\u2019s pledge to do \u201ca big number\u201d on the financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, reforms known as the Dodd-Frank Act.It\u2019s a turbulent time. So, as a public service, I\u2019m going to regularly evaluate some of Mr. Trump\u2019s activities, and help you decide which ones are cause for alarm \u2014 and which, to be honest, are fairly rational attempts at governing, the same kinds of shifts we might expect if Hillary Clinton or a different Republican had been elected president.The Dodd-Frank law can essentially be broken into two parts. There is the act\u2019s core legislation, which placed new constraints on banks\u2019 financial activities and required them to hold onto more money as a cushion against crisis. This core legislation also created an independent regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has become a proud thorn in the side of many financial firms.The secondary aspects of Dodd-Frank, however, have almost nothing to do with stabilizing the economy or protecting consumers. They include provisions like forcing companies to disclose their use of conflict minerals, or to report payments that oil and mining companies make to foreign governments. There\u2019s a provision that regulates how much it costs to swipe a credit card.\u201cSome of these changes are depressing, because they undermine transparency and increase corruption, but they\u2019re not going to blow up our financial system,\u201d said Michael Barr, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury and one of the key architects of Dodd-Frank. \u201cThey leave the core of Dodd-Frank intact.\u201dAnd preserving that core is important, because Dodd-Frank\u2019s purpose isn\u2019t to make the financial system more virtuous, it\u2019s to make it more stable. Two years after the world\u2019s economic system imploded in 2008, the Obama administration and a Democratic Congress erected these new rules to prevent another crisis from happening. Some aspects of the resulting Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act were widely applauded; others were controversial from the start.In the intervening seven years, as the legislation has been tested by the real world, a consensus has emerged that some shifts are needed. \u201cWe wrote this in the wake of a major crisis, and I think the legislation reflected that,\u201d said Barney Frank, a former representative from Massachusetts who was a co-sponsor of the law. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve learned a lot since then, and some parts of the law should change to reflect that.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump signed an executive order last week to identify \u201cgovernment policies that inhibit federal regulation of the United States financial system,\u201d it was widely seen as the first step in overhauling Dodd-Frank.One paranoid view of Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions is that he aims to neuter or kill Dodd-Frank outright \u2014 a concern the president himself has fueled by saying that \u201cDodd-Frank is a disaster\u201d and pledging to \u201cdismantle\u201d it.However, such major revisions would require Congress\u2019s assistance, and it\u2019s unlikely that Democrats or moderate Republicans would go along. Even portions of Wall Street think killing Dodd-Frank is a terrible idea. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a law with good intentions,\u201d said H. Rodgin Cohen, the dean of Wall Street lawyers. \u201cIt just needs adjustments and regulators who understand the need to balance safety alongside economic growth.\u201dSo many hope that Mr. Trump and, more important, congressional Republicans simply want to alter Dodd-Frank. And this is the hard part of forecasting how panicked you ought to be, because we don\u2019t know specifically what the president and Congress will propose.Mr. Frank and numerous other policy makers concede that Dodd-Frank should be reformed to include more exemptions for smaller banks, and that Congress should raise the threshold at which a bank is deemed a potential risk to the economy. Lawmakers from both parties say the law creates too much unnecessary paperwork.So if you hear lawmakers proposing such fixes, you probably don\u2019t need to despair that another financial crisis is around the corner.But if the president is genuinely intent on killing Dodd-Frank, then more angst is warranted. If, for instance, lawmakers try to erase Dodd-Frank\u2019s core provisions, or eliminate or weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it\u2019s appropriate to worry. A leaked memo on Thursday from Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who has declared that he \u201cwill not rest until Dodd-Frank is ripped out by its roots and tossed on the trash bin of history,\u201d laid out plans to weaken the bureau\u2019s leadership, a move that should grab your attention.Other reasons to worry would be if Dodd-Frank reforms pass Congress without any Democratic votes \u2014 signaling that sober congressional minds, which often agree on banking rules, have been elbowed aside by radicals. If so, I suggest exploring which red wines go well with canned beans.Right now, however, you need not panic. It took more than a decade to brew up the toxic mess that became the financial crisis. It took two more years to pass Dodd-Frank. It will require more than an executive order and a leaked memo to undo those protections. As long as concerned citizens keep their eyes open, we\u2019ll all have plenty of time to prepare to freak out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Embraces \u2018Enemy of the People,\u2019 a Phrase With a Fraught History", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe formula \u2018enemy of the people,\u2019\u201d Mr. Khrushchev told the Soviet Communist Party in a 1956 speech denouncing Stalin\u2019s cult of personality, \u201cwas specifically introduced for the purpose of physically annihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.It is difficult to know if President Trump is aware of the historic resonance of the term, a label generally associated with despotic communist governments rather than democracies. But his decision to unleash the terminology has left some historians scratching their heads. Why would the elected leader of a democratic nation embrace a label that, after the death of Stalin, even the Soviet Union found to be too freighted with sinister connotations?Nina Khrushcheva, the great-granddaughter of Mr. Khrushchev and a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York, said the phrase was \u201cshocking to hear in a non-Soviet, moreover non-Stalinist setting.\u201d Her great-grandfather, she said, \u201cof course also used Soviet slogans and ideological idioms but still tried to stay away from sweeping denunciations of whole segments of the Soviet population.\u201dIn Mr. Trump\u2019s case, however, he is branding as enemies a segment of the American population \u2014 specifically representatives of what he calls the \u201cfake news\u201d media, including The New York Times.By using the phrase and placing himself in such infamous company, at least in his choice of vocabulary to attack his critics, Mr. Trump has demonstrated, Ms. Khrushcheva said, that the language of \u201cautocracy, of state nationalism is always the same regardless of the country, and no nation is exempt.\u201d She added that, in all likelihood, Mr. Trump had not read Lenin, Stalin or Mao Zedong, but the \u201cformulas of insult, humiliation, domination, branding, enemy-forming and name calling are always the same.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.The phrase \u201cenemy of the people\u201d first entered the political lexicon in 1789, with the French Revolution. The revolutionaries initially used it as a slogan that was hurled willy-nilly at anybody who opposed them. But, as resistance to the revolution mounted, the term acquired a far more lethal and legalistic meaning with the adoption of a 1794 law that set up a revolutionary tribunal \u201cto punish enemies of the people\u201d and codified political crimes punishable by death. These included \u201cspreading false news to divide or trouble the people.\u201dThe concept resurfaced in a more benign form nearly a century later in \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d an 1882 play by the Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen about an idealistic whistle-blower in a small town at odds with the authorities and locals who, to protect the economy, want to suppress information about water contamination. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 returned the term to the blood-drenched dramas of the French Revolution, with Lenin declaring in Pravda that the Jacobin terror against \u201cenemies of the people\u201d was \u201cinstructive\u201d and needed to be revived, so as to rid the Russian people of \u201clandowners and capitalists as a class.\u201dStalin, who took over as Soviet leader upon Lenin\u2019s death in 1924, drastically expanded the scope of those branded as \u201cenemies of the people,\u201d targeting not only capitalists but also dedicated communists who had worked alongside Lenin for years, but whom Stalin viewed as rivals.\u201cIn essence, it was a label that meant death. It meant you were subhuman and entirely expendable,\u201d said Mitchell A. Orenstein, professor of Russian and East European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThis is the connotation for anyone who lived in the Soviet Union or knows anything about the Soviet Union, which Donald Trump obviously doesn\u2019t \u2014 or he doesn\u2019t care.\u201dHe said that it was hard to figure out whether Mr. Trump was aware of the resonance of the phrase or simply used it because \u201che knows it riles up people who have a certain degree of knowledge.\u201d\u201cHe is only alienating them, and they are the people he wants to alienate anyway,\u201d Mr. Orenstein continued. \u201cHis base sees comparisons with Stalin as just more evidence of the liberal mainstream media going haywire.\u201dMoreover, by using such a loaded term in such a cavalier fashion, the president \u201cis in the process of rendering it meaningless,\u201d Mr. Orenstein said. \u201cIt becomes just na-na-na-na-na,\u201d he added, because nobody really thinks Mr. Trump will bring back the guillotine.Philip Short, a British author who has written biographies of Mao and Cambodia\u2019s genocidal leader Pol Pot, said Mr. Trump delighted in \u201cshaking things up, and this kind of language does just that.\u201d\u201cWe try to analyze it from an establishment point of view, but this leads nowhere,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Trump has ever read Stalin, but if he wants to destabilize people, he is doing it perfectly.\u201dWilliam Taubman, the author of a biography of Khrushchev and emeritus professor of political science at Amherst College, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d that Mr. Trump would revive a term that had fallen into disrepute in the Soviet Union after Stalin\u2019s death in 1953. \u201cIt was so omnipresent, freighted and devastating in its use under Stalin that nobody wanted to touch it,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never heard it used in Russia except in reference to history and in jokes.\u201dMs. Khrushcheva said Mr. Trump had \u201cbeen using a lot of this kind of political-ideological branding\u201d favored by revolutionary leaders, deploying terms like \u201cliberal sympathizer\u201d and \u201clanguage about gloom and doom in America that is much more forcefully negative than that even used by the Russians.\u201dHe has also gone one step further than Chinese and Khmer Rouge communists in Cambodia, who generally preferred homegrown insults to those imported from the Soviet Union.Mr. Short, the Mao and Pol Pot biographer, said Chinese and Cambodian communists, all fiercely nationalistic, rarely if ever used \u201cenemy of the people\u201d in domestic political struggles because it was an alien import. Instead, Pol Pot attacked enemies as \u201cugly microbes\u201d who would \u201crot society, rot the party and rot the country from within,\u201d while Maoists coined insults like \u201cthe stinking ninth category\u201d to denounce experts and intellectuals.Mao, Mr. Short said, \u201cused Chinese expressions and spoke like a Chinese, not a Russian.\u201d\u201cHe did not use the Soviet jargon much,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cBut Mr. Trump does, which is extraordinary.\u201dMao did on occasion use \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d but he directed it not at his domestic foes but at the United States, declaring in 1964 that \u201cU.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the entire world.\u201d\u201cPoliticians normally use phrases that resonate with their own people,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cMao and Pol Pot did not just regurgitate Stalinist terms. What is extraordinary about Trump is that he has taken up a Stalinist phrase that is entirely alien to American political culture.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greeks Turn to the Black Market as Another Bailout Showdown Looms", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 During seven years of a grinding economic crisis, Dimitri Tsamopoulos has lost at least half the clients from his once bustling tax consultancy. But in the past few months, business has jumped, not because the Greek economy is finally recovering but because it is falling even deeper into the abyss.\u201cMost of these people will keep working,\u201d Mr. Tsamopoulos said, arching an eyebrow from behind his desk as clients waited in a smoky room outside. \u201cBut now, they\u2019ll do it on the black market. They\u2019re saying they need a way to survive.\u201dAs of last month, unpaid taxes in Greece had soared to 95 billion euros, up from \u20ac76 billion two years ago. Most of that is considered uncollectable.\u201cThe heart of the matter for an ever-rising number of citizens and businesses is that they simply do not have the financial resources anymore to meet their rising tax obligations,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economist and a member of a team of European Union specialists that helped supervise the country\u2019s earlier bailouts.Short on alternatives, he said, \u201cmany are falling back into the gray economy.\u201dShutting down this gray economy is a priority for Greece\u2019s creditors, even as the two sides are bracing for another showdown, with Athens and its creditors arguing over the latest bailout, worth \u20ac86 billion. Greece is aiming to strike a deal with creditors by Monday, when European finance ministers meet in Brussels to assess if Athens has done enough in overhauling the economy \u2014 and combatting tax evasion \u2014 to unlock bailout funds.Blended into that equation is a standoff between the International Monetary Fund and European countries over how much more austerity to require of Greece. The I.M.F. wants European creditors to further reduce Greece\u2019s mountainous debt, now at 180 percent of economic output, warning that it will spiral out of control otherwise.An essential piece of Greece\u2019s recovery plan has been to collect more taxes from a population that has long engaged in tax evasion. An independent tax authority was created and auditors were hired, helping to pull in about \u20ac5 billion more in revenue than expected last year. But businesses and individuals say they have less to give for taxes that keep rising, and a growing incentive to avoid paying.Unemployment remains about 23 percent, and for some people the shadow economy is a lifeline. Others see it as a way to prevent a government they don\u2019t trust from putting their money into a black hole, which is the national debt.Electricians, plumbers, hairdressers, journalists, computer consultants and a variety of other self-employed workers have all taken the plunge. On a recent afternoon, Yiannis, a young television production designer, stood in line in a government office to de-register as a consultant. Had he not, he said, his take-home pay this year would amount to just 30 percent of earnings.\u201cIt\u2019s like they force you to become illegal,\u201d said Yiannis, who, like many people, refused to give his full name for fear of attracting the tax authorities. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to work on the black market. I need to make ends meet.\u201dYiannis said he had also registered a company in Bulgaria, where the business tax rate is 10 percent, so that he could keep issuing receipts for freelance work. Tens of thousands of Greeks have been registering companies in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Luxembourg and other low-tax countries to avoid paying the higher tax bills at home \u2014 which means less revenue for Greece\u2019s coffers and creates unfair competition for tax-paying entrepreneurs who could potentially play a bigger role in the revival of Greece\u2019s economy.When he bid on a contract to fireproof a new building, another firm offered to work off the books for half his rate. Mr. Ladas won the job because he provided insurance that the competitor could not. But he had to lower his price, sapping revenue that he wanted to reinvest in the business. More income was lost when clients bought his equipment and hired off-the-book electricians for the installation.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to be responsible,\u201d said Mr. Ladas, who wants to build a future in Greece rather than leave, as his friends have done. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to compete against others who don\u2019t pay the same tax as you.\u201dThe revenue that he does earn is steadily being eaten away. When he opened, he kept around 60 percent of his profit, after taxes. Today, his take is about 30 percent, after tax increases approved by the Greek government to meet budget-cutting and revenue targets imposed by creditors.\u201cThose who play by the rules are the ones getting punished,\u201d Mr. Ladas said.Even electricians, in a profession rife with shadow economy workers, complain about the competition. In a brightly lit office in central Athens, members of the national electricians union huddled around a table one evening to discuss their plight.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting against people who don\u2019t pay taxes,\u201d said Emmanouil Kafkalas, the general secretary, adding that at least half of electricians worked in the shadow economy. \u201cWe\u2019re losing work because they can charge less.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified Periklis Ladas. He is the man on the left, not the right.An article on Feb. 19 about the growth of a shadow economy in Greece misstated the day that European finance ministers were to meet in Brussels to discuss the latest Greek bailout package.

{"Headline": "Five Reasons the Opposition Is in Good Shape to Fight Trump", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAMHERST, Mass. \u2014 President Trump\u2019s first weeks in office left a majority of Americans appalled. With his \u201calternative facts,\u201d his scapegoating of foreigners and international trade, and his barrage of executive orders, Mr. Trump confirmed what the opposition had feared: that he will run the country like a populist autocrat and paranoid protectionist.His opponents are feeling a sense of impotence. As they watch the bulk of the Republican Party, the only party that counts in the new America, stand up against nothing that Mr. Trump is proposing, the Democrats feel desolate.Many Democrats fear that Trumpism cannot be stopped. This fear is not ungrounded. Nationalist, populist-autocratic rule is an aggressive form of cancer that is not easy to halt. It emerges in democracies and then uses democratic institutions to metastasize. The very same principles and institutions that permit the outsiders to challenge the establishment \u2014 especially free speech, internally competitive political parties and laws \u2014 soon become the targets of the autocrat once in office. That is the danger of this political cancer: It undermines the very same institutions it uses for its rise, thus blocking future challengers.After the 2016 election, the Democrats were left without control of any significant institutions. They are a minority in Congress and a minority in most state legislatures. Soon the bureaucracy and the courts will be filled with more Trumpites. The most famous bipartisan democracy in the world, with Mr. Trump at the top, is turning into a one-party state.Populist authoritarianism in the context of one-party rule will not be contained easily, let alone defeated. Democrats naturally will try many strategies, many of them contradictory. They will try to use the press to embarrass officials on TV by catching them lying; other times they will refuse to invite Mr. Trump\u2019s officials to talk. They will engage in fiery debates with Trump supporters; other times they will try being more civil. They will try to negotiate with the government; other times they will be obstructionist. They will sign petitions and they will march; other times they will stay quiet to avoid drawing attention. They will denounce the government on social media; other times they will post about things other than politics to avoid dwelling on their misery.Chances are many of these tactics, however disparate, will not show results right away. The problem is not that these strategies are wrong or ill conceived. The problem is that the cancer that these strategies are trying to fight is aggressive, adaptable and difficult to beat.And yet, I still feel there is hope. Compared with other places where populist autocrats have taken power, the United States has a resistance with at least five important advantages it can exploit in its fight against Trumpism:I\u2019m not being a Pollyanna. My point is simply that, comparatively speaking, there is hope. Trumpism can be contained, and yes, defeated electorally.There will be many setbacks along the way. But the opposition should remember that setbacks will not necessarily be the result of problems with the treatment, but with the aggressive cancer it is fighting. The challenge is to not lose hope or engage in excessive self-blame, but to persevere and experiment \u2014 because leaving this cancer untreated is the worst treatment.Advertisement"}

But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn\u2019t tell the truth.\u201dHere is an assessment of some of the claims Mr. Trump made.\u201cThey did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people. They dropped off the word fake.\u201d\u201cLook at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls. They\u2019re so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative.\u201d The day before the election, CBS and ABC projected Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by 4 points with margins of error of 3 points and 2.5 points. About 2.9 million more people, or 2.1 percent, voted for Mrs. Clinton than for Mr. Trump. NBC showed Mrs. Clinton with a 6-point lead and a margin of error of 1 point.\u201cNot that I\u2019m a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump because he\u2019s right on one issue: trade.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve defended other nations\u2019 borders while leaving ours wide open, anybody can come in.\u201dUnder the country\u2019s visa waiver program, citizens from some 30 countries are allowed to enter the United States without a visa for up to 90 days. Citizens from other countries must apply for a visa and could be rejected; waiting times vary. Refugees who are referred to resettlement in the United States typically wait up to two years.\u201cIn the Middle East, we\u2019ve spent as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion.\u201dEstimates for the total spent on the war thus far range from $1.6 trillion to $3.6 trillion. Factoring money appropriated for Homeland Security raises the cost to $4.8 trillion.\u201cObamacare covers very few people. And remember, deduct from the number all of those people who had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them.\u201d The left-leaning Urban Institute estimated that 2.6 million plans were canceled because they did not meet minimum requirements set by the act. But fewer than one million people ended up with no insurance at all, and it is not clear that this was entirely attributable to health care law.\u201cWe have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy, crushing.\u201d Unemployment is at 4.8 percent, compared with 7.8 percent eight years ago. Stock markets have been reporting record highs. Retail sales, the Consumer Price Index and the number of permits for new housing units all rose in January.\u201cWe\u2019re very depleted, very, very depleted.\u201d The number of troops will be reduced by the 2018 fiscal year, a result of pulling out of wars in the Middle East (a position Mr. Trump falsely says that he has espoused since the United States first invaded Iraq). The United States has the most sophisticated naval fleet in the world, with 10 aircraft carriers compared with Russia\u2019s one.Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, committed billions of dollars to updating the nuclear arsenal. Over all, the United States spends more on its military than the next seven to eight countries combined.\u201cThe people over there understand that I\u2019m right. Take a look at what\u2019s happening in Sweden.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018Jim, let me ask you a question, how\u2019s Paris doing?\u2019 \u2018Paris?

Now he doesn\u2019t even think in terms of going there.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who have gained health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

{"Headline": "Will Social Media Help or Hurt Your College and Career Goals?", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudent OpinionAs you become more valuable to the marketplace, good things will find you. To be clear, I\u2019m not arguing that new opportunities and connections are unimportant. I\u2019m instead arguing that you don\u2019t need social media\u2019s help to attract them.My second objection concerns the idea that social media is harmless. Consider that the ability to concentrate without distraction on hard tasks is becoming increasingly valuable in an increasingly complicated economy. Social media weakens this skill because it\u2019s engineered to be addictive. The more you use social media in the way it\u2019s designed to be used \u2014 persistently throughout your waking hours \u2014 the more your brain learns to crave a quick hit of stimulus at the slightest hint of boredom.Once this Pavlovian connection is solidified, it becomes hard to give difficult tasks the unbroken concentration they require, and your brain simply won\u2019t tolerate such a long period without a fix. Indeed, part of my own rejection of social media comes from this fear that these services will diminish my ability to concentrate \u2014 the skill on which I make my living.The idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance athlete, and it should be to you if you\u2019re serious about creating things that matter.Most employers and customers I\u2019ve talked to are ultimately looking for confirmation of their excitement about you, not reasons for suspicions or doubts. Not having any profile could be seen as a red flag, so why give a potential employer any reason to question your candidacy?Your social media presence \u2014 and, really, your whole digital footprint \u2014 is no longer just an extension of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It\u2019s as important as your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Social media use is now a standard of the hiring process, and there\u2019s little chance of going back.You need to realize that social media wields great power: What you say there \u2014 including saying nothing at all \u2014 has an effect on your network or on the employer who is checking out your Instagram account. But remember that you control what people see. By being more judicious about what you share or by altering the platform settings where possible, you can manage your digital trail to increase the odds that a potential employer will form a positive impression of you.\u2014 Do you think social media will help or hurt your college and career goals? Why?\u2014 Was either columnist more persuasive, in your opinion? Which one, and why?\u2014 Did you have a strong opinion about the value of social media to a person\u2019s professional life before you read the articles? Regardless of your stand either way, did reading the columns sway you to one side or the other? Why or why not?\u2014 Conduct a personal social media audit. Make a list of your social media accounts, including old platforms you no longer use.

He describes himself as a lucky white male. Evan Spiegel, the 26-year-old chief executive of Snap, may be all these things, but one thing is certain \u2014 he has a singular approach to business.It will also bring the company\u2019s approach to business, often credited to Mr. Spiegel\u2019s atypical way of seeing things, into the public eye.Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, is expected this week to reveal the paperwork for its initial public offering, showing how it is doing as a business and whether the valuation it is reportedly seeking ($20 billion to $25 billion) is justified.The choice to go public is as much a sign of Mr. Spiegel\u2019s unconventional approach as his original idea to focus on the \u201cright now\u201d with Snapchat when other social media were looking at people\u2019s past. Even as other start-ups have opted to stay private for as long as possible, he has long maintained that a public offering was best for the company.Anthony Scaramucci will not be taking a senior job at the White House as previously announced.What\u2019s the problem?This leaves the White House without a functioning Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs \u2014 an important office when protests over the president\u2019s immigration order are sweeping the country.Another quarter, another loss.The loss this year was worse than expected, The Wall Street Journal reported, pushing down its shares when the market opened on Thursday.

{"Headline": "President Trump Wants a Wall? Mexico Is It", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneAnd then, just as abruptly, the flow stopped. Under pressure from Washington, Mexico reimposed a tourist visa requirement on Brazil that it had eliminated five years before. This severed a trafficking route that started with an easy flight from Rio de Janeiro to Canc\u00fan and ended in a trek across the desert into southern Texas.In 2006, apprehensions of Brazilians by the Border Patrol fell 95 percent, to 1,460. Today few even try to sneak through. Over the last three years it has been mostly Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans who are fleeing home by the tens of thousands, hoping to cross Mexico to reach the United States.But as in 2005, the main buffer the United States has to stop Central American immigrants from entering illegally across the border \u2014 its wall, as it were \u2014 is Mexico. Mexico is a tool that the Trump administration now stands to lose.Ever since the skirmishing of the first few days of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, when President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to the United States after Mr. Trump repeated that Mexico would pay for his promised border wall, Mexican officials have hoped that more serene heads in the administration might moderate some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more hostile proposals.And in a move sure to stir Mexican outrage, the guidelines direct immigration officials to return immigrants from any country caught entering illegally to \u201cthe territory of the foreign contiguous country from which they arrived\u201d while they await removal proceedings in the United States. And that means Mexico.\u201cThat would violate every agreement and convention,\u201d said Gustavo Mohar, who formerly served as Mexico\u2019s top negotiator for immigration with the United States, about the provision.\u201cMexico is obliged to receive Mexicans, but it has the right to demand accreditation that they are indeed Mexican,\u201d Mr. Mohar said.Over all, Mexico stopped and sent back almost twice as many Central Americans as the United States did. The question is, Could President Trump\u2019s wall replace this buffer?And yet the new American administration might recognize that preventing Central Americans from reaching the United States imposes a high political cost on the Mexican government. In 2014, when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto announced the Southern Border Plan to tighten security around border points of entry and known migration corridors, he was harshly criticized for doing dirty work for the United States.\u201cIt became a news story in Mexico: Why are we treating Central American migrants like the United States treats Mexicans?\u201d said Andrew Selee, executive vice president of the Wilson Center in Washington, a research center focused on international affairs.\u201cThe Mexican government persisted because it perceived that a migration crisis on the border with the United States could also damage Mexico,\u201d he noted. \u201cThere were other things at stake in the relationship that it didn\u2019t want to risk.\u201dBy threatening to build a wall and leave Nafta and do any number of things to Mexico, Mr. Trump is changing this equation. If hostility is all he has to offer, the political cost for Mexico to be America\u2019s wall may prove too steep.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Take a Cosmic View on a Trump Stock Market", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe Trump stock market rally has displayed formidable staying power, yet there are reasons to be uneasy.The potential troubles are not bubbling up from the economy or from the market itself, but from the world of politics. That raises ticklish questions for the millions of people who rely on the stock market to secure their retirement, buy a home or educate their children.After all, history shows that stocks have provided the best returns of all publicly available asset classes over long periods, and the conventional wisdom is that they will continue to do so, regardless of transitory things like presidential elections or even wars and recessions.Yet Mr. Trump is making many people nervous. \u201cThe risks are rising fast,\u201d Brad McMillan, the chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Mass., wrote in late January. \u201cPolitics remains the focus here, not economics.\u201dThere are plenty of political controversies at the moment. Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on immigration, oil, financial deregulation, Mexico, NATO, Russia, China and Australia have all set off furors. Take your pick. Let\u2019s just assume that you are concerned \u2014 and wondering whether your money is safe.Based on the long history of the stock market, it\u2019s possible to conclude that Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior in office doesn\u2019t matter. This requires a cosmic perspective, however, and assumes that history will be relevant in the future.For a truly long-term investor, the overall stock market actually hasn\u2019t been all that risky since 1926. But that statement is reasonable only with some very important caveats. You must have held a diversified portfolio, and you must have been willing to absorb enormous short-term paper losses and hold onto your stocks, come what may.If you had been able to do all of that for at least 15 years, you would have been fine, because for every 15-year period since 1926, the stock market has never declined, said Sebastien Page, head of asset allocation for T. Rowe Price. That\u2019s great if you didn\u2019t need your money for 15-year stretches.That\u2019s why it\u2019s been difficult to remain serene about stocks \u2014 and why pure stock holdings have been dangerous for people who have actually needed to use their money. Globally diversified portfolios containing stocks and bonds have made more sense for most people, Mr. Page said.These numbers provide a compelling argument based on history for diversification and long-term investing, despite whatever worries you may have about the current state of American politics.\u201cOur best advice is stay diversified, stay the course and remember the role of stocks in your portfolio,\u201d said Joe Davis, global chief economist and head of the investment strategy group at Vanguard.For, say, a 20-year-old with money that she won\u2019t need for 50 years, a portfolio containing only diversified stock investments may make sense. For a 70-year-old facing retirement, a large dollop of diversified, high-quality bonds may be smart, even though bond returns may be constrained or negative, with interest rates possibly rising from current low levels. (Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions; while higher rates mean more income, they also imply lower prices on bonds.)In a stock market downturn, high-quality bonds are likely to perform well, Mr. Davis said. \u201cBonds have been negatively correlated with the stock market, and that\u2019s very valuable,\u201d he said.Based on the past, the outlook for the next five to 10 years isn\u2019t wonderful. Valuation measures for both stocks and bonds suggest that returns will be lower than they have been, but that has little to do with Mr. Trump. It was the consensus before the election results came in, and it was based mainly on the relatively high levels of asset prices and on the slow growth expected for the economy. It implies that investors should exercise patience and self-restraint.All of this also implies that history is relevant, of course \u2014 and that could be a mistake. It is possible that Mr. Trump will throw America onto a new path that isn\u2019t captured by past market statistics.How likely is that? No one knows. For what it\u2019s worth, the stock market isn\u2019t predicting a dystopian future. To the contrary, despite political turmoil, stocks have been extraordinarily steady, performing as though there were no clouds on any foreseeable horizon.Consider that the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index hasn\u2019t dropped 1 percent in a single day since Oct. 11. That\u2019s unusual. There hasn\u2019t been a comparable stretch since 2006, according to Bespoke Investment Group, an investment advisory firm based in Harrison, N.Y., and, before that, it last happened in 1995.The market has generally not had major declines soon after such periods \u2014 though big declines have occurred sooner or later. The problem is that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to know in advance when such a decline is about to start.If we are on the brink of one now, cash would be better than stock, but pulling out of the market carries a major risk of its own \u2014 missing out on stellar returns.\u201cThere are people who exited the stock market in 2008 and never returned,\u201d Mr. Davis said. They missed one of the greatest rallies in history. From the start of 2009 through January, the overall market has tripled in value, including dividends. That bears out the claim that it has been better to stay in the markets \u2014 as long as you have been able to hold on for very long periods.But if you are rattled now and determined to liquidate your holdings, he said, it\u2019s important to decide in advance what it will take for you to return. It could be a specific political outcome or a market drop of, say, 20 percent. Whatever it is, Mr. Davis said, write it down.Beyond that, remember that a long-term and well-diversified bet on the stock market is an investment in long-term economic growth. Unless we head into another dark age, that\u2019s a good bet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Look Now, but the Great Unbundling Has Spun Into Reverse", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe internet promised to be the great unbundler. The evisceration of distribution costs would free consumers from paying for cable television channels they never watched, allowing them to bypass cable monopolies and pay only for the shows they wanted. No longer would anyone have to buy a $99-a-month triple-play package when all they wanted was the History Channel.Over the last two decades, consumers have felt liberated as traditional bundles unraveled \u2014 from music to media to retail.For instance, Craigslist and myriad other digital start-ups siphoned lucrative job and real estate listings from traditional newspaper bundles. Meanwhile, media firms held onto the economically challenged business of delivering news and entertainment.Proponents of the breakdown of the bundle economy most often cite cable television. Superficially, the evidence is compelling: In the last six years, pay TV penetration has declined from about 90 percent to 80 percent of homes \u2014 with more than two million homes cutting the cord in the last couple of years alone.But paradoxically, the same forces that allowed classified ads and news to be so easily separated also drastically increased the economic rationale for bundling across the board.Consumers merely have swapped one bundle for another (or often, several). There are more than 65 million subscribers to cheaper \u201cover the top\u201d packages provided by Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Sling TV and others (even excluding Amazon Prime Video). One does not always think of all of these as \u201cbundles\u201d because these services do not consistently categorize their content using the commonplace TV channel taxonomy. However, their aggregation of shows looks more and more like a traditional cable bundle.We are in the age of the great rebundling, when firms use packages of services as a way to increase their scale advantage and thus deepen the moat around their businesses.In music, the story is even starker than in television. At one time, consumers used to buy a collection of songs \u2014 on vinyl, cassette and then compact disc. It was possible to buy a single song or two in these formats, but the internet facilitated more and more people downloading individual tracks.Yet, today, there is an inexorable consumer shift to all-you-can-eat bundles of music. Already more than 60 million people pay for Spotify, Apple Music and others. These music bundles will increasingly be combined with other services as well to build competitive advantage. This newspaper currently includes Spotify with certain new subscriptions. And it is easy to see how Google and Apple will increasingly integrate music packages into their broader suite of services (as Amazon already has).Bundling has always worked well for products for which consumers have widely varying tastes and willingness to pay. The magic of bundle economics allows consumers to get more for less, while also maximizing revenue for the provider. Imagine that there are two hungry diners at a burger joint where the restaurant\u2019s marginal cost of food is zero-ish. One customer is willing to fork over $5 for a burger and $1 for fries. The other will shell out $5 for fries but only $1 for a burger. By selling a la carte, the restaurant maximizes revenue by pricing each item at $5. Both consumers leave hungry, and the business takes in $10. However, both diners would snap up a $6 bundle, allowing them to sate their appetites while shelling out $12 in total. Everyone is better off (perhaps not healthwise).In the digital environment, two additional forces are driving this tidal wave of digital bundling.First, the near-zero marginal cost of distribution makes all-you-can-eat packages compelling. Even heavy users of streaming services can potentially be profitable customers if the underlying economics of rights payments are well managed.The Federal Communications Commission appears to be relaxing its position on the bundling of data and services. The agency had been investigating the practice of \u201czero-rating,\u201d whereby a wireless carrier like T-Mobile allows its subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data cap. Recently, the F.C.C. dropped this investigation \u2014 believing that this kind of bundling is now commonplace in a competitive market. Plainly this is the thin edge of the wedge for net neutrality. Connectivity and cloud computing services will most likely start to include \u201cunrated\u201d services to differentiate themselves further from other commodity providers. In the short term, this shift will most likely be a boon for consumers. Time will tell whether this stifles long-range innovation \u2014 especially in bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming.Second, firms need to mitigate the high cost of attracting and retaining online consumers. Netflix can amortize the expense of acquiring and servicing a subscriber over the hundreds of dollars of revenue they will generate if they hang around for a couple of years. Selling individual shows for a few bucks a pop would be vastly more expensive in marketing, billing and service costs.Tying several services together (even when they are not all directly complementary) increases customer loyalty. Amazon Prime has more than 66 million subscribers. Just a few years ago, it was mostly a free-shipping service. Now, it includes an extensive library of free e-books, videos and music. The large base of Prime subscribers makes life hard for would-be Amazon competitors \u2014 who have to contend not just with Amazon\u2019s scale in any particular vertical but also the combined value of the eclectic products and services that Amazon bundles together. This value may also increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning help personalize these applications. Walmart may be four times larger than Amazon in retail, but Amazon\u2019s bundle magnifies the impact of its size, reducing its scale disadvantage.For insurgents, this trend complicates the already formidable challenge of competing with the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple \u2014 all of which have been adept at weaving various interconnected services together to magnify their scale advantage.Technology investors are obsessed with network effects. These help make firms like Facebook and eBay so valuable \u2014 because additional users increase utility for everyone, making it hard for upstarts to compete. But investors often forget that network effects are just a subset of scale advantages. Superior scale is what protects most businesses from competition. It would be hard to start a business to take on Coca-Cola because of its size advantage \u2014 especially in local bottling, distribution and marketing.During the road show for the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape, its chief executive, Jim Barksdale, famously commented that there are \u201conly two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.\u201d For many firms, the bundle is not a decaying symbol of legacy distribution. Rather, it is the new network effect: a critical strategy to amplify scale in the hope of building or deepening a moat to protect against foes everywhere.Jeremy G.

{"Headline": "Tales From the Personal Essay Industrial Complex", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.There was a moment, sometime between 2008 and 2010, when a woman\u2019s insides \u2014 her exploits, her eating habits, her feelings, her sex life \u2014 became a lucrative internet product. Women, of course, have been writing about such things for years, including on the internet, but commodifying that writing had proven fraught. Marketing the entirety of the self through a personal blog \u2014 like Heather Armstrong\u2019s Dooce, or Emily Gould\u2019s iteration of Gawker \u2014 led to writer burnout and reader disillusionment.A better, more sustainable way to commodify the self was to do so piecemeal. For female authors, this meant writing personal essays on the most sensational slivers of their lives. For websites, this meant paying those authors \u2014 hundreds of them, the supply was nearly unlimited \u2014 somewhere between $0 and $100 for each sliver.I know about this economy because, for about four years, I was part of it. I was happy to participate: I had a day job, and I thrilled at the idea of my words in print. I never lied or did something ill-advised just for the story. I just mined my life for the weirdest, best and most tragic jewels until they were gone.For many, the personal essay industry reaped something darker. The web magazine xoJane, founded by Jane Pratt (formerly of Sassy and Jane), was one of the first to tap into this energy. Pratt, whose guiding ethos seemed to be \u201cthe more personal and vulnerable a writer is, the better,\u201d encouraged her staff and freelancers to write that way online. The result was a slew of essays, like those that make up the wildly successful \u201cIt Happened to Me\u201d series, ranging from \u201cI Became Celibate to Heal From Sexual Abuse\u201d to \u201cMy Baby Daughter Died at Two Weeks Old.\u201dCat Marnell was central to this trend. She was ostensibly xoJane\u2019s beauty editor, but her posts \u2014 usually written while high, in the early hours of the morning \u2014 gradually morphed into a diary of addiction. A meditation on Whitney Houston\u2019s overdose went viral; so did a video of Marnell snorting fancy bath salts. Marnell became a New York media celebrity, got fired/quit xoJane when her drug use \u2014 the very thing that made her such a lucrative writer \u2014 became worrisome to H.R. She started writing a drugs column for Vice, and became a late-night, strung-out, makeup-smeared fixture of Alphabet City. She eventually disappeared into her own addiction \u2014 but not before selling her memoir.It took three years, the threat of a ghostwriter and several trips to rehab, but Marnell\u2019s final product, \u201cHow to Murder Your Life,\u201d is far more than the sum of her collected columns. She traces her life story in a manner that manages to be at once sensational and matter-of-fact: the general negligence of her well-to-do parents, the fantasy of boarding school and the brutal reality, the addiction to Adderall and boys and the dedication to bodily perfection that gradually spirals her into a second-trimester abortion and expulsion six weeks from graduation.Marnell treads a knife edge between glamorizing her own despair and rendering it with savage honesty. Several sections read like the drug-fueled interludes of \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d: queasy-making stuff far more effective than a \u201cscared straight\u201d narrative. She propels the reader through what could seem like repetitiveness (drugs, binges, bad mistakes, sprawling parties) with the skill of a pulp novelist. In the introduction, she frankly admits, \u201cIf you are grossed out by \u2018white girl privilege\u2019 (who isn\u2019t?), you might want to bail now,\u201d before averring, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about that. Believe me, I have tried to cut this chapter out twice! My editor keeps making me put it back in.\u201dThe exclamation points, the name-dropping, the absence of social media, the obsession with print culture and \u201cdowntown kids\u201d and Manhattan (the word \u201cBrooklyn\u201d barely appears in the book) \u2014 \u201cHow to Murder Your Life\u201d feels like an artifact from a previous New York, previous internet, previous calculus of celebrity. The book\u2019s success stems from the wobbliness with which Marnell renders those worlds: Are they gross or sexy? Does she hate her body and run it toward destruction, or does she simply understand how female suffering has been rendered erotic?In \u201cAll the Lives I Want:Essays About My Best Friends Who Happen to Be Famous Strangers,\u201d Alana Massey teases similar tensions. Massey shares several broad characteristics with Marnell: an obsession with New York, oscillation between ambition and addiction, frankness about disordered eating and drug use. Massey is three years younger than Marnell \u2014 enough time, in internet years, to make her part of a new generation of personal internet essayists, more circumspect and savvy about how to exploit their own narratives.Massey has excavated major parts of herself online \u2014 one of her first forays into online writing was a piece for xoJane entitled \u201cI\u2019ve Never Had an Orgasm and I\u2019m the Only Person That Doesn\u2019t Care\u201d \u2014 and has fought the \u201cpink ghettoization\u201d of writing about women\u2019s issues, arguing that such work is just \u201cpart of the familiar hazing ritual that many women go through when we aren\u2019t ushered into media through more respectable channels.\u201dWith \u201cAll the Lives I Want,\u201d Massey continues to tell stories of herself, this time through analysis of celebrity women. In 15 brief essays covering a couple of dozen female celebrities and fictional characters, she makes claims like \u201cCourtney Love, you see, is a witch.\u201d Each meditation reads much like an online essay: trenchant in places but in need of a ruthless edit, loosely researched, with individual lines ripe for tweetability and a stomach punch of a kicker.Massey is best when she pinpoints the particular viscousness of living under patriarchy. An essay on Fiona Apple and Lana Del Rey observes that both women attract \u201cmen who can smell the blood on the places where a woman is breaking\u201d; elsewhere, she intermingles the narrative of how Britney Spears\u2019s body became public property with the way men call her body \u201cperfect\u201d only when it\u2019s below a healthy weight. But many of Massey\u2019s best points are swallowed by their extension to too many celebrities in too little space. As a result, she does a lot of telling the audience, in finely wrought, declarative sentences, how female celebrities have been mistreated by the world that venerated them \u2014 but does very little showing how that came to pass.Showing, after all, is the heart of the personal essay: People are enthralled less by the conclusions the author makes about her life than by the details that allow readers to come to their own. Which isn\u2019t to suggest there\u2019s no place for women to write analysis, or fiction, or whatever they please \u2014 just that Massey\u2019s particular voice, like Marnell\u2019s, works best when sharpened to a point, tilling the raw ground of the personal.There\u2019s danger there, of course: If you\u2019ve murdered your own life, either in practice or through the act of flattening it on paper, what\u2019s left to live? But I think Marnell and Massey are working toward something different: They figured out their words can build fires, and they\u2019re learning how to torch the ground, rather than themselves.Anne Helen Petersen is a senior culture writer at BuzzFeed News.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump Try to Bridge Some Gaps While Avoiding Others", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Despite sharp differences on immigration, refugees, trade and climate change, President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada struck a cordial tone on Monday in their first meeting, alternating between attempting to bridge those gaps and steering clear of them.When asked at a White House news conference whether he now sees the northern American border with Canada as insecure, Mr. Trump skirted the question, speaking instead of his administration\u2019s efforts to deport criminals from the United States.\u201cThe last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,\u201d he said.Maintaining the country\u2019s close political and economic links with the United States was top of the Canadian leader\u2019s agenda before his visit to Washington. Mr. Trudeau had forged an unusually close relationship with former President Barack Obama, but many of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, particularly his protectionist stance on trade and his call for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, are chilling for Canadians. They count on trade with the United States for about 25 percent of their country\u2019s gross domestic product.\u201cIt is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds with the United States,\u201d said Mr. Trudeau, who has expressed a cautious openness to renegotiating the trade pact.Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints about trade have focused primarily on Mexico, another partner in the North American agreement, and China, which he has accused of taking advantage of the United States. He did not answer a question about whether he sees Canada as a fair trader, but suggested that he does not foresee deep changes in that relationship, which he called \u201coutstanding.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be tweaking it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much less severe situation than what\u2019s taking place on the southern border.\u201dHe said the two leaders had spoken privately about \u201cdoing some cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster.\u201d They issued a joint statement pledging to continue border security programs that began under Mr. Obama, and reaffirming their commitment to NATO, an alliance that Mr. Trump had previously questioned.The meeting was the first test of the Canadian leader\u2019s effort to foster a good working relationship.Mr. Trump greeted Mr. Trudeau warmly, a reception similar to the president\u2019s greeting last week to Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister. The leaders shook hands heartily when Mr. Trudeau arrived at the White House, patting each other on the shoulder with their free hands.Mr. Trudeau appears determined to maintain friendly relations with Mr. Trump despite their differences, while signaling to Canadians who are wary of their powerful neighbor that Canada still charts its own course.\u201cWe continue our policy of openness to immigration and refugees without compromising security,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThere have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that\u2019s always been done firmly and respectfully.\u201dMr. Trudeau presented the president with a framed photograph taken in the 1980s, showing Mr. Trump speaking at the head of a table of people including Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a former Liberal prime minister of Canada and the current prime minister\u2019s father.The cabinet ministers who traveled with Mr. Trudeau on Monday had prepared for meetings with their American counterparts by emphasizing the importance of the cross-border relationship to Canadians. Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, had reminded Trump administration officials that trade between the countries is roughly in balance, and that Canada is the largest buyer of American exports from 35 states.\u201cThe combination of Canada being smaller and the United States being bigger and the relationship largely being trouble-free means a lot of Americans don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about Canada,\u201d Ms. Freeland said in a recent interview. \u201cAmericans are not always fully aware of the economic significance of the relationship.\u201dCanadian business leaders expressed some relief after their prime minister\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump.\u201cOn the whole, this was a good day,\u201d said John Manley, the president and chief executive of the Business Council of Canada, which represents 150 large Canadian corporations. \u201cThere\u2019s still lots of things to be anxious about, but I think the tone and the substance were all very positive.\u201dSome of those anxieties stem from uncertainty over what small changes to the United States-Canada trade relationship could mean for some sectors of the economy.There had been concerns after Mr. Trump\u2019s election that he might go after the Canadian auto industry, a major employer in Ontario, which exports most of its production to the United States.Flavio Volpe, the president of the Auto Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association, a trade group, said that it was important for his members to hear Mr. Trump\u2019s message that he is not planning to dramatically remake the United States\u2019 trade relationship to Canada.The two leaders also met on Monday with several women who are chief executives of companies from both countries to announce that Canada and the United States would set up a cross-border council to advance women into executive roles, and to encourage entrepreneurship.Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a reported from Washington, and Ian Austen from Ottawa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Watchdog Faces Attack by House Republicans", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the House Financial Services Committee will move forward on legislation to neuter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its power to crack down on predatory business practices, according to a leaked memo that emerged on Thursday and infuriated Democratic defenders of the bureau.The memo, drafted by the chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas and a longtime foe of the consumer agency, aligns House Republicans with President Trump in the latest attack on President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. The memo detailed plans to weaken the leadership of the agency, allowing the president to replace the bureau\u2019s director at any time. Legislation in the works would limit the bureau\u2019s enforcement authority, reduce its ability to make rules and repeal its consumer complaint system.It would also greatly shrink the enforcement tools at the consumer watchdog\u2019s disposal, blocking it from being able to go after businesses engaged in deceptive practices and restricting its oversight of big publicly traded companies that are already regulated by agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201cThis would substantially change the structure of the C.F.P.B. and greatly limits the scope of its authority,\u201d said Hunter Wiggins, former principal deputy enforcement director at the bureau.The proposal was part of a broader set of policies that Republicans have been devising to roll back the Wall Street regulations known as the Dodd-Frank Act, which emerged from the 2008 financial crisis. While Mr. Trump also supports dismantling the law, Republicans would probably be unable to accomplish a sweeping repeal of Dodd-Frank without the support of some Democrats.That will be difficult to get. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, blasted Mr. Hensarling\u2019s plan on Thursday and accused Republicans of plotting to turn an effective consumer watchdog into a \u201ctoy poodle.\u201d\u201cIt took less than three weeks for House Republicans to show their hand on how they will renege on candidate Trump\u2019s campaign promises to hold Wall Street accountable and help working Americans,\u201d Mr. Brown said after reviewing the memo.Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Treasury Department, said during his confirmation hearing that the consumer protection bureau, created by Dodd-Frank, should cease to be funded by the Federal Reserve and should instead be funded through Congress, a move that could curb its independence. Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, who is waiting to be confirmed as the White House\u2019s budget director, has referred to the bureau as a \u201csad, sick joke.\u201dAnd Sean Spicer, White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump had not yet decided if he would try to oust the bureau\u2019s director, Richard Cordray, before Mr. Cordray\u2019s term ends in 2018.\u201cYou bet I\u2019m worried,\u201d Ms. Warren said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m worried for the millions of working families who have gotten some help over the last five years from a strong and independent consumer agency.\u201dShe added: \u201cI\u2019m worried that Trump wants to take the life out from that.\u201dFor Mr. Trump, hobbling the bureau would have the added sweetness of outraging Ms. Warren, a political nemesis whom he derided regularly on Twitter during his campaign as Pocahontas, referring to a controversy about her Native American heritage.That revenge would not be that easy to exact. While Mr. Trump is fond of bellowing, \u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d sacking Mr. Cordray could be complicated.\u201cIn my view, attempts to fire him would be not only illegal but unwise politically,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, a fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and a former official of the bureau. \u201cThe director of the agency is not intended to be a political pawn of the president.\u201d\u201cThe C.F.P.B. has eroded freedom, trampled due process and killed jobs,\u201d Mr. Hensarling wrote. \u201cIt must go.\u201dClosing it completely would almost certainly require some bipartisan support, but some Democrats have demonstrated a willingness to reconceive the bureau. Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, where a number of major credit card companies have their headquarters, said this week that he would like to have hearings to address its future and that he would be open to new leadership, the website Morning Consult reported.\u201cI\u2019ve been interested in exploring the idea of a commission-like approach,\u201d Mr. Carper said.The bureau\u2019s backers point to the nearly $12 billion in financial relief that it has provided to about 27 million American consumers as a result of its work. Big fines recently levied against Wells Fargo and the Navy Federal Credit Union have buttressed their argument that regulation is good for the economy.\u201cPeople know that financial companies were running amok, and that kind of behavior takes money out of people\u2019s pockets and was the cause of a financial crisis,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cPresident Trump campaigned on standing up to Wall Street, and I don\u2019t think his voters are looking for putting Goldman Sachs even more in charge.\u201dThe federal courts could make it easier for the president to remove Mr. Cordray before his term expires. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last October that the president should have the authority to dismiss the consumer bureau\u2019s director at will. If the full Court of Appeals agrees with that decision, Mr. Cordray could be fired immediately. The case could eventually head to the Supreme Court.Ms. Warren said that agencies with single directors had existed without complaint, and that the push to dismantle a watchdog that protects vulnerable consumers went against the populist promises that swept Mr. Trump to the presidency. \u201cEven the majority of Trump voters want to see it protected or expanded,\u201d she said.For the time being, Mr. Cordray and the bureau\u2019s legal team are assessing the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s new executive orders and focusing on the daily business of enforcement.Mr. Cordray would not discuss potential changes to the bureau\u2019s leadership structure, but he defended its importance to the economy, given the coming wave of deregulation.\u201cThis is hard and immensely important work, and we have made real change in the way financial institutions treat consumers,\u201d Mr. Cordray said in an email before the Hensarling memo was released. \u201cCompanies know that they have to comply with the law and that there is somebody standing on the side of consumers to make sure they\u2019re treated fairly.\u201dMr. Cordray said the need for tough oversight had not abated even though the economy had stabilized.\u201cI believe we\u2019ve made some great progress, but this is a big market, and there is a lot of work still left to do,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

For just $140 a month, there are separate bedrooms for his three girls and two boys, as well as a guest bathroom.The complex is being built by Qatar, the oil-rich Persian Gulf state that has stepped in repeatedly in recent years to help isolated, war-racked Gazans. But there are limits to Mr. Gatshan\u2019s thankfulness.\u201cAs a Palestinian, I would not support Qatar if they said they wanted a two-state solution,\u201d said Mr. Gatshan, 44. \u201cI want my human rights. My rights are to live without any limits or restrictions and without occupiers.\u201dFor years, the Obama administration struggled to forge a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians, only to run headlong into unsurmountable obstacles: a right-wing Israeli government, fractured Palestinian leadership, and an Arab world consumed by its own upheavals. Since then the barriers to peace have grown even more formidable, and attitudes like Mr. Gatshan\u2019s more entrenched.When President Trump and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, meet in Washington on Wednesday they are likely to discuss a change of tactics, relying on Arab states like Qatar to help secure an two-state solution, under which Israel and an independent Palestinian state would live side-by-side.A White House official said Tuesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s objective was peace between the two sides, but it did not necessarily need to take the form of a two-state solution.But even if Mr. Trump does not abandon the two-state solution, any route to peace contains many pitfalls.But that is a long shot, experts say, given some of the crises gripping the region: Saudi Arabia is mired in a war in Yemen; Egypt is reeling from economic and security concerns; and Jordan is focused on securing its borders with Iraq and Syria.Israel\u2019s government has moved steadily to the right, expanding settlements on land that the Palestinians and much of the rest of the world say should be part of a future Palestinian state.And the Palestinians remain sharply divided: The Palestinian Authority, backed by the United States and European powers, governs parts of the West Bank, while Hamas, a militant Islamist movement committed to Israel\u2019s destruction, rules the coastal Gaza Strip.\u201cWhat can Jordan or Egypt or Saudi Arabia do?\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, the occupation has to end, or you will have no end to the conflict.\u201dHistorically, sympathy for the Palestinians and their quest for statehood was one of few unifying causes across the Arab world. Arab armies came together to wage wars against the Jewish state, and many governments later provided financial and military aid to armed Palestinian factions.Even after the Oslo peace accords of 1993 led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, most Arab countries rejected formal relations with Israel on principle, considering it a usurper of Arab land. Jordan and Egypt have peace treaties with Israel, but Israel remains unpopular with their citizens.But the prominence of the Palestinian issue in the Arab consciousness has waned in recent years, as the Arab state system has weakened because of popular uprisings and civil conflicts.\u201cCare is there, but attention is not,\u201d Mahmoud Yehia, an Egyptian lawmaker, said of the Palestinian cause. \u201cPeople are dealing with all these new internal issues now, and they have been struggling economically for years and years before that.\u201dSupporters of the outside-in approach say that the merging of interests between Israel and Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt could provide an opening.But that approach has been tried before, without success, in large measure because of deep and nearly universal Arab opposition to Israel. Arab leaders will not dare be seen to align their interests with the Jewish state, even when there is common cause, like opposition to Iran and to terrorist groups like the Islamic State.For many Arabs, the sheer number of crises in the region leaves little energy left for the Palestinians.\u201cThere is also a growing realization among people that the region is now very chaotic,\u201d said H. A. Hellyer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a research organization in Washington. That causes \u201ca sense of helplessness\u201d toward the Palestinian issue.The divisions among Palestinians also undermine support for their cause. \u201cEven if they wanted to do something, they don\u2019t know who they should support now,\u201d Mr. Hellyer said.And many Palestinians have given up on the idea of a two-state solution. A decade has passed since Palestinian infighting left the West Bank and Gaza under the control of competing administrations with opposing views of how to pursue statehood.Others feel that too much time has passed to expect that the West Bank and Gaza can again be brought under a single authority. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza,\u201d said Ibrahim Madhoun, a columnist for the Hamas-affiliated newspaper Al Resala. \u201cNow, Gaza is one thing and the West Bank is something else.\u201dHamad City, where Mr. Gatshan lives with his family, is home to tidy shops, playgrounds and a mosque that will soon hold 3,000 people. A second wing of roughly 1,400 spacious units has just opened. But the Qatari initiative has risen on a potent symbol of deadlock.Much of the land once belonged to an Israeli settlement, which was evacuated in 2005. Israel called it a move toward peace. Gazans said settlers should never have been there in the first place.But Israelis complain bitterly that this evacuation showed that pulling back from settlements does not work: Militant groups, including Hamas, fired rockets into Israel. Three wars followed.Though Hamas has declared a truce, and largely controls other groups who try to continue fighting, some Israelis say a new war in Gaza is the only way to ultimately achieve peace.Israel \u201ccannot be the only country in the world where children cannot walk down the street without worrying that a missile will fall,\u201d Naftali Bennett, a far-right lawmaker and education minister, said on a visit to the fence dividing Gaza and Israel last week. \u201cOur enemies are investing all their resources in developing ways to kill us.\u201d\u201cOnly with a complete victory,\u201d he said, \u201ccan we put an end to this cycle.\u201dIan Fisher reported from Hamad City, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon.

{"Headline": "Treasury Nominee Vows No Tax Cut for Rich. Math Says the Opposite.", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe newly christened \u201cMnuchin rule\u201d \u2014 the assurance given by the Treasury nominee Steven T. Mnuchin that \u201cthere would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class\u201d \u2014 seems as if it was made to be broken.Although Mr. Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top would be offset by the closing of fat loopholes, his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered.Redesigning the tax code with an eye fixed on lower rates has been a Republican mission for decades, and one that Mr. Trump adopted. That prospect, combined with a promised regulatory retreat, has pumped up the stock market and fueled optimism among business leaders.How big? \u201cThree-quarters of the tax cuts would benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers,\u201d if the plan were put into effect this year, it said. The highest-income households \u2014 the top 0.1 percent \u2014 would get \u201can average tax cut of about $1.3 million, 16.9 percent of after-tax income.\u201dThose in the middle fifth of incomes would get a tax cut of almost $260, or 0.5 percent, while the poorest would get about $50.That split would worsen down the road, the Tax Policy Center says: \u201cIn 2025 the top 1 percent of households would receive nearly 100 percent of the total tax reduction.\u201d\u201cThe Mnuchin rule is already being broken as Republicans look to strip away hundreds of billions of dollars in Affordable Care Act tax credits for working Americans to pay for a giant tax break for the wealthy,\u201d Senator Wyden said. \u201cBottom line is it\u2019s unfair to cut benefits that the middle class depends on, all so the wealthy pay a lower rate.\u201dMr. Mnuchin did not respond to a request for comment.Republicans argue their plan makes everyone a winner \u2014 that lower taxes will unleash an enormous swell of economic growth, raising wages, incomes and tax revenue all around.The historical record does not offer much support for the claim that slashing taxes for the most affluent creates growth. Yet even assuming the rosiest of forecasts, the top 1 percent, according to the Tax Foundation, would still receive close to a $100,000 tax cut \u2014 32 times as much as a middle-income family.Mr. Mnuchin has offered his own formula for adhering to the standard he laid down, explaining that \u201cany reductions we have in upper-income taxes would be offset by less deductions.\u201dThat would require some otherworldly mathematical magic, however.Consider the list of proposals that would reduce taxes on the rich:\u25a0 Cut the top income tax rate to 33 percent, from 39.6 percent.\u25a0 Eliminate the estate tax, which applies to a tiny number of people, couples that have estates bigger than $10.8 million.\u25a0 Eliminate the 3.8 percent surtax on high earners\u2019 investment income that has been used to subsidize health care for poorer Americans.\u25a0 Lower taxes on cash flow and income that passes from small businesses to their owners, which also primarily benefits wealthier Americans.Any plan to curb itemized deductions would be partly offset by Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to increase the standard deduction. Curtailing mortgage deductions for the most expensive homes is probably a good idea, Mr. Viard said, but that isn\u2019t going to do much to raise revenue from those at the top of the income pyramid, and the deduction is already roughly limited to the interest paid on $1 million in mortgage debt.Such alternative ideas, however, assume that the Mnuchin rule will have a meaningful impact on what the White House will propose or Congress will debate. Not everyone is convinced that it will. As Mr. Viard said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much interest there is in fulfilling that statement by Mnuchin, however it\u2019s interpreted.\u201dAn article on Friday about how tax proposals from House Republicans and President Trump could make a promise by Steven T. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for Treasury secretary, hard to keep misstated a detail of an analysis of the House Republican tax plan by the Tax Foundation. Four of five taxpayers would see an increase of 0.2 to 0.5 percent in after-tax income, not a cut of 0.2 to 0.5 percent.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Effect: What\u2019s an Investor to Do?", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWhen Donald J. Trump won the presidential election, investors seemed positively giddy about what he was going to do to improve the nation\u2019s economy. Believing that his promises to reduce corporate taxes and curtail costly regulations would unleash economic growth, investors pushed stock indexes to new heights.Hope always plays a powerful role in the financial markets \u2014 and then reality sets in. So, as President Trump gets down to work, investors are now scratching their heads trying to figure out what his presidency will really mean for their portfolios.The recent flurry of executive orders from the new president provides a taste of what may lie ahead. This much is clear to many strategists: Mr. Trump\u2019s mercurial tendencies will bring heightened volatility to individual stocks as well as to the securities markets over all. Let\u2019s just say that fastening your seatbelt is probably a smart move.Mr. Trump prides himself on being a disrupter. So investors had better get used to this approach and the volatility it will bring.Professional traders love volatility, of course, darting in and out of positions to take advantage of precipitous price moves. But buy-and-hold investors often find this action disorienting, and it can chase them out of their holdings at the wrong time. For them, rising volatility is a risk.By the most popular measure, volatility still remains low. The index that measures the implied volatility in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, known as the Vix, stood at around 12 recently, very near the low for the range during the last year.\u201cThose levels are double and triple where they were a year or two ago,\u201d Mr. Kotok said of forward loan contracts. \u201cIf Libor is the same and the interest rate in forward rate agreements is rising, under that construction you are seeing a rising risk premium.\u201dThe stock market rose sharply on Friday, and it does not seem that investors are questioning Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to growing the nation\u2019s economy. Instead, they may be fearful that his bludgeon-force management style will imperil his goals.What makes this period especially difficult for investors is Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to make big decisions without weighing the far-reaching and longer-term consequences.Consider, for example, the perhaps surprising effect that the order banning entry to people from seven countries will have on American colleges and domestic students.As college costs have rocketed in recent years, foreign students, who typically pay in full for tuition, have become an increasingly significant group on American campuses. The number of international students in the country has grown 70 percent over the past decade \u2014 to 5 percent of total enrollment, or more than one million students, said Patricia Healy, a portfolio manager at Cumberland Advisors who specializes in municipal bonds.International students contribute mightily to the revenues at educational institutions; as such, they help subsidize other students who are unable to cover the cost of college, including those from the United States.\u201cMany institutions, especially private ones in urban settings and those that are research-oriented, would be significantly affected by a drop-off in international enrollment,\u201d Ms. Healy wrote to clients in a research note. \u201cThe ban may not have an immediate effect on the finances of universities, unless there are expenses to aid displaced students; but it will have negative ramifications for these and other institutions in the long run if foreign students reconsider coming to the U.S. for their education.\u201dFewer international students enrolling at American universities will mean that fewer domestic students may receive the tuition help they need to pursue their degrees or to conduct research. This is just one of the consequences of restricting the travel of international students.Given how markets react to the kind of disruption that Mr. Trump revels in, how can investors protect themselves?Consider reducing risk exposures by retreating to higher-quality instruments. After years of low interest rates, investors have flocked to lower-grade bonds in search of higher yields. Now is the time to rethink that approach, because of the potential for volatility and higher interest rates.\u201cHigher-quality bonds could be a bit of a buffer if rates go up and news events cause more volatility,\u201d Ms. Healy said in an interview. \u201cThese investments have the strength to withstand it.\u201dInvestors should also acknowledge that we are in uncharted territory. \u201cIt is remarkable that the markets still see a Trump presidency as positive,\u201d Mr. Ashworth of Capital Economics said. \u201cPolitical volatility has never been higher, and market volatility has never been lower.

Northam, a Democrat, what defines this year\u2019s race for governor in Virginia, and he does not mention President Trump. Ask the same question of former Representative Tom Perriello, Mr. Northam\u2019s rival for the Democratic nomination, and he invokes the president in the first sentence.\u201cI think it\u2019s fierce resistance to the kind of hateful politics Trump has represented and putting forward a better vision of how we\u2019re going to build an inclusive economy,\u201d Mr. Perriello said in an interview here last week, speaking after a town hall-style meeting that showed just how immersed he is in the administration\u2019s mounting controversies and the swelling opposition movement.And if he is successful in bending an election that usually revolves around taxes, transportation and education toward the divisive occupant of the White House, he will have sketched out a new strategy for Democrats during the Trump administration that is sure to be mimicked in the party\u2019s primary races in next year\u2019s midterm elections.Mr. Northam, the chosen successor of Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is barred by law from seeking a second consecutive term, had locked up support from every major Democratic official in a state that is trending left. But then Mr. Trump won in November, and Mr. Perriello saw his opening.\u201cA lot of the establishment said that I clearly didn\u2019t get Virginia, that this was not a local issue that people expected from their governors,\u201d Mr. Perriello said with evident satisfaction. \u201cThis was actually a matter of me having very much a sense of where Virginia voters were in terms of their concerns.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether that claim is correct \u2014 the answer will come in the primary election on June 13. But if he is proved right, it will indicate that Trump-bashing is enough to transcend one\u2019s own past apostasies on issues dear to the left in a Democratic primary race. And it will underscore how much this state has changed.Scheduled in typically low-turnout elections the year after the presidential votes, Virginia\u2019s primaries and conventions in governor\u2019s races have been dominated by those engaged in politics, and particularly local and state government. So the issues discussed have largely been unique to Virginia, a history-drenched state with a healthy self-regard and a bipartisan commitment to business.In Mr. Northam\u2019s view, this year will continue in the same pattern.\u201cThe most important thing for Virginia is our economy,\u201d he said in an interview in his office adjacent to the State Capitol, highlighting the job gains the state has had under him and Mr. McAuliffe and outlining a message just as easily offered had Mr. Trump never left \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re not helping businesses grow and bringing in new business and new manufacturers to Virginia, then the rest of these things we like to talk about are not that important,\u201d Mr. Northam said.The two Democratic candidates are as stylistically different as their strategic calculations.Mr. Northam, 57, could have been a candidate for governor here decades ago, before Virginia was transformed into a suburb-dominated and culturally diverse dynamo. The easygoing son of a judge who grew up across the Chesapeake Bay on the state\u2019s rural Eastern Shore, Mr. Northam bears the state\u2019s distinctive accent; a diploma from one of its venerated institutions, the Virginia Military Institute; and a direct connection to its painful history.Addressing a black fraternity alumni group visiting the Capitol, he noted that his parents had kept him enrolled in public schools after Virginia\u2019s leaders reluctantly integrated under federal order. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019m very proud of,\u201d he said.Before being elected lieutenant governor, Mr. Northam was a state senator and, after a stint in the Army, had a pediatric neurology practice.Mr. Perriello, 42, reflects a newer Virginia. The grandson of Italian immigrants, he was reared near Charlottesville, went to Yale and became a diplomat and social justice activist.He speaks from the lexicon of modern-day liberalism \u2014 alluding to the \u201cstructural privileges\u201d he enjoyed \u2014 and is plainly trying to position himself as the preferred candidate of the left.Yet in the one term he served in the House before being swept out with the Tea Party wave of 2010, he took positions that have raised doubts about his ideological consistency.Representing a conservative-leaning district, Mr. Perriello received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association in his re-election bid and supported an amendment to the Affordable Care Act barring insurance companies participating in the law\u2019s exchanges from covering abortion.He said he regretted accepting the N.R.A. endorsement and argued that the group had become an extremist organization in recent years.It is not a very persuasive answer for some Virginia gun control advocates.\u201cThat seems a little strange to me, because the N.R.A. now and the N.R.A. in 2007 are not a whole lot different, as far as I can tell,\u201d said Peter Read, a Northam supporter whose daughter was killed in the mass shooting that year at Virginia Tech.Mr. Perriello has also renounced his support for the abortion-related amendment to the health law, but he is far less nuanced now than he was earlier in his career about the issue generally.When asked about abortion rights at the meeting, he said with no hesitation that he had \u201calways been pro-choice.\u201d But when he was in Congress, he boasted of having \u201crejected the labels pro-life and pro-choice\u201d and \u201cdrawing ire from both sides of this debate.\u201dSensing a growing threat from Mr. Perriello\u2019s effort to tap into the backlash against Mr. Trump, Mr. Northam is now on the attack.\u201cYou can look at my record, the progressive Democratic values that I have believed in and fought for, versus someone who\u2019s again kind of put his finger up in the air to see which way the wind is blowing,\u201d Mr. Northam said, noting his role defending abortion rights in Richmond.But the lieutenant governor has blemishes of his own in a Democratic primary race. He conceded that he had voted for George W. Bush in each of his presidential campaigns, explaining that he was an apolitical doctor at the time and now viewed his decision as \u201cwrong.\u201dThe race may ultimately be determined by whether Mr. Perriello can broaden the universe of voters who participate in the primary election beyond the 319,000 who voted in the last contested Democratic governor\u2019s race, in 2009.He could receive a substantial boost were he to obtain the endorsement of former President Barack Obama, whom he developed a friendship with while in the House and whose State Department he served in until the end of last year.Mr. McAuliffe broached the matter of the Virginia primary in a White House meeting with Mr. Obama shortly after Mr. Perriello entered the race, and Mr. Obama was noncommittal, according to a Democratic strategist briefed on the conversation. Asked if Mr. Obama would wade into the race, his spokesman, Eric Schultz, said only that he would not rule it out.But Mr. McAuliffe said there was \u201czero chance\u201d the former president would intervene, and some of Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers said privately that they doubt he would endorse Mr. Perriello.In an interview in his office, now festooned with a \u201cMake Virginia Great Again\u201d cap, Mr. McAuliffe rather unconvincingly insisted that he was not irritated by Mr. Perriello\u2019s bid. But the insurgent candidacy has upended the governor\u2019s well-laid succession plans, potentially complicating a presidential run he is increasingly thought to be eyeing. (Asked if he wanted to be president, Mr. McAuliffe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I might.\u201d)The governor, however, said that because Virginia voters approve of his performance and are happy with the trajectory of the state, they will cast their ballots for continuity and support Mr. Northam.\u201cYes, there\u2019s this huge angst about Trump, but at the end of the day, Virginia voters care about Virginia,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said, citing education, job creation and \u201ccan I get on 66 or 495 or 95 or 64,\u201d the state\u2019s often-choked highways.But other veteran Democrats here believe that the race, which polls show is fluid because neither candidate is well known, could become competitive.And they have a theory why.\u201cI hate to see us just take advantage of the drama of the time and make a choice on that, as opposed to getting a solid governor,\u201d said Ken Plum, a state legislator and former Virginia Democratic chairman who is backing Mr. Northam.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Wants to Attract More Foreigners (of a Certain Kind)", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySinosphereChina has generally issued a few hundred green cards per year, and the recent uptick illustrates how the authorities are seeking to attract more foreign investors and celebrities, even though most recipients are still ethnically Chinese, analysts said.But for many other foreigners in China, they said, residency restrictions have increased since 2013, when a landmark immigration law took effect, and the green card program remains exceedingly small for a country of 1.3 billion people with about 600,000 foreign residents.He said the policies, much like those of Japan and South Korea, were \u201cpredicated on a very strong nation-state that defines itself as the home of a particular ethnic and cultural group that wants to maintain its purity and wants to let in only what it really, really desperately needs.\u201dChina\u2019s 2013 law was the first major overhaul of national immigration policy since 1985 and helped to lay the foundation for a raft of new residency rules in China\u2019s major cities.From an employer\u2019s perspective, \u201cI would think there are more options for getting the talent you want,\u201d she said of Shanghai\u2019s new rules. She added that green cards, unlike work permits, were not tied to job contracts and were valid for renewable 10-year terms.But Chinese immigration and residency policies that have been enacted since 2013 have also become more restrictive toward less valued workers, especially the African traders and entrepreneurs who have settled in the southern city of Guangzhou since the early 2000s, often by overstaying their visas, experts said.Mr. Mathews said that many African and Arab traders in Guangzhou overstayed their visas because the official limit on their stays \u2014 typically two weeks or a month \u2014 often did not provide enough time to commission a factory order and see it through to completion. But the government appears unwilling to loosen that rule, he added, and foreign traders who obtain legal residence permits are generally limited to one-year stays with no guarantee of renewal, even if they have Chinese spouses or children.\u201cThe whole issue is: Can foreigners become Chinese?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I know there\u2019s a green card system and so on. But on the ground, it appears doubtful.\u201dMs. Zou said China could eventually address labor shortages by bolstering its fertility rate or raising its retirement age, or by investing in automation. Some of that investment is underway, she added, and Chinese companies are outsourcing some low-skilled production to other countries in Asia.Karoline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Economic Arrogance", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI guess this was only to be expected from a man who keeps insisting that crime, which is actually near record lows, is at a record high, that millions of illegal ballots were responsible for his popular vote loss, and so on: In Trumpworld, numbers are what you want them to be, and anything else is fake news. But the truth is that unwarranted arrogance about economics isn\u2019t Trump-specific. On the contrary, it\u2019s the modern Republican norm. And the question is why.Before I get there, a word about why extreme growth optimism is unwarranted.For one thing, in the Reagan years baby boomers were still entering the work force. Now they\u2019re on their way out, and the rise in the working-age population has slowed to a crawl. This demographic shift alone should, other things being equal, subtract around a percentage point from U.S. growth.The only way we could have a growth miracle now would be a huge takeoff in productivity \u2014 output per worker-hour. This could, of course, happen: maybe driverless flying cars will arrive en masse. But it\u2019s hardly something one should assume for a baseline projection.And it\u2019s certainly not something one should count on as a result of conservative economic policies. Which brings me to the strange arrogance of the economic right.As I said, belief that tax cuts and deregulation will reliably produce awesome growth isn\u2019t unique to the Trump-Putin administration. We heard the same thing from Jeb Bush (who?); we hear it from congressional Republicans like Paul Ryan. The question is why. After all, there is nothing \u2014 nothing at all \u2014 in the historical record to justify this arrogance.The evidence, then, is totally at odds with claims that tax-cutting and deregulation are economic wonder drugs. So why does a whole political party continue to insist that they are the answer to all problems?It would be nice to pretend that we\u2019re still having a serious, honest discussion here, but we aren\u2019t. At this point we have to get real and talk about whose interests are being served.Never mind whether slashing taxes on billionaires while giving scammers and polluters the freedom to scam and pollute is good for the economy as a whole; it\u2019s clearly good for billionaires, scammers, and polluters. Campaign finance being what it is, this creates a clear incentive for politicians to keep espousing a failed doctrine, for think tanks to keep inventing new excuses for that doctrine, and more.And on such matters Donald Trump is really no worse than the rest of his party. Unfortunately, he\u2019s also no better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the G.O.P. Wants Trump to Say Tonight", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 When he addresses Congress for the first time on Tuesday night, Donald J. Trump will do so as one of the most untraditional and unexpected presidents in American history. The election, however close, was a decisive statement by the American people against the status quo, an expression of the hope that he would break the stalemate in Washington and lead the country in a new direction.Mr. Trump can take pride in his cabinet choices, the deregulatory thrust he and the Republican Congress have initiated and the boldness he has shown in shaking up the established order and the elites in Washington. His decision to push ahead on the Keystone pipeline is the triumph of common sense over environmental orthodoxy. And his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a master stroke that conservatives celebrate and even liberal jurists respect.I have no doubt that President Trump will spend much of his speech making the case for three initiatives that are already underway in Congress: the rebuilding of the military, the repeal and replacement of the failing Affordable Care Act and the long overdue reform of the tax code. And he will surely discuss his proposals for something most Americans strongly favor \u2014 enhanced border security.However, President Trump will need to do more than merely wait upon a Republican Congress to produce the legislation he has championed. He must become an active participant in the legislative process.There are many knotty issues that must be resolved with respect to all these points in his agenda. How much money will be pumped into the Pentagon, and will it be offset by reduced spending on domestic priorities such as early childhood education, biomedical research and clean drinking water?Do Republicans finance their new health care system by keeping some of the Obamacare taxes or, as some suggest, taxing upper-end health insurance plans \u2014 an idea they previously opposed?There are divisions within Republican ranks in Congress on all these issues. Many support a border-adjustment tax, for example, but a large number passionately oppose the idea. Only presidential leadership can resolve them. And resolving each issue will require President Trump to take ownership of the final decision and sell it to different factions within the Republican Party, and to the country as a whole. Presidents must lead, and leadership will be required to meet the objectives Mr. Trump has laid out.There are other initiatives I hope the president addresses in this speech and those to come. In the opinion of many on both sides of the aisle, President Obama conducted unauthorized and therefore illegal wars in Libya, Syria and other parts of the Middle East. A new effort against the Islamic State requires a new congressional authorization for the use of force. President Trump should ask for it.Preserving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and putting America on a sound fiscal footing requires the reform of the entitlement system. President Trump should embrace that cause. Ronald Reagan did it with respect to Social Security, and won 49 states in his re-election. And as much as all Americans embrace President Trump\u2019s call for enormous new investments in infrastructure, he owes the country an explanation of how he is going to pay for it. President Dwight D. Eisenhower did just that when he built the Interstate System of highways.Finally, there is the vexing issue of illegal immigration. President Trump is right to focus first on border security. Previous administrations have promised to do so, yet failed to deliver. And he is correct to demand that those who entered America illegally and committed serious crimes be deported.But that\u2019s just the start. Once the public is convinced that these tasks are being undertaken, the president will have to decide what to do with those who entered the country illegally but, once here, have obeyed the law, contributed to our economy and often had children who are citizens. Eventually, the president will have to address this issue in a manner which is practical, just and comprehensive. No previous president has managed to do so. Given his reputation for toughness on immigration, Mr. Trump might have the credibility to create a consensus.Our last two presidents tried and failed to unite the country. Indeed, each left it more divided than he found it. President Trump instead has opted to do big things in the hope that by achieving them he can renew the American spirit and bring the country together through deeds, not words. It is a worthy goal. Every American should hope he succeeds.Tom Cole is a Republican representative from Oklahoma.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These \u201980s Artists Are More Important Than Ever", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImages and technological media now pervade every minute of our lives so thoroughly that much of what passes for reality is indistinguishable from its representation. The urban environment is a cloaca of hypnotic, animated signage, sounds and image streams that follow us into taxicabs and hospital waiting rooms, and in turn, any banality, from a misspelled street sign to a funny advertisement, is considered suitable to become an image on social media.This didn\u2019t happen overnight. One of the least helpful clich\u00e9s of recent years has been the declaration that some phenomenon or person is \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d; the presumption that history is headed, with occasional setbacks, toward a much-improved, even utopian state of things could only be endorsed by someone unfamiliar with history. Mistaking the perfection of our devices for the perfection of ourselves relieves us of responsibility for what happens to the world: It will just naturally turn out O.K., sooner or later. But technology can easily outrun our comprehension of what it does to us, even while it incarnates our wishes, fears and pathologies. (What could be more pathological than a nuclear weapon?)Our present bedazzlement-by-pixels was anticipated by a loosely affiliated group of artists who emerged in New York in the mid-1970s and early \u201980s \u2014 before iPhones, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. \u201cThe Pictures Generation\u201d has become a ubiquitous, awkward catchall term, probably abrasive to the artists themselves, for something that was less an organized movement than a heterogeneous expression of a zeitgeist. Their art was connected by an interest in examining power and identity in a media-saturated, politically uncertain age. The name derives from a 1977 show at Artists Space curated by Douglas Crimp, simply called \u201cPictures,\u201d where five of these artists \u2014 Troy Brauntuch, Jack Goldstein, Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo and Philip Smith \u2014 were featured. A survey exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum a few years ago folded in another 25.Some of the artists that carry the Pictures Generation label are well-known to the general public, such as Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, David Salle and Cindy Sherman; many have achieved canonical status in the art world, with their work featured at multiple venues throughout any given year, all over the world. A few, such as Walter Robinson and Troy Brauntuch, are only now starting to get long-overdue recognition. A number of them, like Louise Lawler, the subject of a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York this spring, have re-entered public consciousness at a moment that is oddly similar to the one in which they first appeared. The questions they all first addressed in a faraway, predigital period may be even more relevant today than they were then.The Pictures artists, so-called, were born in Cold War America, during the schizoid cultural meshing of unparalleled national prosperity with the daily threat of looming nuclear annihilation. They grew up with Hollywood movies, low-def network television and ad-heavy pictorial magazines like Look and Life as the audiovisual wallpaper of their childhoods, mostly in American suburbs.16 PhotosThe initially black-and-white, then gradually colorized media world they absorbed trafficked heavily in prescriptions for living: heterosexual families with gleaming teeth in an all-white America; unambiguous gender stereotypes; dream homes in tidy neighborhoods; knee-jerk patriotism; holidays made sparkling with margarine; and an ever-expanding, ever-better smorgasbord of branded consumer products including cars, watches, cigarettes and anything else that could plausibly enhance a quotidian middle-class lifestyle.As the dreary conformity of America during the Eisenhower years loosened dramatically in the \u201960s, mass media got more sophisticated at manipulating public moods and private consciousness. Families that had prospered in the \u201950s passed enormous buying power to their offspring, who became a lively demographic for a brilliantly adaptive advertising industry, a juggernaut that could selectively appeal to bikers, hippies, African-Americans, feminists, student protesters and bohemian types as readily as it did its traditional suburban targets.Despite the political violence and social atomization of the \u201960s, the sense of a stable country still on the rise was sustained, for the most part, by a general belief in the solidity of its institutions, including the media. This optimism lost much of its credibility as the \u201960s counterculture fizzled into paranoia and bleakness during the Nixon years. American failure no longer felt impossible. The Pictures artists came of age in this disillusioning period, sharply aware that the images and narratives they\u2019d been nurtured on were not only bogus but insidiously coercive. They were reflective people who read widely, wrote well and could easily articulate their concerns, well-versed in the deconstructive approach to texts and images of theorists like Jean Baudrillard and Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes\u2019s deflation of authorship and originality, Laura Mulvey\u2019s groundbreaking writings on the male gaze in cinema and Conceptual art\u2019s distillation of the artwork to its self-conscious, philosophically pointed idea. They were intellectuals as well as artists, a disfavored combination throughout most of American art history: Artists weren\u2019t supposed to think about the implications of what they were doing, or the overall context in which it appeared.Pop Art made the art world desirable to the general public, but this admiration constricted during the \u201960s, with the ascendant asceticism of Conceptual art and Minimalism, which called into question the whole idea of art as something to look at. The Pictures artists initially had to contend with a small nexus of established galleries unwelcoming to new work, and a presiding narrative about \u201cadvanced art\u201d that inevitably led to the disappearance of art objects. They were too fastidious, and too smart, to discard the poise and economy of Conceptualism in favor of some inchoate, spontaneous \u201cself-expression\u201d \u2014 the construction of the self, after all, was one of the things they were pondering.So they experimented, showing early work in alternative spaces, which were rapidly losing funding. Providentially, the commercial rise of painting at the end of the \u201970s brought serious revenue back to the art world, and with it a number of new galleries receptive to emerging artists \u2014 like Metro Pictures, where many of these artists got their start. For the first time ever, young New York artists could hope to earn serious money by making art. The work they produced in the \u201970s and early \u201980s might be described as a theatricalization of Conceptual art, or a caustic mimicry of both fine art and commercial illustration.17 PhotosPerhaps because photographs are already \u201ccopies\u201d of what they picture, and because photography was barely considered art at the time, so many of the Pictures artists found it the most congenial medium for what they wanted to do: to point at things already in the world, and make what they implicitly signified apparent.Photographs could be staged to emphasize the look of artfully subtle, unremarked female stereotypes in movies (Cindy Sherman), or to picture toy housewives in miniature home interiors, evoking the pathos of domestic imprisonment (Laurie Simmons). Photos could be excavated from the morgues of bygone magazines and science journals, blown up and bannered with jarring, sardonic captions (Barbara Kruger). Images could be scissored out of National Geographic and Vogue, and repatriated to blocks of strident primary colors, where their fetishistic weirdness became hilariously disturbing (Sarah Charlesworth). A photo could present art in the settings it occupies after it\u2019s sold, on walls of rich collectors, corporate offices and other privileged venues \u2014 today, typically, a billionaire\u2019s storage facility (Louise Lawler).Not everyone made photographic works, but all were engaged in photo-derived imagery. Robert Longo\u2019s large-scale charcoal-and-graphite drawings of \u201cMen in the Cities\u201d were sourced from photographs of the artist\u2019s friends and are key icons of the period; the remarkable painters in this group (Thomas Lawson, Walter Robinson, David Salle and Michael Zwack, to cite a few) found powerful ways to provoke questions about how we process representations of reality, in which contexts, with what quality of attention.The use of existing images, which might be altered in scale, cropped, rephotographed, angled or simply presented in copied form \u2014 \u201cappropriation,\u201d as practiced by Richard Prince and Sherrie Levine, among others \u2014 inspired indignant critical sniping from writers like Robert Hughes. Yet it had a perfectly respectable lineage in art history. These pictures revealed how contrived, unnatural and seductive the originals actually were. They attracted and repelled simultaneously. Such works created a nervous sense of how representation operates in the everyday world \u2014 almost subliminally much of the time, tapping into myths and illusions sunk deep in our brains, influencing the way we act, how we dress, behave in public, occupy space, choose and attract sexual partners, spend money, make friends and enemies.But above all else, the Pictures artists addressed power, especially patriarchal power, at its quotidian level of social engineering, as well as in its grip on art history. If we are to think of the Pictures Generation as an art movement, then it was the first one in history that included a substantial number of women artists. Much of the early resistance to it was flagrantly misogynistic, though its male artists came in for their own share of ridicule from newspaper and magazine critics, whose favorite dismissive word for this art was \u201cbrainy.\u201dWhen it first appeared, in a predigital world, Pictures art looked imperiously distanced from its subject matter, detached from its own japeries and even merciless in its view of American life\u2019s visual detritus and empty glorification of the arbitrary. But a backward glance at these artists reveals plangent nostalgia for innocent first encounters with a visual culture that proved far from innocent. It\u2019s no accident that we are giving these artists a careful second look now. Whatever progressiveness was afforded by the Obama era has come full circle to an isolationist longing where an unpredictable celebrity president speaks directly to an electorate that is collectively backlit by technology\u2019s artificial glow. The emotional resonance of the Pictures Generation has accrued over time, strengthened by its curious suitability to the present.Advertisement"}

To remark that Wright\u2019s novels were also satirical and freewheeling does not begin to cover it. As one of his admirers, the novelist Ishmael Reed, put it, Wright was \u201cRichard Pryor before there was a Richard Pryor. Richard Pryor on paper.\u201dIt\u2019s time to exhume Wright\u2019s novels. I won\u2019t give you the already-exhausted Trump-era culture argument, that we need this writer now more than ever. Instead, I\u2019ll give you this one: Reading Wright is a steep, stinging pleasure, and pleasure will be the guiding principle behind the undersung American books I\u2019ll be speaking about twice a month in this new column.Wright\u2019s books \u2014 they were republished by HarperCollins in 1993 in an omnibus edition under the title \u201cAbsolutely Nothing to Get Alarmed About\u201d \u2014 will not be for everyone. They are essentially plotless. They bristle with pimps and drug dealers and all-American hustlers of every variety. They were composed before the era of political correctness, and their social targets are free-range and multiform.They\u2019re each about a lonely young man, a fan of Billie Holiday and Langston Hughes and F. Scott Fitzgerald, adrift in the big melancholy city. He has dreams of becoming a writer, but for now he\u2019s holed up in cheap apartments or cockroach-filled hotels, working as a bike messenger or a dishwasher or, though he doesn\u2019t identify as gay, allowing older gay men to pay him for sex.In \u201cThe Messenger,\u201d he gives this account of one moment in his workday: \u201cAs I walked through the concourse of the RCA building, sneezing and reading Lawrence Durrell, dead drunk from the explosion of his words, I suddenly looked up and encountered the long face of Steven Rockefeller. He seemed startled. Doesn\u2019t he think poor people read?\u201dThe primal subject of Wright\u2019s novels is loneliness. As a light-skinned black man, his narrator feels like a minority tucked inside a minority. But his solitary nature was baked in at birth. About certain Sunday mornings in Manhattan, the author reports: \u201cThe shameful, envious, eyes-lowered glances at passing couples. You recognize other solitary fellow travelers. Both of you go separate ways, moving with the knowledge of Sunday papers, endless cigarettes, tap water, the hoarded half-pint, and the feeling of having missed out on Saturday night\u2019s jackpot prize.\u201dThe jackpot prize among Wright\u2019s novels is probably \u201cThe Wig.\u201d It\u2019s his most fully realized book, a frazzled picaresque about a young black man who, sensing he needs a gimmick to make it in the white world, employs an economy-size jar of hair relaxer (\u201cthe red, white, and gold label guarantees that the user can go deep-sea diving, emerge from the water, and shake his head triumphantly like any white boy\u201d) to achieve what he calls \u201cthe wig.\u201dHe\u2019s not happy to be mocked about his new mane. When a female friend yelps, \u201cYou\u2019ve conked your hair,\u201d he replies, \u201cDo you want me to bash your face in?\u201d His hair is so resplendent, and later so vividly red, that he wonders: \u201cWould Time magazine review this phenomenon under Medicine, Milestones, The Nation, Art, Show Business, or U.S. Business?\u201dThe wig does not take him far. He ends up working in a feathered costume for a fried-chicken joint. (To his dismay, the costume dents the wig.) This novel\u2019s first four sentences could also be its last four, and they put me in mind of the antiheroes in Jim Harrison\u2019s fiction:\u201cI was a desperate man. Quarterly, I got that crawly feeling in my wafer-thin stomach. During these fasting days, I had the temper of a Greek mountain dog. It was hard to maintain a smile; everyone seemed to jet toward the goal of The Great Society, while I remained in the outhouse, penniless, without \u2018connections.\u2019\u201dThe final novel in Wright\u2019s trilogy, \u201cAbsolutely Nothing to Get Alarmed About,\u201d began as a series of columns in The Village Voice. The narrator by now has found a certain amount of fame as a writer, but it brings him little money and less joy. This is an often desultory novel that the writer David Freeman likened to \u201cthe rough draft of a suicide note.\u201dWright\u2019s heavy-drinking narrator declares early in the book, as if punching out Morse code: \u201cDesperately trying to get a reassuring bird\u2019s-eye view of America. F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s sunny philosophy had always appealed to me. I believed in the future of the country. At 14, I had written: \u2018I am the future.\u2019 Twenty-six years later \u2014 all I want to do is excrete the past and share with you a few Black Studies.\u201dWright\u2019s eye remains sharp in this last book. His narrator stares at a photograph of Norman Mailer in a glossy magazine and thinks: \u201cThe face of an urbane carpenter in a $200 suit.\u201d There is still some antic humor and a good deal of bawdy sex. He sleeps with a woman whose breasts, he notes approvingly, \u201cseemed capable of guiding an ocean liner into harbor.\u201d But the fire had largely gone out of Wright\u2019s work.It\u2019s one of the tragedies of the last century\u2019s American fiction that he wasn\u2019t able to relight it. Wright wrote like it mattered and, though he conjured a world of trouble, he clearly got a bang out of being alive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Sell Handmade Soap? Join the Crowd", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurship\u201cYou can use anything in your spice cabinet for fragrance,\u201d said Ms. Bosworth, whose fee ($168 per student) included hands-on soap-making from scratch, in this instance whipping up two batches of shea-butter soaps scented with essential oil blends: one with lavender, the other lemongrass.Tools included an immersion stick blender, a scale, a plastic mixing spoon and a large stainless-steel pot. At the end of the class, everyone went home with some soap and a reminder to let it dry out for four weeks before working up a lather.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like making your own soap \u2014 I love the alchemy of it,\u201d Ms. Bosworth, 52, told her students.Those students were all hoping for another sort of alchemy: turning their growing skills into a successful business. But they\u2019ll be joining a crowd.Part of what\u2019s helping fuel that growth is soap\u2019s status as a recession-proof indulgence. Whatever the economy, \u201cpeople are willing to buy that nice-smelling bar for $6 or $8 at the farmers market,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Donnell said.Further, soap makers \u2014 95 percent of whom are women \u2014 view the blending of alkali and oils as something they can do at home to supplement the family income.\u201cSome are happy staying small, but some are very entrepreneurial and want to have a lot of stores,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Donnell said.Since soap doesn\u2019t require premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 as long as it\u2019s labeled, sold and represented solely as soap \u2014 the barriers to entry are low.As is the price of getting into business. \u201cYou can get started for under $50,\u201d said Ms. Bosworth (presuming that you don\u2019t pay for her class).Soap-making is a relatively simple process as long as you have patience and a precise scale. But as with baking, some have the knack, and some don\u2019t.Even for people who are highly skilled, turning a big profit is a challenge. One lavender-infused bar smells pretty much like another after all, and removes dirt with equal dispatch.\u201cSoap is such a commodity,\u201d said Ms. Bosworth, whose website describes her as an herbalist, aromatherapist and energy healer based near Boulder, Colo. \u201cYou can find handmade soap anywhere.\u201dBut 19 years ago, when she was starting her business in Massachusetts, there were only four other indie soap makers in the state, she said, and just a few thousand in the country.When the economy tanked in 2008, \u201cI had a lot of competition all of a sudden,\u201d Ms. Bosworth continued. \u201cIt forced all of us to differentiate ourselves.\u201dFor a time, \u201corganic\u201d and \u201cgoat milk\u201d were useful terms for soap makers who were understandably eager to set themselves apart from the rest of the competition. \u201cBut then someone else would have goats\u2019 milk, and you\u2019d have to come up with something else to make you even more special,\u201d said Ms. Bosworth, whose response, for a time, was to offer sea-inspired soap, like seaweed and sea salt.Now her company offers 10 varieties of soap, all of which she still makes personally. She charges $8 for a six-ounce bar, but declined to say how many she sells a year.An average order is six to eight bars, though some customers buy as many as 30 decidedly unpretentious bars a year. \u201cOur soaps are all naturally beige,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to beautify with dyes and make it look unnatural.\u201dOthers in the business begin tinkering with lye and oils to address a family member\u2019s skin condition or as a way to avoid the artificial ingredients in commercial products.When her husband tried it and his skin stopped cracking, that was sufficient impetus for Ms. Jonas to start selling, as her website puts it, \u201ca good, clean soap made by a good, clean family.\u201d Goat Milk Stuff now sells several hundred thousand bars of soap a year, said Ms. Jonas, who has turned the soap-making chores over to her 18-year-old son, Colter.For some companies, soap ultimately becomes a loss leader. \u201cI make money off my soaps, but it\u2019s labor-intensive,\u201d Ms. Bosworth said. \u201cSoap will bring the customers in, but it can be the gateway to selling the higher markup and less labor-intensive lotions and serums and lip balms.\u201dHorse \u2018O Peace, for example, offers lip balms and moisturizers, and recently introduced a line of pet care products. Goat Milk Stuff\u2019s product line includes laundry soap, liquid soap, lotions, cheese, yogurt, milk, gelato and fudge.Fortunately for soap makers, consumers seem to appreciate their back-to-basics ethos. \u201cI think that when people start using it, they realize this soap is different from commercial soap,\u201d said Ms. Ryhanen of Saipua.More than that, they buy into the art of the well-made bar. \u201cYou get up in the morning, and the smell of the coffee brewing and the smell of the soap in the shower are aromatherapy,\u201d Ms. Bosworth said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a bar of soap. It\u2019s something that sets the tone for the whole day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jim Mattis Seeks to Soothe Tensions in Japan and South Korea", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump relishes referring to his new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, as \u201cMad Dog.\u201d Mr. Mattis has never liked the nickname, which he argues is a news media invention. But to the commander in chief, it signifies a man who knows how to take the fight to the enemy and win.During his recent alliance-mending mission in Asia, however, Mr. Mattis was more loyal friend than attack dog, hailed as a welcome voice of sober restraint.\u201cHe appeared calm and considerate to allies despite his nickname,\u201d said Kookmin Ilbo, a South Korean daily newspaper. \u201cThoughtful and diligent\u201d was the verdict of the Mainichi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper. Even the daily Tokyo Sports weighed in, describing Mr. Mattis as the \u201conly sensible person in the Trump administration.\u201dThe mission, the first overseas trip by a top member of the Trump administration\u2019s national security team, was intended to shore up relations with two essential allies, South Korea and Japan. It required a tricky balance: standing firm against North Korea\u2019s saber rattling and China\u2019s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea \u2014 stances that come naturally to a defense secretary \u2014 while also reassuring allies made nervous by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign talk about pulling back from American security commitments in Asia.The task was all the more challenging given the administration\u2019s mixed signals on foreign policy and Mr. Mattis\u2019s testimony to Congress that he was reluctant to repeat the Obama administration\u2019s language about \u201crebalancing\u201d or pivoting to Asia, because it implied that the United States was turning away from its defense obligations elsewhere.South Korea, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North Korea, cherishes its strong alliance with the United States. But in a nation still scarred by the Korean War, many are concerned that a hawkish American administration might escalate tensions with the North. They fear that could disrupt their export-driven economy and even lead to an armed conflict with the North under its unpredictable young leader, Kim Jong-un.But Mr. Mattis also sought to remind South Koreans of the United States\u2019 past sacrifices for their country and its commitment to their defense.During a meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Mr. Mattis recalled how he had come to South Korea for training in the 1970s when he was a young Marine lieutenant based in Okinawa, Japan. He fondly remembered a Sergeant Chung, a South Korean marine who shared some kimchi with him. He also noted that he had commanded the First Marine Division, which had fought in 1950 in the Chosin Reservoir battle of the Korean War.Such comments clearly resonated with Mr. Han and top Defense Ministry officials, all of whom are retired or serving military officers and who have had close interactions with American troops. Mr. Mattis is a retired four-star general.\u201c\u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Mattis in South Korea was unexpectedly soft,\u201d read a headline in OhMyNews, a widely read online newspaper. It observed that Mr. Mattis, despite his nickname, was considered the most prudent among Trump administration officials when it came to military action because he had seen what war was like.In Japan, Mr. Mattis sought to carry out a similar balancing act. During the campaign, Mr. Trump threatened to walk away from the mutual defense pact unless the Japanese did more to reimburse the United States more for defending their territory.Strikingly, Mr. Mattis expressed caution about using military force. In contrast, Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s new secretary of state, suggested during his confirmation hearing that the United States should be prepared to block China\u2019s access to the islands that it has claimed in the South China Sea and built up with airfields, ports and weapons.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month.Mr. Mattis has long argued that diplomacy should be backed up by military might, but that force should not be the first recourse. In the case of the South China Sea, he said, it is the diplomats who should be carrying the ball.\u201cThere is no need right now at this time for military maneuvers or something like that,\u201d said Mr. Mattis, who described the dispute as \u201csomething that\u2019s best solved by the diplomats.\u201dWith the Trump administration in flux, and the potential for surprises from North Korea and China, it seems likely that there will be fresh challenges. But for now, Mr. Mattis appears to have succeeded in his reassurance mission in Seoul and Tokyo.\u201cWords matter enormously over there,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a military expert at the Brookings Institution. \u201cNot only did Mattis say all the right things on issues ranging from Thaad to the Senkaku/Diaoyu to the strength of alliances to the need for a firm but steady and nondramatic U.S. approach to the South China Sea, he also went with a listening ear and little bravado. Things are definitely better, at least for the moment.\u201dMichael R. Gordon reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Task Force Urges Better U.S. Engagement With China", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States\u2019 relationship with China was strained during the Obama administration, with sharp differences over economic and trade issues, cyberattacks and Beijing\u2019s assertive maneuvers in the South China Sea.But since taking office last month, President Trump has signaled that matters could get even more contentious, as his administration has vowed to project more military might in Asia and to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods. China could respond with its own punitive measures.The task force rebuked Mr. Trump\u2019s questioning of the One China policy, by which the United States recognizes the government in Beijing, rather than that of Taiwan, as representing China.The report said that \u201cit would be exceedingly dangerous to unilaterally abandon our longstanding One China policy \u2014 an understanding that has served as the basis for the U.S. relationship with China, helped protect Taiwan\u2019s security, prosperity and democracy, and preserved peace and stability in Asia for almost four decades.\u201dBut relations worsened after the 2008 financial crisis, which China withstood well with a huge stimulus package, it said. Beijing\u2019s leaders grew more hostile toward economic and military supremacy by the United States. In 2013, with Xi Jinping as president, these tendencies hardened.Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that as China\u2019s economy grew, so did its abilities and determination, and old suspicions that the United States wanted to contain it resurfaced.\u201cChina\u2019s goal is clear: It wants to be a regional power,\u201d said Mr. Li, who was not on the task force. \u201cXi Jinping wants to revitalize China\u2019s glorious past. And, with the world\u2019s second-largest economy, it wants to build a stronger military.\u201dThe task force report said the Chinese government also tightened restrictions on American internet companies, nongovernmental organizations and media outlets.As relations between Washington and Beijing started deteriorating, the task force was formed two years ago to make recommendations for the next president. Its members included Charlene Barshefsky, a former United States trade representative; Winston Lord, a former United States ambassador to China; Kurt M. Campbell, a former State Department officer; and Evan S. Medeiros, a special assistant to President Barack Obama on Asia.As they began to meet, consensus emerged that the United States needed to strengthen its resolve and show greater firmness in dealing with China.The task force urged the administration to keep a strong military presence in Asia. It also said new policy and diplomatic tools, including sanctions, litigation over trade disputes and the use of reciprocal measures, were needed. For example, if China restricted investment or trade, the United States might need to do the same.The administration should make clear its resolve to combat climate change, avoid protectionism, reaffirm the One China policy, bolster its military commitments in Asia and, effectively, stay the course, the task force said.The task force warned that if the new administration alters the basic course that has long guided United States relations with China, it could \u201cdestabilize not only the bilateral relationship, but also the region as a whole.\u201dJane Perlez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andrew Puzder Withdraws From Consideration as Labor Secretary", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder withdrew his nomination to be labor secretary on Wednesday as Republican senators turned sharply against him, the latest defeat for a White House besieged by infighting and struggling for traction even with a Republican-controlled Congress.The opposition from Republicans was broad, and the reasons varied. Among the senators who expressed concerns were John Thune of South Dakota, Rob Portman of Ohio, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Tim Scott of South Carolina, more than enough to scuttle the nomination.A spokesman for Mr. Puzder, George Thompson, said his treatment had been \u201can unprecedented smear campaign.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Puzder thanked the president and those who supported him for their optimism about the \u201cpolicies and new thinking\u201d he would have brought to the job.The Senate must still vote on the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, over the loud objection of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who took to the Senate floor again Wednesday to accuse Mr. Mulvaney, a hard-line conservative, of being anti-military.\u201cThis is not personal. This is not political. This is about principle,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cThis is about my conviction as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee that providing for the common defense is our highest constitutional duty.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is facing a revolt by E.P.A. employees scrambling to block him. Ms. Collins declared her opposition to him Wednesday.Republicans blamed Democratic obstruction, not the quality of the president\u2019s choices, for the arduous confirmation process.\u201cI think when you have to put all this energy into an unreasonable nominations process, it takes away the energy that could better be used for other things,\u201d Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri said.Democrats cheered Mr. Puzder\u2019s withdrawal as a victory for working Americans. The Labor Department regulates workplace safety, enforces wage and hour laws, maintains unemployment and payroll data, and is generally seen as an advocate for workers. Mr. Puzder, at the helm of his fast-food company, ardently opposed the Affordable Care Act, cast a skeptical eye on minimum wage and overtime rules, and pledged an assault on regulations that he said in his withdrawal statement would \u201cput America\u2019s workers and businesses back on a path to sustainable prosperity.\u201dSome critics also cast him as sexist, denouncing fast-food advertisements he championed that featured bikini-clad women eating monstrous hamburgers.\u201cThe simple truth is that, given his relationship to employees at the companies he runs, he was not fit to lead a department responsible for defending workers\u2019 rights,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Trump to nominate someone who supported the rights of workers rather than suppressed them.\u201cPuzder should never have even been nominated to lead the Labor Department, and Senate Republicans clearly recognized this, too,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThe fact that someone so anti-labor was even nominated shows how far President Trump is from where he campaigned.\u201dAs the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr. fast-food chains, Mr. Puzder had come under intense criticism from Democrats and liberal groups that accused him of mistreating his workers and supporting automation in the workplace. The intense scrutiny of his personal life compounded his troubles.His hearing was repeatedly delayed as he sought to extricate himself from his business and investments. Democrats, who organized screenings of the video of his wife detailing her allegations of abuse, were preparing to make his marriage an issue and to question him about his company\u2019s salacious TV ads. However, as recently as last week, he had said through a spokesman that he was \u201call in\u201d to move forward.Despite the growing backlash, the White House and Republican leaders tried to rally support around him last week, arguing that no nominee was perfect.\u201cI think Andy Puzder is an outstanding choice,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who counted himself a friend of Mr. Puzder\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for nominees who have never made a mistake. Frequently, it\u2019s impossible to find nominees who have never made a mistake.\u201dRepublicans quietly acknowledged the setback as they saluted Mr. Puzder.\u201cAndy Puzder has the experience and ability to make an excellent labor secretary, but I respect his decision,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the labor committee.While labor groups and supporters of a higher minimum wage opposed Mr. Puzder, some in corporate America had been optimistic that he would understand the plight of businesses and relieve companies of regulations.The National Restaurant Association, the industry\u2019s lobbying group and one of Mr. Puzder\u2019s biggest backers, lamented his treatment on Wednesday and expressed hope that Mr. Trump would choose someone else in his mold.\u201cIt is extremely unfortunate that the confirmation process has resulted in a qualified and dedicated man withdrawing from the labor secretary nomination,\u201d said Cicely Simpson, executive vice president of the association. \u201cWe hope that President Trump\u2019s next labor secretary nominee, like Andy, has experience creating jobs and a deep understanding how to get business and government to work together to grow the economy.\u201dJim Talent, a former Missouri senator, had been helping prepare Mr. Puzder for his confirmation hearing and said he was ready to answer the questions about his family and his business record. After it became clear to Mr. Puzder that he did not have sufficient Republican support, Mr. Talent said, he decided to drop out.\u201cNobody likes a process where you\u2019re attacked all the time,\u201d Mr. Talent said. \u201cHe was looking forward to being able to address these concerns, particularly the ones about his family.\u201dJennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen and House Republicans Clash Over Fed\u2019s Performance", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, sparred with House Republicans on Wednesday about the value of financial regulation and the effectiveness of monetary policy in a testy session that showed the gulf between the central bank and the conservatives who control Capitol Hill.During a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, Ms. Yellen was relentlessly pressed by Republicans to concede that the American economy was broken, that the Fed had failed to fix the underlying problems and that excessive regulation was making things worse.Members of the committee frequently interrupted Ms. Yellen, who tends to speak slowly and at length, and showed frustration when she did not concede their points. For the most part, she did not.Ms. Yellen acknowledged that economic growth had been \u201cquite disappointing,\u201d but she said the Fed\u2019s efforts had contributed to strong job growth since the 2008 financial crisis, and she defended the value of the regulatory changes that came after it.\u201cI think financial regulation has resulted in a stronger financial system and less risk than we had before the crisis,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to have stronger growth and a faster recovery.\u201dThe hearing was contentious from the outset. Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who is the chairman of the committee, began with an indictment of what he described as the Fed\u2019s failures. \u201cAfter eight years of the largest monetary policy stimulus in our history and the most unconventional monetary policy in our history, Americans recently received disappointing economic news yet again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is official: The economy grew at a measly 1.6 percent in 2016, when our historic norm is twice that.\u201dMr. Hensarling also criticized \u201ca failed regulatory state\u201d that he said was impeding growth.The Fed has its own doubts about some of the postcrisis changes in financial regulation, like the so-called Volcker Rule, which limits the kinds of investments financial institutions can make. Banks regard the rule as an arbitrary restraint, and Republicans would like to erase it. The Fed did not back its creation, and Ms. Yellen stopped short of rising to its defense.\u201cI think the evidence on this matter is conflicting,\u201d she said of its impact.But Ms. Yellen did not endorse a broader rollback of the regulations for big banks.\u201cIs it not true that if we would throw off the shackles of unreasonable regulation that we would have had a faster, steeper recovery?\u201d asked Representative Bill Huizenga, Republican of Michigan.Ms. Yellen responded, \u201cI would not generally agree with that.\u201dRepublicans also pressed Ms. Yellen repeatedly to suspend rule writing until the Trump administration could appoint a new vice chairman for regulation. Representative Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky and the new chairman of the monetary policy subcommittee, told Ms. Yellen it was \u201cimperative\u201d for the Fed to refrain from issuing new regulations until Mr. Trump had a chance to place his own people at the central bank.\u201cMany financial institutions in my district and around the country are concerned that the Fed may cram through a new wave of regulations before these new governors are confirmed,\u201d Mr. Barr said.The Fed has completed the bulk of the new regulations required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and Ms. Yellen said the regulatory docket was \u201c relatively light.\u201d But she did not agree to suspend the Fed\u2019s work.House Republicans have circulated a variety of proposals aimed at constraining the Fed\u2019s approach to monetary policy and subjecting the central bank to increased oversight. The Fed has strongly opposed such changes, and Ms. Yellen suggested on Wednesday that Republicans had not been clear about what issues they wanted to fix.Lawmakers, she said, should \u201cdecide what the problem is that needs to be addressed.\u201dThe House proposals have found little traction in the Senate, but supporters are hoping that the Trump administration will embrace some version of the proposals.\u201cClearly, Americans have a newfound expectation that our economy will grow healthier with different policies coming out of Washington,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said.Several Democrats on the committee sought to defend the Fed and the Dodd-Frank Act by pointing to the strength of economic growth. The United States is in the midst of one of the longest expansions in the nation\u2019s history, and job growth has been strong.Representative Maxine Waters of California, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, led Ms. Yellen through a call-and-response routine that resulted in a list of upbeat indicators.Has business lending by commercial banks expanded?Yes.How many jobs has the economy added?Sixteen million.Have wages increased?\u201cBy most measures,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.But Republicans, early and often, pressed Ms. Yellen to acknowledge that the postcrisis performance of the American economy remained disappointing: Growth has been tepid; labor force participation remains low, productivity growth weak.\u201cDoesn\u2019t this underscore the failure of unconventional policies to deliver the expected results?\u201d Mr. Barr asked.Ms. Yellen said it did not, adding, \u201cMy reading would be that putting in place those policies has enabled us to add 16 million jobs to the U.S. economy.\u201dMs. Yellen did not offer any new information about the Fed\u2019s plans for monetary policy. She said on Tuesday that the Fed still expected to raise rates three times this year. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee will next meet on March 14 and 15.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

His videos, a mix of video-game narration, humorous rants and commentary, have cumulatively been viewed billions of times, and more than 53 million people subscribe to his channel. He has been called \u201cthe king of YouTube\u201d and countless variations thereon, and he has remained unchallenged on that perch for years, making millions of dollars and leveraging his popularity into outside ventures.It\u2019s tempting to write off this scandal as an inscrutable product of a teen subculture, wrapped up in layers of irony and the peculiar language and aesthetics of YouTube. It is likewise easy to frame the episode as an isolated collision between offensive speech and careful sponsors. But it\u2019s most useful to understand Kjellberg\u2019s meltdown in the context of the vast platform on which it took place \u2014 YouTube \u2014 and the nascent strains of politics that could come to define it.With more than a billion users, YouTube has become not merely a platform but almost a kind of internet nation-state: the host of a gigantic economy and a set of cultures governed by a new and novel sort of corporation, sometimes at arm\u2019s length and other times up close. It\u2019s a system Kjellberg has spent recent months antagonizing in a broader and less-inflammatory way, even as he continued to thrive within it. He bemoaned its structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube\u2019s very own populist reactionary.For product reviewers and gamers, for the unboxers and the how-to teachers, for the interchannel drama analysts, the bloggers, the makeup artists and the pranksters, YouTube looms large not just as a context but also as a character. The daily exigencies of life on YouTube are perhaps the only subject that cuts across every major YouTube category. Showbiz loves to make movies about showbiz, and television loves to make television about TV. YouTube has simply democratized this impulse.It makes sense that YouTube would become home to such a performatively self-aware economy. It is, after all, one of the most mature of the major social platforms. It is extremely culturally productive, and can claim genuine stars as its own. Above all, it pays. And in the people who depend on the platform to pay their bills, it inspires a peculiar mixture of paranoia, desire, gratefulness and disdain that shows up clearly in their work. YouTube\u2019s peculiar relationship with the economy within it is fraught, promising and poorly understood. It\u2019s also unique among social-media platforms \u2014 but maybe not for much longer. For now, most of the biggest internet platforms are understood as venues for communication, expression and consumption. YouTube has given us a glimpse at what happens when users start associating social platforms with something more: livelihoods.Watch enough YouTube programming on any subject and you\u2019ll gradually come to understand the struggles of starting and maintaining a channel. You\u2019ll become familiar with the mementos Google sends creators at subscriber milestones \u2014 a silver \u201cplay\u201d button at 100,000, around which time your favorite YouTubers might start talking about quitting their day jobs, and a gold one at a million, when they are more to likely have done so. You\u2019ll hear plenty about conversations with YouTube support, many of which contradict one another. You\u2019ll develop opinions about YouTube\u2019s copyright rules, age restrictions and advertising policies. You\u2019ll get an intuitive sense of the YouTube attention marketplace and how people try to take advantage of it, and you\u2019ll hear about advertising rates. You\u2019ll hear conspiracy theories \u2014 some rooted in daily shared YouTube experience, others rooted in less visible fears, desires and resentments \u2014 some of which gain considerable traction.And why shouldn\u2019t you? YouTubers are not employed by YouTube, but they are paid by YouTube, because it matches their videos, automatically, with advertisers. The platform and the video-makers share a clear and common goal: to persuade audiences to watch more videos in order to make more money from ads. But even with a unifying cause, creators inevitably discover smaller ways in which their goals and YouTube\u2019s are at odds. It is in YouTube creators\u2019 interest, for example, to understand the best practices for getting the most YouTube subscribers, or the best strategies for making videos that YouTube might algorithmically recommend. But it is in YouTube\u2019s interest for the inner workings of its platform \u2014 including recommendation algorithms, the way it calculates advertising rates and the precise locations of its boundaries \u2014 to remain at least somewhat secret, to prevent creators from gaming the platform\u2019s quirks at the expense of either YouTube\u2019s user experience or its bottom line. Criticism from its creators is one of the many things YouTube tolerates to maintain this arrangement, which is otherwise clearly working to their benefit.Emergent politics of social platforms differ in scope and character and sit along peculiar axes, some familiar, others new. On Twitter, which does not pay popular users, they revolve around matters of speech and harassment; the platform hosts a range of progressive movements as well as an extremely visible and openly racist reactionary movement, and they have been at war. On Facebook, which is bigger and less combative, they focus on censorship and governance. But on any major platform, they tend to grow from the same fertile place: the gap between the structures built by the company and what users are allowed to do within them. Inevitably, this leads users to fundamental political questions: Who gets what, and why? Who gets to do what, and why?Here, again, it is helpful to situate Kjellberg properly. He initially rose to popularity within the video-gaming subculture, which, beginning with the \u201cGamerGate\u201d movement and continuing through the American presidential election, became surprisingly and darkly politicized. His core audience is young, and his sensibility clearly appeals to a masculine teenage impulse to shock and provoke. The YouTube platform plainly incentivizes such attention-grabbing behavior, right up until the point that it becomes a liability to its operators or their other partners \u2014 a familiar dilemma in the entertainment world, sure, but one that plays out quite differently on YouTube, which is considerably and deliberately less hands-on with its talent. It\u2019s telling that YouTube\u2019s biggest star portrayed the platform as distant and capricious. It\u2019s alarming that following his performative hostility led him to where it did: attempting to rationalize the use of anti-Semitic speech under the guise of transgression.Maker Studios, which seeks to create a sort of auxiliary production apparatus for YouTube, has less of a connection to the platform than any of the YouTubers it has partnered with, who belong much more to their audiences, and to YouTube. Its severing of ties, in the bigger context of YouTube, amounts to a disavowal. YouTube\u2019s reaction, and how it follows up, is the thing to watch. As, of course, is Kjellberg\u2019s. His most recent video, posted after Maker Studios and Google made their announcements, was a lighthearted play-through of a gag video game called \u201cGenital Jousting,\u201d and did not reference the scandal. His commenters, on the other hand, did, asking almost uniformly that he not apologize for anything.The full character of the burgeoning politics of platforms remains to be seen. But right-wing movements have found early traction and see opportunity. Even as farce, Kjellberg\u2019s performance has been illustrative, and a small number of eager observers say they hope that, as backlash mounts, it will be galvanizing. \u201cIf Pewdiepie wasn\u2019t #AltRight before,\u201d Vox Day, a former video-game designer and an alt-right leader posted on Gab.ai, a private, Twitterlike service popular with the movement, \u201che is now.\u201dJohn Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Trump Agenda Is Moving Slowly: The Republicans\u2019 Wonk Gap", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHeavy LiftingWhen Republicans won in November, it looked as if 2017 would mean a major legislative shift to the right. But two months into the 115th Congress and six weeks into the Trump administration, progress on fulfilling Republicans\u2019 major domestic policy goals is looking further away, not closer.This is partly just the usual slow grinding of legislative gears; don\u2019t forget that it took the Obama administration 14 months to pass its health care overhaul. And it\u2019s partly a result of Democrats in the Senate slowing down confirmation of most of President Trump\u2019s nominees, which leaves less time for legislating.But there\u2019s another element in the sluggish or nonexistent progress on major elements of the Republican agenda. Large portions of the Republican caucus embrace a kind of policy nihilism. They criticize any piece of legislation that doesn\u2019t completely accomplish conservative goals, but don\u2019t build coalitions to devise complex legislation themselves.The roster of congressional Republicans includes lots of passionate ideological voices. It is lighter on the kind of wonkish, compromise-oriented technocrats who move bills.The years of lock-step Republican opposition to President Obama\u2019s agenda are well known, and that opposition is rooted in ideology. But the aversion to doing the messy work of making policy really goes back further than that. Consider what happened in domestic policy after George W. Bush won re-election in 2004.First, Mr. Bush sought to partly privatize Social Security, a plan that went nowhere in a Republican-led Congress. He pushed for comprehensive immigration reform, and conservatives scuttled that. Later, after Democrats won Congress in 2006, a majority of Republican House members voted against the financial rescue bill known as TARP in 2008, even as a president of their own party said it was needed to avert an economic calamity.The last time congressional Republicans have done the major lifting of making domestic policy was Mr. Bush\u2019s first term, a productive time that included an expansion of Medicare to cover prescription drugs, the No Child Left Behind education law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that reshaped securities law and tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.But that\u2019s now a decade and a half ago. Only 51 of the 238 current House Republicans were in Congress then \u2014 meaning a significant majority of Republican House members have never been in Congress at a time when their party was making major domestic policy.He noted that Speaker Paul Ryan has tried to keep some of those governing muscles toned by passing elements of his \u201cBetter Way\u201d agenda, even when they had no shot of being passed by the Senate or signed by President Obama.Having a Republican in the White House may not make things much easier. Many of the newer Republican lawmakers have shown little inclination to follow leaders with more experience in passing complex legislation. In debt ceiling standoffs in 2011 and 2013 \u2014 the latter combined with a government shutdown \u2014 congressional leaders were pushed into confrontation by a base that didn\u2019t want to compromise with President Obama to keep the government running.In 2015, Mr. Boehner called conservative members of his party who sought government shutdowns \u201cfalse prophets\u201d who \u201cwhip people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things they know are never going to happen.\u201dIf you make a career opposing even the basic work of making the government run, it\u2019s hard to pivot to writing major legislation. In the opposition, it\u2019s easy to be strident and pure in your views. Legislative sausage-making requires compromise and flexibility and focus on the gritty details. Some politicians are great at both opposition and actual legislating \u2014 but not many.You\u2019re seeing that dynamic most vividly with the Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal Obamacare. They have spent years assailing the law, but the criticisms have always had a fundamental contradiction. They say the health insurance that people obtain through the law is inadequate and too expensive; they also say that the program involves too much government intervention in the economy.As a rhetorical tool, one can slide from one argument to the next easily. But when it\u2019s time to legislate, it\u2019s hard to deal with both of those issues at once. If you make the program cheaper and more market-based, you\u2019re almost certainly making insurance less comprehensive, leaving fewer Americans well covered.\u201cIn the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like,\u201d Mr. Boehner said at a panel discussion. \u201cNot once.\u201dIf a more conventional Republican were in the White House \u2014 Mitt Romney, say, or John Kasich \u2014 clear leadership on policy details could come from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. A president has the bully pulpit of his office, control over a vast bureaucracy that can help sort through the technical issues around a law, and, normally, a campaign policy agenda that can form a starting point for legislation.But President Trump is even less attuned to policy detail than the typical House Republican. He didn\u2019t campaign on a detailed policy agenda. And he seems to have only recently figured out what a policy morass health care can be. (\u201cNobody knew health care could be so complicated,\u201d he said Monday, to guffaws from anyone who has thought even a bit about health care reform.)None of this means that major legislation won\u2019t happen in coming years. Republicans are united in the desire for tax cuts, and the analysts who handicap these things remain confident that a major tax package will be enacted this year or early in 2018.But it\u2019s hard to carry out a sweeping agenda of shrinking and remaking the federal government when relatively few members of your own party have the inclination to focus on policy details, embrace compromise and accept the inherent trade-offs that come with change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haunted by Student Debt Past Age 50", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe experience of being crushed by student debt is no longer limited to the young. New federal data shows millions of Americans who are retired or nearing retirement face this burden, as well as the possibility of having their Social Security benefits garnished to make payments.Some older borrowers are carrying their own education loans, but most fell into debt helping their children or grandchildren, either by borrowing directly or co-signing loans. As these borrowers age, they have increasing difficulty keeping up loan payments while also paying for food, housing, medication, and dental and medical care.The federal government needs to give priority to people who are struggling to survive over the companies that collect their loan payments. That means ending the practice of seizing the Social Security benefits of poor or disabled student loan debtors.But loan servicing companies, which sometimes cheat borrowers outright, do a terrible job of enrolling people in this program. This deprives older borrowers of information about payment plans that would allow them to meet their loan obligations without skimping on medical or dental care.Still, the government should do more for older borrowers. For starters, it should automatically enroll them in income-based repayment when their accounts become delinquent \u2014 but before they default. Those who have reached default should be enrolled in the rehabilitation plan, which offers affordable payments.Meanwhile, Congress should exempt Social Security income from garnishment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Does Steve Bannon Want?", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionPresident Trump presents a problem to those who look at politics in terms of systematic ideologies. He is either disinclined or unable to lay out his agenda in that way. So perhaps it was inevitable that Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who does have a gift for thinking systematically, would be so often invoked by Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents. They need him not just as a hate object but as a heuristic, too. There may never be a \u201cTrumpism,\u201d and unless one emerges, the closest we may come to understanding this administration is as an expression of \u201cBannonism.\u201dMr. Bannon, 63, has won a reputation for abrasive brilliance at almost every stop in his unorthodox career \u2014 as a naval officer, Goldman Sachs mergers specialist, entertainment-industry financier, documentary screenwriter and director, Breitbart News cyber-agitprop impresario and chief executive of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. One Harvard Business School classmate described him to The Boston Globe as \u201ctop three in intellectual horsepower in our class \u2014 perhaps the smartest.\u201d Benjamin Harnwell of the Institute for Human Dignity, a Catholic organization in Rome, calls him a \u201cwalking bibliography.\u201d Perhaps because Mr. Bannon came late to conservatism, turning his full-time energy to political matters only after the Sept. 11 attacks, he radiates an excitement about it that most of his conservative contemporaries long ago lost.One month into the Trump administration, Mr. Bannon has already made his influence felt. He helped draft the president\u2019s Inaugural Address, acquired a seat on the National Security Council and reportedly was the main force behind the president\u2019s stalled ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Reports that the administration has considered designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization echo Mr. Bannon\u2019s own longtime preoccupation with the group, as both a screenwriter and a talk-radio host.Many accounts of Mr. Bannon paint him as a cartoon villain or internet troll come to life, as a bigot, an anti-Semite, a misogynist, a crypto-fascist. The former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, have even called him a \u201cwhite nationalist.\u201d While he is certainly a hard-line conservative of some kind, the evidence that he is an extremist of a more troubling sort has generally been either massaged, misread or hyped up.Nor does it make Mr. Bannon a fringe character that during the meetings of the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2013 and 2014, he hosted rival panel discussions called the Uninvited \u2014 although it did show a relish for the role of ideological bad boy. Mr. Bannon\u2019s panels included such mainstream figures as the former House speaker Newt Gingrich and the former Bush administration attorney general Michael Mukasey, and discussed such familiar Republican preoccupations as military preparedness and the 2012 attacks on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya. It wasn\u2019t much different from watching Fox News.So some of the roots of Mr. Bannon\u2019s ideology, like the roots of Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity, are to be found in the disappointed hopes of the global economy. But Mr. Bannon, unlike Mr. Trump, has a detailed idea, an explanation, of how American sovereignty was lost, and of what to do about it. It is the same idea that Tea Party activists have: A class of regulators in the government has robbed Americans of their democratic prerogatives. That class now constitutes an \u201cadministrative state\u201d that operates to empower itself and enrich its crony-capitalist allies.When Mr. Bannon spoke on Thursday of \u201cdeconstructing the administrative state,\u201d it may have sounded like gobbledygook outside the hall, but it was an electrifying profession of faith for the attendees. It is through Mr. Bannon that Trumpism can be converted from a set of nostalgic laments and complaints into a program for overhauling the government.Mr. Bannon adds something personal and idiosyncratic to this Tea Party mix. He has a theory of historical cycles that can be considered elegantly simple or dangerously simplistic. It is a model laid out by William Strauss and Neil Howe in two books from the 1990s. Their argument assumes an 80- to 100-year cycle divided into roughly 20-year \u201chighs,\u201d \u201cawakenings,\u201d \u201cunravelings\u201d and \u201ccrises.\u201d The American Revolution, the Civil War, the New Deal, World War II \u2014 Mr. Bannon has said for years that we\u2019re due for another crisis about now. His documentary about the 2008 financial collapse, \u201cGeneration Zero,\u201d released in 2010, uses the Strauss-Howe model to explain what happened, and concludes with Mr. Howe himself saying, \u201cHistory is seasonal, and winter is coming.\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s views reflect a transformation of conservatism over the past decade or so. You can trace this transformation in the films he has made. His 2004 documentary, \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d is an orthodox tribute to the Republican Party hero Ronald Reagan. But \u201cGeneration Zero,\u201d half a decade later, is a strange hybrid. The financial crash has intervened. Mr. Bannon\u2019s film features predictable interviews with think-tank supply siders and free marketers fretting about big government. But new, less orthodox voices creep in, too, from the protectionist newscaster Lou Dobbs to the investment manager Barry Ritholtz. They question whether the free market is altogether free. Mr. Ritholtz says that the outcome of the financial crisis has been \u201csocialism for the wealthy but capitalism for everybody else.\u201dBy 2014, Mr. Bannon\u2019s own ideology had become centered on this distrust. He was saying such things about capitalism himself. \u201cThink about it,\u201d he said in a talk hosted by the Institute for Human Dignity. \u201cNot one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis.\u201d He warned against \u201cthe Ayn Rand or the Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism,\u201d by which he meant \u201ca capitalism that really looks to make people commodities, and to objectify people.\u201d Capitalism, he said, ought to rest on a \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d foundation.If so, this was bad news for the Republican Party. By the time Mr. Bannon spoke, Ayn Rand-style capitalism was all that remained of its Reagan-era agenda. Free-market thinking had swallowed the party whole, and its Judeo-Christian preoccupations \u2014 \u201ca nation with a culture\u201d and \u201ca reason for being\u201d \u2014 along with it. A business orientation was what donors wanted.But voters never more than tolerated it. It was Pat Buchanan who in his 1992 run for president first called on Republicans to value jobs and communities over profits. An argument consumed the party over whether this was a better-rounded vision of society or just the grousing of a reactionary. After a generation, Mr. Buchanan has won that argument. By 2016 his views on trade and migration, once dismissed as crackpot, were spreading so fast that everyone in the party had embraced them \u2014 except its elected officials and its establishment presidential candidates.Mr. Bannon does not often go into detail about what Judeo-Christian culture is, but he knows one thing it is not: Islam. Like most Americans, he believes that Islamism \u2014 the extremist political movement \u2014 is a dangerous adversary. More controversially he holds that, since this political movement is generated within the sphere of Islam, the growth of Islam \u2014 the religion \u2014 is itself a problem with which American authorities should occupy themselves. This is a view that was emphatically repudiated by Presidents Obama and George W. Bush.Mr. Bannon has apparently drawn his own views on the subject from intensive, if not necessarily varied, reading. The thinkers he has engaged with in this area tend to be hot and polemical rather than cool and detached. They include the provocateur Pamela Geller, a campaigner against the \u201cGround Zero Mosque\u201d who once suggested the State Department was \u201cessentially being run by Islamic supremacists\u201d; her sometime collaborator Robert Spencer, the director of the website Jihad Watch, with whom she heads an organization called Stop Islamization of America; and the former Department of Homeland Security official Philip Haney, who has argued that officials in the Obama administration had compromised \u201cthe security of citizens for the ideological rigidity of political correctness.\u201dPresident Trump being unpopular among intellectuals, any thinker in his cabinet will be, at some level, a nonconformist, a rebel or an individualist. That may yet make things interesting for the country. It will certainly make Washington a hostile environment for Mr. Bannon. Many policy intellectuals in the capital have paid a steep price in swallowed misgivings and trimmed convictions to get to the place that Mr. Bannon has somehow blown into town and usurped. He never had to compromise or even modify his principles. His boss didn\u2019t even get a majority of the popular vote. Establishment conservatives may be prone to mistake their jealousy for a principled conviction that Mr. Bannon is unsocialized and dangerous.But Mr. Bannon\u2019s ideology, whatever it may be, does not wholly capture what drives him, says the screenwriter Julia Jones. Starting in the early 1990s, Ms. Jones and Mr. Bannon began writing screenplays together, and did so for a decade and a half. She is one of the few longtime collaborators in his otherwise peripatetic career. As Ms. Jones sees it, a more reliable key to his worldview lies in his military service. \u201cHe has a respect for duty,\u201d she said in early February. \u201cThe word he has used a lot is \u2018dharma.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Bannon found the concept of dharma in the Bhagavad Gita, she recalls. It can describe one\u2019s path in life or one\u2019s place in the universe.When Mr. Bannon came to Hollywood, Ms. Jones says, he was less political. For two years, according to Ms. Jones, the two of them worked on the outline of a 26-part television series about seekers after the secrets of the human self, from Arthur Conan Doyle to Nietzsche to Madame Blavatsky to Ramakrishna to the Baal Shem Tov to Geronimo. \u201cIt was his idea,\u201d she said. \u201cHe assembled all the people.\u201dBut the Sept. 11 attacks, Ms. Jones says, changed him, and their collaboration did not survive his growing engagement with politics. Speaking of his films, she says, \u201cHe developed a kind of propaganda-type tone of voice that I found offensive.\u201d Ms. Jones is a literary person, left-liberal in politics. She regrets that Mr. Bannon \u201chas found a home in nationalism.\u201d But she does not believe he is any kind of anarchist, let alone a racist.Those focused on Mr. Bannon\u2019s ideology are probably barking up the wrong tree. There are plenty of reasons for concern about Mr. Bannon, but they have less to do with where he stands on the issues than with who he is as a person. He is a newcomer to political power and, in fact, relatively new to an interest in politics. He is willing to break with authority. While he does not embrace any of the discredited ideologies of the last century, he is attached to a theory of history\u2019s cycles that is, to put it politely, untested. Most ominously, he is an intellectual in politics excited by grand theories \u2014 a combination that has produced unpredictable results before.We\u2019ll see how it works out. Barack Obama, in a similar way, used to allude to the direction and the \u201carc\u201d of history. Some may find the two theories of history equally na\u00efve and unrealistic. Others may see a mitigating element in the cyclical nature of Mr. Bannon\u2019s view. A progressive who believes history is more or less linear is fighting for immortality when he enters the political arena. A conservative who believes history is cyclical is fighting only for a role in managing, say, the next 20 or 80 years. Then his work will be undone, as everyone\u2019s is eventually.Christopher Caldwell, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, is at work on a book about the rise and fall of the post-1960s political order.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Vowed to Protect the Safety Net. What if His Appointees Disagree?", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two days before Election Day, Donald J. Trump traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, and proclaimed that he was the protector of federal programs aimed at helping elderly and low-income Americans. It was Hillary Clinton, he said, who was an untrustworthy steward of the working class and who would slash vital benefits.\u201cI am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago.\u201d The pledge followed earlier promises to enact a new paid-maternity-leave benefit and not to make cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.When President Trump addresses Congress this Tuesday and follows the speech with a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, his White House will finally address in concrete numbers one of his central contradictions: He campaigned as the populist protector of programs for the working class, yet he has pledged to control the budget deficit, cut spending and cut taxes.Moreover, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with traditional small-government conservatives bent on cutting back or eliminating many of the programs he has championed. Many of his aides and cabinet members have expressed views that are fundamentally opposed to those he campaigned on.The disparity between Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and his appointments has cheered many Republicans and left Democrats fearing that he will not only renege on his promises to protect the government\u2019s largest entitlement programs but that he will also slash programs he did not mention on the campaign trail that offer food, housing and child care support for the poor.\u201cThe appointments that he\u2019s made are troublesome and very, very scary,\u201d Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said. \u201cHe made a pledge and sort of delineated himself from the rest of the Republican field by saying these things. Everything he\u2019s done since he\u2019s been elected is very worrisome.\u201dEven some liberal economists say that will amount to a transfer of funds from poor children and families toward better-off older Americans, because the budget office projects that discretionary spending \u2014 where most programs for poor families come from \u2014 will be squeezed from 6.3 percent of the economy now to 5.3 percent in 2027, the smallest level since 1962.With those numbers on their side, Republicans are most likely to use their power in both the executive and legislative branches to push through large cuts to federal programs for poor and working-class Americans, say Democrats and liberal policy analysts \u2014 if Mr. Trump eases up on his promises.\u201cThis is the greatest threat to low-income people in my lifetime,\u201d said Olivia Golden, executive director of the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit organization focused on low-income Americans.House Republican allies see no real contradiction in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises and what they say he must now do. Since President George W. Bush\u2019s failed 2005 effort to partially privatize Social Security, Republicans have assured retirees and those nearing retirement that any changes or cuts to entitlement programs for older adults would not affect them.Now, Republicans are retroactively applying those caveats to Mr. Trump\u2019s promises, saying the president understands that programs like Social Security and Medicare must be maintained for Americans who are currently receiving benefits but must be changed for younger Americans who may have to work longer before retiring and getting benefits.\u201cIt was really about making sure that those people who are getting benefits or about to get benefits are protected,\u201d said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and a leader of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus. \u201cIf we do nothing, he will not save Medicare and Social Security.\u201dRepresentative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, said he would be closely watching his former Freedom Caucus colleague, Mr. Mulvaney, as he settles in to work at the Office of Management and Budget. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how Mick Mulvaney approaches this from O.M.B. because he is very like-minded with us here,\u201d Mr. Duncan said.In fact, on the campaign trail and in interviews before the election, Mr. Trump did not suggest that he would maintain the programs in their current form only for older Americans. His rallies were attended by a cross-section of ages, who cheered his broad promises. And last March, Mr. Trump said during a debate among Republican presidential candidates that he planned to make no changes.\u201cI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.\u201dThe pressure to break that promise will come not only from congressional Republicans but also from his own campaign pledges to build a wall along the Mexican border, increase spending on defense, border security and infrastructure, cut taxes \u201cbig league\u201d and control the deficit.\u201cThe last time we saw this kind of budgetary logic was at the beginning of the Reagan administration when he came into office, pledged to beef up defense spending and cut taxes,\u201d said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former aide to President Bill Clinton. \u201cThey tried to keep the spending increases down and the deficit increases down by whacking away at social safety net programs, many of which were cut during that period.\u201dEven if Mr. Trump keeps his promise not to touch Social Security and Medicare, other programs like housing subsidies, child care assistance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, could be cut, social welfare and budget analysts say.And those cuts would not just affect poor minority voters, who tend to support Democratic candidates. A study released this month by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities research group shows that white working-age adults without a college degree, a critical voting block for Republicans, benefit the most from social safety net programs and poverty-reducing benefits.\u201cMy fear is that we are going to see the biggest cuts that any president has ever proposed in programs for low- and modest-income families,\u201d said Bob Greenstein, the center\u2019s president. \u201cIt could be the biggest Robin Hood in reverse a president has ever offered.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trudeau, Praising the E.U., Doesn\u2019t Mention \u2018Brexit\u2019 or Trump", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeven years in the making, the deal slashes tariffs on industrial and agricultural products and opens up the services sector in areas like cargo shipping, telecommunications and financial services.Mr. Trudeau indirectly alluded on Thursday to the anxieties that have propelled populist movements, especially immigration, which is a major worry for the British voters who decided to leave the European Union and for the American voters who put Mr. Trump, a political outsider, into the White House.\u201cWe live in a time when some people are worried that the current system only benefits society\u2019s narrow elite,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cAnd their concern is valid. This anxiety towards the economy and trade \u2014 the worry that our kids won\u2019t have access to the same jobs and opportunities that we have \u2014 can be addressed only if we ensure that trade is inclusive, and that everyone benefits.\u201dThe Canada-European Union deal, known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA, \u201cis a terrific example of just that,\u201d he continued.He acknowledged that protectionist forces had placed open economies under tremendous pressure, and he stressed that trade deals must work for ordinary people and help to improve the average person\u2019s standard of living. \u201cIf we are successful, CETA will become the blueprint for all ambitious future trade deals,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are not, this could well be one of the last.\u201dMr. Trudeau\u2019s speech was a notable counterpoint to the rhetoric of Mr. Trump and, to a lesser extent, that of Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, both of whom have questioned the European Union\u2019s relevance and even its long-term future. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s message for the European Union, an alliance that is facing profound, even existential, challenges, seemed intended to bolster its morale.\u201cThe European Union is a truly remarkable achievement and an unprecedented model for peaceful cooperation,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cCanada knows that an effective European voice on the global stage isn\u2019t just preferable \u2014 it\u2019s essential.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe know that the E.U. is the world\u2019s largest donor of development and humanitarian assistance, and that, together, your member states represent one of the world\u2019s largest economies. Not only that, but you are a vital, central player in addressing the challenges that we collectively face as an international community.\u201dMr. Trudeau\u2019s approach stands in sharp contrast to President Trump\u2019s moves to shut out refugees, overturn trade deals and denigrate multilateral organizations, including the European Union and the United Nations. That made Mr. Trudeau a particularly welcome guest.Accompanied into the parliamentary chamber by ushers wearing white bow ties and gloves, Mr. Trudeau spoke partly in French, which is customary for a Canadian leader, but also appeared to underscore his country\u2019s affinity with Europe.Adding that it was an honor to address the chamber, Mr. Trudeau said that Europe and Canada had \u201cbuilt something \u2014 something important \u2014 especially at this moment on your continent and mine,\u201d referring to the trade agreement.The deal still must be approved by national and regional parliaments in Europe, and it could face a number of obstacles during that process. For their part, Canadians were making \u201csteady progress\u201d toward ratification of the deal, Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, the Canadian minister for international trade, said at a news conference on Wednesday.His boss, Mr. Trudeau, said at the news conference: \u201cWe\u2019re in a globalized world, and how we make sure that we are turning that into opportunities for small businesses and our citizens is the challenge of our times.\u201dEarlier, a number of lawmakers took the opportunity of a close brush with Mr. Trudeau to take pictures with their cellphones. Opponents of the trade deal were mostly muted, though at least one sign condemning the pact could be seen as Mr. Trudeau spoke.\u201cJustin Trudeau\u2019s government has been a positive contrast to the attitude of the Trump on CETA administration,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHowever, in continuing the work of his predecessor, Trudeau has shown himself to be more a man of continuity than one looking to disrupt the status quo.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Donald Trump may be a month into his presidency, but his public remarks continue to be laden with the same mischaracterizations, misrepresentations and, yes, lies as his campaign.Mr. Trump\u2019s alternate reality has been on vivid display in venues ranging from an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla., to a gathering of conservatives last week just outside the nation\u2019s capital.\u201cJobs are already starting to pour back in,\u201d he yelled to the crowd in Florida. \u201cObamacare covers very few people,\u201d he insisted in MarylandThe small problem with these \u201cfacts\u201d and so many more in his florid rhetoric is that they are not true.He has extolled, for example, announcements by General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Intel to hire tens of thousands of workers in the United States instead of in Mexico.But each of these companies was already planning to make the employment moves or did them for business reasons unrelated to Mr. Trump.\u201cAll of these decisions,\u201d said Pat Morrissey, a G.M. spokesman, \u201chave been in the works for some time.\u201dThen there are the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, which Mr. Trump contended will create as many as 42,000 jobs.And those are just temporary jobs; the permanent job count at Keystone will be 35.The only jobs that he could legitimately claim to have preserved would be the 800 Carrier jobs in Indiana that were \u201csaved\u201d with the help of $7 million in state subsidies.As for the Affordable Care Act, by every estimate, more than 20 million Americans have received health insurance through it.As for Lockheed Martin and the F-35 fighter jet, which has indeed been a troubled program, the company had already agreed to reduce the cost of each plane as production ramped up.\u201cAll President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue,\u201d said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \u201cHe\u2019s not responsible for the savings; they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene.\u201dIn Melbourne, Mr. Trump also took a victory lap for the rising stock market and the \u201cgreat spirit of optimism\u201d that is \u201csweeping all across the country.\u201d So how does he explain his 43 percent approval rating?To be sure, he\u2019s correct to note that the stock market has been hitting record highs, and various measures of business confidence have also been on the rise.But those positive signals result not from anything Mr. Trump has done to make America Great Again but from a bunch of stuff he\u2019s promising to do to make business great again.You don\u2019t have to be a stock market expert to appreciate that when a president says he\u2019s going to significantly cut business taxes and emasculate regulations that may be limiting profitability, of course stocks are going to go up.Indeed, the sectors that have shot up the most \u2014 including financials, steel, oil services and coal \u2014 are precisely the ones most likely to benefit from Trumponomics.Some investors \u2014 including myself \u2014 wondered whether Mr. Trump\u2019s volatile style would scare the markets more than his planned giveaways to corporate America would buoy them. That verdict is in (at least for now).But both stock market indexes and business confidence have benefited from recent data suggesting that economic growth began accelerating modestly well before Mr. Trump took office.Indicators like retail sales and factory output have been on the rise. Meanwhile, outside the United States, sclerotic Europe has managed to inch its growth rate up close to ours, while key emerging economies like China \u2014 a perennial worry for markets \u2014 seem to be on a sustained upward trajectory.What markets should worry about is whether Mr. Trump will be able to deliver on his overwhelmingly pro-business agenda. If he falls short, look for the stock market to wobble and perhaps swoon.At least in the meantime, however, Mr. Trump is busily trying to take credit for positive signs that were in fact nurtured on Barack Obama\u2019s watch.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

But the trust and confidence underlying the longstanding alliance will be harmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent lack of respect, and his remarks will be very costly in the public domain, they said.Under the terms of the deal, hurriedly worked out by Mr. Turnbull and former President Barack Obama in New York last year, Australia would also accept Central American refugees staying in a Costa Rican detention facility.Australia has been harshly criticized for its offshore detention policy, and the issue is politically delicate at home. Many of the refugees it holds, on the Pacific island-nation of Nauru and on the island of Manus in Papua New Guinea, are from Iran and Iraq. Both countries are among the seven whose citizens are barred from entering the United States for at least 90 days under the executive order Mr. Trump signed on Friday.In his conversation with Mr. Turnbull the next day, Mr. Trump said the deal with Australia was going to hurt him politically, according to a senior official in the Trump administration.The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters in Washington on Thursday that Mr. Trump would allow the deal to proceed as long as the refugees were subjected to \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d Mr. Spicer also said Mr. Trump remained \u201cextremely upset\u201d over the deal arranged by his predecessor.Mr. Turnbull, whose popularity has been sagging over domestic issues, struggled on Thursday to cast the call in a positive light, fending off demands from the opposition Labor Party that he detail exactly what Mr. Trump had said.Even after Mr. Trump made his remarks on Twitter, Mr. Turnbull insisted in a radio interview that he had \u201ca clear commitment from the president\u201d that the resettlement plans would proceed.\u201cThe alliance is absolutely rock solid,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said. \u201cIt is so strong.\u201dThe United States Embassy in Canberra had tried to help Mr. Turnbull with his predicament earlier Thursday, saying the White House had confirmed that the agreement would be honored. But after Mr. Trump wrote about the refugee deal on Twitter, the embassy referred questions about the agreement to the White House.Mr. Turnbull\u2019s Liberal Party is the more conservative of Australia\u2019s two major parties, and it has been a stalwart supporter of close ties with the United States.The Labor Party has leaned slightly more toward China, but as the debate over relations with Washington has intensified in recent months, former leaders of the party have become outspoken critics of the United States and have argued for shifting toward Beijing.Chinese students also contribute substantially to Australian universities and schools, so much so that many of the institutions are dependent on the fees for survival. And under a new trade agreement, Australia is exporting large quantities of wine and meat to China.After Mr. Trump, in office just a few days, scrapped the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 a regional trade pact that the Obama administration had hoped would be an economic counterweight to China \u2014 Mr. Turnbull announced that he would seek to reconstitute the deal without the United States, but possibly including China, another indication of Beijing\u2019s clout.According to the 2016 survey, 45 percent said that Australia should distance itself from the United States if Mr. Trump became president, Mr. Roggeveen said.\u201cWe can assume that number will now rise,\u201d said Mr. Medcalf, of Australian National University. \u201cThis incident will only intensify the damage done by Trump\u2019s abandonment of the T.P.P., which would have been a pillar of strategic partnership as well as of trade.\u201dThe United States operates signals intelligence and radar facilities in remote corners of Australia that are becoming more important as North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat expands, said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\u201cAustralia shares raw and finished intelligence in the closest possible collaboration you can imagine,\u201d Mr. Jennings said. \u201cIt is extremely high tech. It is something no countries can equal, and it is part of what is known as the Five Eyes intelligence operation. It has created the highest possible level of trusted collaboration between the five countries.\u201dThe Five Eyes countries are Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.Mr. Trump visited Australia in 2011, expressing a great liking for the country and entering the fray with China. On Twitter, he called it a \u201cbeautiful country with terrific people who love America.\u201d Then he added that Australia should \u201cscrew\u201d China by raising its commodity prices.James Goldrick, a former rear admiral in the Australian Navy who served in Afghanistan, said that if Mr. Trump\u2019s current abrasive attitude continued, it would probably make Australia a less publicly cooperative partner of the United States.\u201cIf the Trump administration pursues a less consultative approach, Australia will need to become more public in expressing its opinion on American initiatives that it does not wholly support,\u201d Mr. Goldrick said.China\u2019s role in Asia and North Korea\u2019s nuclear efforts are far more important to the United States-Australia alliance than any one telephone call, said Peter Hayes, an Australian who is the director of the Nautilus Institute, a California-based research institute on security issues. But Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cability to create chaos\u201d has placed those important strategic questions under a \u201cdark cloud,\u201d he said.\u201cThe United States has invested five decades in creating that system of alliances, and it is evident Trump is pretty ignorant of it and doesn\u2019t care about it, to the extent he knows about it,\u201d Mr. Hayes said.Michelle Innis and Jacqueline Williams contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia, and Ryan McMorrow from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Northern Ireland and the Disunited Kingdom", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBELFAST, Northern Ireland \u2014 The most striking thing about Ireland\u2019s only land border is its absence. No posts or fences mark its circuitous 310-mile length. There is neither razor wire nor checkpoints.When, a couple of years ago, I often took a rickety bus from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland, I would occasionally pass the time by trying to figure out if we had crossed the invisible line based on when my cellphone switched providers. I was seldom certain. The hedgerows and fields, the fog-capped hills, look the same on either side.Now, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, the border has returned to Irish politics. When Britain leaves the European Union, which is expected to happen some time before the summer of 2019, the undulating border counties will become a European Union frontier, raising the prospect of dislocation, violence and political disintegration in Ireland \u2014 and in Britain.Under Northern Ireland\u2019s complex power-sharing system, the government cannot function if the two largest parties refuse to take part. But since the Brexit referendum, relations between the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein have deteriorated so badly that many doubt the two parties can return to their mandatory coalition after the March 2 vote. Even more troubling, Brexit undermines the fundamental premise on which the Northern Irish peace process rests: respect for diversity. Despite the wishes of its electorate, Northern Ireland will be leaving the European Union on the same terms as the rest of Britain.This is not just a democratic deficit. Economically, Northern Ireland, the poorest region in Britain, has become increasingly integrated with the Republic of Ireland. Cross-border trade, particularly in agriculture, has grown steadily. A single energy market was one of the first tangible fruits of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended 30 years of sectarian violence.In the almost two decades since, Northern Ireland has quietly slipped from Britain\u2019s national consciousness. The seemingly endless television reports of bombings and killings have been replaced by silence. The Conservatives, in particular, have little affection for what Winston Churchill called \u201cthe dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone.\u201dChurchill\u2019s distant successor, Prime Minister Theresa May, spent the second half of last year promising \u201cno return to the borders of the past.\u201d Now Ms. May says that the Irish border will be as \u201cfluid\u201d and \u201cfriction-free\u201d as possible. What this means in practice is anyone\u2019s guess: James Brokenshire, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, is reputed to placate queries about the border by saying, \u201cMs. May is aware of your concerns.\u201dAwareness alone will not, however, solve the border problem \u2014 or the broader problems. Some 300 roads cross this border, some winding from one jurisdiction to another multiple times in short stretches. Customs posts and border checks would be both vertiginously expensive and an attractive target for emboldened Irish republicans opposed to the peace process.A solution could \u2014 in theory \u2014 be possible. Ireland is not part of the European free-travel zone set up by the Schengen Agreement and, as the British government has repeatedly pointed out, an island-wide common travel area predates the European project. Such an accommodation for Northern Ireland, however, would require Brussels\u2019 imprimatur \u2014 something Ms. May seems unwilling to even ask for.Northern Ireland\u2019s economy, so precarious that it requires an annual transfer of around 10 billion pounds a year from Westminster, will be badly hit by a hard border. Under current arrangements, Northern Ireland will receive around 600 million euros annually from the European Union until 2020. After that? Nobody knows.The tyranny-of-the-majority logic inherent in Brexit also risks destabilizing Northern Ireland\u2019s demographic balance. When the newly partitioned state was founded in 1921, two-thirds of the population was Protestant. Today almost half the people in Northern Ireland are Roman Catholic.Brexit was sold as a chance for Britain to recover former glories. It could yet precipitate the end of the last vestige of the empire: the United Kingdom itself.Many moderate Irish nationalists have been content to support the union underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. But will they be so acquiescent when faced with a hard border in Ireland, and a Little Englander political culture in Westminster? Even some liberal Northern Irish unionists balk at the hard-line rhetoric from London.The Scots \u2014 who overwhelmingly voted to stay in the European Union \u2014 are pushing for a new referendum on independence from Britain. A poll on Irish unity is unlikely in the short term, but seems inevitable, too. All of which raises the question of whether the British government actually cares that much about the union anymore.The United Kingdom was always a pragmatic enterprise, a bargain between more-or-less willing participants for commercial and military gain. Imperial spoils held Welsh, Scottish, English and Northern Irish together for centuries. Those bonds are quickly deteriorating. The fracturing of British politics along national lines \u2014 the Conservatives hold just a single seat in Parliament from Scotland or Northern Ireland \u2014 only adds to the sense of a listing, disunited kingdom.Ms. May says that Britain will \u201cmake a success\u201d of Brexit. On the Irish border, such Pollyanna visions meet cold, hard reality. Without a radical change in course, the British prime minister might end up leading her country out of not one union, but two.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Irrational\u2019 Coal Plants May Hamper China\u2019s Climate Change Efforts", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYINING, China \u2014 When scientists and environmental scholars scan the grim industrial landscape of China, a certain coal plant near the rugged Kazakhstan border stands out.On the outside, it looks like any other modern energy plant \u2014 shiny metal towers loom over the grassy grounds, and workers in hard hats stroll the campus. But in those towers, a rare and contentious process is underway, spewing an alarming amount of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas accelerating climate change.The plant and others like it undermine China\u2019s aim of being a global leader on efforts to limit climate change.\u201cIt is extremely irrational to develop coal-to-gas technology,\u201d Li Junfeng, a climate change and energy adviser to the government, wrote in 2015 in China Energy News, a publication managed by People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper. He added that coal-to-gas was \u201cunfit to become a national strategy.\u201dDespite such denunciations and a continuing policy debate, at least four such plants have begun operating in China in the past four years, pushed by local governments and state-owned enterprises in coal-rich regions. Dozens more have been under consideration.No other country is considering building coal-to-gas plants on this scale.The technology\u2019s emerging use reveals the challenges China faces in reducing coal\u2019s central role in the economy, particularly in the north, which has some of the world\u2019s largest coal deposits.Under the Obama administration, United States officials working on climate change tracked China\u2019s use of this technology and expressed concern to Chinese counterparts, including the environmental protection minister, Chen Jining. That will most likely change under President Trump, who has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and threatened to renounce the Paris agreement, a global accord to limit carbon emissions.In January, President Xi Jinping said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that all countries should remain committed to the Paris agreement because \u201cthis is a responsibility we must shoulder for the sake of our future generations.\u201dThe Chinese government is trying to rein in local officials and companies in northern China that undermine central policy when acting out of economic self-interest. Too often, the actions of local governments contradict attempts by central policy makers to wean Chinese industries off coal and move toward a less carbon-heavy economy.\u201cWith the economy and market conditions, we really don\u2019t think this is a good choice,\u201d said Gan Yiwei, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia, based in Beijing, who has researched coal-to-gas plants.The plant here in the frontier region of Xinjiang is a pioneer effort by coal proponents. It was opened by a local subsidiary of the China Kingho Energy Group, the country\u2019s largest private coal mining company, and is outside the city of Yining, whose population is a mix of ethnic Han, Uighur, Kazakh and other groups.In 2013, Kingho opened the coal-to-gas plant as a pilot project closely watched by central-level officials. Xinjiang has the largest coal reserves in China. The same year, a similar pilot project opened in Inner Mongolia, another region brimming with coal.After the market for coal slumped in 2012, local governments in northern China desperately began looking for new uses for it. Officials turned to two industries in which coal is converted to other material: coal-to-gas and coal-to-chemicals. Officials have expanded both industries across northern China, despite their detrimental environmental impact.Two Duke University researchers published an essay in 2013 recommending that Chinese officials cancel the coal-to-gas programs. Some central government officials understood that there were risks to adopting these technologies. The National Development and Reform Commission, the government\u2019s economic planning agency, held a forum in January 2014 for experts to discuss the effects of coal-to-gas on climate change. There have been no public reports on the conference.Around the same time, China\u2019s National Energy Administration banned the construction of any coal-to-gas plants that would produce less than two billion cubic meters of gas per year.So while central government officials take a cautious approach to the industry, they are still allowing it to grow. Last year, a coal-to-gas plant opened in Henan Province, the first in the east. Also in 2016, the Ministry of Environmental Protection approved three new plants. And at least three existing plants are expanding.Kingho signed an agreement last October to push ahead with a \u201cPhase 2\u201d expansion of the Yining plant.Kingho declined an interview request and did not agree to take me on a tour. On a Saturday, I walked onto the grounds, after a guard in a black uniform at the main gate asked me to sign a visitors\u2019 logbook. The roads were wide and quiet, and a few workers in uniforms rode around on electric scooters.The plant is far from China\u2019s largest population centers. Across the northwest, companies would have to build and operate long pipelines to get gas to cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Yet local governments and state-owned enterprises justify construction of the plants by saying they will eventually supply gas to eastern China.The idea of transporting gas from the west aligns with pollution control policies announced in 2013. That year, after a rise in public anger over air pollution, the government said officials in populous parts of eastern China had to limit coal use, which meant those officials would have to look for other energy sources, including gas.State-owned energy companies label coal-to-gas plants as \u201cclean energy\u201d or \u201cnew energy,\u201d despite their high levels of carbon dioxide emissions. In his 2015 article, Mr. Li said that carbon dioxide emissions from coal-to-gas were 270 percent greater than natural gas from traditional sources.\u201cThey do not reduce emissions,\u201d said Lin Boqiang, the director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University. \u201cThey only shift emissions elsewhere. Actually, they increase emissions.\u201dAnother climate researcher, Jiang Kejun, said that if China adopted coal-to-gas on a larger scale in five to 10 years, then officials would have to find a way to get companies to use carbon capture technology to limit the effect of the emissions.Since coal-to-gas plants are expensive to operate, market forces may end up dampening their popularity, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s very risky, and there is no clear future,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I believe enterprises themselves will be very cautious.\u201dAntipollution regulations, if properly enforced by officials, could also bring the projects to a halt. The Yili Xintian Coal Chemical Company has been trying to open a new coal-to-gas plant here in Yining, but local environmental protection officials told the company to stop in 2015. They said the plant could pollute the Yili River, an important water source.In February 2016, the company rewrote the project report, arguing that the plant would be environmentally friendly. Despite objections from local residents during the public comment period, the Ministry of Environmental Protection approved the plant in December.China has forged recent agreements with Russia and Central Asian nations to buy natural gas. Pipelines running across the Asian heartland transport the gas through Xinjiang to eastern China.Those pipelines also damage the environment and cultural sites, but some scholars say they have greater concerns over the use of coal-to-gas.\u201cThe development of coal-to-gas technology,\u201d Mr. Li wrote, \u201cwill actually bring a relatively large negative influence to the already fragile local ecological environment.\u201dVanessa Piao and Karoline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

(The brand will not show its spring/summer 2017 collection in Paris on March 5 as planned.) Here, T rounds up 10 highlights from his time at the helm.Tisci cast his transgender Brazilian-born personal assistant and fit model, Leandra Medeiros Cerezo, in Givenchy\u2019s fall/winter 2010 campaign, introducing her to the fashion world; she dubbed herself Lea T, the \u201cT\u201d standing for \u201cTisci\u201d because she felt a part of the designer\u2019s family. Tisci continued to promote Lea T as the face of Givenchy, and they paved the way for what most might consider to be nonconventional models. (She has also thrived outside the walls of the French fashion house, becoming the first transgender face of Redken and even appearing on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show.\u201d) Tisci championed untraditional ideas of beauty across the board \u2014 booking the albino model Stephen Thompson and countless androgynous talents. A Givenchy catwalk meant dramatic transformations. In earlier years, that took the form of sticker-like mustaches (fall 2006 couture) and bleached eyebrows (spring 2007 couture). For fall 2015, he played with elaborate facial jewelry and baby hairs, and the following season, he sent models down the runway with feathers, pearls and gems (above) affixed to their faces. It\u2019s no coincidence that the term \u201cathleisure\u201d began to take root in fashion circles around 2014: That was the year Tisci began what would become a multiseason collaboration with Nike, starting with a much-hyped revamp of its iconic Air Force 1 sneaker that spring. Since then, he\u2019s lent his spin to models including the Dunk and Zoom Legend \u2014 and created a vivid collection of workout wear, too (above), pegged to last year\u2019s Olympics in Rio. Tisci has long been interested in \u2014 and inspired by \u2014 streetwear, turning out T-shirts and sweatshirts alongside highly tailored pieces and gowns since the early 2010s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Said the Unemployment Rate Wasn\u2019t Real. Here Are Some Other Options.", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJobs ReportThere was even some welcome progress in the number of people who count themselves as part of the labor force.There is certainly a filament of truth in that. The unemployment rate counts only people who say they want a job and have looked for one in the last month \u2014 meaning that millions of Americans who dropped out of the labor force during the aftermath of the 2008 recession do not count as unemployed by the standard definition.So if the White House wants to choose a different measure of job market health to emphasize on the first Friday of every month, we\u2019re all ears. The nice thing about a convention is you can change it. Here, in fact, is a menu of labor market measures that might be plausible alternatives to the main number \u2014 and why the Trump administration may, or may not, want the world to watch it.There are some problems with that measure. It includes people who are not working and who have no desire whatsoever to do so. It includes 17 year-old high school students, 80-year-old retirees, disabled adults and parents who voluntarily stay home with their children. Moreover, if Mr. Trump wants to focus on this measure, he may not be pleased with the results. Because the baby boom generation is hitting retirement age and voluntarily stepping out of the labor force, this measure of non-employment is likely to rise in the years ahead.What isn\u2019t subjective is compensation. And data on average hourly earnings helps convey not just whether people are getting raises for existing jobs, but also whether the composition of jobs in the economy is shifting toward higher pay. Average hourly earnings for all private sector employees was $26 in January, and for nonmanagerial private sector employees it was $21.84.An economy in which those numbers rise significantly faster than inflation is an economy in which working-class people are feeling better about the world and are seeing greater rewards for their labor.There are plenty more options for the Trump administration to consider as job market measures to emphasize. Unemployment in the construction sector (currently 9.4 percent)? The jobless rate among people who didn\u2019t go to college (currently 5.8 percent)? The options are nearly endless.But \u2014 and this is important \u2014 if the president wants to set a different measure of the job market for his administration to focus on and improve, it would be best if he could let us know what it is now, so that we can really assess whether things are getting better or worse during his presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Connecting Trump\u2019s Dots", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery day, the president\u2019s behavior becomes more worrying. One day he demeans a federal judge who challenges him; the next day, without evidence, he accuses the media of hiding illegal voting or acts of terrorism. His lack of respect for institutions and truth pours out so fast, you start to forget how crazy this behavior is for any adult, let alone a president, and just how ugly things will get when we have a real crisis. And crises are baked into this story because of the incoherence of President Trump\u2019s worldview.How so? The world today is more interdependent than ever. The globalization of markets, the spread of cellphones, the accelerations in technology and biology, the new mass movements of migrants and the disruptions in the climate are all intertwined and impacting one another. As a result, we need a president who can connect all of these dots and navigate a path that gets the most out of them and cushions the worst.But Trump is a dot exploiter, not connector. He made a series of reckless, unconnected promises, not much longer than tweets, to get elected, and now he\u2019s just checking off each one, without thinking through the linkages among them or anticipating second-order effects.It is a great way to make America weak \u2014 and overstretched \u2014 again.Where do I start? Trump wants to get tougher with China on trade and security. That\u2019s not crazy. But how would I do that? I\u2019d organize an alliance of Pacific trading nations that surround China and enlist them in a trade pact that supports U.S.-style rule of law, greater market access for U.S. intellectual property and products and promotes U.S. values \u2014 as opposed to China\u2019s. I\u2019d call it the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP for short.Oh wait, President Barack Obama did that, but Trump scrapped TPP on Day 1, without, I am sure, having read it. Now there is every reason to believe our Asian-Pacific allies will fall even more under China\u2019s economic sway and trade \u201crules.\u201d How smart is that?Instead, Trump is building a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants and force companies to move to the U.S. Let\u2019s see \u2026 what happened after 9/11, when the border crossings with Mexico and Canada were severely constricted for security? It forced some assembly line shutdowns at U.S. auto companies, like Ford, because their supply chains stretched to Mexico and Canada. The lower-cost work is done in Mexico and then integrated with higher-value-added work in America, which enables our car companies to compete on price in Europe, Japan and China.So what did the U.S., Canada and Mexico do after 9/11? They created a North American security envelope, explained Seth Stodder, Obama\u2019s assistant secretary of homeland security, so if you fly into Mexico or Toronto from the Middle East, our Homeland Security Department now probably knows about it.\u201cSince 9/11, we and our Mexican and Canadian partners have worked to secure the North American perimeter by sharing information on people and goods coming to our countries, cross-referencing that information against terrorism databases and working collaboratively to identify potential bad actors trying to come to North America,\u201d Stodder said. If we build a wall and demand that Mexico pay for it, how long will it go on cooperating with us?And if Trump forces all these U.S.-based multinationals to move operations from Mexico back to the U.S., what will that do? Help tank the Mexican economy so more Mexicans will try to come north, and raise the costs for U.S. manufacturers. What will they do? Move their factories to the U.S. but replace as many humans as possible with robots to contain costs.The U.N. says there\u2019s a record 65 million displaced migrants and refugees, mostly from the developing world, trying to get into secure places like the U.S. or Europe. Why? A mix of civil wars, state failures, climate stresses and population explosions. What did Trump do his first week? Appoint climate deniers to key posts and ban U.S. aid to health groups that provide abortion as a family-planning option in developing nations.Trump wants to partner with Vladimir Putin to defeat ISIS in Syria \u2014 a worthy goal. But Putin hasn\u2019t been trying to defeat ISIS. He\u2019s been trying to defeat democracy in Syria to keep the genocidal pro-Russian dictator there in power.Will that be our goal, too? And who are Putin\u2019s allies in Syria? Iran, Hezbollah and Shiite mercenaries from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Will they be our allies, too? No. We will enlist Iraqi and Syrian Sunnis to help us, says Trump. Really? But he just barred them from entering the U.S. How cooperative will they be?And whom else might this ban keep out? Remember Steve Jobs? His biological father was Abdulfattah \u201cJohn\u201d Jandali. He came to America as a student in the 1950s and studied at the University of Wisconsin. He was from \u2026 Homs, Syria.It\u2019s amazing what a mess you can make when you only check boxes and don\u2019t link them.Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}

With three million weekly listeners, \u201cCoast to Coast,\u201d which is broadcast every night from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. Eastern time, is carried by more than 600 radio stations in North America and is by far the most popular overnight radio program in the country, according to information from Nielsen.\u201cMost of the folks during the daytime will generally take whatever is handed to them,\u201d Mr. Noory said.Not his listeners.\u201cSkepticism in my view is very healthy,\u201d said Mr. Noory, who considers himself a libertarian. \u201cI think everybody needs to be skeptical about just about everything, until they have either done their own homework, done their own research or accepted information from sources that they trust, like The New York Times, or like The Wall Street Journal, or like Matt Drudge, if they trust him, as well.\u201dMr. Noory worked in television news for 34 years, as a reporter, a producer and an executive at stations in Detroit, Minneapolis and St. Louis. But his interest in unexplained phenomena developed early. He has said many times that he had an out-of-body experience when he was 11, and described the episode again in a recent interview.\u201cI was bouncing up on the ceiling looking down on my body,\u201d he said.\u201cCoast to Coast\u201d began in 1984 as a talk radio program broadcasting from the Las Vegas station KDWN. Mr. Bell, its founder and first host, had originally been a D.J. He switched his focus to talk radio at a time when music listeners began to favor higher-fidelity FM stations, forcing many AM channels to switch formats. When \u201cCoast to Coast\u201d went national, in 1992, he started to receive calls from listeners about their paranormal experiences. Those calls soon became the show\u2019s trademark.\u201cArt was a little more, if he thought you were loo-la, he would tell you,\u201d said Veronica Costin, who started tuning in during the 1990s.

Let\u2019s just say the DNA on Bigfoot is half-human. Does he have a soul?

They dictate things to you and the way you see the world, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not.\u201dEach episode of \u201cCoast to Coast\u201d begins with a news segment, but when asked if he saw himself as a journalist, Mr. Noory responded that he was \u201ca facilitator of the truth, wherever that takes us.\u201dTo uphold the appearance of impartiality, Mr. Noory said, he has abstained from voting since joining \u201cCoast to Coast.\u201d \u201cI want to be able to go on the air and say, \u2018Folks, I don\u2019t have a favorite here,\u2019\u201d he said. But that doesn\u2019t prevent him from making projections.Mr. Noory said in a recent phone interview that he had noticed a significant change in his audience, and in the general population, over the last 15 years.\u201cI have never seen a time period where more people are upset, concerned, scared, ticked off, about so many things,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why Donald Trump got elected.

{"Headline": "Video Review: Nissan Sentra Nismo Offers Affordable Spunk, but Underwhelms", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenYou know what FOMO is, right? As defined by the Oxford English Dictionary \u2014 yes, it is in that dictionary \u2014 it is the Fear of Missing Out, angst that something exciting is happening and you are excluded. In other words, it is my social life.Nismo is something else altogether. It stands for Nissan Motorsports, Nissan\u2019s in-house tuning and performance division. Nismo is sort of what AMG is to Mercedes or M to BMW. For decades, the engineering group at Nissan has done things like prep cars to win multiple titles at 24 Hours of Daytonas, among many other trophies. Put simply, it has cred.If a petite spoiler on your Altima causes you anguish (usually brought on by watching \u201cFast and Furious\u201d movies), Nismo can set you straight with a giant wing. And now you can saunter down to a Nissan dealership and buy a Sentra Nismo. Yes, the whole car.In a nutshell, Sentra Nismo begins with the peppy Sentra SR Turbo sedan, then adds a functional aerodynamics package, suspension tuning and a stiffer structure courtesy of a reinforced floor and rear shelf. There is also some faux anodized aluminum and carbon fiber trim in the cockpit along with some deeply bolstered front chairs. Skinny pilots will love them. Larger drivers? Could be FOMO time.There\u2019s no power upgrade to the 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. Right feet get 188 horsepower and 177 pound-feet of torque to play with. Choose between a six-speed manual and the transmission I drove \u2014 a continuously variable unit with simulated manual shifting on the console. No paddle shifters? In a Nismo car?I\u2019ll estimate the 0-60 sprint happens in 7 seconds. The closest competitors, the Ford Fiesta ST and Volkswagen GTI, will win that drag race by a tick or two. At 5,000 r.p.m. there\u2019s a distinct whistle from the turbo. When it comes to stopping, the decent brakes are also unchanged from the SR Turbo.That tuned suspension keeps body movements buttoned down while keeping the Nismo more comfortable than one might expect. Of course, low-profile tires on upgraded 18-inch wheels let sharp bumps right on through. Torque steer, a tugging of the steering wheel under hard acceleration that powerful front-drive cars exhibit, is well controlled. The right amount of road and engine noise is allowed into the cockpit, leaving it fine for daily driving. The motor note is on the tame side.The Nismo\u2019s performance tires cling tenaciously during hard cornering, but the hot Sentra lacks the joy found in a Fiesta GT or GTI when carving curves. The Ford and VW (both with brake torque vectoring) practically beg drivers to charge aggressively into a bend. The Nissan (without it) facilitates the maneuver but doesn\u2019t actively encourage it.The continuously variable transmission is a no-cost option that Nissan thinks 60 percent of buyers will grab. Without driving the manual, I have to believe that rowing your own car is far more entertaining to the enthusiasts Nismo is geared toward. Comparing the Nismo\u2019s variable transmission with the GTI\u2019s dual-clutch automatic is like bringing a butter knife to a chain-saw fight. VW\u2019s transmission has soul-satisfying rapid-fire action. The Nissan\u2019s \u201cshift\u201d dynamic remains slightly rubbery, even though it is revised for Nismo.On specified premium gas, the E.P.A. rates fuel economy of both transmissions at an average of 27 miles per gallon. That\u2019s about the same as GTI and thirstier than Fiesta ST, both of which run on standard fuel.The cabin is simple, with little to distract the driver. If it looks built to a price point, low cost is a prime mission for Sentra. Nismo owners will miss out on auto climate control and a sunroof. The only major option available is a $1,220 premium package that adds a serviceable Bose sound system and navigation to a larger 5.8-inch LCD screen.All Sentras have a fairly roomy back seat. Keep it to two average adults and complaints will be limited to the lack of a rear power port and motion sickness after a hard road romp. The trunk is enormous, holding more than some small crossovers.At $27,075 as tested, the Sentra Nismo is affordable. Comparably equipped, an extra two to three thousand dollars buys the legendary-for-a-reason GTI. For $3,000 less there\u2019s the smaller Fiesta ST or Nissan\u2019s own Sentra SR Turbo with the same motor and brakes. And don\u2019t forget the Honda Civic Hatchback Sport, which delivers refinement and spunk for just $22,000.Sentra Nismo offers an affordable way to play in the street, but serious pilots will want more Nismo attitude. Few dedicated asphalt jockeys will be missing out here.Advertisement"}

Putin would have no reason to stop supporting separatists in Eastern Ukraine, and Russian aggression could spread through Eastern Europe and beyond.President Trump\u2019s attitude toward Moscow has been one of the major questions during his campaign and his first days in office. What little is known of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone conversations with Mr. Putin and Mr. Poroshenko offers little enlightenment; nor is it fully clear what Michael Flynn said to the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, that cost Mr. Flynn his job as national security adviser.In the heat of the furor over Mr. Flynn, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, declared on Tuesday that Mr. Trump has made it clear he expects Russia to \u201cde-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea.\u201d Mr. Trump, he said, \u201chas been incredibly tough on Russia.\u201dWhat that really means, however, is evidently not entirely clear in Moscow or Kiev, and the Kremlin, for one, has wasted no time in testing his resolve.The question now is what the Trump people intend to do.Mr. Poroshenko seemed to take comfort from the fact that Mr. Trump referred to Russia\u2019s takeover of Crimea as \u201cillegal annexation.\u201dIn meetings around Kiev last week, Ukrainian politicians, activists and foreign businesspeople argued forcefully that Ukraine has moved forward since the Maidan protests of 2013-14 drove out the Russia-friendly and outrageously corrupt government of Viktor Yanukovych, followed by Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.The economy grew a smidgen last year; several anticorruption agencies have made small but significant advances, including a requirement for all top officials to declare their assets; and an all-volunteer army is finally holding its own, even if the separatists have access to more modern Russian arms. Most significantly, public opinion polls show that Russian aggression is fostering exactly what the Russians deny \u2014 a Ukrainian national identity, even among Russian-speaking Ukrainians who bridle at Russia\u2019s actions.The progress, Ukrainian officials acknowledge, is insufficient. The war on corruption still collides with the \u201cspecial interests\u201d of oligarchs, and 2.2 percent economic growth last year is a fraction of what the economy lost in the post-Maidan disruptions. Above all, the \u201cwar\u201d \u2014 as everyone here refers to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine \u2014 is a huge obstacle to foreign investment.

{"Headline": "China Names Guo Shuqing, a Rapid-Fire Regulator, to Oversee Troubled Banks", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As a top stock market regulator, Guo Shuqing cemented a reputation as an economic reformer who tried to bring market-oriented changes to China\u2019s fraud-ridden and heavily politicized financial system.Now Mr. Guo has returned to Beijing to tackle an even bigger problem: the murky, debt-laden Chinese banking system.On Friday the state news media said that he was named chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, succeeding Shang Fulin, who had reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. The Chinese commercial news media widely reported and filmed Mr. Guo\u2019s arrival at that agency on Friday morning, where he was greeted by Mr. Shang.Mr. Guo\u2019s appointment offers a sign that China is taking a financial overhaul seriously, though it was made among other moves that could send mixed signals about that commitment. The stakes are high: Experts widely believe that China\u2019s weak financial system is holding back its economy, the world\u2019s second largest.Yet other appointments suggested a commitment to the status quo. The state news media on Friday said the No. 2 officials at the National Development and Reform Commission, China\u2019s top economic planning body, and the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees trade, among other things, were named to succeed their retiring bosses, who were also 65.The choice to run the National Development and Reform Commission, He Lifeng, served from 2009 to 2012 as the deputy secretary of Tianjin. He helped oversee the construction of a forest of office and residential skyscrapers at the city\u2019s fringes that have barely been occupied and have become one of the many symbols of China\u2019s dependence on investment-led growth that is often wasteful.China could signal its commitment to a financial overhaul with any changes at the top of its central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China. Zhou Xiaochuan, widely considered a reformist voice in China, is more than two years past retirement age, so predicting his departure has become a popular parlor game in China\u2019s financial world. Appointing Yi Gang, Mr. Zhou\u2019s deputy, to the top could be seen as an endorsement of Mr. Zhou\u2019s gentle advocacy of reform, though elevating Mr. Yi could also reflect Beijing\u2019s lack of interest in rocking the boat.The shuffle comes at a delicate time for China\u2019s financial leadership. Its competence was called into question in 2015, when conflicting signals contributed to a stock market crash and increased government controls. Experts say either the banking commission or the central bank could get added responsibilities should China try to streamline financial regulation.Mr. Guo faces an immediate challenge in reasserting the authority of the banking commission, also known as the C.B.R.C. Like the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Chinese central bank has clawed away from banking regulators a considerable part of their authority to oversee whether banks are lending prudently. The Chinese central bank has also played an increasingly critical role in fighting money laundering and capital flight.China could tip its hand on that matter after the annual gathering of the National People\u2019s Congress, its top lawmaking body, which begins March 5. It may then hold a top-level financial work conference in April on reorganization that was originally planned for January or February.Some experts viewed the recall of Mr. Guo to Beijing as a sign that policy changes are coming. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a signal for fundamental reforms in China\u2019s financial regulatory framework,\u201d said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.In a country where officials tend to either have political experience in running provinces, or economic and financial experience in working at regulatory agencies and state-controlled banks in Beijing, Mr. Guo is a rare example of someone who has done both. He served as a deputy governor of impoverished Guizhou Province in the late 1990s, then as director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. He then became the chairman of the China Construction Bank, one of China\u2019s four main banks, from 2005.He took the top job at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top stock market regulator, in late 2011, unleashing a fury of reform efforts in just 17 months. Then just as quickly, he was gone, sent south to coastal Shandong Province as the acting governor.Rather than a setback to his career, it was another way to develop his economic and political chops. Within months, he rose to become the governor of Shandong Province, helping clean up the financial sector there.Political analysts had said that Mr. Guo might stay in Shandong and be promoted to Communist Party secretary, the top job, above even the governor.Previous party secretaries of Shandong, a large and economically important province, have sometimes joined the Politburo, a top Communist Party leadership group, and gone on to become vice premiers with broad economic powers. Vice premiers are much more important in China than the governor of the central bank, because the central bank has no political independence in China and answers to the cabinet.Time may be running out for Mr. Guo, who will turn 61 this year. The ministers who run the central bank and the main regulatory commissions typically retire at 65, making it harder for Mr. Guo to do a stint at the banking commission and then move on to another senior position.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Compost King of New York", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "FeatureWhat happens to food scraps after the city takes them? Soon a large fraction will wind up on Long Island, where Charles Vigliotti hopes to turn them into profit.Supported byThis resource, Vigliotti knew, had a lot going for it. Like oil and coal, kitchen scraps can be converted into energy. But unlike oil and coal, which are expensive to dig out of the ground, food waste is something that cities will actually pay someone to haul away. Many innovative municipalities, in an effort to keep organic material out of dumps \u2014 where it generates methane, a greenhouse gas \u2014 already separate food from garbage and send it to old-fashioned compost facilities. There, workers pile the waste in linear heaps called windrows, mix it with leaves and grass clippings and let oxygen-dependent microbes transform the gunk into lovely dark fertilizer. But the more material you compost, the more space (and gas-guzzling bulldozers and windrow turners) you need to process it. It can get a little smelly, too, which is yet another reason New York City, which generates about one million tons of organic waste a year, will probably never host giant compost farms.But anaerobic digestion, in which food is broken down by microbes inside tall, airtight silos, has a real shot at scaling near densely populated areas. The footprint of such plants is relatively small, and their odors are mechanically contained, if they are operated properly. Digesters do cost more to build and run than compost sites, but they more than make up for that by generating two separate revenue streams: fertilizer and biogas, which is chemically similar to natural gas and can be burned to make heat and electricity.To hear Vigliotti explain it, the supply of feedstock for his anaerobic digester was unending, a veritable geyser of potential profit flowing from every part of the food chain: orphaned produce from wholesale markets, the crusty remains of all-you-can-eat buffets, fryer oil, kitchen grease and gloopy residential plate scrapings. All of this was simply waiting to be tapped by someone with the chutzpah and the capital to convert it into a product \u2014 renewable energy \u2014 for which there is unending demand. Vigliotti\u2019s only real cost, not inconsiderable, was refining. And lawyers. \u201cWe face a staggering level of regulatory approval,\u201d he told me.In the crunchy-granola world of urban compost, populated by outdoorsy types in Carhartts and work boots, Vigliotti stands out. He wears designer suits and a pinkie ring, slicks back his hair \u00e0 la L.B.J. and commutes from his Oyster Bay home in a silver Porsche Panamera. The nephew of Vincent Vigliotti, an established Bronx trash carter, Charles spent the 1970s hanging off the back of a commercial garbage truck working the streets of Jackson Heights, Queens. \u201cMy uncle\u2019s carting business and my carting business were completely separate,\u201d Vigliotti told me, twice, the first time we met. (Later, I understood why: His uncle pleaded guilty in 1997 to charges of attempted racketeering, which stemmed from his participation in a Mafia-dominated cartel.)Over the years, Vigliotti, who is 63, gradually evolved from a hauler of waste to a producer of fine fertilizers. And so he was well positioned when New York City contracted last year with six companies to transform the food waste it currently collects from the curbsides of almost a million residents. Four of those companies will send their scraps to traditional compost facilities. A fifth will truck its share to the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, operated by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in north Brooklyn. There, chopped-up food will be stirred into giant tanks that already digest sewage, anaerobically, using microbes; the resulting biogas will be captured and used to power turbines on site or to heat nearby homes. Vigliotti\u2019s contract, the second-largest, allows him to annually shunt more than 23,000 tons of city food waste into his soon-to-be-built Yaphank plant, where it will mingle with 155,000 tons of scraps from two counties outside the city. When it is up and running, American Organic Energy will have the largest anaerobic digester east of the Mississippi. \u201cI\u2019d like to say I had a vision of environmental responsibility,\u201d Vigliotti told me, with a wink, about the origins of his new endeavor. \u201cBut I saw food composting as a business opportunity.\u201dFor a brief time, I could provide answers to such questions. As my own compost baron, I sorted and tipped my grapefruit rinds and eggshells into a front-yard composting bin; the resulting fertilizer fed my building\u2019s crab-apple tree. But when I ran out of leaves to mix into the scraps, my \u201ccompost\u201d grew extremely smelly. Odors, flies and quality control can bedevil even the most experienced food-waste recyclers, but I didn\u2019t give up. Instead, a few years ago, I upgraded from a solo operation to something just a little bigger, joining the 200,000 other New Yorkers who weekly marched their organics to one of 74 drop-off sites \u2014 at farmers\u2019 markets, subway stations, libraries \u2014 around New York City, collectively diverting 2.3 million pounds of food waste from the dump each year.Lugging scraps to my farmers market was enormously satisfying. I liked returning my potato peels to the woman who grew my potatoes; I knew she\u2019d make good use of them. The act also felt more immediately important than many other things I did to lessen my planetary impact, like driving less and line-drying more. When the Department of Sanitation\u2019s curbside organics-collection program expanded to my Brooklyn neighborhood in 2015, I was grateful, but also a little wary. Placing my scraps on the curb in a securely latched, hard-sided bin was certainly convenient, but my compost cycle was starting to spiral, from small-batch to medium to \u2014 well, I wasn\u2019t sure what. I had no idea where this centralized system deposited my scraps, or how \u2014 or if \u2014 they were transformed into something of value.By 2018, the Department of Sanitation hopes to extend its curbside program \u2014 the largest residential-food-waste collection scheme in the country \u2014 citywide. But quantity doesn\u2019t always equal quality, and already there is evidence that an industrial future may not match the integrity of the artisanal present. Longer supply chains mean burning more fuel to transport this resource, and recipients of scraps have little control over what New Yorkers throw into their bins. Because local composters, at urban farms, educate their suppliers, they don\u2019t need to remove plastic bags, twist-ties and other detritus from their feedstock. But the anonymity of industrial-scale operations means that such contaminants can easily slide through.When New York\u2019s curbside program began several years ago, trucks trundled city scraps down the New Jersey Turnpike to the Peninsula Compost Company, a large facility in Wilmington, Del. But after Waste Management, the nation\u2019s largest solid-waste handler, bought a controlling interest in the plant six years ago, its compost quality declined \u2014 it contained too many shards of glass and pieces of plastic \u2014 and neighbors began to complain that the yard smelled like the bottom of a garbage pail. Environmental regulators forced Peninsula to shut down in 2014.Since then, the city has been carting food waste to several local transfer stations, one of which I visited in Jamaica, Queens. Inside a dreary industrial shed at a private company called Regal Recycling, a team of workers in rubber boots and face masks combed through a 10-foot-tall pile of organic waste collected from various schools. Using long-handled hoes and their gloved fingers, the men painstakingly extracted plastic baggies, milk boxes, Capri Sun pouches, sporks and balls of aluminum foil. (As the volume of curbside organics climbs, Regal and other city transfer stations will install mechanical preprocessing equipment.)Michael Reali, Regal\u2019s vice president, told me the city paid him about $80 a ton to receive this material, and then he paid truckers to transport the waste upstate and a permitted composter $35 per ton to receive it. Sometimes the load was clean, sometimes not. Reali pivoted away from the school waste and gestured toward a 20-foot mound shoved against the opposite wall. Collected from two fruit wholesalers, the pile was almost 100 percent mangoes and avocados, with very little extraneous material. (And it smelled great.) I was starting to understand that compost, like oil, has different grades. Pure commercial streams like this one were akin to West Texas light crude: clean and easy to process. School and residential streams were like tar sands: dirty and expensive to upgrade.Reali\u2019s decontaminated table scraps eventually made their way to McEnroe Organic Farm, which stretches over 1,100-acres of rolling pastureland and cultivated fields in the mid-Hudson Valley. There I watched as front-end loaders mixed the food with locally sourced wood shavings and straw. The woody materials provided more carbon to complement the food\u2019s nitrogen and bulk up the compost. Thoroughly mingled, the compost was then laid in rows and covered by a fleece blanket to cook; heat killed any pathogens and weed seeds. Twice a week for a month, workers remove the blankets and spider a mechanical windrow turner over the top, fluffing and mixing. After resting for several more months, the compost is fed into a screening machine. About 60 percent of McEnroe\u2019s 28,000 tons of finished material nourishes the farm, which raises organic vegetables, grains and pastured meat. The rest, selling for up to $100 a cubic yard, helps balance its books.The nation\u2019s industrialized compost operations bring in roughly $3 billion annually; American farmers bought $21.2 billion of conventional fertilizers in 2016. I liked being part of this smaller economy, though. McEnroe\u2019s adorable Angus calves and grain-filled silos made it easy to imagine that my waste was circling virtuously, even as I blocked out the miserable labors of the transfer station downstate. The system worked, I liked to think. Compost could scale up; food could return to being food.Then I got on the phone with Will Brinton, who runs the Woods End Laboratories in Mount Vernon, Me., and has spent his entire career studying the science of rot. Several years ago, Brinton began comparing the costs and benefits of composting food with those of anaerobically digesting it. He assumed that composting would come out on top. But, Brinton said, \u201cI was horrified to see, at the end of the study, that we were investing more carbon in making compost than the compost returned to the earth.\u201d All those energy-sucking bulldozers and trucks and augers and screeners were taking their toll. Biogas created by anaerobically digesting corncobs and orange peels, in contrast, was carbon neutral. That\u2019s because the plant generates its own energy, and burning the fuel doesn\u2019t release new carbon into the atmosphere, as burning oil or coal does; it merely recycles the carbon already inside those scraps. Take the calculations a step further, by subtracting the methane that would have been generated by putting this food waste in landfills, and biofuel could be considered carbon negative.In recognition of these facts, the Environmental Protection Agency now lists anaerobic digestion as preferable to composting when it comes to surplus food (of course, feeding surpluses to people, followed by animals, is even better). Even the U.S. Composting Council, a trade group, acknowledges anaerobic digestion\u2019s beneficial role in producing energy.After city landfills began closing in the 1980s, Vigliotti found he was spending too much money directing waste out of state. He began to move away from the trash business and in 1991 established with his brother Arnold a compost company in Westbury, N.Y., that transforms Himalayas of landscape debris \u2014 grass clippings, leaves, wood chips \u2014 into millions of bags of lawn and garden products. Business was good, but Vigliotti remained restless. In 1999, he opened a compost site in Yaphank, where in 2008 he began dabbling in food waste, mixing scraps from a Whole Foods Market and a small-batch won-ton manufacturer into his formula for potting soils. At this point, Vigliotti wasn\u2019t thinking of food waste as a renewable energy source or a way to reduce the city\u2019s far-flung garbage footprint or greenhouse-gas emissions. It was simply a way to take in more volume and thus make more money.Vigliotti initially composted his food scraps using a basic windrow technology similar to McEnroe\u2019s. That was fine for bakery waste and those won tons. But when he began accepting meat, fish, oils and road-killed deer, he ran into trouble: The site now produced eye-watering odors and attracted blankets of gulls. After a multiyear battle with angry locals, who supported organics recycling in theory but had little patience for its stinky reality, Vigliotti and other stakeholders devised a remedy. Instead of composting food in windrows, he would digest it in tanks. But in order to justify the expense of building those tanks, Vigliotti would need to attract more food scraps. And if those came from households in addition to commercial establishments, he would need a lot of fancy equipment to screen out the sort of contaminants that bedeviled Reali\u2019s laborers in Queens and Waste Management\u2019s workers at Peninsula in Delaware.And so the project grew. Today, American Organic Energy is supported by $45 million in borrowed capital, plus grants from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority ($1.35 million) and Empire State Development ($400,000).Gazing down from that high bluff of soil in Yaphank, Vigliotti laid out the mechanics of his new anaerobic operation. \u201cThe trucks are going to pull into a two-acre building and dump their load into a 10-foot-deep pit,\u201d he explained. Air pressure inside would be lower than outside, so no odors would escape. Next, expensive German machinery would crush the cans and bottles that would inevitably ride in with the food; metals would be extracted and packages shredded, and with the addition of water, random plastic would float to the top of the tanks while glass and grit settled to the bottom. \u201cWe know we\u2019re gonna get loads from supermarkets with unopened tuna cans and expired bacon packages,\u201d Vigliotti said, \u201cwhile residential food is going to be in a plastic bag with a soup can of broken glass in it \u2014 that\u2019s the way Americans throw out their garbage.\u201dVigliotti wasn\u2019t bothered. \u201cWe are not changing human nature but building our plant to suit it,\u201d he said. His philosophy was diametrically opposed to that of community composters, who insist that participants honor and defend the integrity of their organics, down to the removal of tiny stickers from lemons and limes. And for the most part, they do. But it was clear to me now that these artisanal operations \u2014 even if they do expand to schools, parks and other city-owned spaces with support from local government \u2014 will never be able to handle the boroughs\u2019 tsunami of residential food waste. (Nor do they particularly want to.)Once isolated, Vigliotti\u2019s organic material will move into six three-story tanks, where it will stew for 20 days, producing enough biogas to generate nearly 50 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year. Twenty percent of the output will feed the plant\u2019s electrical demand; PSE&G, a local electrical utility, will be able to buy the rest (unless American Organic Energy compresses its biogas to run trucks). Vigliotti won\u2019t reveal his per-ton processing costs or his expected revenue, but he noted that selling the gas alone will bring in \u201cseven figures,\u201d even with the commodity\u2019s price near a 10-year low because of the fracking boom.But gas isn\u2019t the only thing that American Organic Energy plans to sell. When the microbes are done feasting, Vigliotti continued, they\u2019ll leave behind a watery digestate that machines will squeeze and separate into solids and liquids. Vigliotti will blend the solids with woody material \u2014 the stuff arrayed at our feet, of which he had an endless supply \u2014 and aerobically compost the mixture in windrows, then sell the resulting 40,000 tons per year of potting soil to regional garden centers through a deal with Scotts Miracle-Gro. Partnering with G.E. Water & Process Technologies, he will put the leftover liquids through a multistage filtering process, after which American Organic Energy will reuse the clean portion on site and sell the fraction that\u2019s high in ammonium sulfate \u2014 a projected 912,500 gallons a year \u2014 as plant food (around $20 for two and a half gallons, retail). \u201cWe\u2019ll be targeting the affluent urban market with that,\u201d Vigliotti said.Nothing, it seemed, could stand in Vigliotti\u2019s way. He was nearly levitating from his Italian loafers when he wrapped up his presentation with a sweeping offer. \u201cIf the city gives us a site in the boroughs,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will build and operate a plant that handles 1,000 tons of food waste per day, and we will process it at rates lower than what anyone else is offering.\u201d The room grew quiet. A thousand tons is the amount generated daily by all of the city\u2019s institutional and commercial food establishments combined.Was Vigliotti serious? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. With his network of corporate partners, he dreamed of building beautifully managed, energy-producing digesters on smallish city plots across the nation. Here in New York, he added, his words tumbling ahead of his thoughts, \u201cwe could put together a proposal that would make everyone\u2019s eyeballs and bells ring, and a bunch of carbon footprint stuff, compressed-natural-gas trucks. ...\u201d The crowd nodded, caught up in his enthusiasm for a food-waste-fueled clean-energy future. \u201cEveryone here knows there is more material in this city than 10 facilities like ours could handle,\u201d Vigliotti said, rather sternly. Then he packed up his schematic diagrams and headed for his Porsche.Elizabeth Royte is the author of \u201cBottlemania,\u201d \u201cGarbage Land\u201d and \u201cThe Tapir\u2019s Morning Bath.\u201d Her writing has appeared in Harper\u2019s Magazine, National Geographic and Outside.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tom Price Is Sworn In as Health Secretary Amid Senate Disunity", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, took office on Friday with a promise to fix what he called a \u201cbroken health care system\u201d that was \u201charming Americans and their families.\u201dRepublicans said that Mr. Price, 62, an orthopedic surgeon, would bring a physician\u2019s insights to managing a federal agency that they said had become addicted to heavy-handed federal regulation and blind to problems spawned by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\u201cDr. Price has a thorough understanding of health care policy and the damage that Obamacare has caused,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, where consumers this year saw rate increases averaging 44 percent to 62 percent in the law\u2019s marketplace.Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee, said Mr. Price would be \u201can excellent partner\u201d as Congress tries to devise a replacement for the health care law championed by former President Barack Obama.Senate Democrats and the chamber\u2019s two independents said they feared the worst, based on Mr. Price\u2019s 12-year record as a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Georgia. They said that Mr. Price had led efforts to repeal the health care law and slow the growth of Medicare and Medicaid by shifting some costs to beneficiaries and trimming payments to some health care providers.\u201cThis is a sad evening,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cPeople will look back and say that the Republicans\u2019 war on seniors began at 2 a.m. Friday morning when the Senate unfortunately confirmed Representative Price.\u201dThe depth of concern about Mr. Price was illustrated by the comments of Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats but is not given to hyperbole.\u201cTo put somebody in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services that is inimical to Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 this guy is a wrecking ball,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cHe is not a secretary. He is going into this agency to destroy it. He wants to undercut and diminish and, in some cases, literally destroy some of the major underpinnings of providing health care to people in this country.\u201dBy contrast, at the swearing-in ceremony, the vice president said Mr. Price had emerged as \u201cthe most principled expert on health care policy in the House of Representatives, if not the entire Congress.\u201dMr. Trump said again on Friday that the Affordable Care Act was \u201ca total and complete disaster.\u201d With the confirmation of Mr. Price, he said, the administration will \u201cget down to the final strokes,\u201d devising a plan that can provide \u201ctremendous health care at a lower price.\u201dIn a farewell address to the House submitted for publication in the Congressional Record, Mr. Price said that, as chairman of the Budget Committee, he had begun an important effort to \u201cfix our nation\u2019s broken health care system\u201d and \u201cget Washington out of the way\u201d of patients and doctors.One of the first challenges facing the new secretary is to stabilize insurance markets and decide the future of financial assistance provided to insurance companies that say they have lost large amounts of money treating patients under the Affordable Care Act.A judge on the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled on Thursday that the Obama administration had illegally reneged on a promise to pay subsidies to an Oregon insurer, Moda Health Plan. Many other insurers have filed similar claims. The Obama administration\u2019s failure to pay the claims was cited as a reason for the collapse of many nonprofit insurance cooperatives created under the Affordable Care Act.The Trump administration has not decided whether to appeal the decision.The next prospective member of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet to be voted on will be Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, on Monday evening.Congressional reaction to Mr. Mnuchin, as to Mr. Price, has been divided along party lines. Republicans have been impressed with the former Goldman Sachs banker\u2019s business acumen, while Democrats have argued forcefully that he is ill-equipped to steer America\u2019s economy.Those divisions were on stark display during Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s confirmation hearing at the Senate Finance Committee last month, when Democrats questioned him over his business record and ultimately boycotted votes on his nomination.Mr. Mnuchin has also been accused by Senate Democrats of lying to Congress when he said during his hearing that OneWest Bank did not engage in the foreclosure practice of \u201crobo-signing\u201d when he was its chief executive. Local news reports suggested that the bank did engage in such practices in some states.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said on Friday that such discrepancies should disqualify Mr. Mnuchin, who she said was unlikely to look out for working-class Americans.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s record to suggest that he would want to stand up to Wall Street,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a speech on the Senate floor. \u201cMr. Mnuchin is the ultimate Wall Street insider.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sex and the French Elections", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs France gears up for presidential elections in April (and probably a runoff in May), this unusual pair could help prevent it from becoming the next country to succumb to xenophobic populism. He\u2019s the upstart presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, and she\u2019s his former high school French teacher, Brigitte Trogneux, now his close adviser and wife.Mr. Macron, the 39-year-old former economy minister, is now in second place in the polls. He surged past the conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon this week thanks to \u201cPenelope-gate\u201d \u2014 an investigation into whether Mr. Fillon\u2019s Welsh-born wife held a well-paid government job but didn\u2019t actually work, and other allegations.Mr. Macron still lags the front-runner, Marine Le Pen, who wants France to slash immigration and leave the European Union. Mr. Macron is adamantly pro-Europe and quickly opposed President Trump\u2019s barring of refugees. Polls show that Mr. Macron would easily defeat Ms. Le Pen in a runoff.He\u2019s benefiting from a global election season in which voters want to break with conventions. On one hand Mr. Macron is an \u00e9narque \u2014 a graduate of ENA, France\u2019s elite finishing school for future presidents and ministers \u2014 and worked as an investment banker before quickly rising in the Socialist Party. But last year he broke away from the ruling (and ailing) Socialists to form his own centrist party, which he claims is neither left nor right. His youth adds to his novelty.And his unconventional personal story keeps him from seeming like just another ambitious \u00e9narque. Mr. Macron and his wife met when he was a 15-year-old 10th grader at a Jesuit high school in Amiens, and Ms. Trogneux was a 40-year-old married mother of three children, one of whom was in Mr. Macron\u2019s class. Then known by her married name, Auzi\u00e8re, she taught French literature and ran the theater club.By all accounts Mr. Macron was precocious: an accomplished pianist who excelled academically and starred in the school play, which Ms. Trogneux directed. (While minister, he recited Moli\u00e8re from memory on French TV.) \u201cResolutely, he wasn\u2019t like the others. He was always with the teachers,\u201d Ms. Trogneux said in the French documentary \u201cEmmanuel Macron: The Meteor Strategy.\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t an ado\u201d \u2014 an adolescent \u2014 she added.Their relationship turned romantic when Mr. Macron, then in 11th grade, persuaded her to write a play with him. \u201cWriting brought us together every Friday and it unleashed an incredible closeness,\u201d she told Paris Match.At the insistence of either his alarmed parents or the frazzled Ms. Trogneux, Mr. Macron left to spend his senior year in Paris at the prestigious Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV. Before leaving home, he reportedly promised his teacher: \u201cYou won\u2019t get rid of me. I will return and I will marry you.\u201dOver long phone calls from Paris, \u201clittle by little, he vanquished my resistance,\u201d she said. Ms. Trogneux eventually divorced her husband and took a teaching job in Paris. \u201cI told myself: I\u2019m going to miss out on my life if I don\u2019t do this.\u201dAt their 2007 wedding, Mr. Macron thanked Ms. Trogneux\u2019s children for accepting him and said the pair are \u201cnot at all a normal couple \u2014 though I don\u2019t like that adjective much \u2014 but we\u2019re a couple that exists.\u201dIts existence has caused some flack. A radio humorist recently called the long-legged Ms. Trogneux a \u201cmenopausal Barbie.\u201d Critics call Mr. Macron a \u201cchouchou\u201d \u2014 a kind of teacher\u2019s pet \u2014 who\u2019s jumping the line for the presidency and flaunting his personal life to win votes.But the French press is frequently admiring of their relationship. Magazines call her a fashion icon and run pictures of the youthful Mr. Macron giving a baby bottle to one of his seven step-grandchildren.It helps that \u2014 although their romance began when Mr. Macron was scandalously young \u2014 once students reach university, student-teacher flings are practically expected. The twist, in Mr. Macron\u2019s case, is that they\u2019re still together decades later.And true love excuses many breaches of convention here. Last fall\u2019s main literary event was \u201cLetters to Anne,\u201d a 1,276-page book of romantic letters that former President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand sent to his longtime mistress, Anne Pingeot. They met when she was 19 and he was 45. (\u201cI feel that I\u2019ve been making love to you without stopping since August 15, 1963!\u201d Mr. Mitterrand declared in a letter dated seven years later.)The French also pride themselves on not moralizing. Politicians\u2019 private lives don\u2019t have to follow a script, and no one even expects them to discuss it. Marine Le Pen has two ex-husbands and took years to acknowledge her current relationship with another party official.But don\u2019t confuse a lack of moralizing with a lack of interest. One sign that President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s career was kaput was that no one cared anymore about whom he was sleeping with. The Socialists are running Mr. Hollande\u2019s former education minister for president instead; he\u2019s currently in distant fourth place in the polls.The one requirement is that a politician\u2019s love life should be sincere, especially if it\u2019s part of his public persona. Mr. Macron went on TV in November to deny a persistent rumor that he\u2019s secretly gay and living a \u201cdouble life.\u201d At issue isn\u2019t his sexuality; it\u2019s his authenticity. The implication is that if his love story isn\u2019t real, his plans for the country lack substance, too.For the future of France, let\u2019s hope it is.Pamela Druckerman is the author of \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran, Puzzled by Trump, Treads Carefully for Now", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, gave a mild rejoinder, saying, \u201cIt is a shame that the U.S. government, instead of thanking the Iranian nation for their continued fight against terrorism, keeps repeating unfounded claims and adopts unwise policies that are effectively helping terrorist groups.\u201dMr. Flynn also made clear that the challenge to Iran extended beyond the missile test, holding Tehran responsible for an attack on a Saudi warship by Houthi rebels in Yemen, who the United States says are supported by Iran. Iran denies that, but the remark was taken as a veiled warning about Iran\u2019s support of regional proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shiite militias in Iraq.\u201cThe Trump administration condemns actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout the Middle East and place American lives at risk,\u201d he said.Later, President Trump posted on Twitter that \u201cIran is rapidly taking over Iraq,\u201d its neighbor, \u201cwhile the U.S. squandered three trillion dollars there. Obviously long ago.\u201d\u201cTrump is not predictable for Americans, not for Europeans and not for us,\u201d said Nader Karimi Joni, a war veteran and analyst close to the government of President Hassan Rouhani. \u201cHe and his team are not trustworthy. They will not honor any agreement. Nothing good is coming from this.\u201dCertainly not for Mr. Rouhani, a moderate who came to power promising to ratchet down tensions with the West, cinch a nuclear deal and get Iran\u2019s economy moving again. Now, all those goals are in jeopardy, and Mr. Rouhani\u2019s re-election this spring is far from assured.But there is little doubt that the clerics have been thrown off balance. One analyst with access to government deliberations said that hard-liners in Iran were confused and did not know how to deal with the situation. Some in the establishment are opting for the same rhetoric and tactics they used under Mr. Obama, but in reality, this is uncharted territory, he said.Mr. Trump has filled his foreign policy team with advisers like Mr. Flynn and the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, who consider Iran to be the greatest cause of instability in the Middle East, if not the world, and who think the Obama administration treated Tehran with kid gloves.When Iran test fired a missile on Sunday, it did not announce the launch on state television, something the country\u2019s leadership usually likes to do to send a message to its adversaries. Missile tests are commonplace in Iran, but Sunday\u2019s muted test was clearly meant to test the Trump administration\u2019s reaction.Mr. Flynn did not elaborate what he meant by saying he was putting Iran on notice. But in Iran, many agreed that whatever it meant, it did not bode well.\u201cWhen they say we are put on notice, it means we should be very careful,\u201d said Soroush Farhadian, a reformist journalist. \u201cWe need self-restraint. Our military men need to be prevented from making blunders. One incident in the Persian Gulf can lead to conflict right now.\u201dIn recent months, speedboats belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have made a practice of aggressively approaching United States naval vessels, then veering off. During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed that if they tried that under his watch, he would \u201cblow them out of the water.\u201d There have been no reported incidents since Mr. Trump took office.Ayatollah Khamenei was uncharacteristically mute during a visit on Thursday to the martyr\u2019s graves, usually a moment for brief remarks about current affairs. The position of Mr. Rouhani is more sensitive, as he has been promoting ties with the United States and executed the nuclear agreement, with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei, who also has been critical of the deal.Having tied his political future to the nuclear agreement and promised to normalize relations with the West, Mr. Rouhani is rapidly losing influence, analysts say. He now finds himself faced with an American travel ban for his citizens and an American president who thinks the nuclear pact \u201cis a really, really bad deal.\u201dHard-liners are deeply critical of Mr. Rouhani and are increasingly dismissing him as a figure of the past, the right answer in the Obama era but the wrong one now. Many expect the next president to be a far more combative figure, in the mold of the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\u201cFor this Trump, we need to talk and act tough,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst. \u201cMr. Rouhani speaks beautiful words, but they are empty. We can deal with Mr. Trump. He is a businessman, but we should not compromise.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kenneth Arrow, Nobel-Winning Economist Whose Influence Spanned Decades, Dies at 95", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKenneth J. Arrow, one of the most brilliant economic minds of the 20th century and, at 51, the youngest economist ever to win a Nobel, died on Tuesday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 95.His son David confirmed the death.Paul A. Samuelson, the first American to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, called Professor Arrow \u201cthe most important theorist of the 20th century in economics.\u201d When Professor Arrow received the award in 1972, Professor Samuelson wrote, \u201cThe economics of insurance, medical care, prescription drug testing \u2014 to say nothing of bingo and the stock market \u2014 will never be the same after Arrow.\u201dProfessor Arrow \u2014 a member of an extended family of distinguished economists, including Professor Samuelson and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and adviser to President Barack Obama \u2014 generated work that was technically forbidding even to mathematically oriented colleagues.But over the decades, economists have learned to apply his ideas to the modern design of insurance products, financial securities, employment contracts and much more.The backdrop for Professor Arrow\u2019s influential early work was the centuries-long recognition that majority voting can produce arbitrary outcomes.Consider a legislature choosing its leader from among three candidates: Alice, Betty and Harry. If the legislature were to vote first on Alice versus Betty, with the winner running against Harry, it could come to a different decision than had it first started by voting on Alice versus Harry. Because the order with which the legislature takes votes is arbitrary, the ultimate winner of this system of majority voting becomes arbitrary. That puts politics in an awkward corner.In search of nonarbitrary outcomes, social scientists proffered different ways to conduct votes. For example, the legislature could run all three candidates in the initial round and structure some type of runoff. Or the legislature could give each member multiple votes to be assigned to the three candidates in proportion to the intensity of the member\u2019s preferences.But no voting system, however cleverly designed, resolved the problems associated with majority voting. In a theorem of stunning generality, Professor Arrow proved that no system of majority voting worked satisfactorily according to a carefully articulated definition of \u201csatisfactory\u201d (which social scientists generally accept).What Professor Arrow proved in his book \u201cSocial Choice and Individual Values\u201d (1951) was far more sweeping. Not only would majority-voting rules prove unsatisfactory; so, too, would nonvoting systems of making social choices if, as was fundamental to his way of thinking, those choices were based on the preferences of the individuals making up the society. (Professor Arrow\u2019s rules did not allow for dictators.)The Arrow \u201cimpossibility theorem\u201d ricocheted around the social sciences, noteworthy for its use of abstract mathematical concepts to generate a conclusion of sweeping applicability.Professor Arrow\u2019s research opened the academic field of social choice \u2014 a literature that ranges from countries picking presidents to corporate boards picking business strategies. Having learned from him that no system works entirely well, academics turned to challenging follow-up questions, like whether some voting systems were better than others.Professor Arrow\u2019s next major contributions, for which he shared the 1972 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science with the British economist John R. Hicks, were published later in the 1950s. They took a bird\u2019s-eye, \u201cgeneral equilibrium\u201d view of market economies, setting out equations to capture the interplay between consumers and producers.The basic equations had been set out a half-century earlier by the French economist Leon Walras. But Professor Arrow and his co-authors extended the Walrasian system to capture important complexities, like the fact that markets exist well into the future, posing risk for consumers and producers.Professor Arrow proved that their system of equations mathematically cohere: Prices exist that bring all markets into simultaneous equilibrium (whereby every item produced at the equilibrium price would be voluntarily purchased). And market competition puts society\u2019s resources to good use: Competitive markets are efficient, in the language of economists.Professor Arrow\u2019s theorems set out the precise conditions under which Adam Smith\u2019s famous conjecture in \u201cThe Wealth of Nations\u201d holds true: that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of market competition among self-serving individuals serves society well.As was true of his earlier work on social choice, the magnitude of Professor Arrow\u2019s theoretical insight was staggering. But, he made clear, his powerful conclusions about the workings of competitive markets held true only under ideal \u2014 that is to say, unrealistic \u2014 assumptions.His assumptions, for example, ruled out the existence of third-party effects: The sale of a product by Harry to Joe was assumed not to affect the well-being of Sally \u2014 an assumption routinely violated in the real world by, for example, the sale of products that harm the environment.The mathematics behind the general equilibrium proofs of Professor Arrow and his co-authors were daunting. Few economists mastered the details. But Franklin M. Fisher, who taught graduate courses on general equilibrium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, acknowledged in a 2013 interview with The New York Times that all academic economists were in Professor Arrow\u2019s intellectual debt. Professor Arrow proved that the economists\u2019 workaday tools of supply-and-demand equations are built on a logically coherent foundation.His later research translated common-sense ideas into elegant mathematics. Once the ideas were translated, other economists could extend them in unanticipated directions.Take \u201clearning by doing,\u201d a notion that Professor Arrow examined in the early 1960s. The basic idea is straightforward: The more that a company produces, the smarter it gets. Decades later, economists incorporated this idea into sophisticated theories of \u201cendogenous growth,\u201d which have a country\u2019s rate of economic growth depending on internal policies that promote innovation and education \u2014 the very forces that Professor Arrow\u2019s writings anticipated.Professor Arrow also created mathematical concepts by which economists could measure and analyze risk. William F. Sharpe, who won a Nobel in 1990 for analyzing the relationship between financial risk and return, credited Professor Arrow with helping to formulate the basis for modern theories of financial investment and corporate finance.Professor Arrow, he said, belonged in the \u201cpantheon\u201d of investment management. His ideas have worked their way into the design of complicated financial securities, known as derivatives, like options (which give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified asset at a specified price on or before a specified date). Businesses buy and sell financial derivatives to protect themselves from financial turmoil, and investors buy and sell them to speculate on future movements of security prices.Professor Arrow anticipated the modern analysis of markets in which buyers and sellers do not share accurate information (now known as markets with asymmetric information). In a strikingly prescient article published in the early 1960s, he teased apart the complexities that asymmetric information creates in the market for health insurance. He pointed to incentives for patients and their physicians to agree to medical procedures of questionable value when a third party, the insurer, pays the bills.Professor Arrow\u2019s work spawned the modern treatment of \u201cmoral hazard,\u201d whereby the fact of the purchase of insurance systematically affects the behavior of the parties to the contract.Joseph Stiglitz, who won the Nobel in 2001 for formalizing the study of markets with incomplete information, traces his work to Professor Arrow\u2019s initial forays.The upshot? The theorist who in the 1950s proved that perfectly competitive markets could exist as a matter of mathematical logic spent much of the rest of his career showing how far short of perfection actual markets fall.Kenneth Joseph Arrow was born on Aug. 23, 1921, in New York City. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan, he raced through City College, finishing with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social science and in mathematics \u2014 what he called later \u201ca paradoxical combination that was prognostic of my future interests.\u201dHe did his graduate work at Columbia University, interrupting it to serve as a weather officer, rising to captain, in the Army Air Corps during World War II. His first published paper, \u201cOn the Optimal Use of Winds for Flight Planning,\u201d drew on this experience.Early in his career he worked at the RAND Corporation, the research and development organization in Santa Monica, Calif., in what he described as \u201cthe heady days of emerging game theory and mathematical programming.\u201dProfessor Arrow spent the bulk of his career at Stanford University, except for a teaching stint at Harvard from 1968 to 1979. He also served briefly on the staff of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.He retired from Stanford in 1991 but continued to accept short-term appointments in Europe and to serve on the external faculty and the science board of the Santa Fe Institute, a research center in New Mexico focused on the interplay of the social and physical sciences.He led the American Economic Association, served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and, in 2004, was awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation\u2019s highest scientific honor, presented in 2006 by President George W. Bush.\u201cHis politics are liberal, definitely,\u201d said Robert M. Solow, a longtime friend and fellow Nobel laureate in economics. \u201cWith other people, this might rub the right half of the economics profession the wrong way, but it doesn\u2019t with Kenneth.\u201dRobert Summers was the brother of Paul Samuelson and the father of Lawrence Summers, who at 28 became a tenured economics professor at Harvard and later served as the Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, as well as president of Harvard and senior adviser to Mr. Obama.Professor Arrow\u2019s wife, the former Selma Schweitzer, whom he married in 1947, died in 2015. Besides his sister and son David, he is survived by another son, Andrew, and a grandson.Professor Arrow was widely hailed as a polymath, possessing prodigious knowledge of subjects far removed from economics. Eric Maskin, a Harvard economist and fellow Nobel winner, told of a good-natured conspiracy waged by junior faculty to get the better of Professor Arrow, even if artificially. They all agreed to study the breeding habits of gray whales \u2014 a suitably abstruse topic \u2014 and gathered at an appointed date at a place where Professor Arrow would be sure to visit.When, as expected, he showed up, they were talking out loud about the theory by a marine biologist \u2014 last name, Turner \u2014 which purported to explain how gray whales found the same breeding spot year after year. As Professor Maskin recounted the story, \u201cKen was silent,\u201d and his junior colleagues amused themselves that they had for once bested their formidable professor.Well, not so fast.Before leaving, Professor Arrow muttered, \u201cBut I thought that Turner\u2019s theory was entirely discredited by Spencer, who showed that the hypothesized homing mechanism couldn\u2019t possibly work.\u201dRobert D. Hershey Jr. and Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worries Grow Over Euro\u2019s Fate as Debts Smolder in Italy and Greece", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as global stock markets climb, worries are building among investors that long-simmering debt troubles in Greece and Italy will put additional strain on the euro.Over the past year, aggressive bond buying by the European Central Bank and encouraging signs of economic growth across Europe have helped the eurozone overcome a series of political jolts, including Britain electing to quit the European Union and Italian voters rejecting the proposals of a reform-minded government.Yet with the central bank expected to eventually unwind its purchases of government bonds and other assets, investors are increasingly becoming concerned about how Europe \u2014 and Germany, in particular \u2014 can cope with escalating debt pressures in Italy and Greece.The result has been a sell-off of European government bonds as investment funds reassess the risks of holding such securities. In Italy, for instance, some hedge funds are making direct bets that the prices of Italian bonds will collapse.The yield on Italy\u2019s benchmark 10-year note \u2014 which moves in the opposite direction of its price \u2014 has doubled to 2.3 percent since late last fall. The yield on the equivalent Greek note has jumped to nearly 8 percent from 6.7 percent at the beginning of the year.Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank\u2019s president, promised in summer 2012 to do whatever it took to save the euro, but the debt burdens of Italy and Greece have become progressively worse amid the stagnation of their economies.Italy\u2019s debt as a share of its economic output has risen to 133 percent from 123 percent during that period. In Greece, debt has increased to an expected 183 percent of the country\u2019s total economy from 159 percent.These figures highlight a harsh economic reality: Just as an individual will struggle to pay off a punishing credit card bill if her salary stays flat or falls, a country cannot reduce its debt pile without expanding its economy.And with Italy and Greece held back by the fiscal constraints that the euro\u2019s rules require and not expected to generate sufficient growth in the future, the only alternatives are a restructuring of debt or an exit from the common currency.\u201cThe common themes here are high debt, low growth and dysfunctional banking systems,\u201d said Ashoka Mody, a former top economist at the International Monetary Fund who is writing a book about the birth of the currency pact. \u201cNow these problems are not only Europe\u2019s problem; they are a global problem.\u201dWhile these issues have not been secret \u2014 they were at the heart of the eurozone\u2019s debt crisis in 2010 and 2011 \u2014 they are drawing closer scrutiny now because of reports making the rounds among traders and economists.For investors interested in making specific bets against Italy, two studies that conclude the country is unlikely to be able to repay its debts in full have attracted the most attention.Astellon Capital, a hedge fund based in London, argues in its analysis that some form of restructuring is essential for Italy, given the inability of the country\u2019s economy to grow. The Astellon study highlights the fact that most of Italy\u2019s debt is governed by local law, which, in theory, would make it easier to restructure.As Greece proved in 2011, having your debt governed by local law \u2014 rather than by courts in London and New York \u2014 makes it easier to achieve terms in a debt restructuring that favor the government instead of international investors.A study by Astellon Capital, a London-based hedge fund, concluded that Italy is unlikely to be able to repay its debts in full.The Astellon report also notes that the E.C.B. and sickly Italian banks have been the main buyers of Italian government bonds over the past three years. That buying has driven prices higher, sending yields tumbling to a low of 1 percent from 6 percent.Now, even with the recent rise in yields, a view is taking hold that a yield of 2 percent is not sufficient given the risk that Italy may be forced in the future to impose a haircut on its private sector creditors \u2014 or, in a more extreme scenario, have to exit the euro.\u201cThere is only one buyer of these bonds, and that is the E.C.B.,\u201d said Bernd Ondruch, Astellon\u2019s managing partner. \u201cThe risk-reward scenario to owning Italian bonds right now is just dreadful.\u201dAlso drawing the attention of investors with skeptical views toward the eurozone is a paper issued by Mediobanca, the Italian investment bank.Like the Astellon study, the Mediobanca report highlights just how little Italy has benefited from being in the euro: Growth has been literally zero, and the economy\u2019s competitiveness as an exporter has deteriorated.In the meantime, Italy\u2019s debts have ballooned, with only Greece paying out more to creditors as a share of its broader economy (6.1 percent compared with 5.5 percent for Italy).The report has been the focal point of heated disagreement between the fund and Europe in terms of what Greece needs to do to get back on track. The fund has argued that, in addition to needed reforms, European governments must provide debt relief to Greece for the country\u2019s economy to recover fully.\u201cGrowth, competitiveness and debt sustainability have not been restored,\u201d the fund concludes in its evaluation \u2014 a powerful indictment given that it has now been seven years since the first Greek bailout.The Europeans, and Germany in particular, have rejected this notion, contending that Greece\u2019s economy is improving and that as long it keeps spending tight, the government will be able to make good on its debts.But Marcello Minenna, a financial economist and one of the authors of the Mediobanca report, says the dispute between Europe and the I.M.F. misses a larger point.As he and his colleagues lay out in their study, it is a historic inability of poorer countries in the currency bloc to grow and reach their full potential that lies at the root of the continuing drama over Italian and Greek debt.\u201cThese countries are not growing due to lack of investments \u2014 they are caught in a mouse trap,\u201d Mr. Minenna said. \u201cWithout a major restructuring of eurozone, there is just nothing you can do under these rules.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Came to Ski Idaho Slopes. Now They\u2019re Saving the Ski Resort.", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDONNELLY, Idaho \u2014 There is an old joke in the ski industry that a resort needs to go bankrupt three times before it can be profitable. Tamarack is hoping to get away with just once.Today the resort looks like the physical manifestation of a big idea never executed. There is a towering crane that hasn\u2019t moved anything in years. The ski shop and restaurants are open, but sit in dome-shaped buildings that the original investors intended to be temporary. The permanent village sits nearby, half-built and covered in white Tyvek, as it has been since 2008.And instead of chill vacations on the slopes, the group of mostly part-time residents who bought homes and condos around the resort have spent the years since Mr. Boespflug\u2019s disappearance trying to save their mountain from creditors.A small mountain supermarket has opened, closed, reopened and closed again. At one point a group of repo men used a helicopter to take back a ski lift.But now, after a decade of springs that began with a question of whether the resort would open the following winter, Tamarack has some semblance of stability. The debt pile has been cleared, and in October homeowners banded together to buy the resort\u2019s operations.With things looking up, Angela and Mark Gustafson are doubling down. Last summer, two years after buying a townhome with views of the half-built village, they moved to a larger home near a golf course on the other side of the resort.The timing wasn\u2019t perfect: The golf course was recently returned to nature after its owner walked away. But Mrs. Gustafson remains confident that better days are ahead.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have upgraded to a bigger home if we didn\u2019t have faith in a resurrection,\u201d she said.Tamitude means things like accepting that everyone who works here will have more than one job. In addition to being general manager, Mr. Larsen is the resort\u2019s marketing director, food and beverage manager, staff photographer, videographer and wedding salesman.He walks around at night turning the heat down in empty buildings. Sometimes he cleans toilets and buses tables at the restaurants.This a long way from Mr. Larsen\u2019s last job at Telluride Ski Resort, where he was vice president for sales and marketing. He had an office overlooking the village and \u201cdefinitely didn\u2019t clean bathrooms.\u201d But he has come to relish the turnaround and got gushy with Western spirit while describing how he spent the summer cutting ski trails through the forest, then skied them the following winter.\u201cSo many men and women in the ski business have looked up the mountain and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to make this place incredible,\u2019\u201d he said over dinner. \u201cBut like those men and women, you have to hack your way through the wilderness.\u201dAnd while there has been lots of recent progress, it seems unlikely that Tamarack will fulfill the original idea of a high-end resort for skiers flying in from around the world.Mostly there is a sense of comfort that whatever the resort ends up being, its destiny belongs to people who live and ski here instead of some faceless banks.\u201cIt gives a sense of stability, not just to the resort but to the community,\u201d said Ken Roberts, chairman of the Idaho Tax Commission and a farmer whose family has been in Donnelly for more than a century. \u201cYou now have owners who have a vested interest in seeing it being successful.\u201dAnd there are worse things than living next to a newly built resort where the lift lines range from small to nonexistent. On a recent morning between runs, Steve Bussolini, 67, a retired college administrator who lives in nearby McCall, joked that the parking lot is so empty that he never has to walk more than 25 steps before putting his skis on.He was disappointed when Tamarack\u2019s Wildwood lift was repossessed by Bank of America in 2012. But then he found a path through the trees and discovered lots of fresh powder.\u201cIt makes for better skiing,\u201d he said.Mr. Boespflug and his investors started building the resort in 2002. Real estate was booming, so they financed the construction with hundreds of millions of dollars in home and condo sales, and by 2004 the ski lifts were up and running.The hope for new jobs was why Brad Backus, a Tamarack ski guide who also served as Donnelly\u2019s mayor, gave the town a new motto \u2014 \u201cCrossroads to Recreation\u201d \u2014 that is etched onto the granite sign announcing your arrival.That vision seemed in doubt in the winter of 2008, when Mr. Backus started hearing rumors that the resort, like the economy, was having financial troubles. He figured business would slow down and, at worst, someone would step in to buy the resort.But a few weeks later, the resort abruptly closed. The next day, when Mr. Backus and his wife went to collect their skis from an office, they had to shovel a path through the empty parking lot on what should have been an epic powder day.\u201cIt was eerie,\u201d he said.For a while people were hoping that falling prices would attract new buyers and a quick turnaround, but instead the bottom continued to drop.When Louise Francesconi bought her home at Tamarack in 2009, just as things were getting rough, she was looking for a good deal on a ski home near relatives. Instead she got a full-time job.Ms. Francesconi, a longtime military contracting executive, became president of the homeowners\u2019 association in 2016 and spent the last year negotiating to have a group of homeowners buy the resort\u2019s assets \u2014 land and buildings, mostly \u2014 from creditors.So, technically speaking, does this mean she went to buy a house and ended up with the resort?\u201cIt sounds complicated, but it\u2019s accurate,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Panel Presses Yellen on Financial Regulation", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats on Tuesday enlisted Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, as an expert witness against Republican plans to roll back postcrisis financial regulations.In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. Yellen said repeatedly that the new safeguards were effective and that regulation was not impeding economic growth.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the committee, asked Ms. Yellen whether regulation had reduced the risk of financial crises.\u201cI believe the financial system is much more resilient than it was,\u201d she said.Are businesses unable to get loans? No, Ms. Yellen responded.Are banks unable to compete with foreign rivals? No, she said.Are consumers better protected against predation? Yes, she said.Mr. Brown closed with a flourish, declaring that he would summarize the testimony, \u201cSteps taken after the crisis made our economy stronger, our financial system more stable, our banks better capitalized and our consumers better protected.\u201dThe performance drew muted criticism from Senate Republicans, who pressed Ms. Yellen to say that the postcrisis pendulum had swung too far in the direction of regulation. In part, the tempered tone of their questions reflected the reality that Republicans are in power, and free to move forward with plans to reduce regulation.The new chairman of the banking committee, Senator Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, said he hoped the Fed would cooperate with the Trump administration in its efforts to reduce financial regulation. \u201cIt is time to reassess what is working and what is not,\u201d Mr. Crapo said. \u201cFinancial regulation should strike a proper balance between the need for a safe and sound financial system and the need to promote a vibrant, growing economy.\u201dSenator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, went further, expressing the hope that the Fed would \u201crefrain from issuing major new regulations\u201d until Mr. Trump had the chance to name his people to senior roles at the central bank, including the position of vice chairman for regulation, created after the crisis to oversee rule making.Ms. Yellen was invited to Capitol Hill to deliver a biannual report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking Committee. And she found time to tell the committee that the Fed remained pleased with the performance of the economy and expected to continue raising its benchmark interest rate, although she dodged questions about the timing.The unemployment rate was little changed over the last year, standing at 4.8 percent in January, even as the economy added an average of 190,000 jobs a month during the second half of 2016, and an additional 227,000 jobs last month. That indicates people are returning to the work force. Inflation also showed signs of rising to a healthier level. Prices increased by 1.6 percent during 2016, a percentage point more than in the previous year, although that is still below the Fed\u2019s preferred 2 percent annual pace.Ms. Yellen demurred when asked directly whether the Fed planned to raise rates at its next policy-making meeting, in March. But she reiterated the Fed\u2019s December prediction of three increases in 2017, raising the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate from its current range, 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent.\u201cIt is our expectation that rate increases this year will be appropriate,\u201d she said.Other officials have echoed that view. Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, told reporters last week that the expectation of three increases \u201cis not unreasonable.\u201d The comments are particularly noteworthy because Mr. Evans remains one of the strongest proponents of raising rates slowly to support continued growth.Investors continue to predict that the Fed will not raise rates until its June meeting, although the chance of an earlier increase rose after Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony.Ms. Yellen also offered Congress the broad advice that changes in fiscal policy should focus on long-term improvements in productivity rather than short-term growth. Here, too, she dodged questions about the details. When one senator asked for her views on a particular tax proposal, Ms. Yellen smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that.\u201dChanges in fiscal policy have the potential to scramble the Fed\u2019s economic outlook. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for measures to stimulate economic growth, like tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have suggested that the central bank would seek to offset such measures by raising interest rates more quickly because the Fed judges the economy to be growing at roughly the maximum sustainable pace already. But she reiterated that before acting, the Fed would see what Congress may do.On regulation, however, Ms. Yellen was willing to get down to basics.Gary Cohn, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser and a former Goldman Sachs executive, said this month that bank lending had been constrained by changes requiring banks to raise a larger share of funds from investors rather than lenders. Such funding protects a bank in the event of losses, because it need not be repaid.Mr. Cohn described this regulation incorrectly, saying banks were required to \u201choard\u201d capital. In fact, capital is a kind of funding; it is not held or hoarded.Under questioning by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, Ms. Yellen defended the importance of capital standards and corrected Mr. Cohn.\u201cIt\u2019s not a requirement that they stick it in a safe and it can\u2019t be used,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen agreed with Senate Republicans that the government should draw a greater distinction between the regulation of big banks and smaller institutions.Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, secured an acknowledgment from Ms. Yellen that community banks were not responsible for the 2008 financial crisis, then pressed her to explain why they had been subjected to any additional regulation.In response to a separate question about possible remedies, Ms. Yellen suggested that Congress might exempt smaller banks from requirements that are rarely relevant but still impose significant administrative costs, like limits on executive compensation.Democrats are concerned, however, that smaller changes would open the door to larger ones. They also face mounting pressure from the party\u2019s base. Before the hearing, Mr. Brown walked into the audience to address several dozen people wearing green T-shirts that read, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another crash,\u201d who came to protest the rollback of financial regulation.Mr. Brown assured them that he was on their side. \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole bunch of senators, Republicans, have forgotten that we had a financial crisis,\u201d he told them.Ms. Yellen will return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to take questions from the House Financial Services Committee, generally a livelier affair than the Senate version.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Dollar Rise or Fall? The Trump Team\u2019s Message Is Garbled", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsFor a very long time, if you asked United States government officials their view on the value of the dollar, they would almost certainly decline to answer. \u201cThe currency is the purview of the Treasury secretary,\u201d they\u2019d say.The Trump administration looks to be taking a different approach. Officials, including the president himself, have been breaking tradition and talking about currency markets \u2014 and in many cases, suggesting that the dollar is too highly valued.But the Trump administration has also offered contradictory signals about just what it wants to see happen on currency markets, with tension building between the administration\u2019s stated goals and the policies it says it advocates. Predicting the direction of currency policy in the Trump administration requires parsing the words and policy proposals that come from several different places.Mr. Trump enlarged on this theme in comments this week at a meeting with pharmaceutical executives. \u201cWe know nothing about devaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery other country lives on devaluation. You look at what China\u2019s doing, you look at what Japan has done over the years \u2014 they played the money market, they played the devaluation market, and we sit there like a bunch of dummies.\u201dTaking the president\u2019s words at face value, we would seem to be in for a deliberate effort by the administration to reduce the value of the United States currency relative to its neighbors, in hopes of giving U.S. exporters an advantage and reducing the trade deficit.That is also the tone that Peter Navarro, the director of the White House\u2019s national trade council, struck in an interview with The Financial Times this week. He described the euro as \u201cgrossly undervalued,\u201d which would imply that the dollar is too strong against the world\u2019s other most widely used currency.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, has tried to take a more balanced approach to talking about the valuation of the dollar. While trying not to undercut his boss, he has made the point that over the longer run a strong domestic economy will cause the dollar to increase in value.\u201cThe currency is very, very strong, and what you see is people from all over the world wanting to invest in the U.S. currency,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in his confirmation hearing. \u201cI think when the president-elect made a comment on the U.S. currency, it was not meant to be long-term comment. It was meant to be that perhaps in the short term, the strength in the currency as a result of free markets and people wanting to invest here may have had negative impacts on \u2014 on our ability in trade.\u201dBut even that nuanced thought from Mr. Mnuchin is in tension with the concrete outcomes in the currency markets that are resulting from his administration\u2019s policies.And more broadly, if the administration\u2019s plan to cut taxes and increase infrastructure comes to fruition, it implies that interest rates in the United States will be higher than they otherwise would be. Higher interest rates will bring global investors, with their assets, flocking into the United States and propel the dollar even higher.Any administration has a range of tools it can use to influence the value of the currency. It can set trade policies, use diplomatic pressure on trading partners, make public statements and appoint people to the Federal Reserve who are inclined toward either looser money or tighter money.So in the months ahead, the Trump administration will have to decide if it really intends to follow through on the president\u2019s words about the need to devalue the dollar. Or it will follow the long tradition in the United States of viewing a strong currency as a sign of strength, not weakness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Headlights Get New Attention as More Than a Car Design Flourish", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsOver the last 30 years, as automotive lighting has graduated from incandescent bulbs to halogen, xenon and now LED, headlamps have definitely gotten brighter.But they haven\u2019t necessarily gotten better.In a study last year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the headlights for only one of 31 vehicles tested \u2014 a Toyota Prius v \u2014 earned a \u201cgood\u201d rating. Ten models had \u201cpoor\u201d headlamps. The worst performer of the lot: one version of BMW\u2019s luxury 3 Series sedan.Making good headlamps is not a mystery or even a technical challenge. Often, though, as much focus is put on how they look as part of the car design as on how well and where they throw light.\u201cAesthetic design, not road performance, has been controlling headlamps,\u201d said Adrian Lund, the president of the insurance institute.But that could be changing. This year, for the first time, the institute will give its coveted highest safety rating, known as Top Safety Pick Plus, only to vehicles whose headlights receive a minimum \u201cadequate\u201d score.The new focus on lights will most likely push automakers to ensure that their lamps not only shine brightly, but also do so far enough down the road. Already, BMW stopped offering the poorly rated halogen lamps on its 3 Series sedans; as a result, the car was designated a Top Safety Pick Plus.\u201cHeadlamps have not been viewed as the safety component that they should be,\u201d said Jennifer Stockburger, the director of operations for the auto test center for Consumer Reports, which also examines headlight quality.The insurance institute first started testing headlights in 2016 to see how well lamps that swiveled around bends, known as curve-adaptive headlamps, would perform. It found that property damage liability claim rates fell 9 percent for those cars that had curve-adaptive headlamps.Working with the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the Consumers Union, the institute then developed headlamp performance standards. It designated how far both low and high beams should reach around curves and in a straightaway without providing glare.To be rated acceptable, the second-highest rating, high-beam headlights have to shine at least 492 feet down the road, and 328 feet down the right side of the road on low settings.By law, headlamps today can be of any shape, as long as the light output meets specifications set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Headlamps must also adequately avoid glare, or dazzle as it is known in Europe, for oncoming vehicles and pedestrians.As a result, vehicle manufacturers generally put a lot of effort into making their headlights stand out as part of a vehicle\u2019s design statement, creating lights that swoop, are flush to the body, or are angled in a way that reflects the vehicle\u2019s sheet metal.But minimum illumination distance is not mandated, and manufacturers self-certify that their lamps meet the light output criteria.And once on the road, a variety of factors \u2014 including lamps that weren\u2019t aimed properly at the factory or even springs that haven\u2019t settled into place yet \u2014 can sharply reduce the ability of a headlamp to shine down the road or light up the important places.Newer technologies, such as xenon and LED lamps, project light that is brighter and whiter than what traditional incandescent bulbs cast, giving the illusion that they are better. But if they\u2019re incorrectly aimed, they can actually perform worse than older halogen systems, Mr. Lund of the insurance institute said.When testing headlights, Consumer Reports aims the headlamp according to government specifications. The insurance institute tests lamps as they arrive on the vehicle from the manufacturer. The group says that method gives the consumer a better sense of real-world performance.Regardless of approach, both groups have found vehicle makers to be responsive to their criticisms.\u201cThe manufacturers are absolutely interested in our results,\u201d said Ms. Stockburger of Consumer Reports. \u201cThey\u2019ve changed the performance of their headlamps and improved them over the years that we\u2019ve been testing.\u201dThe insurance institute found a similar reaction.The headlamp performance of BMW\u2019s 2 Series xenon lamps went from \u201cmarginal\u201d to \u201cgood,\u201d simply by re-aiming the lamps.Fiat Chrysler moved to LED lamps for all but the base model of the Jeep Wrangler, and now offers xenon lamps as an option on the Jeep Renegade.And even better lighting systems could be coming soon.One new system, generically known as adaptive driving beams, illuminates the road using around 50 to 100 distinct LEDs or, as in the case of BMW, a lamp that changes angles. The goal is to get the reach of high beams without throwing glare.When onboard cameras sense oncoming vehicles or pedestrians, the lights can adjust automatically, either by dimming individual LEDs in the lamp or moving the light down and to the side, in essence providing always-on high beams without shining the beam into the eyes of other drivers.Adaptive driving beam headlamps are available from several manufacturers, like Audi, the Opel division of General Motors and Mercedes-Benz in Europe, but they\u2019re not yet legal in the United States. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that can change the rules, is now weighing recommendations to make those lights legal.\u201cWe\u2019re very excited about adaptive driving beams,\u201d said David Hines, director of the agency\u2019s office of crash avoidance standards. He would not predict when the standard would be approved, however.Further into the future are pixel beam headlamps, essentially matrix beam headlamps on steroids. They will use more than a thousand individually controlled LEDs that turn on and off to light or mask small oncoming objects.Developed by Osram and other lighting manufacturers, pixel beams will be able to shut light off to objects as small as a driver\u2019s face, or a rearview mirror, said Bart Terburg, Osram\u2019s automotive regulations manager. These new systems will start appearing on cars in about four years, he said.The federal government will also soon join the insurance institute and Consumer Reports in providing headlamp ratings for prospective buyers, much as it now reports on crash-worthiness and fuel economy. It hopes that such data will appear beginning with model-year 2019 vehicles. Such ratings could also increase pressure on automakers to do a better job with lighting.\u201cWe want to help illuminate the road,\u201d Mr. Lund of the insurance institute said, \u201cnot just make cars prettier.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "But Chatman wasn\u2019t a firefighter by trade \u2014 he was a prisoner of the State of California. For his work that night, Chatman received 45 cents an hour after paying the state restitution. By comparison, the average career firefighter earns about $23 per hour. Across the U.S., millions of prisoners are forced to work and are paid a pittance for it \u2014 or nothing. Conditions can be harsh, and prison workers lack most labor protections. What makes this possible is a clause in the 13th Amendment, passed by Congress in 1865 to abolish slavery. It allows for involuntary servitude \u201cas a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\u201d The clause effectively legalized forced labor, legal scholars say, allowing the South to arrest former slaves en masse after the war to create an unpaid work force to rebuild its economy. \u201cTo talk about how we got where we are today, we have to start with slavery and see how the justice system took over as a system of social control,\u201d says Ngozi Ndulue, senior director of criminal justice programs at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Today, the country's incarcerated population of 2.3 million people is disproportionately black \u2014 38 percent versus 13 percent in the overall population \u2014 and social researchers describe our prison system and its supply of \u201cfree labor\u201d as a new form of slavery. This subjugation often continues after release, as formerly incarcerated individuals can\u2019t ever fully re-enter society; some are denied access to housing and other benefits, even an identity card. \u201cI had to open a bank account with a prison ID. That\u2019s the only thing you have with your picture on it,\u201d says Chatman, who was in prison on a drug offense. \u201cSo you\u2019re still in jail.\u201d The toll of a prison sentence can extend well beyond the individual. \u201cPrisons and our system of mass incarceration have a way of erasing entire communities, entire populations,\u201d says Michelle Alexander, author of \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d who is featured in \u201c13TH,\u201d the Oscar\u00ae-nominated documentary exploring racial inequality in the U.S. through the lens of mass incarceration. ollowing emancipation, Southern states devised a system known as \u201cconvict leasing.\u201d In this \u201cconvenient\u201d arrangement, private contractors paid fees to the government and fed, housed and clothed convicts. In return, they used these convicts \u2014 almost all black \u2014 as workers in labor-intensive industries such as mining and farming. While slaves had cost up to $2,500 apiece at the time, after 1865 prisoners could be purchased for pennies. If there was a shortfall in the work force, local law enforcement authorities simply made more arrests, whether a crime was actually committed or not. \u201cOnce the system of mass incarceration began to grow, it became quickly apparent that a lot of money could be made,\u201d says Alexander. The system proliferated throughout the 20th century as successive administrations \u2014 Republican and Democratic \u2014 tried to outdo each other in being tough on crime. The \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d was a key driver of swelling prison populations, disproportionately affecting black communities. \u201cAfrican American and white youth use [illegal] drugs at about the same rate. And yet, African Americans are six times more likely to wind up in prison,\u201d says Van Jones, president and cofounder of #cut50, an initiative to safely halve the number of people in U.S. prisons and jails. Similar crimes often result in harsher punishments for blacks than whites. For example, conviction for selling crack cocaine (more heavily sold and used by people of color) can result in a sentence 100 times more severe than for selling the same amount of powdered cocaine (more heavily sold and used by whites). Tougher sentencing compounded racial imbalances in prison populations. In California, the 1994 \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law doubled the time a defendant with a prior conviction of a serious felony served for a second offense. For those with two or more prior strikes, the law mandated a prison term of 25 years to life. The result of policies such as these created a surge in the number of African Americans in prison. By 1993, the incarceration rate of blacks was seven times that of whites. \u201cMass incarceration has to be viewed as a manifestation of our longer history of racial inequality,\u201d says Bryan Stevenson, executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, who is featured in \u201c13TH.\u201d uring his many years in prison, Shaka Senghor \u2014 who began a sentence at the age of 19 after being convicted of second-degree murder \u2014 was also part of the prison labor force. He worked in the prison kitchen for 17 cents an hour. Senghor \u2014 featured in \u201c13TH\u201d and now an author and director's fellow of the MIT Media Lab \u2014 was lucky because he was highly literate. \u201cI learned quickly that I had no desire to do hard labor for 17 cents an hour, so I figured out how to utilize my skill set in ways that would be helpful,\u201d he explains. However, for many of those in prison, this is impossible. \u201cUnfortunately, the average reading level in prison is about third grade,\u201d he says. For those without educational, artistic or other opportunities, the experience was \u201cone big warehouse of misery,\u201d he says. Private companies are taking advantage of this labor pool, too \u2014 in part because it\u2019s cheap, but also because incarcerated workers can help secure federal contracts. \u201cCorporations are once again exploiting people who have been labeled criminals and paying them wages that we condemn in third-world countries,\u201d says Alexander. The system itself has also produced cottage industries that benefit from its continued operation. In public prisons, guard unions push for \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies to ensure job security for their members. Prisons are economic hubs, requiring supplies of goods and services. \u201cIt's like having a massive hotel in the middle of your town,\u201d says Jones, who is featured in \u201c13TH.\u201d With incarceration supporting an $80 billion a year industry, he argues that the profit motive is a big part of the problem. \u201cThere are a lot of people who make money,\u201d he says. \u201cThat has now infected our criminal justice system in a very pernicious way.\u201d ncarceration\u2019s effects often persist after a prisoner is released. Depending on the state, former inmates can be denied everything from public housing and welfare to college loans and the right to vote. A criminal record makes it harder to get a job, especially one that pays well. \u201cYou're willing to benefit from a captive population, you're so-called \u2018helping\u2019 them with their rehabilitation, but then you won't hire people who are convicted of a felony for a job in the real world,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThat is incredibly unjust.\u201d To explain the stigma faced by people with felony convictions \u2014 and particularly African Americans \u2014 Jones uses an analogy: When you see something coiled up under a bush, \u201cYou jump because it might be a snake \u2014 turns out it was just a garden hose, but it's that instant reaction,\u201d he says. Likewise, \u201cYou walk down the street and see a black guy walking toward you ... you may have that instant apprehension,\u201d he adds. Multiplied out through countless life moments \u2014 from job interviews to police stops \u2014 \u201cthat split second of apprehension gives you a certain set of outcomes.\u201d This discrimination not only harms former prisoners but also broader society, since without access to social services, they are more likely to re-engage in criminal behavior. Children and family members suffer, too. \u201cOnce you're branded a criminal or a felon, you often find it difficult or nearly impossible to work, which means that you're not going to be able to support your children,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cIt has devastating impacts for children, who are far more likely to be incarcerated [later in life] if their parent has been.\u201d Even if former prisoners manage to develop successful careers, they continue to be denied rights given to other citizens. Senghor discovered this when he was prevented from visiting Canada to give a TED Talk because his prior conviction made it illegal to leave the country. He cites the case of a friend who, for the same reason, was barred from chaperoning his daughter on a school trip. In this way, former prisoners are never fully free. \u201cYou start serving a different sentence,\u201d says Senghor. \u201cAnd it's a sentence that appears to be much more permanent than the one that we actually served on the inside.\u201d hatman\u2019s story demonstrates that a successful postprison life is possible. Once sentenced to six life sentences plus 125 years for armed robbery and drug offenses under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law, he is now an operations manager in a company of more than 4,000 people. He says that, once released, many formerly incarcerated individuals are hungry to take part in society. \u201cA lot of people, given the opportunity, just want to be good citizens,\u201d he says. But to allow more people to take this path, help is needed. To be sure, fundamental reform \u2014 in laws, sentencing and prison practices \u2014 is key to ending the cycle of forced labor that disproportionately affects blacks. Yet as awareness of the problem of prison labor increases, the appetite for change is growing, with a range of initiatives emerging along with evidence of their success. For example, 75 percent of graduates of drug courts that provide sentence alternatives like treatment with supervision never see another pair of handcuffs. For Chatman, who was featured in the film \u201cThe Return,\u201d his key support tools were Alcoholics Anonymous, which he was able to access while incarcerated, and Homes of a Loving Father, a spiritual recovery program for men just out of prison. Meanwhile, financial incentives still need to be changed, says Jones, so that rather than paying to incarcerate people, payments reward successful rehabilitation. \u201cIf we're going to be a free-market system, then let's have real competition for these different models and allocate the dollars based on who's giving us the most community safety,\u201d he says. Jackson sees firsthand the effects of rehabilitation. Her organization hires formerly incarcerated people who, she says, are the hardest workers on staff: \u201cThey are really excited to have a second chance.\u201d She sees potential in everything from bipartisan support for rehabilitation programs to companies' willingness to develop best practices for hiring formerly incarcerated individuals. \u201cThere is a lot of stuff to be hopeful for,\u201d she says. The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

He made it clear that he plans to smash a pillar of the economic recovery.Diluting or repealing Dodd-Frank would be a grave setback. It would reassert the deregulatory sentiment that preceded and precipitated the financial booms and busts of recent decades, including the dot.com bust of the early 2000s and the mortgage bust that preceded the bank bailouts of 2008. Recession was a feature of both calamities. In each case, jobs, wages and wealth took hits from which many American workers have been unable to fully recover while those at the apex of income and wealth emerged even richer.The Dodd-Frank Act has imposed rules and regulations on what had become a largely deregulated financial system. The law\u2019s overarching aim is to protect workers and consumers by countering the financial speculation, reckless lending and price gouging that inflate bubbles. By design, such rules make it harder for banks to make money, which is why bankers have fought so hard to weaken and repeal Dodd-Frank.Until Mr. Trump, however, their rollback efforts were of limited success. Under Dodd-Frank, the financial system has become more stable and more responsive to human and economic needs.Mr. Trump either does not understand or does not care that rolling back Dodd-Frank will undercut his pledge \u2014 and his opportunity \u2014 to fully revive the job market. History has affirmed that bolstered economic activity in the wake of major financial deregulation is a prelude to disaster for anyone whose economic well-being depends on jobs, wages and salary.

But even if looser credit would help hiring \u2014 a very big if \u2014 the main problem in the job market today is not too few jobs, but wages that have been too low for too long.

{"Headline": "Why Falling Home Prices Could Be a Good Thing", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySimplifying ShelterSuppose there were a way to pump up the economy, reduce inequality and put an end to destructive housing bubbles like the one that contributed to the Great Recession. The idea would be simple, but not easy, requiring a wholesale reframing of the United States economy and housing market.The solution: Americans, together and all at once, would have to stop thinking about their homes as an investment.Another big problem: High rent and home prices prevent Americans from moving to cities where jobs and wages are booming. That hampers economic growth, makes income inequality worse and keeps people from pursuing their dreams.In this thought experiment, housing prices would probably adjust. They would be somewhat cheaper in most places, where population is growing slowly. But they would be profoundly cheaper in places like super-expensive San Francisco.According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that\u2019s what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.We would still see homes of different sizes and styles \u2014 condos in some places, single-family homes in others \u2014 depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project\u2019s timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.That is a theoretical figure that includes easy-to-see things like increased sales of building materials and more jobs for construction workers. Most of the increase, however, would come from more abstract gains like increased wages for people who are willing to move from an economically distressed city to a faster-growing economy elsewhere, but are currently unable to because housing is too expensive.Over time, the accelerated pace of building could lead to a long-run deflation in home values. But for the most part that would be limited to a few coastal cities. And while the older homeowners there would most likely be resentful of all the new apartments, condos and townhomes that caused their home equity to shrivel, younger people would have an easier time getting started.Moreover, it\u2019s likely that lower home prices would encourage workers to move farther and more often in search of job opportunities. The impact on mobility could be huge, as the $1.5 trillion figure shows.Today, people with less education tend to go where housing is cheap, like Las Vegas, while college-educated workers with skills that are in demand still go to places where wages are high, like the Bay Area.Finally, if housing were plentiful and cheap, we would probably stop having big housing bubbles. One good way of describing a speculative bubble is a moment when society deludes itself into believing that something plentiful is scarce, or will soon be. In the mid-2000s, banks and homeowners came to believe that homes would be scarce in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, even though there were enough materials, land and labor to keep building and building and building.Housing is particularly prone to bubbles because, in contrast with other products, we seem to want it more when it is expensive and less when it is cheap. And no matter how many times we look out an airplane window to see vast acres of emptiness, we somehow still believe that land is a great investment because nobody is making more of it.Homes would still hold a lot of value; they still might appreciate, if more slowly; and desirable neighborhoods would still seem relatively expensive. But there would probably be fewer manias in which people expect home prices to double in just a few years.Just as we don\u2019t expect to make a profit selling our cars, if we stopped thinking of our homes as big moneymakers, we would probably start focusing on building them faster and less expensively.Homes would be stacked together, creating de facto apartment buildings that could be built and unbuilt in a few weeks. Although that wouldn\u2019t do much to help a family of four, it might take some pressure off the housing market by directing younger people to studios instead of having them pile in together, freeing up some three-bedroom apartments for families.For now, Americans seem unlikely to embrace this vision on a large scale, and even if they did, it would take a long time to start seeing home prices drop or flatline. But mass-produced homes from the past \u2014 brick townhouses or bungalows that came from a Sears catalog \u2014 are now sought after, so this imaginary world needn\u2019t be uglier, though it very well may be.Also, even if homes were a lot cheaper, we would probably retain the societal benefits of homeownership: As Mr. Glaeser and Mr. Gyourko\u2019s data shows, housing is already relatively affordable in the vast majority of American cities. So there is little reason to believe that people would desert overpriced neighborhoods if they suddenly became cheaper.This does not mean that select places like New York\u2019s West Village or San Francisco\u2019s Mission District would suddenly be affordable \u2014 or that American cities would suddenly fill up with towering condominiums and blocks of identical rowhouses. Housing is a regional problem, spread across miles of cities and suburbs, so a lot of new development would probably occur in close-in suburbs where there is more land than people think.Take Boston. The median Boston suburb has a minimum lot size of one acre, and many suburbs have minimum lot sizes of one home per two or four acres. That is a huge drag on the region\u2019s overall housing supply, according to Mr. Glaeser.Yes, adding more homes, even medium-density ones, would annoy people looking for less crowded quarters. But the nation as a whole would probably be better off, both in jobs and in financial security. The money not spent on housing could flow to other, possibly more productive, investments \u2014 like stocks in new companies or bonds for infrastructure projects.Of course, our view of homeownership is so entrenched in our economy, our political system and our tax code that it would be impossible to change in a short time, and probably even in a long time. But there could be political and societal benefits. What if local decisions that today are dictated by fears of declining property values could instead be made with an eye toward what\u2019s best for education or job growth?The point of this thought experiment isn\u2019t to embrace it full-on, but to open our eyes to the negatives of the national obsession of owning a home, expecting its value to rise, and using the levers of local government to keep neighborhoods as they are.Advertisement"}

Save for a few courageous senators, the G.O.P. has melted into spinelessness. The mainstream media can expose misbehavior, but can\u2019t veto legislation. The Democrats control no levers of power. And Jared Kushner couldn\u2019t even stop the Steve Bannon-led White House from issuing a Holocaust Remembrance Day decree that deliberately omitted any reference to Jews.The only group whom Trump has some respect for, who can get access to him and who can maybe counter the malign ideological instincts of Bannon & Company are the likes of Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Jeff Immelt, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jamie Dimon, Mike Bloomberg, Elon Musk, Indra Nooyi, Ginni Rometty, Dennis Muilenburg and Doug McMillon.Sure, if Trump executes on his promises for deregulation, infrastructure and tax reform, your companies will enjoy a quick sugar high. But if you listen to what Trump and Bannon are saying, their vision of America and the world is unlike anything you business leaders have encountered before.They are playing with, and happy to dispense with, big systems \u2014 like Nafta, the World Trade Organization and the European Union \u2014 that drive so much of the global economy. They believe things that are provably wrong \u2014 that the majority of job loss in America is from Mexicans and Chinese, when in fact it\u2019s from microchips and computers, i.e., improved productivity.Yes, some things are true even if Trump believes them: Islam does have problems with gender and religious pluralism, and integration in Western societies. Ignoring that is reckless.And while we\u2019re talking dangerous, why are there record numbers of migrants flooding out of sub-Saharan Africa, the Mideast and Central America, trying to get into Europe and America? Two big reasons are droughts and population explosions. And what do Trump and Bannon propose? Ignoring climate change and halting U.S. government help with family planning in the developing world.Nothing is connected in their world. Everything is just a box to check or wall to build.When someone tells you he is giving birth to a \u201cnew political order\u201d in America, be afraid. Yes, the acceleration in technology and globalization has particularly benefited higher-skilled knowledge workers in the West and lower-skilled rising middle classes in Asia. And, yes, it did squeeze middle-skilled workers in the West, who were more vulnerable to outsourcing, algorithms and automation. More needs to be done to help them.If Trump is simply out to negotiate better trade deals for America and get our allies to share the burdens of defending the free world more equitably, God bless him. That can be a win for our workers.But I fear that Bannon is manipulating Trump into a more messianic mission \u2014 that his \u201cnew political order\u201d is not just about jobs, but culture, an attempt to recreate an America of the 1950s: a country dominated by white Christians, not \u201ccosmopolitans\u201d; where no one spoke Spanish at the grocery store; where America\u2019s biggest C.E.O.s weren\u2019t named Satya or Sundar; where every worker could have a high-wage middle-skilled job; and where trade walls and the slow pace of automation meant you didn\u2019t have to be a lifelong learner.If that\u2019s where Trump is going, it will take us to a dark place. The way we lift American workers is not by building higher walls, but rather stronger communities \u2014 where business, philanthropies, the local school system and local government forge adaptive coalitions to enable every worker to engage in lifelong learning and every company to access global markets and every town to attract the smart risk-takers who start companies.That is exactly what is happening in America\u2019s best communities, and the job of government is to scale it, and the job of big business is to defend it. So don\u2019t be fooled by a Trump sugar high; your businesses will thrive only if America is the country that prepares itself and its workers to live in a world without walls, not one that goes around erecting them.This is the \u201cnew political order\u201d we need and that you must defend. You ignore this mission at your \u2014 and our \u2014 peril.An earlier version of this column misstated, in two instances, the surname of the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. He is Jamie Dimon, not Diamond.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Deportation Order Risk: Immigrants Driven Underground", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterNew deportation rules proposed by the Trump administration risk creating an American underclass with parallels to others around the world: slum residents in India, guest workers in oil-rich Persian Gulf states and internal migrant workers in China.Those groups provide a cautionary tale for what could happen if the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, as well as their family members, are forced deep into the shadows.Stuck in a gray zone outside the legal system, they are vulnerable to exploitation, including wage theft and sex trafficking. Because they are denied formal protections or services, informal alternatives take their place \u2014 creating an ideal space for corruption, gangs and other forms of criminality.The result is often the precise opposite of what the administration is seeking: not a cohesive society but a fragmented one, not less crime but more, and, rather than ending undocumented immigration, deepening the secrecy that makes it difficult to manage.In the United States, undocumented immigrants have always lived in limbo, officially illegal but often tolerated. But President Trump\u2019s new rules, aimed at reconciling that contradiction, risk deepening it. As a result, they could increase the burdens on undocumented migrants and, more broadly, on society.This kind of underclass begins with a gap between law and reality.India\u2019s slums, for instance, are often portrayed as emblems of the country\u2019s struggle with poverty. But they also signal India\u2019s failure to keep up with its rapidly growing urban populations. People who migrate to cities, unable to find sufficient affordable housing, improvise sprawling settlements that become more permanent.While cities often tolerate these illegal settlements \u2014 their residents help drive the economy \u2014 there is always a chance that slums can be cleared. Residents, living in legal limbo, can\u2019t get access to full state services or, often, rely on the protection of the police.Rural laborers who move to cities for work have been vital to China\u2019s economic growth for decades. But the hukou system ties their right to services to their residential status.As a result, a quarter billion urban workers are registered as rural, cutting them off from basic services like health care in the cities where they live. Their children are even denied education \u2014 urban schools serve only children registered as urban \u2014 entrenching their status as a permanent underclass.America\u2019s undocumented immigrants live under a similar contradiction between law and reality. Though millions reside in the United States, often bolstering local economies, being in the wrong place at the wrong time could lead to deportation.Previous administrations focused on deporting criminals, giving most undocumented people tacit permission to feel secure in basic interactions with the state.The Trump administration\u2019s new deportation rules will, by radically expanding who can be targeted for deportation, remove that security and heighten the burdens of life in limbo.The gulf states of the Middle East demonstrate how creating an underclass can also invite abuse and corruption.This system, though legal, forces foreign workers outside of anything resembling a formal set of laws. Allegations of abuse are widespread, including wage theft and forced labor.Undocumented immigrants in the United States face a similar problem. Economic conditions attract workers, but their illegal status prevents the state from either protecting them or ensuring that their labor is regulated and taxed in a way that fairly benefits everyone.India\u2019s slums demonstrate another issue: Residents, cut off from basic services and the justice system, need something to take their place. Often, it is criminal elements that rush in to fill the vacuum.People need electricity, for instance, but when anyone who diverts electricity into a slum city is by definition a criminal, then criminals will fill that need. The same goes for sewers, electricity and basic security \u2014 a need that tends to produce violent protection rackets.\u201cPeople within that territory are considered part of the gang\u2019s agreement of protection,\u201d Dr. Fox said.American immigration restrictions have long created a similar vacuum. Undocumented migrants turn to criminal smugglers for help entering and leaving the country, for instance.Mr. Trump\u2019s new deportation rules risk extending this vacuum across the border into much of the United States. If millions of undocumented migrants and their family members conclude they cannot call the police to report a crime without risking deportation, they will lose formal legal protections. Only informal alternatives would remain.Rather than bolstering the rule of law, these rules could open a yet wider space where it does not exist.These informal systems persist because they work just well enough for just enough people, Dr. Fox said.In India, for instance, the slums provide just enough of a solution for everyone \u2014 slum dwellers survive day-to-day, criminal groups extract their slice and local officials siphon off something for themselves. This means that everyone works to preserve the equilibrium, despite its costs.\u201cThere\u2019s always a kernel of hope that these hybrid systems are going to evolve\u201d into something more sustainable, Dr. Fox said, \u201cbut unfortunately the fact of their hybridity makes them susceptible to shifting political winds.\u201dWhen these systems come under inevitable pressure to reform, that can happen in one of two ways \u2014 expelling the populations or bringing them out of the shadows \u2014 but neither has proved easy.Mr. Trump is trying the first option, but similar efforts by other countries show that this rarely solves the underlying problem and can create new challenges.Even if slum residents are cleared out, this does not fix the problem that put them in slums in the first place: Cities need cheap labor but often don\u2019t provide cheap housing. If anything, it exacerbates the costs of this problem, with families being ejected from the legal limbo of the slums to the lawlessness of living on the street.A lesson from such efforts: Populations who live in legal limbo are not the cause of the problem, but rather a symptom. Targeting them with expulsion can end up deepening the underlying issue, making it costlier and harder to resolve.Efforts to move such communities out of the shadows have also run into problems.The United States has itself granted periodic amnesties to undocumented migrants. But while this temporarily reduces pressure on migrants and on the state, it leaves the underlying problem in place \u2014 and tends to prompt a populist backlash that leads to policies like Mr. Trump\u2019s deportation rules.These marginalized communities are often targeted by populists, Dr. Fox said, precisely because their status leaves them unable to fight back.By definition, any effort to fix such a system means upsetting whatever equilibrium has developed. When that happens, it is almost always the most vulnerable \u2014 the slum residents, the migrant workers, the undocumented immigrants \u2014 who will suffer the consequences.Advertisement"}

Tillerson; at the White House with Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser; and with Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump who is also the president\u2019s son-in-law.Ms. Mogherini said she and Trump administration officials remained in disagreement on some issues, including refugees and migration, climate change and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201cI will go back to Brussels clearly with the sense that, yes, we have differences,\u201d she said.More broadly, Ms. Mogherini said that an administration that has made \u201cAmerica First\u201d its guiding principle will find that Europe can be equally self-interested. And she politely reminded everyone just how vital Europe is to the economy and security of the United States.Mr. Trump has a jaundiced view of the European Union, seeing it as a trading rival and predicting that other member nations will follow Britain in voting to leave. His attitude is such a stark contrast with that of Mr. Obama that the European Council president, Donald Tusk, recently placed Mr. Trump on a list of threats to the union alongside radical Islam.Ms. Mogherini said she sensed a gradual shift in the administration\u2019s attitudes. \u201cI think that it is becoming more and more clear that the European Union is an indispensable partner in some fields,\u201d she said.But she is not counting on a complete transformation. \u201cIn international relations, you don\u2019t base your work on hope,\u201d she said.She bluntly warned the administration not to nominate an ambassador to the European Union who is critical of the bloc, as has been rumored, or attempt to negotiate a bilateral trading agreement with Britain for years.\u201cThe European Union is here to stay,\u201d she said, adding that even though Britain may leave, \u201cthe other 27 will stick together and stay together because it\u2019s in their interests to do so. I\u2019ve never seen them more determined.\u201dMs. Mogherini implied that the European Union could start picking off some of the United States\u2019 most likely free-trade partners.Among Mr. Trump\u2019s first actions was to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trading pact. China is already hoping to replace the United States as a trading partner in Asia, and Ms. Mogherini suggested that her bloc could do the same elsewhere.A deal between the European Union and Canada is scheduled to be finalized next week, and other deals could be in the offing \u201cas our partners in the world are looking more and more to Europe as a reliable partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Activism Hits Even the Less Flashy Tech Companies", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As soon as President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, some of the biggest tech companies went quiet. Their executives did not sign legal briefs, brandish statements or dissent on Twitter. They strove for business as usual.This was the older, stodgier, less glamorous part of the tech universe. These executives are generally not household names. Most of the companies have little presence in the excitable consumer marketplace. Some are government contractors. Their workers tend to be more settled, less tempted by cool start-ups. Despite the companies\u2019 sizable employment, the spotlight is not on them.Among these firms are IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Qualcomm, Cisco, Dell and Oracle. When 127 companies signed an amicus brief last week in a Seattle court that said the executive order \u201cviolates the immigration laws and the Constitution,\u201d none of these six firms were on the list.Yet even at some of these companies, there are stirrings of defiance. In a few well-publicized cases, workers have noisily quit. Many more have chosen to remain but are agitating for an explicit corporate morality even as Mr. Trump considers a new executive order on immigration. They want their companies to make clear not only what they support but also, perhaps even more important, what lines they will not cross.The activist push is being driven in significant measure by women, who are still fighting for their due in a male-dominated industry. But in an unlikely twist, the chief executives they are trying to influence at two major companies are female.\u201cIn some instances it is notable for a company to take a stand on an issue,\u201d said one of the women, Irene Scher, a regional vice president of sales. \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s notable not to have taken a stand.\u201dA co-chief executive of Oracle, Safra Catz, and the chief executive of IBM, Virginia Rometty, became advisers to Mr. Trump during the transition. \u201cI know that you are committed to help America\u2019s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people,\u201d Ms. Rometty wrote to him in November. Ms. Catz said in December, \u201cWe are with him and will help in any way we can.\u201dThe three friends who created the Oracle petition joined the company in August, when it acquired the company they worked for, Opower. They emphasize they are not at odds with their employer.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a criticism of Oracle,\u201d said one of them, Rachel Kane, a sales executive at Oracle Utilities. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them visibility into how individuals at the company feel.\u201d Oracle declined to comment.Cauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM, said she believed \u201cworkplaces have a responsibility to society \u2014 to the clients we serve, the employees we hire and the citizens who are impacted by our decisions.\u201d She said IBM had been \u201cprogressive\u201d in encouraging women\u2019s participation in technology and on other issues, but had not delivered on the immigration ban.\u201cIBM\u2019s decision not to actively stand up to the Trump administration and condemn this policy is extremely disturbing,\u201d she said.Dell and Cisco declined to comment. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.The internal debate at some of the big tech companies revolves around the question of engagement: Can you persuade more from the inside than the outside?The pro-engagement position has been expressed by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and a member of the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum. In a handful of cases, people have said they are canceling new Teslas because they view him as working for the president.Mr. Musk said he had made sure that the travel ban was discussed \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d at a Feb. 3 White House meeting. A spokeswoman said no further details were available.The answer did not satisfy everyone. As one critic replied to Mr. Musk on Twitter: \u201cYou are not advising Trump, you are giving him cover and validating his nonsense. You can do more good by taking a stand. Please.\u201dIBM released a statement that said Ms. Rometty had \u201cconveyed the company\u2019s views directly to the president and the secretary of Homeland Security\u201d on Feb. 3, \u201cincluding suggestions for how technology can help to promote both national security and lawful immigration.\u201dEd Barbini, vice president for corporate communications at IBM, said no further details were available. He noted that the company said in December that it would never participate in the building of a Muslim registry. He declined to comment on the petition.When a small group of IBM employees was drawing up the petition in November, it debated including a reference to the Nazis. IBM maintains that the accounts of its role in Hitler\u2019s regime are overblown and incendiary.\u201cWatson sacrificed short-term business interests in order to be on the right side of history, something IBM takes pride in today,\u201d the petition says.Daniel Hanley, one of the organizers, said the goal was \u201cto build an organization inside the company that can hold IBM accountable to our values, and serve as a model for tech workers at other companies.\u201d\u201cWhen his policies border on the unconstitutional, the criminal and the morally unjust,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI am here to oppose him in every possible and legal way.\u201dThat was on a Monday.

{"Headline": "SoftBank of Japan Will Buy U.S. Private Equity Giant Fortress", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver its three-decade existence, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and its founder, Masayoshi Son, have been known for ambitious and sometimes head-scratching moves.Now, SoftBank is nearing its most unusual move yet: It is buying Fortress Investment Group, an American private equity giant that oversees around $70 billion in assets.Over the past three decades, SoftBank has become one of Japan\u2019s most formidable technology companies. It is perhaps best known for its telecommunications empire, which stretches from Japan to Sprint in the United States. SoftBank also has portfolio of investments that includes stakes in the Alibaba Group of China, the Japanese affiliate of Yahoo and start-ups like the online lender SoFi. At its helm, the entire time, has been Mr. Son.An American-trained businessman, Mr. Son began the business as a software distributor, but eventually moved into cellphone service and became the first Japanese carrier to embrace the iPhone. He has never been known for his modesty, repeatedly boasting about outsize ambitions like dethroning Verizon and AT&T atop the American wireless industry with Sprint.SoftBank will be paying $3.3 billion for Fortress, a premium to the company\u2019s stock market value of $2.3 billion. As part of the agreement, SoftBank has the option of bringing in partners to help cover the cost of the deal and who may want to become investors in Fortress funds, too, thus increasing assets under management.The deal frees up Peter L. Briger Jr. and Wesley R. Edens of Fortress to focus on their strengths as fund managers \u2014 several of their private equity funds have produced double-digit returns over time \u2014 without having to deal with the headaches of running a public company. As leaders of a public company, they struggled mightily to bolster their stock, more so than their competitors. Recently, the firm shut down its flagship hedge fund.The purchase of Fortress, a prominent private equity firm with a specialty in investing in distressed assets, was driven by Rajeev Misra, a former top derivatives expert at Deutsche Bank who has taken a leading role in setting investment strategy for the SoftBank Vision Fund.After leaving Deutsche Bank in 2008, where he had worked closely with Anshu Jain, who headed the bank\u2019s global markets operations, Mr. Misra went to UBS and then spent several months at Fortress, where he came to know the firm\u2019s chairmen, Mr. Briger and Mr. Edens, well.Now, Mr. Misra will be helping steer an enormous new fund that is intended to invest in technology companies worldwide, often by taking huge stakes. SoftBank is expected to contribute at least $25 billion to the fund, while partners in the fund include Saudi Arabia and Apple.All told, SoftBank will now oversee assets under management of $170 billion, making it one of the largest private investors in the world after the Blackstone Group, which manages about $330 billion.While private equity firms have performed poorly as publicly traded stocks, they are attractive in part because of their ability to lock up money for multiple years and charge high fees.As an entity that is regulated \u2014 if relatively lightly compared with, say, a bank \u2014 Fortress will have to operate at arm\u2019s length from the $100 billion Vision Fund when it comes to making investments. And the team of investors under Mr. Misra and Mr. Son will also remain unchanged.Still, it expected that there will be ample opportunity for the Vision Fund to benefit from shared intelligence between the two entities. That could mean Fortress seeing a deal in a telecommunications company that does not fit its mandate and passing it along to the Vision Fund. The transaction also widens the Vision Fund\u2019s capacity to source new investments, given Fortress\u2019s global network.For Fortress, the motivation was to join with one of the world\u2019s most innovative investors and to enter global markets, like the Middle East, where they have trailed some of their peers.Fortress went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2007, before the financial crisis. But shares of Fortress, like shares of other publicly traded private equity firms, have performed poorly in recent years. Fortress\u2019s stock price is down 80 percent since it began trading, and its executives have made no secret that the joy of being a public company has largely evaporated.The firm\u2019s struggles trace to the financial crisis, when it was slow to exit the subprime loan business, forcing heavy losses. The stock dipped below $1, and the firm did not consistently return to profitability until 2012.At the same time, Mr. Edens positioned the firm to capitalize on the economic recovery, piling back into the subprime business through its purchase of the mortgage servicer Nationstar and consumer lender Springleaf, now known as OneMain Financial. Mr. Edens, a former Lehman Brothers partner who co-founded Fortress, has turned the firm\u2019s $124 million Springleaf investment into a stake valued at roughly $2 billion.Under the terms of the deal, Fortress will become an independent subsidiary of SoftBank. Fortress\u2019s principals, who control roughly a third of the firm\u2019s voting shares, have agreed to vote in favor of the sale, which is expected to close by year\u2019s end.On Tuesday, before the deal was announced, shares of Fortress rose 6.5 percent on unusually heavy trading volume.Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And which seems to have disappeared completely from the White House radar?The answer to all three questions is Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to put his self-described talents as a builder to work by spending $1 trillion on restoring the country\u2019s crumbling bridges, potholed roads, rust-bucket trains and shabby-not-chic airports. More than a month into his presidency, no such plan has emerged, and there are no signs that one is coming anytime soon.Though the circumstances are not the same, Mr. Trump\u2019s indolence and Congress\u2019s palpable lack of initiative sit in sharp contrast to the speed with which President Obama and congressional Democrats were able to engineer a nearly $1 trillion economic stimulus bill in 2009, a task completed in less than six weeks. At the current pace, Mr. Trump\u2019s American greatness project may never get off the ground, remaining no more than a slogan on red hats, a testament to the emptiness of his populist promises to help the forgotten workers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Eritrea, a Diver\u2019s Dreamscape", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExplorerThe coral wall rose from the depths of the Red Sea, a vast and multicolor canvas brimming with sea life. I swam alongside it for 200 feet, past tangled branches, swaying ferns and brain-like spheres, and then dove toward the ocean floor. A school of black-and-yellow-stripe angelfish darted around me, while a grouper the size of a Smart car lumbered past. Rising toward the surface, I spotted a silver barracuda hovering just below the water line. Abruptly the wall ended, and I rounded the corner to confront a netherworld of rusting cables, ropes, labyrinthine corridors and cabins, and a barnacle-covered anchor.I first visited Massawa in 1993, just after Eritrea formally declared its independence, as Africa bureau chief for Newsweek, then returned three years later, when the media and Western donors were still touting the country as a success story. I hired a dive boat and a guide and for two days explored the pristine reefs of the Dahlak Archipelago, then just beginning to attract tourists.Two decades later, on a return visit last July, I again ventured to the coast, curious to see how Massawa had fared under Eritrea\u2019s harsh dictatorship, and what was left of the diving industry that, in the 1990s, had seemed poised to grow.As we waited for the office to open, he lamented Eritrea\u2019s ravaged economy and the open-ended conscription program. \u201cThe prime years of people\u2019s lives are being lost,\u201d he told me. He had used his connections to secure a dead-end posting in a ministry instead of army service, but still dreamed of fleeing. \u201cI think about escaping, every day, but now I realize I missed my chance,\u201d he said, as an official showed up on his moped two hours late and unlocked the door. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. The walls have gone up.\u201dI hired a taxi at a downtown stand, and at 8:30 the next morning, the driver, Zaki, picked me up at my hotel. It was Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, and the streets of this small city were deserted. We drove past the Ethiopian war cemetery, fields of cactus and a herd of camels, and then the Asmara escarpment came into view: a barrier of acacia-speckled mountains that extends almost to the Red Sea. Cyclists clad in red-and-white Lycra worked their way around the hairpin turns; the pop music of Mahmoud Ahmed, an Amharic singer from Ethiopia, blared from Zaki\u2019s CD player. After two hours \u2014 and a drop of nearly 8,000 feet \u2014 we reached the sandy coastal plain. A quintet of captured Ethiopian tanks marked the entrance to Massawa.Late that afternoon the hotel clerk put me in touch with Abdullah, a grizzled boat captain who spoke some Italian but no English. A friendly English-speaking Eritrean from Asmara who was sitting at the outdoor cafe offered to help me make the deal. The logistics, I quickly learned, had grown complicated. Dahlak Kebir Island, the archipelago\u2019s main attraction, was now off limits to tourists, Abdullah said. Instead he proposed a daylong scuba-diving trip to Dessie Island, not far from Dahlak, for 16,000 nakfas, or $1,020, about five times what I had paid two decades earlier.\u201cI have no business,\u201d Abdullah explained, pointing to five scuttled dive boats moored across Massawa harbor that had constituted his fleet during better times. \u201cEverything is gone.\u201d Abdullah was open to negotiation, but instead I opted for a half-day snorkeling and beach trip around Green Island, just beyond the harbor. The cost was a far more reasonable $200.The next morning, with the temperature pushing 95 degrees, I met Abdullah on the dock. Two Eritreans to whom I had been introduced the day before \u2014 Lydia, my taxi driver Zaki\u2019s sister, and her boyfriend, Berhane, a Massawa-born \u00e9migr\u00e9 living in Norway who returns home several times a year \u2014 joined me for the adventure. They had packed an ice chest with cold Asmara beers, which we loaded onto the skiff.As we puttered past the loading docks and cranes of the silent port, Berhane added his voice to the many others I had heard lamenting the country\u2019s collapse. \u201cThere are no enterprises and no construction. The government makes it impossible for you, so what else can you do but leave?\u201d he told me. Ten of his 12 siblings had fled abroad. \u201cFor many, drowning in the sea is a better option them staying here.\u201d Yet Massawa was his home, he said, and Lydia lived here with her two young sons \u2014 and so he felt obliged to return.Ten minutes after leaving the pier, Abdullah cast the anchor overboard. I strapped on my mask, snorkel and fins, and leapt off the boat. Instantly the harsh realities of Eritrea dissolved in a swirl of color and motion. The water was warm and clear, and I hovered above an extensive coral garden \u2014 a \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d tableau. Long-beaked parrotfish, big-eyed squirrelfish, translucent blue disc-shaped surgeonfish, and huge angelfish in a dozen patterns nibbled on brightly colored coral and darted through sea anemones. Schools of tetras and black mollies swept past. I chased a blue-spotted stingray, keeping a safe distance, until it darted beneath a rock, only its poisonous spine protruding from its sanctuary. After an hour spent exploring several of these coral gardens, I climbed back aboard the boat, and we headed toward Green Island. The Asmara escarpment \u2014 barren and dun colored \u2014 rose just beyond the shore. I walked along a beach alive with hermit crabs. The entire beach seemed to be in motion, tiny white conch shells skittering across the sand.At dusk that evening I walked by myself down a causeway into Massawa\u2019s Old City. I had been here 20 years before, and remembered jostling with crowds in a square filled with fish restaurants and outdoor tables. Now, wandering down deserted alleys, past mosques and crumbling archways, I searched in vain for the square. Two young couples sat on stools in the dirt courtyard of a private home. One of the women, who spoke some English, invited me to join them. I asked where all the people had gone. \u201cThey have all left \u2014 for Europe,\u201d she replied. \u201cDo you want to go, too?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe boys do, because they are both in the army, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.I ordered the sea bass, and it came quickly to my table, butterflied and grilled with paprika, served with flaky and charred flat bread. It was crisp, spicy and utterly delicious. I paid the bill and walked through the now-darkened streets, past splashes of light from a couple of grocery stores. Then I reached the causeway, and followed a set of abandoned railway tracks back to the Dahlak Hotel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Isolating China Doesn\u2019t Work", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe United States and China have been inextricably linked since the birth of America. The first fortunes made in the United States came thanks to the tea trade with China. The profits made in Canton and reinvested in America transformed the young republic into the 19th century\u2019s factory of the world. For its part, 19th-century China turned to the United States as the first country to educate its young in a desperate effort to counter the West. In the present day, the United States, with its open wallets, open universities and open society, has been by far the most important foreign enabler of China\u2019s rise.Throughout the course of this shared history, Americans have generally held that a strong China was in their interests. But now that China is strong, many Americans are not so sure. For the last decade and a half, neither side has figured out how much of the other it wants and how much of the other it hates.No matter who became United States president in 2017, a reckoning was due. China\u2019s rise has been too rapid. Along the way, Beijing has gamed the international system created by the United States to increase its growth at the expense of others, engaged in widespread industrial espionage as a shortcut to innovation, repressed free speech at home and bolstered governments abroad such as North Korea that threaten their neighbors and the United States.Regardless of political party, the majority of those in Washington who make China policy have united around the view that Beijing has, in the words of one adviser to President Trump, \u201cplayed the United States for a sucker for far too long.\u201dBut the complexity and depth of the relationship makes reconfiguring it fraught with risks. China is now a major world power, and its economy is tightly interwoven with America\u2019s. More than 300,000 Chinese students attend American universities. Chinese firms have invested upward of $100 billion in the United States. Apple sells more iPhones in China than in the United States, and 150,000 Boeing employees rely on its China sales for their jobs.In the last few weeks, both President Xi Jinping and Mr. Trump have set out to show the world how different they are. On Jan. 17 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Xi defended globalization and equated protectionism with \u201clocking oneself in a dark room.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s retort came on Jan. 20 with a fiery inauguration speech promising that in all ways he would put America first. As one of his first acts as president, Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact grouping 12 nations along the Pacific Rim, excluding China. Mr. Xi, seeking to capitalize on the folly of Mr. Trump\u2019s move, then invited those Asian neighbors abandoned by America to join a Chinese-led regional economic partnership.There is a rich irony in both approaches. At Davos, Mr. Xi portrayed himself as the un-Trump, the last defender of globalization. It was a cynical move: China\u2019s embrace of globalization can roughly be defined as having foreigners buy as much Chinese stuff as possible and demanding that foreign firms share their technological secrets with Chinese partners so that a Chinese competitor can learn to make a product at a lower price.For his part, Mr. Trump seems to be channeling more Mao Zedong than Andrew Jackson. Mao used the passions whipped up by China\u2019s fight with America during the Korean War as a way to bring his Communist revolution to the point of no return, to make China the un-America. A Chinese Communist Party directive in 1951 ordered that the admiration for the United States that coursed through Chinese society must be redirected into \u201chate the U.S. imperialists,\u201d with the goal of \u201cencouraging national self-confidence and self-respect\u201d \u2014 forever joining the yin of hating America with the yang of loving China.The Chinese Maoist thinker Zhang Hongliang said in a recent blog post that Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to put America first reminds him of Mao\u2019s famed 1949 speech that the \u201cChinese people have stood up.\u201d In Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to battle Washington\u2019s elite, Mr. Zhang sees Mao\u2019s promise to obliterate capitalist overlords and establish a \u201cpeople\u2019s government.\u201d And in Mr. Trump\u2019s maddening unpredictability there are echoes of one of Mao\u2019s famous quotes: \u201cThere is chaos under heaven, the situation is excellent.\u201dMr. Trump has returned to a more negative view of the Middle Kingdom that has shadowed America\u2019s policy of benevolent solicitude since the two countries began interacting in 1784.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations that China was \u201craping\u201d the United States over trade recalled the railings of Denis Kearney, the firebrand founder of the Workingmen\u2019s Party in 1880s California who at the end of each rally would lead the crowd in a chant, \u201cThe Chinese must go!\u201d Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Kearney masterfully merged a hatred of the robber barons \u2014 the elites of the day \u2014 with a fear of China.The Workingmen\u2019s Party used its heft to lobby Washington to bar Chinese people from America\u2019s shores. This coalesced in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which, in its prohibition of Chinese laborers\u2019 traveling to America, was the first time Americans targeted a specific immigrant group for exclusion from the United States. Sound familiar?Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics mark an end to the strategy pursued for decades by American leaders who held that an open America would create a more open China. In this, he is ignoring the main lesson of the two countries\u2019 shared history: Isolating China doesn\u2019t work.It took 61 years for the United States to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, and it did an enormous amount of hurt. It persuaded the Chinese to favor Communism over capitalism and kept the Chinese community in America isolated, small and scared.Ignoring China in the 1950s did a similar disservice. Indeed, Mao was clearly petrified of closer ties with America, telling the Soviet ambassador in January 1955 that a lack of relations with the United States \u201cgives us the chance to more freely educate our people in the anti-American spirit.\u201dStarting a trade war with China or gearing up for a military conflict in the South China Sea will do very much the same. It will push China into a defensive crouch, validate its paranoia and allow it to nurture its anti-American fears. It will also provide Mr. Xi with the opportunity to profit from Mr. Trump\u2019s missteps, to appear statesmanlike when Mr. Trump appears bellicose, to bully Taiwan and to make China\u2019s repressive system of government seem more attractive.Far better for Mr. Trump to use his maddening unpredictability and all the leverage available to an American president to dare China to open its society further and to become a responsible world leader. The long history that binds China and the United States should strengthen the relationship, not doom it to failure.John Pomfret is the author of \u201cThe Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom: America and China, 1776 to the Present.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Limited Immigration; Now It\u2019s Short of Workers", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGIFU, Japan \u2014 Liu Hongmei was fed up with her job at a Shanghai clothing factory, where she worked long hours for little pay.So three years ago, she quit to take a job in Japan. A garment factory there promised Ms. Liu three times her $430-per-month Chinese wage, and she hoped to save thousands of dollars for her family, which was growing with the recent birth of a son.\u201cIt seemed like a big opportunity,\u201d she recalled.Call it an opportunity, maybe, but don\u2019t call it work. Legally, the time Ms. Liu spent ironing and packing women\u2019s wear in Japan is considered \u201ctraining.\u201d She had entered the murky and at times abusive world of Japan\u2019s technical trainees \u2014 essentially second-class laborers brought in from abroad to fill jobs that Japanese citizens aren\u2019t taking.Japan, on the other hand, long ago achieved what Mr. Trump has promised: It has very little illegal immigration and is officially closed to people seeking blue-collar work.Now, though, its tough stance on immigration \u2014 legal and illegal \u2014 is causing problems. Many Japanese industries are suffering from severe labor shortages, which has helped put a brake on economic growth.That is prompting Japan to question some fundamental assumptions about its labor needs. The debate is politically delicate, but changing realities on the ground \u2014 in Japan\u2019s factories and fields \u2014 are forcing politicians to catch up. Japan\u2019s total foreign-born labor force topped one million for the first time last year, according to the government, lifted in part by people entering the country on visas reserved for technical trainees.That growth has also led to an increase in cases of worker abuse and fraud, labor activists say.Ms. Liu is part of that debate. She arrived in Japan in debt after paying brokers $7,000 to arrange her visa. Once there, she said, she found onerous working conditions and lower-than-promised pay.Her bosses, she said, \u201ctreat us like slaves.\u201dMs. Liu and other Chinese workers at her factory came to Japan through a government-sponsored internship program. Its purpose is to square the circle between Japan\u2019s labor shortage and its ban on low-wage immigration.Farms, food-processing businesses and many manufacturers would struggle to stay afloat without foreign trainees, specialists say.\u201cPractically every vegetable in the supermarkets of Tokyo was picked by a trainee,\u201d said Kiyoto Tanno, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University.To appease business groups, the government has created immigration loopholes, and hundreds of thousands of low-wage workers like Ms. Liu have poured through them. They come from China and Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia, and they are filling empty jobs in Japan as the Japanese population shrinks, becoming a crucial if underacknowledged motor of the economy.Their numbers are soaring. The trainee program has doubled in size in the last five years, to over 200,000, according to official data, and the government is planning to expand it. The biggest source of workers has been China, but much of the recent growth has come from Vietnam.Few doubt that \u201ctraining\u201d is a fig leaf. Beyond a short period of language study, most trainees receive little or no instruction that would distinguish them from regular manual laborers, specialists and participants say.\u201cThe system is like calling a crow white,\u201d said Yoshio Kimura, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who heads the party\u2019s labor committee. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really doing is importing labor.\u201dTraining is not the only way around Japanese immigration restrictions. There are also students in part-time jobs, asylum seekers waiting for refugee applications to be processed \u2014 almost all are ultimately rejected \u2014 and South Americans of Japanese descent who can obtain special visas based on their ancestry.Eventually, Japan plans to lengthen the maximum time that trainees can stay in the country to five years, from three, and allow more kinds of businesses to hire them, including nursing homes and cleaning companies for offices and hotels.Parliament approved the creation of a new agency to oversee the trainee program last year, in response to criticism over worker exploitation. Once it is in place, the plan is to bring in more workers.Mr. Kimura and some other lawmakers want to go further, by establishing a formal guest worker system. Though it would not open a path to immigration \u2014 workers would still be expected to go home eventually \u2014 it would be more forthright than the current approach.Business groups favor the proposal, and the Liberal Democrats approved it as party policy in May. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has not indicated whether it will follow through.\u201cIf we want economic growth in the future, we need foreigners,\u201d Mr. Kimura said.Nobuya Takai, a lawyer who has represented foreign trainees in labor disputes, said the pretense that trainees are not workers contributes to problems.Companies do not hire them directly, but through a byzantine system of government and private-sector middlemen. Most trainees end up thousands of dollars in debt to pay broker fees before they even arrive, say Mr. Takai and others who have studied the program. And because trainees cannot easily switch jobs \u2014 their visas tie them to a single company \u2014 they lack what should be major leverage: the ability to walk out on a bad employer.\u201cThey can\u2019t change jobs, and they lose money if they go home,\u201d Mr. Takai said.The New York Times spoke with more than a dozen trainees. All of them said they had paid labor brokers in their home countries, usually $7,000 to $11,000, to come to Japan to work. Most borrowed the money from family or banks.The trainees came from several countries in Asia and worked in different industries, in different parts of Japan: a Cambodian construction worker, a Chinese lettuce picker, seamstresses from China and Vietnam.Complaints about unpaid labor were common. Cao Bao, a 33-year-old from Jilin Province in northeast China, worked for Kishimoto Manufacturing, a small auto parts supplier in central Japan.He said Chinese trainees there were made to clean and paint the factory on their days off, without pay, when managers found errors in their work. He was fired when he complained, he said, and a Japanese labor union has taken up his case.\u201cSome Japanese are helpful and nice, but the people at the company are different,\u201d Mr. Cao said.Masahisa Kishimoto, the company\u2019s president, said Mr. Cao had left of his own accord, and he blamed cultural differences for problems at the factory. In China, he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t clean.\u201d\u201cThere are no rules,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that you if you don\u2019t get caught, you can do anything.\u201dMr. Kishimoto referred other questions to Joho Highway Co-op, an employers\u2019 association that recruits trainees on behalf of Kishimoto Manufacturing and other local businesses. The co-op said that Kishimoto had been imposing \u201cpenalty\u201d overtime on both Japanese and Chinese workers, in violation of labor rules, and that Kishimoto had compensated the employees after the co-op intervened. Mr. Kishimoto said the company had fully complied with labor laws.Government data on workplace accidents shows that trainees are more likely to be hurt on the job than Japanese workers \u2014 a result of poor training, language barriers or more dangerous assignments. Since 2010, two trainee deaths have been recognized by the government as cases of karoshi, the Japanese term for death by overwork. Given widespread underreporting of overtime, the true number could be higher.In the financially struggling garment industry, abuses are pervasive enough that the minister of economy, trade and industry promised an inquiry last year, during a debate in Parliament over expanding the trainee program.Tham Thi Nhung, 32, a mother of two from Vietnam, said she worked from 8 a.m. to 9 or 10 p.m. Her job was to sew jackets, coats and dresses at a small clothing factory in Aichi prefecture, an industrial region in central Japan.All but one of the business\u2019s six seamstresses were Vietnamese, Ms. Nhung said. They hadn\u2019t had a day off in four months, she said, but the owner was recording only part of their overtime. In November, after the women complained that they were being underpaid by $712 a month, the owner sent a letter saying the factory was closing, and they were being laid off.A telephone number registered for Ms. Nhung\u2019s employer, Fashion Ai, was not working, and a lawyer representing the company declined to comment.\u201cWe told the boss, but she said she wouldn\u2019t pay more,\u201d Ms. Nhung said. \u201cShe told us to keep working or go back to Vietnam.\u201dMs. Liu said she emptied her savings and borrowed from relatives to cover the visa fee.Ms. Liu and her colleagues said their employer had been paying them less than the legal minimum wage for overtime, and had been overcharging them for company housing.The employer was 50-year-old Takeshi Nakahara, who along with his wife owns several small garment factories in Gifu, near Aichi. He started using Chinese trainees 15 years ago, he said in an interview, because \u201cno Japanese want to work in the apparel industry.\u201dLow wages are the only way to compete with cheap foreign factories, he added. \u201cMost manufacturers have moved overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to stay profitable.\u201dMr. Nakahara said he had been paying Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers less than minimum wage for overtime, though he said the idea had been theirs. \u201cThey demanded more overtime work,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them it wouldn\u2019t be profitable for the company, and they said they were willing to work for less.\u201dAlthough the arrangement was illegal, he said he felt betrayed when the women, nearing the end of their three-year contracts, made demands for back pay.The workers sought help from Zhen Kai, a Chinese labor activist who has lived in Japan for decades. He operates a small union office in Gifu that includes temporary rooms in which workers can stay.Mr. Zhen says that he sympathizes with the businesses and that many would have folded without the trainee program. The government, he says, has effectively kept such businesses alive by letting them exploit workers.\u201cOwners often say to me, \u2018Are you trying to destroy my company?\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Zhen negotiated with the Nakaharas, who offered a settlement, initially about $5,800.Fed up and homesick, Ms. Liu accepted the offer and was getting ready to go back to China, even though she still owed money to the relatives who helped her pay for her visa. The other four women decided to stay in Japan to fight for more compensation, and a few weeks later accepted offers of $10,000 to $16,000.Asked if they had learned anything during their ostensible training, they laughed bitterly. \u201cOnly hardship,\u201d Ms. Liu said.\u201cMy image of Japan,\u201d she said, \u201cwas that it was a good country.\u201dHisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watchmakers Look to Women in the Middle East", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlthough the last few years have been challenging for the watch industry, one sector actually has shown noteworthy growth: women\u2019s luxury timepieces in the Middle East.In 2016, the value of women\u2019s high-end watch sales in the region increased by 9 percent year over year; in 2015, the rise was 21 percent, according to the market research company Euromonitor International. (The company includes Africa in its reports on the area, but the vast majority of sales are made in the United Arab Emirates.) In comparison, the value of women\u2019s luxury timepiece sales globally grew only 1 percent last year.Even as low oil prices and other factors have roiled the region\u2019s economy, the downturn has \u201cmainly affected bigger-ticket items,\u201d said Winston Chesterfield, a research director for Wealth-X, which analyzes the spending habits of the world\u2019s wealthiest people. \u201cIn a category like this, where women are buying a watch, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to affect their bottom line all that much.\u201dAnd in the Middle East, it\u2019s all about style.\u201cThe ladies like watches with diamonds and bling,\u201d said R\u00e9my Julia, the Dubai-based head of watches in the Middle East for Christie\u2019s. \u201cMen tend to go for white gold, platinum or steel. The watch has to be very discreet, and often men try to match their watch to a pen and sometimes cuff links.\u201dAt Christie\u2019s next watch auction in the region, scheduled for March 19, nearly one quarter of the 184 featured watches are women\u2019s designs. Included are jewelry-focused pieces like a watch embellished with more than 26 carats of diamonds, called the Ladyhawke, made by Boucheron, with a Girard-Perregaux timepiece. Its value is estimated at $250,000 to $450,000.\u201cShe\u2019s a very modern woman,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s working, she\u2019s a mom at home and she has her personal life. She has different moments and different outfits.\u201dUnique versions of timepieces, usually with a higher price than the more widely distributed models, also resonate in the region. \u201cWomen in the Middle East are really looking for novelties,\u201d said Nicolas Beau, Chanel\u2019s international watch director. \u201cThey are very into newness and innovation. The Middle Eastern female customer loves exclusive watches and limited editions.\u201dSome brands have been taking advantage of the region\u2019s promise with specific products or marketing partnerships.Last year, for example, Hublot introduced two limited-edition women\u2019s watches that are available only in Dubai. One, the Classic Fusion Lady Dubai, is adorned with sapphires, amethysts and green tsavorites. Priced at $36,000, it was introduced March 8, International Women\u2019s Day.Last October, Baume et Mercier was a sponsor of Fashion Forward Dubai, a series of fashion shows, to help showcase models like the Petite Promesse, a small style that is offered with options like a bright orange leather wrap bracelet.IWC unveiled another line of watches aimed at women, the Da Vinci collection, at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva last month. A version of the style (which was introduced with options like a pink alligator strap, a narrow bezel and a circle of diamonds) is planned for sale exclusively in the Middle East this year.Global retailers also continue to consider the region among the most profitable. Net-a-Porter, the fashion e-tailer, which added luxury watches in recent months, says a third of its highest-priced watches and jewelry are sold to clients from the Middle East.The site began selling timepieces by IWC, its first luxury watch brand, in November; the sleek East West watch by Tiffany & Company was added in December. Sophie Quy, the site\u2019s buyer for fine jewelry and watches, said more luxury watches, and brands, would be added in coming months.With its female clients in mind, many watch brands have been expanding their offerings for women, especially in small dimensions.Cartier recently announced the reintroduction of its Panth\u00e8re watch, a timepiece on an articulated metal bracelet originally created in the 1980s. The iteration will be available in two petite sizes \u2014 with faces measuring 22 millimeters (just under an inch) or 27 millimeters in diameter \u2014 in April.\u201cWe knew that we wanted to present a watch for women,\u201d said Pierre Rainero, the brand\u2019s director of image, style and heritage. \u201cWe had a feeling it would be of interest for a new generation.\u201d (Kim Kardashian West\u2019s online references to the yellow-gold Panth\u00e8re bracelet that her husband, Kanye West, gave her in 2012 and photographs of celebrities wearing pieces from the collection would seem to support that opinion.)The watch range includes, along with minimalist options in steel and yellow gold, an animal-print version in 18-karat white gold, black enamel and more than 7 carats of diamonds that will retail in the United Arab Emirates for 494,000 dirhams (the equivalent of $134,465).At the Baselworld watch fair in March, a piece Chanel will be spotlighting is a new, limited-edition version of the Premi\u00e8re watch, with a link band inspired by the brand\u2019s 2.55 handbag and threaded with thin strips of crimson red leather.At the same event last year, the company highlighted an especially small watch, the J12XS, with a face about the size of an American penny.The delicacy of both pieces is in sharp contrast to, say, the brand\u2019s large ceramic watches that were popular with women a decade ago. \u201cThere was a trend for bigger watches and, as always, there are waves with trends, so it goes from bigger watches to smaller watches,\u201d Mr. Beau said.But industry observers say the appeal of smaller watches has been helped by the ubiquitous smartphone and mini-tablet.\u201cFor ages and ages, there were women who would say, \u2018I don\u2019t want a small-faced watch because I can\u2019t tell the time,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Chesterfield of Wealth-X. \u201cThey don\u2019t need their watch to do that anymore. They can have that delicacy, that femininity, without using it as a timepiece.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Commerce Pick Wilbur Ross, \u2018Inherently Bad\u2019 Deals Paid Off", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 With a panel of senators questioning him, the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross stayed on message: If confirmed as President Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, he would protect American workers and tear up bad trade deals that harmed American industry.And yet, for more than a decade, those same trade deals helped Mr. Ross amass a fortune across the globe \u2014 in countries like Mexico and China, among others. In fact, Mr. Ross has sometimes invested overseas in ways that Mr. Trump condemns.As the head of an auto parts company, Mr. Ross shipped jobs to Mexico, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he now says is unfair and must be renegotiated. That company, along with a textile firm he founded, publicly stated that Mexico was central to their growth.To some of his former associates, that history clangs against the persistent message of Mr. Trump, who has called Nafta \u201cthe single worst trade deal ever approved in this country\u201d and has excoriated American businesses for sending jobs overseas.But a spokesman for Mr. Ross described his experience as an asset, not a contradiction.\u201cAs a private businessman, Mr. Ross made pragmatic decisions based on the rules of the road at the time , and it is precisely his knowledge of how trade deals work that will allow him to be successful in renegotiating bad deals like Nafta,\u201d said the spokesman, James Rockas.The Senate is scheduled to vote on Mr. Ross\u2019s confirmation on Monday.Mr. Ross\u2019s flexible approach to trade is characteristic of many private equity barons focused on the bottom line, his former associates say. After taking over two bankrupt American textile makers more than a decade ago, for instance, Mr. Ross paid a visit to an executive of J. C. Penney Company.The industry was in turmoil, and Mr. Ross needed advice. Fellow mill owners, largely concentrated in the American Southeast, were blaming free trade for destroying their livelihoods. Many felt that sending jobs overseas, even for survival, was tantamount to treason.But for Mr. Ross, who made his name fixing bankrupt companies across a variety of American industries, hiring workers abroad made sense, former associates say. So Mr. Ross inquired about opening a mill with hundreds of workers \u2014 not in the United States, but in Vietnam.\u201cHe struck me as very practical about trade,\u201d recounted Peter McGrath, the former head of product development for J. C. Penney, who offered Mr. Ross advice. \u201cHe was on a different part of the curve than a lot of his competitors.\u201dJust over a year later, in 2006, Mr. Ross announced plans to open an $80 million state-of-the-art cotton plant in Vietnam that would employ 1,500 workers. It was one of many business decisions Mr. Ross made over the years that seemed to depart from Mr. Trump\u2019s stance against free-trade deals and the migration of jobs overseas.\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a devious person,\u201d Jock Nash, a retired lobbyist for Milliken & Company, a textile manufacturer, said of Mr. Ross. \u201cAnybody that knows how to make money is opportunistic \u2014 and they have to be to make money.\u201dHaving been tapped by Mr. Trump to lead the charge on America\u2019s worldwide trade relationships, Mr. Ross, 79, has adapted once more. In his new role, if confirmed, he will be tasked with increasing American exports to help create jobs in America. First and foremost, he told members of Congress, he would focus on Nafta.\u201cWe cannot afford trade that is inherently bad for American workers and for American businesses,\u201d Mr. Ross said during his testimony.His measured comments have taken a back seat to Mr. Trump\u2019s more vocal broadsides against the auto industry for its investments in Mexico, often via Twitter. Mr. Ross has argued that investment in Mexico hurts American economic growth, bolstering the Mexican economy while reducing investment in the United States.But Mr. Ross has made extensive investments in the auto industry south of the American border. His entry into Mexico began in 2007, a year after he began buying up the global assets of struggling American auto parts makers. He combined them into International Automotive Components, a supplier of auto interiors with factories around the world, including in Mexico and China. Sales in 2015 reached $5.9 billion.Nearly a decade ago, when his company announced the purchase of a plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, adding $300 million in sales and 1,700 employees to its payroll, Mr. Ross said the deal \u201cdemonstrates our commitment to expansion in low-cost countries.\u201dEight years later, just before Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign, the company inaugurated a brand new plant, its eighth operation in Mexico. By then, Mr. Ross\u2019s company had completed expansions at three other plants in Mexico. The future there looked bright: His company cited a forecast that Mexico would account for 25 percent of the world\u2019s growth in auto production.Mr. Ross acknowledged in the hearing that he had moved \u201ca couple of hundred\u201d jobs to Mexico, saying an automaker had demanded the shift.But he began transferring work to Mexico in the early days of his business. When Mr. Ross acquired an auto parts factory in Carlisle, Pa., a decade ago, he took a hard line with the union, demanding cuts in wages and benefits worth between a quarter and 30 percent of workers\u2019 earnings, according to Doug Carey, who was the president of Local 1739 of Unite-Here, which represented many of the workers.When the union rejected the demand, Mr. Ross shut the plant down, moving the work to North Carolina, Canada and Mexico, Mr. Carey said.\u201cWilbur Ross \u2014 there\u2019s no way he cares about the worker,\u201d said Stacey Foltz, who worked at the plant for 10 years. \u201cHe made billions of dollars taking jobs out of the country.\u201dIn other cases, even when a plant stayed open, Mr. Ross transferred production to Mexico.In 2007, after Mr. Ross acquired 11 plants from Lear Corporation that were represented by the United Automobile Workers, their bargaining committees flew to Detroit to meet him.Over lunch, they said, they listened to his pitch for turning the company around, which involved cuts to their salaries and benefits.\u201cAll the U.A.W. plants gave concessions,\u201d said Richie Franklin, the bargaining chairman for Local 2999 in Strasburg, Va. \u201cIt was a tough pill to swallow.\u201dThough grateful to Mr. Ross for turning the company around, Mr. Franklin was frustrated to see jobs vanish. Two years after the workers agreed to the cuts, Mr. Ross\u2019s company moved the production of consoles for General Motors trucks to Mexico, leaving 110 people out of work.\u201cThey just did it, and there was nothing we could do,\u201d Mr. Franklin said.In the world of textiles, Mr. Ross used a playbook developed over years. He scoured for companies in distress. Before long, he purchased two textile makers in North Carolina: Cone Mills and Burlington Mills.At the time, the industry was in upheaval. Textile and clothing manufacturers were bleeding money and jobs. Cheaper wages in Asia brought a surge of imports that helped wipe out nearly three-quarters of the industry, experts say.Finding a way forward for Mr. Ross\u2019s company, the International Textile Group, would require cheap labor in Mexico and elsewhere.\u201cI think he was one who recognized that Burlington wouldn\u2019t survive without that kind of diversification of production,\u201d said Patrick Conway, an economics professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. \u201cIt is the same juxtaposition you would see with Trump hiring foreign workers for his casinos while talking about building a wall.\u201d\u201cIt is a compartmentalization of the businessman\u2019s mind,\u201d he added.Mr. Ross began lobbying for another trade deal, one that would essentially incorporate Central America into a free-trade zone like Nafta. According to people familiar with the negotiations, he became one of the biggest proponents of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or Cafta.He became a mediator of sorts between textile makers like himself and retailers like Walmart and J. C. Penney, whose priority was giving consumers low prices, not using American fabrics.While Cafta has failed to prevent an onslaught of Chinese imported goods, Mexico remains a crucial element of the company Mr. Ross built.One-third of the International Textile Group\u2019s revenue is generated by two factories in Mexico, and in its 2015 annual report, published when Mr. Ross was still in charge, the company was clear where the future lay \u2014 not in the United States, but in Mexico and China.\u201cI.T.G.\u2019s long-term focus includes realizing the benefits of its global expansion, including reaching full production at the company\u2019s facilities in China,\u201d the company said in its report.As for Mexico, the report stated that because the company was a \u201cresident, diversified textile product manufacturer in Mexico,\u201d it \u201cbelieves that Nafta is generally advantageous.\u201dMr. Ross sold the International Textile Group in October to another private equity firm.For all the choices Mr. Ross made to open factories abroad or lay people off domestically, most who knew him during that era say he was not a heartless Wall Street tycoon. He kept jobs where he could in the United States, including in Greensboro, N.C., where the company maintains a denim mill.Bruce Raynor, a former union leader in the textile and auto parts industries, said Mr. Ross was not anti-union, as many of his Wall Street contemporaries were. Over the years, Mr. Raynor sat across the table from Mr. Ross on numerous occasions, whether negotiating contracts for textile workers or for auto parts workers.\u201cIt was a low bar to be a decent guy, but as a distressed investor, you buy things that are not doing well,\u201d said Mr. Raynor, who now runs a consulting business. \u201cBy definition, if you represent workers, and this is a company in trouble, it\u2019s not like those transactions are fun.\u201d\u201cWilbur was always very decent to work with,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that about too many of these guys.\u201dPerhaps most telling, he said, was the investment Mr. Ross made in the Amalgamated Bank, a nearly 100-year-old institution founded by the nation\u2019s unions. In the depths of the financial crisis, Mr. Raynor asked Mr. Ross for a bailout.Having worked with Mr. Ross for years, he asked whether the businessman would be interested in making an investment of $50 million, the largest the bank would allow.After months of due diligence, the deal went through, Mr. Raynor said, which he believes was a testament to Mr. Ross\u2019s decency \u2014 not greed. He said Mr. Ross could have made more lucrative investments, but opted instead to help the unions.\u201c\u2018I want to make money, but I\u2019m not under any illusions and I\u2019m not in a hurry,\u2019\u201d he said Mr. Ross had told him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "By Investing in Science, Trump Can Strengthen the Economy", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsScience and technology have powered America\u2019s economic engine for more than 70 years. But federal support has been getting leaner. The nation is spending about 60 percent of what it did 30 years ago on federal research and development as measured against the total economy. In other words, this spending is becoming a smaller percentage of the gross domestic product.That\u2019s a big problem, because many of our global competitors in Europe and Asia have been ramping up their research spending with a goal of knocking us off our scientific and economic pedestal.Now President Trump is in the position to do something about it.During his campaign, he hammered away at the historically slow growth of the American economy during the Obama years. He repeatedly pledged to speed up the pace of that trajectory. Increasing investments in long-term scientific research, long a federal responsibility, can help him deliver on his pledge. The nonpartisan Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscored the importance of such investments when it noted that it ranked the United States only 10th on its global innovation index largely because of flagging support for long-term research.The funding pinch is causing us to become more risk averse and forgo wagers on transformational technologies \u2014 such as high-capacity multi-electron batteries \u2014 that could pay off in a big way if they succeed. It is also allowing our vaunted science and technology infrastructure to decay. The greatly oversubscribed Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, for example, has been waiting almost a decade for a desperately needed second \u201ctarget station\u201d to meet the needs of materials research so critical to industry.But before President Trump takes the science plunge, he needs to get the best and most honest advice he can. He should start by appointing his own science adviser, someone he trusts who has the professional stature, respect and breadth of knowledge commensurate with the complexities of the job and holds sensible views on climate change.He also needs to fully staff the Office of Science and Technology Policy, as every president has since Gerald Ford. And he should maintain the President\u2019s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology that has reported directly to every president since George H. W. Bush. Not only do those two offices ensure that a president receives quality analysis and timely professional advice, but they also insulate him from lobbyists.Once those advisers are in place, there are three big science and technology opportunities President Trump should pursue.First, make science infrastructure part of a national infrastructure program. Research facilities are as important as roads, bridges and airports. Just as the Eisenhower administration\u2019s Interstate System of highways lifted the economy, creating tens of thousands of jobs in the process, our national laboratories propelled the country to the forefront of discovery, innovation and global competitiveness. So, too, did our public research universities, which are now struggling to maintain educational quality in the face of a precipitous decline in state support, as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences documented in its Lincoln Project report recently.President Trump prides himself on being a builder of big projects. He has the opportunity to demonstrate that prowess in the science arena. He should support building major research facilities in the United States, such as the International Linear Collider for basic science or the fast spectrum test reactor that could result in less expensive and safer advanced nuclear power systems.His second big science opportunity lies in his interest in corporate tax reform and repatriating the $2.5 trillion held overseas mostly by high-tech companies. He has proposed a low tax rate of 10 percent on that repatriated money. He should also embrace a mandate that would require corporations to deposit 5 percent of the money they bring back into a nonprofit research endowment, operated as a private-public partnership.Representative Randy Hultgren, Republican of Illinois, has advocated creating such a quasi-governmental structure \u2014 however it is capitalized \u2014 to provide essential continuity in research support and backing for long-term applied research both government and industry often shun.President Trump\u2019s third big opportunity is to make major investments in clean energy research through the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science and the department\u2019s energy technology programs. Last summer, congressional appropriators in both parties expressed support for the president\u2019s request to double spending on clean energy research, although they noted there was not enough money in the current fiscal year to accommodate the first requested step \u2014 a 5 percent increase, or about $400 million.In his fiscal year 2018 budget request, President Trump should call on Congress to make good on that support from Congress. It would enable him make good on his promise to keep an open mind on climate change \u2014 as he indicated he would in a Nov. 22 interview with The New York Times \u2014 by pursuing policies that both moderate global warning and strengthen the American economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lesson of Nordstrom: Do Business With the Trumps or Else", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe president\u2019s tweet \u2014 posted on his personal account and then re-sent from his White House account \u2014 is an act of intimidation. Nordstrom interacts with many executive branch agencies: the Department of Labor, the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and others. Each one of these agencies will be headed by Trump appointees. Most will be staffed with other political appointees as well. The president is telling all of these people that he is very angry with Nordstrom. The message is clear, and it won\u2019t take much for a political appointee in some agency to conceive of an ingenious way of ingratiating himself with the White House by making life difficult for the store chain.Most important, regardless of whether such retaliation actually happens, Nordstrom and the handful of other companies that announced they, too, would drop the line have to live in fear of it for the rest of the Trump administration. And now every other department store knows that it had better not make a similar \u201cbusiness decision\u201d that displeases the president. In other words, do business with the Trump family and help the Trump family promote its products, or else.This is not the way free markets work, particularly in the United States. We fought a revolution in part against the mercantilism that prevailed in Britain, where the king and members of Parliament played favorites and people who wanted to ingratiate themselves with the government did business with companies in which powerful politicians had an interest (the South Sea Company and the East India Company were the two most notorious examples). Edmund Burke and Adam Smith railed against this type of corrupt relationship between business and government in Britain; similarly, the founders of our country did not want that type of abuse of power going on here.The modern-day Tea Party movement arose in the aftermath of the Great Recession, a reaction to the perception that politicians were playing favorites in bailing out Wall Street banks and auto companies. The Republican Party for years has made a very strong case for an economy in which market actors make their own decisions free of government interference.And now all of that \u2014 and indeed the bedrock principles of limited government power that go back to Thomas Jefferson \u2014 lies in shambles as a president seeks not only to use his official position to promote the business of the Trump family but also to retaliate against other businesses for the decisions they make in the marketplace.Americans have worried about losing freedoms in the Trump administration, including freedom of religion and of the press, as well as the right to be heard by an independent judiciary. We learned this week that free markets are at risk as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Age of Rudeness", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "FeatureAs the social contract frays, what does it mean to be polite?Supported byThere\u2019s no need to be rude, I say to the man in the packed hall at passport control. There are people everywhere, and his job is to send them into the right queues. I have been watching him shout at them. I have watched the obsessive way he notices them, to pick on them. There\u2019s no need to be rude, I say.His head jerks around.You\u2019re rude, he counters. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s rude.This is an airport, a place of transit. There are all sorts of people here, people of different ages, races and nationalities, people in myriad sets of circumstances. In this customs hall, there are so many different versions of living that it seems possible that no one version could ever be agreed on. Does it follow, then, that nothing that happens here really matters?No, I\u2019m not, I say.You are, he says. You\u2019re being rude.The man is wearing a uniform, though not a very impressive one: a white short-sleeved synthetic shirt, black synthetic trousers, a cheap tie with the airport\u2019s insignia on it. It is no different from the uniform a bus driver might wear, or someone at a car-rental desk, someone who lacks any meaningful authority while also being forced into constant interaction with members of the public, someone for whom the operation of character is both nothing and everything. He is angry. His face is red, and his expression is unpleasant. He looks at me \u2014 a woman of 48 traveling alone, a woman who doubtless exhibits some signs of the privileged life she has led \u2014 with loathing. Apparently it is I, not he, who has broken the social code. Apparently it was rude of me to accuse him of rudeness.The social code remains unwritten, and it has always interested me how many problems this poses in the matter of ascertaining the truth. The truth often appears in the guise of a threat to the social code. It has this in common with rudeness. When people tell the truth, they can experience a feeling of release from pretense that is perhaps similar to the release of rudeness. It might follow that people can mistake truth for rudeness, and rudeness for truth. It may only be by examining the aftermath of each that it becomes possible to prove which was which.The queue moves forward. I reach passport control, and I pass through it, and the man is left behind.By telling this story, I am trying to substantiate my fear that discrimination and bullying are used against people trying to enter Britain, my country. There are many people who don\u2019t have this fear. To them, my story proves only one thing, which is that I once met a rude man in an airport. I might even have inadvertently made them pity him. I, the teller of this tale, would have to demonstrate that under the same circumstances, I would have behaved better. In the event, all I did was criticize him. I made him angrier; perhaps he took it out on the next person in the queue. To top it all off, I admit that he accuses me of precisely the same failing: rudeness. Anyone hearing the story will at this point stop thinking about the moral problem of rudeness and start thinking about me. I have damaged my own narrative authority: Might I be to blame after all? By including that detail \u2014 true though it is \u2014 I am giving the man a platform for his point of view. In most of my stories, I allow the truth to look after itself. In this one, I\u2019m not sure that it can.For all these reasons, the story doesn\u2019t work as it should. Why, then, if it proves nothing, is this a story I persist in telling? The answer: because I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t understand it, and I feel that the thing I don\u2019t understand about it \u2014 indeed the mere fact of not understanding \u2014 is significant.The uniformed woman at security bangs the gray plastic trays one after another onto the conveyor belt with a violence that seems to be a request for attention. At every opportunity, she makes it clear that she has relinquished self-control: Her nature has been let loose, like an animal from its cage. She abuses, without exception, every person who passes along her queue, while seeming not to address any single one of them: We are no longer individuals; we are a herd enduring the drover\u2019s lash, heads down and silent. She looks unhealthy, her face covered with sore-looking red spots, her shapeless white body almost writhing with its own anger, as though it wishes only to transgress its boundaries, to escape itself in an act of brutality.The person in front of me in the queue is a well-groomed black woman. She is traveling with a child, a pretty girl with neatly plaited hair. She has put two large clear bags of cosmetics and creams in her tray, but this, apparently, is not allowed; she is permitted only a single bag. The uniformed woman halts the queue and slowly and deliberately holds up the two bags, looking fixedly at their owner.What\u2019s this then? she says. What\u2019s this about?The woman explains that because two of them are traveling, she has assumed that they are entitled to two bags. Her voice is quiet and polite. The little girl gazes ahead with wide, unblinking eyes.You assumed wrong, the uniformed woman says. Her horrible relish for the situation is apparent. She has been waiting, it is clear, to fasten on someone and has found her victim.You don\u2019t get away with that, she says, grimacing and shaking her head. Where do people like you get your ideas from?The rest of us watch while she makes the woman unpack the bags and then decide which of her possessions are to be thrown away. They are mostly new and expensive-looking. In another situation, their scented femininity might have seemed to mock the ugliness of the woman superintending their destruction with folded arms and a jeering expression on her face. The other woman\u2019s slender, varnished fingers are shaking as she scrabbles with the various pots and jars. She keeps dropping things, her head bowed, her lower lip caught in her teeth. The uniformed woman\u2019s unremitting commentary on these events is so unpleasant that I realize she is half-demented with what would seem to be the combination of power and powerlessness. No one intervenes. I do not inform her that there is no need to be rude. Instead, as I increasingly seem to in such situations these days, I wonder what Jesus would have done.My traveling companion \u2014 a painter \u2014 is the politest person I know, but I have noticed that he does not often take up arms on another person\u2019s behalf. He dislikes conflict. When it is our turn in the queue, the uniformed woman stares at the bag he has placed in the tray. It contains his tubes of paint. They are crumpled and bespattered with use, and there are so many of them that the bag can\u2019t close at the top. She folds her arms.What are those, she says.They\u2019re paints, he replies.You can\u2019t take those through, she says.Why not, he asks pleasantly.The bag has to close at the top, she says. That\u2019s why not.But I need them to paint with, he says.You can\u2019t take them through, she says.He looks at her in silence. He is looking directly into her eyes. He stands completely quiet and still. The look goes on for a very long time. Her eyes are small and pale blue and impotent: I did not notice them until now. My friend neither blinks nor looks away, and the woman is forced to hold herself there as the seconds tick by, her small eyes open and straining. During those seconds, it seems as if layers of her are being removed: She is being simplified, put in order, by being looked at. He is giving her his full attention, and I watch the strange transformation occur. Finally he speaks.What do you suggest I do, he says, very calmly.Well, sir, she says, if you\u2019re traveling with this lady, she might have room in her bag.Neither of them looks at me \u2014 they are still looking at each other.Would that be acceptable? she says.Yes, he says, I don\u2019t see why not.I proffer my bag, and the woman herself transfers the paints from one bag to the other. Her hands labor to do it with care and exactitude: It takes her a long time. Finally she seals the bag and lays it gently back in the tray.Is that all right, sir? she says.Now that he has won this victory, I want him to use it to reprimand her, not just for her behavior toward the black woman in the queue but for all the wrongs her behavior represents; for the fact that it\u2019s safer to be him, and always has been. He does not reprimand her. He smiles at her politely.Thank you very much, he says.It would have been a shame to throw them away, wouldn\u2019t it? she says.Yes, it would, he says. I appreciate your help.I hope you enjoy your holiday, sir, she says.Are people rude because they are unhappy? Is rudeness like nakedness, a state deserving the tact and mercy of the clothed? If we are polite to rude people, perhaps we give them back their dignity; yet the obsessiveness of the rude presents certain challenges to the proponents of civilized behavior. It is an act of disinhibition: Like a narcotic, it offers a sensation of glorious release from jailers no one else can see.In the recollection of events, rudeness often has a role to play in the moral construction of a drama: It is the outward sign of an inward or unseen calamity. Rudeness itself is not the calamity. It is the harbinger, not the manifestation, of evil. In the Bible, Satan is not rude \u2014 he is usually rather charming \u2014 but the people who act in his service are. Jesus, on the other hand, often comes across as somewhat terse. Indeed, many of the people he encounters find him direct to the point of rudeness. The test, it is clear, is to tell rudeness from truth, and in the Bible that test is often failed. An unambiguous event \u2014 violence \u2014 is therefore required. The episode of the crucifixion is an orgy of rudeness whose villains are impossible to miss. The uncouth conduct of the Roman soldiers at the foot of the cross, for instance, can be seen in no other light: Anyone thinking that Jesus could have done a bit more to avoid his fate is offered this lasting example of humanity\u2019s incurable awfulness. They know not what they do, was Jesus\u2019 comment on his tormentors. Forgive them.In the aftermath of their victory, the winners are markedly unmagnanimous. They brand those who voted the other way as a liberal elite, patronizing, self-interested, out of touch with real life. The liberal elite are characterized as bad losers, as though the vote were a football match. When they protest against or complain about the result and its consequences, they are immediately belittled and shouted down. In the weeks before the vote, the eventual victors\u2019 own handling of language resembled a small child\u2019s handling of an explosive device: They appeared to have no idea of its dangers or power. They used phrases like \u201cWe want our country back\u201d and \u201cTake back control\u201d that were open to any and every interpretation. Now they complain that they have been misrepresented as racist, xenophobic, ignorant. They are keen to end the argument, to quit the field of language where only the headachy prospect of detailed analysis remains, to take their dubious verbal victory and run for the hills. They have a blunt phrase they use in the hope of its being the last word, and it is characteristically rude: \u201cYou lost. Get over it.\u201dThe liberal elite, meanwhile, have evolved a theory: It is their belief that many of the people who voted to leave the European Union now regret their decision. There is no more tenuous comfort than that which rests on the possibility of another\u2019s remorse. In psychoanalysis, events are reconstructed in the knowledge of their outcome: The therapeutic properties of narrative lie in its capacity to ascribe meaning to sufferings that at the time seemed to have no purpose. The liberal elite are in shock; they fall upon the notion of the victors\u2019 regret as a palliative for their mental distress, but because the referendum result is irreversible, this narrative must adopt the form of tragedy.Unlike the victors, the losers are loquacious. They render the logic of their suffering with exactitude and skill, waxing to new expressive heights. The deluge of fine writing that follows the referendum contrasts strangely with the reticence that preceded it. The liberal elite are defending their reality, but too late. Some urge a show of tolerance and understanding; others talk about the various stages of grief; others still call for courage in standing up for the values of liberalism. These are fine performances, but it is unclear whom they are for. I have often noticed how people begin to narrate out loud when in the presence of mute creatures, a dog, say, or a baby: Who is the silent witness to this verbal outpouring?Meanwhile, in the Essex town of Harlow, a Polish man is murdered in the street by a gang of white youths who apparently heard him speaking his native language.In the United States, Hillary Clinton calls half the supporters of Donald Trump \u201ca basket of deplorables.\u201d At first the remark impressed me. I approved of Clinton for her courage and honesty, while reflecting on her curious choice of words. \u201cBasket of deplorables\u201d almost sounded like a phrase from Dr. Seuss: It would be typical of him to put deplorables in a basket, for the moral amusement of his young readers. A sack or a box of deplorables wouldn\u2019t be the same thing at all, and a swamp of deplorables is too Dante-esque; but a basket is just the kind of zany, cheerful container that makes light of the deplorables while still putting them in their place. It quickly became clear, however, that as a public utterance, the phrase was malfunctioning. The basket began to speak, to distinguish itself: Inside it were a number of offended individuals. Clinton had made the mistake of being rude. The \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d wasn\u2019t Dr. Seuss after all. It was the snobbish language of the liberal elite, caught committing the elemental moral crime of negating individual human value. Yet Clinton\u2019s adversary regularly committed this crime with impunity. Were Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s two different kinds of rudeness?In Britain, a man tweets that someone should \u201cJo Cox\u201d Anna Soubry. The amorality of the English tongue: In the run-up to the referendum, Jo Cox, a member of Parliament, was shot and stabbed to death by a far-right nationalist; to \u201cJo Cox\u201d someone is to murder a female member of Parliament who advocates remaining in the European Union. The man who posts the tweet is arrested. The police, it seems, are trying to get on top of our verbal problems. It has now become commonplace for proponents of liberal values to receive death threats. The death threat, I suppose, is the extreme of rudeness: It is the place where word finally has to be taken as deed, where civilization\u2019s immunity reaches the point of breakdown. \u201cI could kill you,\u201d my mother often used to say to me, and I didn\u2019t know whether to believe her or not. It is true that I frequently fell foul of her and others through my habit of outspokenness. The sharpness of my phrases maddened her. I was quite capable of the basket-of-deplorables mistake, the confusion of cleverness with insult, the belief in language as an ultimate good, the serving of which was its own reward. No one could mind what you said if you said it with sufficient skill, could they? Later I came to believe that the good of language lay entirely in its relationship to truth. Language was a system through which right and wrong \u2014 truth and untruth \u2014 could be infallibly identified. Honesty, so long as it was absolute, was a means for individuals to understand all good and evil.The liberal elite, as far as I am aware, do not make death threats. Is this because they have better manners? Do they in fact wish that their enemies were dead but would just never say so? And if they do wish it \u2014 albeit politely, in the manner of a white lie \u2014 is the sin somehow less cardinal for being courteous? The anti-liberals do not seem to find their own penchant for death threats problematic. In America, Trump even makes a veiled one against Clinton. We are told by the newspapers that Trump invited the Clintons to his wedding, that their daughters are good friends. Is this verbal violence, then, simply incompetence? Is it the verbal equivalent of someone who has not learned the piano sitting down and trying to play Rachmaninoff\u2019s Third?The rudeness of these public figures gives pleasure and relief, it is clear, to their audiences. Perhaps what they experience is not the possibility of actual violence but a sort of intellectual unbuttoning, a freedom from the constraint of language. Perhaps they have lived lives in which they have been continually outplayed in the field of articulation, but of this new skill \u2014 rudeness \u2014 they find that they are the masters. My mother\u2019s death threats undoubtedly arose from her frustration with my own use of language. What I did not take into account when I spoke to her was the difference in our social positions. She was a housewife with little education and a rapidly retreating beauty, for whom life was a process of discovering that no greatness had been held in store for her. She did such things for me as cook and clean, while I was on my way to university and liberty. Yet to my mind, she had an extraordinary power, the power to blacken my mental outlook and ruin my prospect of life. When I spoke to her, I thought I was addressing a tyrant in whose overthrow my only weapons were words. But words were the very things that roused her to violence, because at her life\u2019s core, she had been separated from them. Her labor, her maternal identity, her status were all outside the language economy. Instead, she formulated a story of herself whose simplifications and lies infuriated me. I aimed to correct her with truth \u2014 perhaps I thought that if only I could insult her with sufficient accuracy, we would be reconciled \u2014 but she refused to be corrected, to be chastened. In the end, she won by being prepared to sacrifice the moral basis of language. She didn\u2019t care what she said, or rather, she exacted from words the licentious pleasures of misuse; in so doing, she took my weapon and broke it before my eyes. She made fun of me for the words I used, and I couldn\u2019t respond by threatening her with death. I couldn\u2019t say \u201cI could kill you\u201d because it wasn\u2019t true, and in language I had staked everything on telling the truth.In a clothes shop in London, I sift through the rails, looking for something to wear. The instant I came in, the assistant bounded up to me and recited what was obviously a set of phrases scripted by the management. I dislike being spoken to in this way, though I realize the assistant doesn\u2019t do so out of choice. I told her I was fine. I told her I would find her if I needed anything. But a few minutes later, she\u2019s back.How\u2019s your day been so far? she says.The truth? It\u2019s been a day of anxiety and self-criticism, of worry about children and money, and now to top it all off, I\u2019ve made the mistake of coming here in the unfounded belief that it will make me look nicer, and that making myself look nicer will help.It\u2019s been fine, I say.There\u2019s a pause in which perhaps she is waiting for me to ask her about her own day in return, which I don\u2019t.Are you looking for something special? she says.Not really, I say.So you\u2019re just browsing, she says.There is a pause.Did I tell you, she says, that we have other sizes downstairs?You did, I say.If you want something in another size, she says, you just have to ask me.I will, I say.I turn back to the rails and find that if anything, my delusion has been strengthened by this exchange, which has made me feel ugly and unlikable and in more need than ever of transformation. I take out a dress. It is blue. I look at it on its hanger.Good choice, the assistant says. I love that dress. The color\u2019s amazing.Immediately I put it back on the rail. I move away a little. After a while, I begin to forget about the assistant. I think about clothes, their strange promise, the way their problems so resemble the problems of love. I take out another dress, this one wine-colored and dramatic.God, that would look amazing, the assistant says. Is it the right size?According to the label, it is.Yes, I say.Shall I put it in the fitting room for you? she says. It\u2019s just easier, isn\u2019t it? Then you\u2019ve got your hands free while you keep browsing.For the first time, I look at her. She has a broad face and a wide mouth with which she smiles continually, desperately. I wonder whether the width of her smile was a factor in her being given this job. She is older than I expected. Her face is lined, and despite her efforts, the mouth betrays some knowledge of sorrow.Thank you very much, I say.I give her the dress, and she goes away. I find that I no longer want to be in the shop. I don\u2019t want to try on the dress. I don\u2019t want to take my clothes off or look at myself in a mirror. I consider quietly leaving while the assistant is gone, but the fact that I have caused the dress to be put in the fitting room is too significant. Perhaps it will be transformative after all. On my way there, I meet the assistant, who is on her way out. She widens her eyes and raises her hands in mock dismay.I wasn\u2019t expecting you to be so quick! she exclaims. Didn\u2019t you find anything else you liked?I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry, I say.God, I know exactly what you mean, she says. We\u2019re all in such a hurry. There just isn\u2019t time to stop, is there?The fitting rooms are empty: There aren\u2019t any other customers. The assistant hovers behind me while I go into the cubicle where she has hung the dress. I wonder whether she will actually follow me in. I pull the curtain behind me and feel a sense of relief. My reflection in the mirror is glaring and strange. I have stood in such boxlike spaces before, alone with myself, and these moments seem connected to one another in a way I can\u2019t quite specify. It is as though life is a board game, and here is the starting point to which I keep finding myself unexpectedly returned. I take off my clothes. This suddenly seems like an extraordinary thing to do in an unfamiliar room in a street in central London. Through the gap in the curtain I can see into a dingy back room whose door has been left open. There are pipes running up the walls, a small fridge, a kettle, a box of tea bags. Someone has hung a coat on a hook. I realize that the theater of this shop is about to break down, and that the assistant\u2019s manner \u2014 her bad acting, her inability to disguise herself in her role \u2014 is partly to blame.How is everything? she says.I am standing there in my underwear, and her voice is so loud and close that I nearly jump out of my skin.How\u2019s it going in there? How are you getting on?I realize that she must be speaking to me.I\u2019m fine, I say.How\u2019s the fit? she says. Do you need any other sizes?I can hear the rustle of her clothes and the scraping sound of her nylon tights. She is standing right outside the curtain.No, I say. Really, I\u2019m fine.Why don\u2019t you come out? she says. I can give you a second opinion.Suddenly I am angry. I forget to feel sorry for her; I forget that she did not choose to say these things; I forget that she is perhaps in the wrong job. I feel trapped, humiliated, misunderstood. I feel that people always have a choice where language is concerned, that the moral and relational basis of our existence depends on that principle. I wish to tell her that there are those who have sacrificed themselves to defend it. If we stop speaking to one another as individuals, I want to say to her, if we allow language to become a tool of coercion, then we are lost.No, I say. Actually, I don\u2019t want to come out.There is a silence outside the curtain. Then I hear the rustling of her clothes as she starts to move away.All right then, she says, in a voice that for the first time I can identify as hers. It is a flat voice, disaffected, a voice that expresses no surprise when things turn out badly.I put my clothes back on and take the dress on its hanger and leave the cubicle. The assistant is standing with her back to me on the empty shop floor, her arms folded across her chest, looking out the window. She does not ask me how I got on or whether I liked the dress and intend to buy it. She does not offer to take the dress from me and hang it back on its rail. She is offended, and she is very deliberately showing it. We are, then, equal at least in our lack of self-control. I hang up the dress myself.It wasn\u2019t my day, I say to her, by way of an apology.She gives a small start and utters a sound. She is trying to say something: She is searching, I see, for one of her scripted phrases in the effort to reassume her persona. Falteringly, she half-smiles, but her mouth is turned down at the corners like a clown\u2019s. I imagine her going home this evening, unhappy.When I tell the story afterward, making myself both its villain and its butt, it goes like this: I, currently dismayed by the sudden ascent of rudeness in our world and wondering what it means, am betrayed into rudeness myself by a personal sensitivity to language that causes me to do the very thing I despise, which is fail to recognize another human\u2019s individuality. But the person I tell it to doesn\u2019t hear it that way at all. He hears it as a story about how annoying shop assistants are.I hate it when they do that, he says. It was good you made an issue of it. Maybe she\u2019ll give feedback to the management, and they\u2019ll stop making people say all that stuff.My mother and I don\u2019t speak to each other anymore, but I\u2019ve been thinking about her lately. I\u2019ve been thinking about facts, about how they get stronger and clearer, while points of view fade or change. The loss of the parent-child relationship is a fact. It is also a failure. It is regrettable. The last time my parents spoke to me, my father said something very rude. He said I was full of shit. He put the phone down straight away after he said it, and I have not heard from him again. For a long time afterward, I was profoundly disturbed by his words: For my father to speak to me of shit, and claim that I was full of it, seemed to remove my basis for existing. Yet he was half of me: It was, I realized, for that reason that he felt he could speak to me the way he did. I was his child; he forgot that I was as real as he. It could be said that one-half of our country has told the other it is full of shit, deliberately choosing those words because it knows that their object finds rudeness \u2014 the desecration of language \u2014 especially upsetting.In Sophocles\u2019 play \u201cPhiloctetes,\u201d the man who suffers most is also the man with the most powerful weapon, an infallible bow that could be said to represent the concept of accuracy. The hardhearted Odysseus abandoned the wounded Philoctetes on an island, only to discover 10 years later that the Trojan War could not be won without Philoctetes\u2019 bow. He returns to the island determined to get the bow by any means. For his part, Philoctetes has spent 10 years in almost unendurable pain: It is decreed that he cannot be healed other than by the physician Asclepius at Troy, yet he would rather die than help Odysseus by returning with him. Time has done nothing to break down the impasse: Philoctetes still can\u2019t forgive Odysseus; Odysseus still can\u2019t grasp the moral sensitivity of Philoctetes. It is for the third actor, Neoptolemus, a boy of pure heart, to resolve the standoff and bring an end to war and pain. Odysseus urges Neoptolemus to befriend Philoctetes in order to steal the bow, claiming it is for the greater good. Philoctetes, meanwhile, tells Neoptolemus the story of his dreadful sufferings and elicits his empathy and pity. In his dilemma, Neoptolemus realizes two things: that wrong is never justified by being carried out under orders, and that the bow is meaningless without Philoctetes himself. The moral power of individuality and the poetic power of suffering are the two indispensable components of truth. For his part, Neoptolemus might be said to represent the concept of good manners. In this drama, the expressive man and the rude man need each other, but without the man of manners, they will never be reconciled.It strikes me that good manners would be the thing to aim for in the current situation. I have made a resolution, which is to be more polite. I don\u2019t know what good it will do: This might be a dangerous time for politeness. It might involve sacrifices. It might involve turning the other cheek. A friend of mine says this is the beginning of the end of the global order: He says that in a couple of decades\u2019 time, we\u2019ll be eating rats and tulip bulbs, as people have done before in times of social collapse. I consider the role that good manners might play in the sphere of rat-eating, and it seems to me an important one. As one who has never been tested, who has never endured famine or war or extremism or even discrimination, and who therefore perhaps does not know whether she is true or false, brave or a coward, selfless or self-serving, righteous or misled, it would be good to have something to navigate by.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While We\u2019re Distracted by the Drama, the Economy Seems to Be Taking Off", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsYou could be forgiven for not noticing it, but the United States economy is gaining momentum.It may not be as dramatic as the torrent of political news out of Washington; an improving economy, after all, announces itself through a series of data releases that are just a little bit better than people were expecting. But that\u2019s exactly what has happened. In consumer spending, the job market and manufacturing, the economy seems to be enjoying consistent, broad-based growth to start the year.There could always be a setback, of course, but the momentum is almost uniformly positive as the Trump era gets underway.Some of the factors at work may turn out to be temporary. Energy prices were near recent lows a year ago, and their recovery since has meant oil exploration and related fields are recovering. Similarly, the effects of a steep run-up in the value of the dollar from 2014 to early 2015 have now worked their way through the economy and aren\u2019t holding back manufacturing the way they once were.An unusually warm winter is probably a factor in some of the good numbers, as people who in a normal year would have hunkered down amid snowstorms instead went shopping. But the positive tenor of the latest data has been building for months, and includes some data sets that shouldn\u2019t be too affected by the weather.And the number of permits issued for new housing units rose 4.6 percent in January, the Census Bureau said Thursday, and is up 8.2 percent from a year ago, as the housing recovery kicks into a higher gear. The number of housing units started fell slightly in January, but November and December numbers were revised higher.This all continues a recent theme. The economy added 227,000 jobs in January despite an unemployment rate that is already low. The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits each week keeps hitting lows not seen since the 1970s.The improving data \u2014 and particularly the uptick in inflation \u2014 does create a puzzle for the Federal Reserve. In testimony this week, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet Yellen, made clear that an interest rate increase was on the way, though she left ambiguity on whether it would happen at the Fed\u2019s March meeting or later in the spring or summer.If the Fed indeed raises interest rates this spring in an effort to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from taking off, it will be the third rise since December 2015 \u2014 but would signal that a faster pace of rate increases was on tap.On one hand, the Fed\u2019s policies work with a lag, so it must act with an eye toward where the economy is going, not where it has been. On the other, after years of trying to slog out of a deep recession, Ms. Yellen and her colleagues don\u2019t want to act prematurely and stop the expansion in its tracks.\u201cWaiting too long\u201d to raise rates, Ms. Yellen told Congress this week, would be unwise because it might require the Fed \u201cto eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession.\u201dThe stock market has reached new highs in recent days based on a mix of positive economic data and optimism that the Trump administration will bring business tax cuts and profit-friendly deregulation. Granted, a trade war or other disruptions could be damaging, and markets could turn quickly if some of the anticipated goodies don\u2019t materialize from Washington.But the steady flow of improving economic data is a reminder that things are looking pretty good for 2017 if President Trump and Ms. Yellen can avoid messing it up.Advertisement"}

Hardly a lost city, Fordl\u00e2ndia is home to about 2,000 people, some who live in the crumbling structures built nearly a century ago.Ford, the automobile manufacturer who is considered a founder of American industrial mass-production methods, hatched his plan for Fordl\u00e2ndia in a bid to produce his own source of the rubber needed for making tires and car parts like valves, hoses and gaskets.These endeavors on the other side of the world devastated Brazil\u2019s rubber economy. But Ford despised relying on the Europeans, fearing a proposal by Winston Churchill to create a rubber cartel. So, in a move that pleased Brazilian officials, Ford acquired a giant stretch of land in the Amazon.Despite such setbacks, Ford constructed an American-style town, which he wanted inhabited by Brazilians hewing to what he considered American values.Employees moved into clapboard bungalows \u2014 designed, of course, in Michigan \u2014 some of which are still standing. Streetlamps illuminated concrete sidewalks. Portions of these footpaths persist in the town, near red fire hydrants, in the shadow of decaying dance halls and crumbling warehouses.\u201cIt turns out Detroit isn\u2019t the only place where Ford produced ruins,\u201d said Guilherme Lisboa, 67, the owner of a small inn called the Pousada Americana.Going even further in Ford\u2019s quest for utopia, so-called sanitation squads operated across the outpost, killing stray dogs, draining puddles of water where malaria-transmitting mosquitoes could multiply and checking employees for venereal diseases.\u201cWith a surety of purpose and incuriosity about the world that seems all too familiar, Ford deliberately rejected expert advice and set out to turn the Amazon into the Midwest of his imagination,\u201d Mr. Grandin, the historian, wrote in his account of the town.These days, the ruins of Fordl\u00e2ndia stand as testament to the folly of trying to bend the jungle to the will of man.Seeking to promote the automobile as a form of recreation \u2014 along with the golf course, tennis courts, a movie theater and swimming pools \u2014 managers laid out nearly 30 miles of roads around Fordl\u00e2ndia. But cars are mostly absent on the town\u2019s muddy lanes, eclipsed by the motorbikes found in towns across the Amazon.By the end of World War II, it was clear that cultivating rubber trees around Fordl\u00e2ndia could not be profitable in the face of leaf blight and competition from synthetic rubber and Asian plantations freed from Japanese domination.After Ford turned the town over to Brazil\u2019s government in 1945, officials transferred Fordl\u00e2ndia from one public agency to another, largely for unsuccessful experiments in tropical agriculture. The town went into a seemingly perpetual state of decline.\u201cNothing happens here, and that\u2019s how I like it,\u201d said Joaquim Pereira da Silva, 73, a farmer from Minas Gerais State who followed his star to Fordl\u00e2ndia in 1997. Now he lives on Palm Avenue in an old American house he bought for 20,000 reais (about $6,670) from a squatter who fixed it up.\u201cThe Americans had no idea about rubber but they knew how to build things to last,\u201d he said.Scavenging material left by the Americans, he fashioned a fishing lantern from old car parts and a spice grinder from discarded machinery. Mr. dos Santos expressed mixed views of Fordl\u00e2ndia under American stewardship, growing up in the years after Ford unloaded the town.\u201cThis place in Ford\u2019s day was clean, no insects, no animals, no jungle in the town,\u201d said Mr. dos Santos, one of 11 children born to a family that depended on the rubber plantation.\u201cMy father worked for them,\u201d he said, \u201cand he did what they ordered him to do. Workers are like dogs: They obey.\u201dBut to Ford\u2019s dismay, sometimes they didn\u2019t obey.Managers tried enforcing the alcohol prohibition, but workers simply hopped on boats to a so-called island of innocence nearby with bars and brothels. And in 1930, workers fed up with eating Ford\u2019s diet of oatmeal, canned peaches and brown rice in a sweltering dining hall staged a full-scale riot.The Amazon offered its own challenges to the Americans. Some couldn\u2019t adapt to the conditions here, suffering nervous breakdowns. One drowned when a storm on the Tapaj\u00f3s River toppled his boat. Another manager left after three of his children died from tropical fevers.Ford might have avoided such tragedies, and the ruinous management of the plantation, if he had sought counsel from specialists in caring for rubber trees or scholars of the Amazon\u2019s capacity to thwart grandiose ventures. But he seemed to abhor learning from the past.Paula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Murders of My Colleagues", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 A year ago, at least eight gunmen in military fatigues stormed the home of the crime reporter Anabel Flores near the city of Orizaba and dragged her away from her pleading family. The next day her body was found on a road; she was dead at 32, just a few weeks after giving birth to her second child.In May and August, police arrested two suspected members of the Zetas drug cartel for the killing, but haven\u2019t released their names or more details, leading the Committee to Protect Journalists to report that \u201cthe case remained opaque\u201d \u2014 like the homicides of so many of her colleagues here.Last year was one of the most deadly for Mexican reporters in recent history. Even the total number of victims is hard to pin down, thanks to botched investigations and confusion about how many of the dead officially worked as journalists. But most press groups count at least nine slain here in 2016, some as many 16. Reporters Without Borders said Mexico was the third most perilous country in the world for journalists, after Syria and Afghanistan \u2014 in other words, the most perilous outside a declared war zone.Reporting from Mexico since 2001, I have written stories about journalists being shot or decapitated or disappearing more times than I can count. At one point, I was working in an international news agency when a colleague raised the question of whether we should continue to cover media murders at all anymore. Are they actually more important than the other 20,000 or so homicides that happen every year in Mexico?I argued we should. The least we can do is publicize their names, give a last tribute to their work. But it\u2019s more than that. The murder of journalists is not only the killing of human beings; it is also an attack on free speech. It has turned many parts of the country into black holes, granting immunity to corrupt officials.Most journalists murdered in Mexico work for smaller media outlets in the provincial towns and cities where the state is weakest and organized crime strongest. The killers feel they can target reporters with minimal consequences. And they are right.The national and international news media need to keep covering these journalists\u2019 stories to both show solidarity and create pressure for justice. In an age when journalism is under attack from all sides, we need to defend our profession, and that starts with stopping our colleagues from being murdered.Press freedom groups, including Mexico\u2019s Periodistas de a Pie, have done great work training reporters in security measures like identifying escape routes before they go into difficult areas. Hundreds of threatened journalists have also enrolled in a protection program run by the federal government since 2012, getting panic buttons with which they can alert police if they are in trouble, or occasionally assistance moving to a different, safer city.But these measures don\u2019t do anything to fix the problem at its source. If we want criminals to stop killing journalists, we need something else: justice. Murder investigations are often handled by ineffective, and sometimes suspect, state prosecutors. In some cases, victims are kidnapped in one state and killed in another, leading to different prosecutors handling, or too often manhandling, the evidence.A key problem is that local officials are often working with the drug cartels, and occasionally were even themselves involved in the attacks. A police officer in Oaxaca State was arrested in the killing of a journalist last year. The year before, an arrest warrant was issued for a mayor in Veracruz State for the murder of another reporter.There is a designated federal prosecutor for crimes against journalists, but his office takes only a limited number of cases that fulfill particular legal requirements \u2014 like evidence that local police were involved. But the circumstances around a lot of the killings are murky, so many of the probes are left to those local officials.The end results are poor. In at least two-thirds of journalist murders last year, no one was even arrested. When there were arrests, the police often acted suspiciously, sometimes refusing to release the names of the suspects.One solution would be to make the office of the federal prosecutor on journalists head the investigation of every single media homicide. The office needs to have the resources and teeth to take on the difficult cases and reduce the impunity. And it should be responsible for solving those cases; if it doesn\u2019t, the prosecutor should be replaced.By taking the cases away from the states, you move them farther from the corruption networks that may be complicit in the journalists\u2019 murders. And you push them into one central office that press groups can deal with \u2014 and pressure for results. But it needs to be transparent in its investigations. The Committee to Protect Journalists puts profiles of each case on its website, information that the special prosecutor itself should be providing.Mexico is knee deep in problems, including rampant corruption that strangles the economy. Journalists are a key part of the solution, but they can expose the country\u2019s rot only if they have the basic protection from being murdered. We should not become accustomed to the killing of our colleagues.Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Residents and businesses have had to contend with mandatory water rationing since 2013.Surrounded by ocean, the island has a major disadvantage to the rest of California: It can\u2019t tap the melting Sierra Nevada snow that sustains mainland farms and cities during the warm months.That\u2019s why officials have tightly restricted the use of Catalina\u2019s main water source: an aquifer connected to the interior Middle Ranch Reservoir. The drumbeat of winter storms has helped to replenish the reservoir, but as of last week it was still only roughly a quarter full \u2014 and summer is looming.He shared some of his pictures with us:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The proposal significantly raises the bar set in 2015 when Gov.

{"Headline": "McCain Steps In to Ease Tension With Australia Over Trump Insult", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst 100 Days Briefing\u25a0 Senator John McCain steps in to assure Australia that the United States remains a stalwart ally after President Trump insulted its prime minister.\u25a0 Uproar over a \u201ctechnical fix\u201d to sanctions on Russian intelligence proves to be misplaced.\u25a0 Nancy Pelosi helpfully offers to co-sponsor a bill promised from a Republican to require presidential candidates to submit to physical and mental health evaluations.In a remarkable statement, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, announced that he had called Australia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Joe Hockey, to assure him of an \u201cunwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.\u201d\u201cI asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.\u201dMr. Trump angrily berated Australia\u2019s prime minister after the leader pressed Mr. Trump to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. He then followed up with a Twitter post announcing his displeasure.For Mr. McCain, a Vietnam War hero, that was too much, apparently.\u201cOn the Fourth of July, 1918, American and Australian soldiers fought side-by-side at the Battle of Hamel. In the century that followed, our two nations struggled and sacrificed together in World War I and World War II, Korea and Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those of us who took part in the conflict remember well the service of more than 50,000 Australians in the Vietnam War, including more than 500 that gave their lives.\u201cToday, Australia is hosting increased deployments of U.S. aircraft, more regular port visits by U.S. warships and critical training for U.S. Marines at Robertson Barracks in Darwin. This deepening cooperation is a reminder that from maintaining security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region to combating radical Islamist terrorism, the U.S.-Australia relationship is more important than ever.\u201cIn short, Australia is one of America\u2019s oldest friends and staunchest allies. We are united by ties of family and friendship, mutual interests and common values, and shared sacrifice in wartime.\u201dWhen word got out that the Trump Treasury Department has adjusted sanctions against the F.S.B., Russia\u2019s successor intelligence agency to the Soviet-era K.G.B., the response was predictable: President Trump had eased penalties on an intelligence agency that had intervened on his behalf in the election, critics screamed.\u201cRussia attacked our democracy. It should be punished. Instead, President Trump is easing sanctions against its team of hackers, the F.S.B.,\u201d declared Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California.Not so fast.The fix to the sanctions was initiated by career Treasury Department officials during the last days of the Obama administration and finalized on Thursday. And officials who remain at Treasury from the Obama days supported making the change.The technical explanation is this: Apparently Russian border and customs officials are connected to the F.S.B., so theoretically, any visit to Russia that involves payment of a border tax is a violation of sanctions \u2014 it would be material support to the F.S.B. That goes well beyond former President Barack Obama\u2019s intent.The adjustment keeps the sanctions focused on the intelligence unit of the agency.\u201cI haven\u2019t eased anything,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters as he was meeting with Harley-Davidson executives, and he was telling the truth.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, on Thursday enthusiastically volunteered to cosponsor not-yet-written legislation addressing the president\u2019s physical, and mental, fitness, promised from an unlikely source: the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee.Allowing herself a brief tangent in her weekly press conference, Ms. Pelosi said she \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d until the committee\u2019s chairman, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, introduces a promised bill that would require presidential and vice presidential candidates to submit to an independent medical examination.\u201cI think it\u2019s a very good idea,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, grinning.In an interview Thursday, Mr. Chaffetz said his proposal, still in the development stages, would compel candidates to publicly release health details that might factor into a voter\u2019s decision on Election Day. It would include any medications they are taking, which could have side effects that impair their decision-making abilities, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have your hands on the nuclear codes and control our military, I think a basic health test would be appropriate,\u201d he said.He denied that his idea targets Mr. Trump, saying it came to him because of questions raised during the campaign about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health.\u201cWe compel them to do a financial disclosure,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz concluded. \u201cI think they should also do a medical disclosure.\u201dOf course, Mr. Trump never disclosed his tax returns either.Mr. Trump does know how to please his audience.Even conservatives were a bit taken aback.The president was in turn defiant, bellicose and diversionary. Early Thursday morning, he joined the saber rattling of his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, when he threatened Iran over a ballistic missile test that challenged a United Nations Security Council resolution that had called upon Tehran not to undertake such launches.And he claimed the presidential mantle by bringing up his unscheduled trip to Dover Air Force Base to greet the remains of an American commando killed in a raid in Yemen. He had been studiously silent before, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family of the deceased.So about Mr. Trump\u2019s Iran tweets.Iran was hurting from international sanctions before the nuclear deal between Tehran and five world powers, including the United States, was concluded in July 2015. It was having a hard time finding customers for its oil, ports were closed to its ships and banking relationships were suspended.But there was no evidence of imminent collapse.And that $150 billion? It belonged to Iran but had been frozen. And it turned out not to be $150 billion, an extreme estimate. By most accounts from American government officials, it was south of $50 billion.Presidents define themselves by whom they defend.Six months into his first term, President Obama \u2014 answering a shouted question at a White House news conference \u2014 stood up for Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. of Harvard after the African-American legal scholar and racial commentator was briefly arrested for disorderly conduct after trying to open the jammed lock on his own front door in Cambridge, Mass.\u201cI think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That\u2019s just a fact,\u201d Mr. Obama said \u2014 and thus ensued an uproar over the president and the police that culminated in the July 30, 2009, \u201cBeer Summit\u201d between the president, Mr. Gates and the arresting officer, in a gesture of reconciliation.That prompted an early morning Twitter-threat from Mr. Trump, who once offered to pay supporters\u2019 legal bills if they bashed protesters at his political rallies:Representative Patrick McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, wants the Federal Reserve to stop talking about financial regulation with other countries, citing President Trump\u2019s dictum that the United States must put America first.In a letter to Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen, Mr. McHenry blasted the Fed\u2019s meetings with foreign regulators as unacceptable and unauthorized. He demanded that the Fed suspend such meetings until Mr. Trump names his own people to run the central bank.\u201cIt is incumbent upon all regulators to support the U.S. economy, and scrutinize international agreements that are killing American jobs,\u201d Mr. McHenry wrote. \u201cAccordingly the Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has had an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America\u2019s best interests.\u201dMr. McHenry is vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the Fed, but he does not appear well-versed in the relevant laws. The Fed\u2019s regulatory authority was not altered by Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and Mr. Trump cannot replace Ms. Yellen until her term ends in February 2018.Andrew Puzder\u2019s confirmation hearing to be the next secretary of labor appears to be in trouble, having been postponed four times as he tries to divest from the company he leads.Adding to his troubles, an ethics watchdog group filed a petition on Wednesday to unseal court documents related to the divorce of Mr. Puzder.Andrew Puzder's divorce records are coming under scrutiny, as an ethics group argues that abuse allegations from his former wife are relevant to his cabinet confirmation hearings because the Labor Department is charged with assuring workers\u2019 physical safety.In some of the sealed documents, Mr. Puzder\u2019s former wife, Lisa Fierstein, appears to have alleged that Mr. Puzder physically abused her.\u201cIf confirmed Mr. Puzder would be responsible for and oversee policy for millions of working American women,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director, Daniel Stevens, said in a statement. \u201cBefore the Senate acts, the public has a right to know if Mr. Puzder abused his wife.\u201dGeorge Thompson, a spokesman for Mr. Puzder, who is currently chief executive of the parent company of the fast food outlets Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, called the petition \u201ca shameless attempt to smear an individual who has shown nothing but dedication to creating jobs.\u201dMichael A. Kahn, a Missouri lawyer with experience in privacy rights cases, said a decision on the documents would hinge on the judge\u2019s assessment of whether there is \u201cgood cause\u201d to unseal them. Mr. Kahn said the odds were long but that the allegations of abuse coupled with the high-profile position to which Mr. Puzder has been nominated could give the effort a \u201ctoehold.\u201dLet the Supreme Court advertising war begin.A liberal advocacy group is beginning to run television ads against Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, with plans to target some states represented by moderate Democratic senators.Conservative groups have set off on a multimillion-dollar effort to support Judge Gorsuch that includes television advertising and planned events at megachurches. People for the American Way would not disclose the amount of money it was spending to run its ads.The capsule summary with an earlier version of this article misidentified the ambassador whom Senator John McCain called in an attempt to ease tensions with Australia.

{"Headline": "The Big \u2018Brexit\u2019 Winners? Lobbyists and Lawyers", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Around dawn, a few hours after Britons voted last summer to leave the European Union, an official with a pro-\u201cBrexit\u201d group called an acquaintance on the Remain side to discuss what would come next. One thing led to another and, today, the two former opponents are partners in a consultancy, Hanbury Strategy.\u201cThings are going well,\u201d said the official, Paul Stephenson, the former communications director for Vote Leave. \u201cIt\u2019s early days, but people are receptive and, I think, because we are both so fresh out of politics and we both were at senior levels in the campaigns, we have a very good understanding and a bit of an edge over some of our rivals on this stuff.\u201dWhile Brexit may have sent the pound sterling into free fall and spread tremors through the business world, there have been some winners \u2014 most conspicuous among them the big consulting agencies, such as KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. And lawyers, trade experts, lobbyists and public relations firms are all lining up to coach businesses and the British government throughout what promises to be a complex, multiyear negotiation whose outcome remains uncertain.Those advisory firms, in turn, have hired a flock of people who, like Mr. Stephenson and his partner, Ameet Gill \u2014 who was a top aide to Britain\u2019s former prime minister, David Cameron \u2014 worked in the Leave and Remain campaigns.Brexit holds enormous implications for British businesses, which stand to lose the right to move goods to and from continental Europe without tariffs or paperwork. Banks will probably have to relinquish the right to use London as a base from which to sell financial services across the European Union\u2019s 27 other member nations.In the days after the vote, businesses, unprepared for the outcome, were in shock.There was a \u201chuge hunger for clarity,\u201d said Alan Leaman, the chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association, which has around 60 members.Mr. Leaman compared the referendum result to the business equivalent of a highway pileup, with consultancies acting as the emergency services.\u201cWhen something very major breaks out, it is hugely disruptive,\u201d Mr. Leaman said. \u201cFor a period, what people want to understand is, \u2018What are the options, and what potential challenges are associated with this?\u2019\u201dIt is not just businesses that need advice. The British government had not prepared for Brexit, which may prove to be the Civil Service\u2019s biggest single task since World War II.Since the European Commission covers trade negotiations on behalf of its member countries, there is an acute shortage of negotiators in London.Tom Brake, the foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats who campaigned to remain in the European Union, has so far failed to extract meaningful figures from the government about its consultancy spending, though he says that top trade experts charge up to $10,000 a day.\u201cI suspect the government is racking up phenomenal costs,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure that the people who voted to leave, who had genuine grievances about the lack of job opportunities, did not envisage that one of the side effects of Brexit would be many jobs for highly powered legal and consulting firms.\u201dBut where there is confusion there are opportunities. Most big advisory firms now offer Brexit advice, and smaller companies promote themselves as experts. One firm calls itself \u201cArticle 50 Associates,\u201d named for the European Union treaty article that Britain will use to withdraw, and describes itself as \u201ca specialist political consultancy focusing on helping individuals, enterprises, agencies and others navigate the twists and turns in the Brexit process.\u201dAll this activity has started a race to hire what is known in the consultancy world as \u201cBrexit talent.\u201d Sometimes it almost seems as if the vote\u2019s campaign teams, have largely transferred to the private sector, where former rivals often work side by side. And the vote\u2019s outcome has not prevented some high-profile Remain campaigners from emerging as winners in the consultancy world.Teneo, an advisory firm that has a \u201cBrexit client transition unit,\u201d has taken on Craig Oliver, Mr. Cameron\u2019s former director of communications, as well as William Hague, a former British foreign secretary.Portland Communications, a political consultancy and communications company, recruited Victoria Dean, a former British diplomat with experience in Brussels, to head up its so-called Brexit team; Henry Cook, a former aide to Michael Gove, who was a cabinet minister and Leave campaigner; James Starkie, the network manager of Vote Leave; and Amy Richards, a former press office manager for the Remain camp.Adam Atashzai, a former deputy political director to Mr. Cameron, went to Finsbury, a communications and public affairs firm, while Mats Persson, a former adviser to Mr. Cameron on European issues, is with EY, the professional services firm. David Chaplin, the director of strategic communications for the Remain camp, has joined Hill & Knowlton, a public relations group.Edelman, a communications marketing firm (whose website asks clients, \u201cAre you ready for Brexit?\u201d), hired Lucy Thomas, a former deputy director of the Remain camp, and Will Walden, a former adviser to Boris Johnson, a major figure in the Leave camp who is now the foreign secretary.\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise agencies are snapping up people from the Remain and Leave campaigns given the huge complexities of Brexit for businesses,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cFor those of us who worked on the Remain side, it is bittersweet to have to advise on the big challenges ahead now that Brexit is a reality, but it is important that businesses have the best advice and are able to make their case loud and clear.\u201dGenerally, those who were employed by government as civil servants cannot lobby the government for two years, though that does not prevent them from giving strategic advice.Though consultants normally charge less than trade lawyers, their fees can still run to several tens of thousands of pounds a month, with a top consultant asking more than $6,000 a day, industry insiders say.Some doubt that the Brexit bounce will last. Mr. Leaman noted that the health of the sector is related to the strength of the economy, which may suffer after the withdrawal. He also says that there are anecdotal reports that continental European companies are more reluctant to approach British companies for advice. But for now, he says, there is \u201ca lot of activity.\u201dMr. Stephenson, too, accepts that Brexit work will likely be limited to the next few years, but said he thinks that withdrawal from the European Union will mean more regulation in Britain\u2019s Parliament, an area in which his company specializes.He rejected the idea that he is cashing in on uncertainty that he helped to create, arguing that he originally opposed holding the referendum but, when it was called, had to choose which side to support.Mr. Stephenson still believes that Brexit will be good, not just for his company, but also for Britain. But he conceded that the views of his business partner, Mr. Gill, may be more nuanced.\u201cHe vacillates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree on everything, but that\u2019s part of our strength. I think we do give a balanced picture.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Gets Parliament\u2019s Backing on \u2018Brexit\u2019 Bill", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Easily winning a crucial vote among lawmakers, Prime Minister Theresa May was well on her way Wednesday to winning the parliamentary approval that Britain\u2019s highest court said she needed before she could begin talks on ending more than four decades of European integration.Wednesday\u2019s vote, in the House of Commons, will not be the final parliamentary verdict on Mrs. May\u2019s plans, but with 498 lawmakers in favor and 114 against, it was emphatic enough to show that any subsequent efforts in Parliament to complicate, or slow, the path to withdrawal would probably be in vain.The bill will still need to go to the revising chamber of Parliament, the House of Lords, where there are many opponents of British withdrawal, known as Brexit. But invariably the unelected upper chamber gives way to elected colleagues in the House of Commons, providing there is a clear majority there.Most analysts now expect the bill to complete its passage through Parliament in time for Mrs. May to begin exit negotiations under Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s governing treaty by the end of March, as she has promised.The debate before Wednesday\u2019s vote underlined the extraordinary pace of change in British politics during the past year.Before last year\u2019s referendum on whether to quit the 28-nation bloc, more than half of the elected members of the British Parliament wanted to remain.Wary of the opposition she might face, Mrs. May tried to avoid going to Parliament before invoking Article 50 and agreed to do so only when instructed by the country\u2019s Supreme Court.In hindsight, that looks like a battle she need never have fought.The June 23 plebiscite, in which around 52 percent of those voting chose to leave, has transformed the Conservative Party, which had been split over a British exit, into an enthusiast for it.Though the opposition Labour Party campaigned last year to remain, its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a lifelong critic of European integration and never seemed fully convinced about the pro-European case. On Wednesday, he instructed his lawmakers to vote to allow Brexit negotiations to start, an order that prompted a rebellion within his party.Yet, that was limited to less than 50 people, because even Labour\u2019s most ardent proponents of remaining know that some of their usual supporters ignored their advice and voted to leave.That has provoked an almost existential crisis for Labour, one hinted at on Tuesday when Keir Starmer, the Labour politician responsible for dealing with the British exit, noted that two-thirds of Labour lawmakers represent constituencies that voted to leave in the referendum.\u201cThis is obviously a difficult decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish the result had gone the other way \u2014 I campaigned passionately for that \u2014 but as democrats, we in the Labour Party have to accept the result,\u201d Mr. Starmer said. \u201cIt follows that the prime minister should not be blocked from starting the Article 50 negotiations.\u201dThat stance has left the Scottish National Party as the clearest source of opposition, but one with insufficient numbers to change the parliamentary arithmetic. On Wednesday night, Stephen Gethins, who speaks for the party on European issues, described the vote as \u201ca devastating act of sabotage on Scotland\u2019s economy and our very social fabric.\u201dDavid Davis, the minister in charge of negotiating the British exit, told lawmakers that \u201ca point of no return already passed.\u201d Britons, he said, were asked \u201cwhether they wanted to leave the European Union, and they decided they did.\u201d\u201cAt the core of this bill lies a very simple question: Do we trust the people or not?\u201d Mr. Davis said.Kenneth Clarke, a veteran Conservative lawmaker and former chancellor of the Exchequer, said before the vote that he would vote against invoking Article 50. \u201cI personally shall be voting with my conscience content, and when we see what unfolds hereafter as we leave the European Union, I hope that the consciences of other members of Parliament will remain equally content,\u201d he said.All the same, it looks increasingly likely that winning British parliamentary approval may be the least of Mrs. May\u2019s problems.Before Parliament\u2019s Northern Ireland affairs select committee, a former senior European Union customs official, Michael Lux, warned of the likelihood of checks at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, something Mrs. May and Northern Ireland officials dearly want to avoid.Speaking to a separate committee, Ivan Rogers, who resigned recently as Britain\u2019s permanent representative to the European Union, said the exit talks would be on a \u201chumongous\u201d scale and would be conducted with \u201cname-calling\u201d and in an \u201cextremely feisty atmosphere.\u201dHe has said that British politicians in charge of the exit are not grappling with the true costs and enormous scale of the task. European Union officials were suggesting that Britain should pay from $43 billion to $65 billion to resolve its outstanding liabilities before leaving, and reaching a trade deal between Britain and the bloc could take until the mid-2020s, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a negotiation on the scale that we haven\u2019t experienced ever, certainly not since the Second World War,\u201d Mr. Rogers added.Advertisement"}

Campbell resigned under pressure on Tuesday as the director and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, after months of growing concerns among staff members and some trustees about its financial health and his capacity to lead the largest museum in the country.Met officials said that Mr. Campbell would stay on until June, the end of the fiscal year, but that Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and chief operating officer, would be simultaneously serving as interim chief executive. Mr. Weiss will work with Mr. Campbell and the museum\u2019s leadership on a transition plan while the Met seeks a new director, one of the most powerful in the art world.\u201cWe are not looking to appoint a new director immediately,\u201d said Daniel Brodsky, the museum\u2019s chairman, in a letter to board and staff members, \u201cbut instead will take some time to consider the leadership needs of the museum in a thoughtful and deliberative way.\u201dThe sudden end to Mr. Campbell\u2019s tenure came in recent days after key board members \u2014 including Hamilton E. James, who leads the Met\u2019s finance committee \u2014 insisted it was time for him to go, according to people inside the Met who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal confidential conversations and personnel decisions.It was Mr. James, the president and chief operating officer of the Blackstone Group investment firm, who by many accounts first sounded the alarm about the Met\u2019s financial condition after joining the board in 2010. Mr. James declined on Tuesday to be interviewed.The full board was not informed of Mr. Campbell\u2019s resignation until Tuesday afternoon, having been summoned to a conference call only an hour before. According to one trustee who spoke on condition of anonymity \u2014 having been instructed by the board chairman not to speak to the news media \u2014 Mr. Brodsky started the call by introducing Mr. Campbell, who then read his full statement in what the trustee called a \u201ctrembling voice.\u201dMr. Brodsky said that he would take no questions, but would see everyone at the next full board meeting in two weeks.In response to Mr. Campbell\u2019s exit, Mr. de Montebello said in a telephone interview: \u201cI wish him well in his new endeavors. The Met is a great institution and I\u2019m sure it will thrive in the future under new leadership.\u201dMr. Campbell, in his letter to staff and trustees on Tuesday, wrote that he had decided to step down \u201cin order to pursue the next phase of my career.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of The Met\u2019s accomplishments during my tenure,\u201d he wrote.Just how an institution as august and professional as the Met found itself in a financial emergency during a strong economy became the subject of public consternation, and some of the blame fell on Mr. Campbell as its chief executive.In 2015 Mr. Weiss, formerly president of Haverford College, was hired, a move viewed by many inside the Met as a way to bring in an experienced administrator to compensate for Mr. Campbell\u2019s managerial inexperience.Don\u2019t be overwhelmed by over 6,000 years of history at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We\u2019re here to help.But the Met also has had critical and popular success under Mr. Campbell, seeing its attendance rise to about seven million visitors a year (including the Cloisters). And the Met Breuer, which opened in March, has drawn 557,000 visitors \u2014 more than projected \u2014 exceeding the Whitney\u2019s annual attendance in that building.Mr. Campbell will have to give up his Met apartment across from the museum at 993 Fifth Avenue. It is worth millions of dollars, part of his hefty compensation package, which was about $1.4 million in 2015, according to the most recently available tax forms.Others have wondered whether Mr. Weiss, 59, might succeed Mr. Campbell since he has proved proficient as a financial steward and steadying force and is liked by the staff. In addition to an M.B.A., Mr. Weiss has a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in Western medieval and Byzantine art.According to a senior executive in the art world with knowledge of the board\u2019s thinking on the succession plan, who refused to be identified because of the sensitive situation, the trustees intend to use the next few months to see if Mr. Weiss is up to the job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump, White House Apprentice", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt\u2019s with a whiff of desperation that President Trump insists these days that he\u2019s the chief executive Washington needs, the decisive dealmaker who, as he said during the campaign, \u201calone can fix it.\u201d What America has seen so far is an inept White House led by a celebrity apprentice.This president did not inherit \u201ca mess\u201d from Barack Obama, as he likes to say, but a nation recovered from recession and with strong alliances abroad. Mr. Trump is well on his way to creating a mess of his own, weakening national security and even risking the delivery of basic government services. Most of the top thousand jobs in the administration remain vacant. Career public servants are clashing with inexperienced \u201cbeachhead\u201d teams appointed by the White House to run federal agencies until permanent staff members arrive.Mr. Trump lost his national security adviser this week in a scandal involving ties to Russian intelligence. Robert Harward, a retired vice admiral, refused the job on Thursday, rattled by a dysfunctional National Security Council and a president who has alienated Mexico, Australia and even the British royal family, while cozying up to Moscow.When Mr. Trump\u2019s assistants can keep the edge of panic out of their voices, they insist that Mr. Trump has gotten more done in the early going than most presidents. And Mr. Trump is so adept at creating smoke that Americans might be forgiven for thinking that\u2019s true. But at this point in the Obama presidency, which did inherit a mess, Congress had passed laws aimed at dragging the economy back from the brink of depression while committing $800 billion in Recovery Act spending to projects ranging from housing to roads to advanced energy technologies.Mr. Trump\u2019s vaunted $1 trillion infrastructure spending program, by contrast, doesn\u2019t yet exist, because the president confuses executive orders with achievements. Orders are dashed off without input from Congress and the government officials who would implement them. The White House is a toxic mix of ideology, inexperience and rivalries; insiders say tantrums are nearly as common as the spelling errors in the press office\u2019s news releases. Steve Bannon writes the president\u2019s script, and Reince Priebus, the embattled chief of staff, crashes meetings to which he has not been invited.Mr. Trump complains about the slow pace of congressional confirmation of his appointees, but the obstacle is at his end. His staff doesn\u2019t bother to vet nominees in advance. His pick for labor secretary failed in part because no one in authority seemed to know that the nominee had employed an undocumented immigrant and had been accused of abusing his ex-wife.If there is any upside here, it is that the administration\u2019s ineptitude has so far spared the nation from a wholesale dismantling of major laws, including the Affordable Care Act, though he may yet kill the law through malign neglect. In the meantime, however, as Mr. Harward\u2019s retreat on Thursday suggests, the chaos carries other risks. A Navy SEAL turned corporate executive, Mr. Harward cited family and financial considerations for refusing the national security job, but privately he was reported to be worried about the effect of a mercurial president on national security decision making. As Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military\u2019s Special Operations Command, said this week: \u201cOur government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon, because we\u2019re a nation at war.\u201dIndeed, unless Mr. Trump can bring some semblance of order to his official household and governing style, the only element of his famous campaign pledge that may prove accurate is the \u201calone\u201d part.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Relief in Japan After Shinzo Abe\u2019s Visit With Trump", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 In many respects, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s trip to Washington and Florida to meet and play golf with President Trump went as well as the Japanese leader could have hoped.\u201cIn a basic sense, Prime Minister Abe got almost everything he wanted,\u201d said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo. Mr. Trump\u2019s statements in a joint news conference with Mr. Abe were \u201ctotally different from what he has been saying about Japan since the 1980s,\u201d Mr. Kubo said. \u201cThat is surprising as well as remarkable. In a sense he showed us, including the American public, that he is capable of changing his position on such an important issue as Japan.\u201dPerhaps most significant to the Japanese, Mr. Trump promised that the United States was \u201ccommitted to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control,\u201d a reference to the American guarantee to defend Japan in any confrontation with China over disputed islands, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu, in the East China Sea.Mr. Abe had \u201cexaggerated the threat from China to create momentum for America and Japan to join hands and contain China\u2019s rise,\u201d said the editorial, written by Su Xiaohui, a senior researcher at a state-run foreign policy think tank in Beijing.Mr. Abe has also been adept at developing relationships with other potentially difficult heads of state.While the majority of the Japanese public approved of Mr. Abe\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump, there was some criticism, particularly from the left. The leader of the Japanese Communist Party, Kazuo Shii, denounced Mr. Abe for not objecting to Mr. Trump\u2019s barring of refugees and foreign visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Others cautioned that the mercurial Mr. Trump could easily change his mind if offended, and that Mr. Abe had made himself vulnerable by seeming too eager to align himself with the American president.Some analysts said that by pursuing a close friendship with Mr. Trump, Mr. Abe was betraying the moral foundation of the alliance that has endured since the end of World War II.Mr. Trump may also be coming to realize that with a rising China, Japan is the United States\u2019 best ally in Asia.Before the American election, the Japanese government had clearly preferred Hillary Clinton to Mr. Trump. But now that Mr. Trump is the president, some analysts believe he could inadvertently help Mr. Abe\u2019s ambitions to strengthen Japan\u2019s military and increase defense spending.Although he has been assiduous about currying favor with Mr. Trump, Mr. Abe has also pursued a program of diplomacy throughout Southeast Asia, visiting countries like the Philippines and Vietnam in recent months.Analysts said that South Korea is Japan\u2019s most important ally in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s so close and bigger than all of them, except India,\u201d Mr. Green said. For Japan, he said, South Korea remains \u201ca blind spot.\u201dMakiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Boyer, executive director of the International Studies Association, would ordinarily spend this week pulling together the final details for his group\u2019s annual convention, which usually draws about 6,500 social scientists and academics and kicks off in two weeks in Baltimore.But this is not an ordinary year.\u201cAn enormous number of the attendees at our convention are coming from outside North America,\u201d Mr. Boyer said. \u201cThat obviously raises a lot of implications.\u201dAlthough a firm number will not be clear until the days immediately before the event, Mr. Boyer said, he estimated that 100 or more attendees might decide not to attend. \u201cWe\u2019re really just trying to get a handle on that now, given that nobody is certain how this is going to be implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think there are a lot of other folks who are backing out out of fear.\u201dThe annual convention, he said, \u201cis one of the three major revenue generators\u201d for his association. He estimated that, \u201cat minimum, we\u2019re in jeopardy of a quarter to half a million dollars, and when we have only a $2.7 million budget, that\u2019s a big hit.\u201d\u201cPeople like certainty, travelers like certainty, companies like certainty,\u201d said Greeley Koch, the group\u2019s executive director. In the absence of that, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ll just err on the side of caution and not take the trip.\u201dSteve Rudner, founder and managing partner at Rudner Law Offices, a firm that represents hotels, said that one corporate group of about 40 scheduled to arrive last Friday at a Florida hotel he represents canceled at the last minute over concerns that the company\u2019s chief executive, a Canadian resident with dual Canadian-Iranian citizenship, would not be able to enter the United States.\u201cAnytime, as a country, we throw up a sign that says certain people are not welcome, certain people will be detained or denied entry, there are many groups who will not want to risk denial of entry,\u201d Mr. Rudner said. He estimated the group could forfeit as much as $58,000 because of the last-minute cancellation. \u201cMany groups will just look to move the meeting elsewhere,\u201d he added.Michael W. McCormick, executive director and chief operating officer of the Global Business Travel Association, offered a similar prediction. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with a perception and whether people are going to postpone that trip or find another way in the near term to accomplish their business,\u201d he said.A member survey conducted online early last week found that nearly a third of travel managers said their companies were cutting back on business travel in the immediate aftermath of the order. More than half expressed worry that there would be uncertainty in the future about whether a green card or approved visa would be considered valid for entry to the United States, and more than one in four predicted that the executive order would lead to a long-term reduction in business travel.\u201cThat\u2019s a concern \u2014 you start talking about that impact,\u201d Mr. McCormick said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing from companies is that there will be a short- and long-term impact and reduction in business travel.\u201dFor many meeting and convention organizers, the long lead time they need for planning means that even events not taking place for months are stuck in a holding pattern.Debbie Baker, owner of an independent meeting planning company, said she was waiting to sign hotel contracts for a Las Vegas meeting scheduled for the fall. The client, a mining and generating company, has about 20 percent of its attendees coming from overseas. \u201cBecause they have offices in every country, they have V.P.s in every country as well,\u201d she said.Ms. Baker said she was worried that she could lose the client\u2019s business entirely. \u201cIf they canceled the meeting, it would be an astronomical amount of money I\u2019d lose,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might decide to hold it in Saudi Arabia or someplace like that, in which case I would lose the whole meeting.\u201dThe big question is what happens next. \u201cAs we talk about the economy and creating jobs, the last thing you want to do is put something in place that has the tendency to reduce travel,\u201d Mr. Koch said.Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program, warned that perceptions of either uncertainty or hostility \u2014 if not both \u2014 could be corrosive to the domestic travel industry.\u201cIf our foreign policy becomes more antagonistic, one could posit that would influence people\u2019s decision to come to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re welcome, even if the policy isn\u2019t directly targeting you, that may change your view of whether you\u2019d feel comfortable traveling in that country,\u201d a sentiment that meeting and event planners say they are already hearing from worried constituents.\u201cThese policies are not helpful,\u201d Mr. Parilla said, predicting that groups would gravitate to more welcoming destinations. \u201cWe\u2019re not the only game in town,\u201d he added.This has already started to happen. At the biennial conclave of the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations in Tehran last week, where 300 to 400 professional tour guides from around the world gathered, a contingent from the Guides Association of New York City presented their group\u2019s bid to bring the event to New York in 2019.\u201cIf the entire vote was based on that evening, we would\u2019ve had it in the bag,\u201d said Matthew Baker, past president of the New York association and a member of the bid committee. \u201cThere was a tremendous amount of good feedback from everyone, especially our Iranian hosts.\u201dThen, word started trickling in about the travel ban, and the confidence turned to anxiety.\u201cI started receiving reports from my colleagues around the world \u2014 everyone was worried about getting a visa into the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cOne of our Iranian hosts was elected to the new executive board, so there was the concern about one of our executive board members not being able to attend a convention he was supposed to be organizing.\u201dUltimately, the roughly 50 delegates voting for the next convention site chose Tbilisi in the Republic of Georgia over New York. Mr. Baker said the Iranian tour guides at the convention sympathized with his delegation\u2019s situation, noting their own challenges promoting their country as a tourist destination in the face of travel restrictions and sanctions.Even though a relatively small number of the participants were from the seven nations affected by the travel ban, delegates from other countries worried that this early signal from the new American administration foreshadowed potential trouble down the road.\u201cIf we can have a ban on seven countries now,\u201d Mr. Baker said, \u201cwhat can happen in the future?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nicolas Sarkozy Ordered to Stand Trial Over Campaign Finances", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sarkozy, 62, a mercurial right-wing politician who was president of France from 2007 to 2012, has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer said he would appeal the decision, after which the case would be referred to another court for a final ruling.Mr. Sarkozy, who could face up to a year in prison and a fine of 3,750 euros, or about $4,000, is out of the running for presidential elections this spring after a poor showing in a November primary for the center and right candidates, and he no longer leads the center-right Republican Party.In Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s case, the prosecution asserts that he knowingly authorized his 2012 campaign to surpass the strict spending limits set by French law.At the time, the limit for presidential campaigns was about $18.6 million per candidate in the first round of the elections, and about $5 million on top of that in the second round for the two top vote-getters, who included Mr. Sarkozy.The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said on Tuesday that Mr. Sarkozy was suspected of spending at least $45 million, nearly twice the limit, and that he had ignored warnings from his campaign accountants.The case against Mr. Sarkozy is part of what is known as the Bygmalion affair, named for the public relations company suspected of issuing false invoices to Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s party in 2012 for events that were actually for his presidential campaign.The prosecution asserts that the goal of the fraud was to hide the overspending by Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s campaign from the electoral authorities.Thirteen other people \u2014 including former party officials, aides close to Mr. Sarkozy and former executives at Bygmalion \u2014 were also ordered to stand trial on charges of involvement in the fraud, the prosecutor\u2019s office said on Tuesday.Thierry Herzog, Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s lawyer, noted in a statement that the decision was signed by only one of the two judges investigating the case, a potential sign of uncertainty about the evidence.\u201cThe clear disagreement between the two magistrates in charge of the matter is such a rare event that it is worth underlining,\u201d he said, \u201cas it illustrates the inanity of the decision.\u201dThe revelations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has portrayed himself as a virtuous politician, who, unlike his opponents \u2014 Mr. Sarkozy primarily \u2014 was untainted by legal scandals.Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Pressured to Improve Migrants\u2019 Living Conditions", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Human rights groups stepped up their warnings on Thursday about the living conditions for migrants in Greece after three people died during a recent cold snap on the Aegean island of Lesbos, and as dozens of asylum seekers near Athens threatened to resume a hunger strike if the situation did not improve.The approval this week of 3.9 million euros, about $4.15 million, in emergency funds from the European Union will help, but with around 62,000 migrants effectively trapped in Greece at the moment, it will not be nearly enough to resolve the situation.\u201cThe conditions at Elliniko are difficult,\u201d Roland Schoenbauer of the United Nations refugee agency said of the site near Athens that was once home to the city\u2019s international airport. \u201cThis is not a camp that was made to house human beings for an extended period.\u201dThe site, along with two adjacent sports venues built for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, is home to about 1,600 migrants, mostly Afghans, as well as some families from Iran and Pakistan.Migrants at Elliniko have been living in flimsy tents for more than a year, and a group of around 30 people started refusing food and trying to block deliveries to the site over the weekend to protest living conditions, according to aid workers. They have since started eating again but are threatening an open-ended hunger strike if conditions are not improved.The Greek migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, was confronted by migrants on Monday and briefly prevented from entering Elliniko. While acknowledging the \u201cpain and hardship\u201d they face, Mr. Mouzalas said groups \u2014 which he did not identify \u2014 were waging a campaign of misinformation and exploiting migrants for their own political ends.At a news conference on Thursday, Maria Bikaki, a spokeswoman for the left-leaning Coordination for Refugees and Migrants, rejected assertions that the migrants at Elliniko were being manipulated or instigated.\u201cThe only instigation here is the situation,\u201d she said.Zeinab Ghanbari, a 20-year-old Afghan woman who has been living at Elliniko since she, her husband and her son, now 4, were turned away from Greece\u2019s border with Macedonia a year ago, expressed dismay at her predicament.\u201cIn my country, the Taliban and Al Qaeda kill us in one go with a bullet,\u201d said Mrs. Ghanbari, who is pregnant and would like to go to Sweden. \u201cHere we\u2019re dying gradually over a year. If we knew that Europe, that Greece, is like this, I would have preferred to die in my country.\u201dThe list of migrants\u2019 demands includes a disinfection of the site, where insects and rats are said to be rife; better food and medical services; and a gradual relocation to proper homes rather than tents in disused military barracks and other makeshift quarters.Kyriakos Mantouvalos, a spokesman for Mr. Mouzalas, said the authorities were doing \u201ceverything possible\u201d to help the migrants, including improving access to hot water and better food. He added that the country\u2019s options were limited, and he said that many migrants had rejected offers to move to better-equipped facilities in central Greece.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Mr. Mantouvalos said. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201dMr. Schoenbauer did, however, report \u201cone positive development.\u201d Two warehouses in northern Greece being used to house migrants \u2014 \u201ccurrently among the worst in the country\u201d \u2014 will be closed and its occupants moved to alternative accommodations in United Nations-subsidized apartments and hotels.With temperatures plummeting and snow falling across much of the country, Greek officials acknowledged after the criticism from the European Commission that hundreds of migrants were living in tents at overcrowded camps on the Aegean Islands. A recent improvement in the weather offered some respite, but there are concerns about what will happen when temperatures drop again.Thousands of migrants were left stranded in Greece last year after several European countries closed their borders in an effort to prevent them from moving on to central and western Europe.So far, about 12,000 people have been moved from Greece and Italy to other European Union member states under a plan scheduled to expire in September that envisioned the relocation of 160,000 refugees; of the 12,000, about 9,000 were relocated from Greece.A plan by the European Commission to allow member states to return asylum seekers to Greece starting in mid-March, in line with European Union rules that were suspended last year because of the crisis, is expected to heap even more pressure on Greece.On Thursday, the authorities in neighboring Macedonia said they had returned 49 migrants who had elected not to file asylum claims. The migrants were taken by bus to the border and then crossed on foot, where they were met by the Greek authorities.As the Greek authorities and rights groups try to keep a lid on tensions, the United Nations refugee agency has been working with the government to transfer hundreds of migrants from cramped island facilities to more spacious quarters on the Greek mainland.According to Mr. Schoenbauer, the United Nations is working with hotels on Lesbos, but several government buildings are sitting idle, notably on the nearby island of Samos, where many residents are frustrated with the presence of migrants.\u201cThe local authorities don\u2019t want to give us the keys,\u201d Mr. Schoenbauer said.Aleksandar Dimishkovski contributed reporting from Skopje, Macedonia.Advertisement"}

The mainstream news media was quick to disagree with her, but the question of whether 2017 could be the last year of European unity is on many people\u2019s minds these days. European leaders feel as if they are awaiting the hangman\u2019s noose.In many corners of Europe, there is a growing anxiety that the populist wave cannot be reversed. The old Continent is torn apart by the bitter divisions brought on by the euro and migration crises. The union is squeezed between revisionist Russia and President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First,\u201d and demoralized by Britain\u2019s shocking vote for Brexit.So will the European Union be undone in 2017?Probably not. In the same way that arrogance and self-confidence blinded European elites to the possibility of Brexit, despair and a fashionable fatalism are now preventing people from seeing the fall of the dice. Betting on the European Union\u2019s collapse may just turn out to be the wrong wager of 2017.It now looks as if America, once again, will be Europe\u2019s savior. Some Europeans support Mr. Trump\u2019s retreat from his country\u2019s traditional allies and others hate it, but both groups are made nervous by what they have witnessed in the first month of the new administration. Mr. Trump frightens Europeans not because of his willingness to build walls (Europe is ahead of him on this front), and not because Europeans are besotted with globalization (many of them hate it). He alarms Europeans because he is President Chaos. He is like a character out of a children\u2019s book \u2014 the one who jumped on his horse and galloped in all directions at once.But what might make Mr. Trump the savior of the European Union is not only the resentment he provokes among the risk-averse middle classes but also the radicalizing effect his victory is having on populist parties here. Long before the American election, populists were ascendant in Europe. In several countries they succeeded in attracting a sizable number of votes by swerving to the political center. They thus became, for some, a viable alternative to the status quo.But since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, his European soul mates have ditched that approach and decided to re-radicalize and imitate his campaign\u2019s winning strategy. They jettisoned their hard-earned moderation and returned to an angrier tone and more apocalyptic worldview. Ms. Le Pen was overnight transformed from a compassionate radical into a holy warrior against the two \u201ctotalitarianisms\u201d of our time, Islamism and globalization.In the same way that Barack Obama\u2019s hosannas to the European Union did not assist its supporters, Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-European Union rhetoric does no favors to the populists. European elites are taking this moment to champion Europeans\u2019 independence and speak on behalf of their national interest. Thus Mr. Trump\u2019s revolution provides space for a European Union-friendly nationalism.All that may still happen \u2014 but most likely it won\u2019t. Avoiding the worst, though, might just provide new, badly needed political energy to the European project. History teaches us that in times of crisis, survival is the ultimate source of legitimacy. It will be the European Union\u2019s ability to survive in 2017 rather than its ability to reform itself that might persuade Europeans that unity is not over.Ivan Krastev is the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Giuliani in 1993.There is another side of the ledger to consider, political observers said, that has so far warded off serious contenders in the Democratic primary \u2014 often the deciding contest in a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.\u201cHe\u2019s in this sweet spot of being progressive enough to satisfy the progressives, but not so far to the left that people think he\u2019s an unrealistic leader,\u201d said Christina Greer, a professor of political science at Fordham University. As for quality of life in the city, she added, \u201cThings are either status quo as they were under Bloomberg, or not as bad as people said they would be under de Blasio.\u201dThe election of President Trump has also been a boon for the mayor, who staked out a position as a vocal opponent of the new administration early on.Another factor in the mayor\u2019s favor is that most of the logical Democratic contenders, like Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, would have to leave their office to run for mayor. The safer route would suggest waiting until 2021, when Mr. de Blasio would have to leave office because of term limits.Others have been quietly considering jumping in, including Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker who lost to Mr. de Blasio in 2013, and Daniel R. Garodnick, a Manhattan city councilman who cannot seek re-election this year because of term limits.What has held nearly every Democrat back from making a firm decision is the uncertainty surrounding the federal investigations, they or their aides said. An indictment of one or several members of the de Blasio administration could be enough for some of those waiting in the wings. Criminal charges against Mr. de Blasio would cause a flood of entrants.\u201cIf I had to bet, Stringer still stays out because that\u2019s who he is,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cQuinn\u2019s a tougher call. Garodnick only runs if no one else does and he has a clear shot.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that the mayor is operating from a position of tremendous strength,\u201d said David S. Birdsell, dean of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t have exploitable weaknesses of the sort that would allow a challenger to easily mount a credible campaign.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s critics on the right contend that City Hall is awash in corruption and mismanagement. On the left, he is attacked as acting too slowly or not aggressively enough on housing and policing. Such criticism has prompted an advocate of criminal justice reform, Robert Gangi, to declare a long-shot bid for mayor.Even rising homelessness, if it does not affect quality of life or crime in the city, may not have an effect on his chances. \u201cIt is a tragedy,\u201d Mr. Birdsell said of the human impact of homelessness, \u201cbut the homeless by and large don\u2019t vote.\u201d\u201cThe mayor needs to be replaced because he\u2019s distracted, doesn\u2019t work hard and is mired in conflicts of interest,\u201d said Sal F. Albanese, a Democrat who has run for mayor several times.\u201cI cannot stand by and let a corrupt, noncaring, lazy mayor continue,\u201d said Bo Dietl, a retired police detective who wanted to run as a Democrat but was not registered in the party and did not correctly file the paperwork to switch. (\u201cI will run as an independent,\u201d he said.)State Senator Tony Avella, a Democrat from Queens, said he was running because \u201cineffective management\u201d had made the city \u201ca place that is nearly impossible to afford to live or retire in.\u201dBut failures of personality, style and management do not equate to the sorts of crises that have shaken incumbent mayors from their powerful pedestals in New York City history.\u201cIt is very possible that he could win even though his approval ratings are low,\u201d Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran political consultant, said of the mayor. Mr. Sheinkopf has met with eight potential challengers to Mr. de Blasio about working on their campaigns. He has yet to decide if he will.\u201cThere is no complacency here,\u201d Mr. Walzak said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the U.S. Economy Too Dynamic, or Not Dynamic Enough?", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIf you\u2019re an economic technocrat staring at a dashboard of official indicators of how the United States is doing, these look like pretty good times.The unemployment rate is low. Gross domestic product is growing. Wages are rising a good bit faster than inflation, which is very modest. These may not be all-out boom times, but as far as economic policy goes, it looks like a job well done.Your countrymen, it is amply clear, do not agree.Let\u2019s consider Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, the anti-establishment energy behind the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, and parallels in the politics of Britain and other advanced nations. It takes no grand leap of logic to conclude that something is rotten in many people\u2019s economic lives that hasn\u2019t been picked up by the headline data that government statistical agencies publish every month.But what exactly has gone so wrong?One set of answers boils down to this: The economy has become too volatile and uncertain. Perhaps the dissatisfaction is driven by globalization, automation and the decline of employers\u2019 implicit promises to offer workers jobs through thick and thin. These factors have made it harder for people to get good-paying jobs and to hold onto them for decades. High levels of inequality mean many of the benefits of growth don\u2019t accrue for people at the middle and bottom of the pay scale.All of this has hammered people without an advanced education and left them feeling unmoored and without opportunity, even if by narrow measurements jobs are plentiful and compensation is rising.Robert Johnson, the president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, argues that the cumulative impact of rapid technological change and shifts in work can have downsides that economists should try to account for more rigorously.\u201cWhen firms invest in technical change that disrupts employment structures,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, \u201ctheir decisions focus solely on private profit and neglect the costly side effects that society must bear. When one small firm adopts a new technology displacing workers, this may not be a societal crisis. When many firms do this at the same time, the changes in the nature of production and employment across the nation become a profound social problem.\u201dEconomists speak of \u201cnegative externalities\u201d \u2014 what happens, for example, when a firm pollutes the air, making everyone else worse off. In this argument, rapid change, when it takes place across many industries at once, is a negative externality that we need to try to account for, particularly \u201cwhen the economic insecurity leads to a desperate and extreme politics,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.In short, one could summarize this set of complaints as the economy\u2019s having become too dynamic for its own good.But a different line of research offers an alternate theory.They cite federal data showing that in 1977, more than 16 percent of firms in the United States were less than a year old, a figure that had fallen to half that by 2014. New businesses have similarly done less to power new jobs than they once did, while the biggest, oldest firms account for a rising share of economic activity. Market concentration increased for two-thirds of industries between 1997 and 2012, the report found. That coincided with a steady rise in corporate profits as a share of gross domestic product, and in a decline in the share going to workers\u2019 wages.The job market has become less fluid. The proportion of workers who change jobs in a given year has fallen from 12 percent in 2000 to 7 percent in 2015. Workers are also less likely to migrate within the country. In the 1970s, more than 3 percent of the population moved across state lines in a given year; since 2006, the number has hovered around 1.5 percent.Most startlingly, the creation of new companies has been concentrated in a small number of metropolitan areas: Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. From 2010 to 2014, those five regions created as many net new businesses as the rest of the country combined. If you didn\u2019t live in them, or were unwilling to move to them, you were out of luck.\u201cThe debate is so thoroughly dominated by the idea that there is too much change, too much churn, too much disruption,\u201d said John Lettieri, a co-founder of the innovation group. \u201cAnd it may feel that way to many people. But we think that what they\u2019re really feeling is a lack of creation of new businesses and new jobs.\u201dOld industries have always faced pressure from various forces. The rise of computers obliterated countless jobs for clerks from the 1960s through the 1990s. New steel-making technology rendered old plants obsolete in the 1980s.But in those earlier eras, new industries and new jobs were emerging quickly to take their place. Now, that entrepreneurial ferment, except for in a few megacities, isn\u2019t happening as rapidly.Both the \u201ctoo much dynamism\u201d and the \u201ctoo little dynamism\u201d narratives for what ails American workers have different potential remedies, which cut across ideological lines.If you believe that increased market concentration is a central problem, you might consider tougher antitrust enforcement, a favorite of liberals, but also explore conservative arguments that complex regulation creates an unfair advantage for big companies that can employ scores of lawyers.If you look at globalization as the main problem, you might see some Trumpian renegotiation of trade deals and arm-twisting to get companies to keep jobs at home as being in order. But you could also argue for a more generous social safety net and government funding for retraining.Of course, the too much versus too little dynamism diagnoses aren\u2019t mutually exclusive; there are probably elements of truth in both. Maybe the economy really isn\u2019t working for many Americans because globalization, automation and changing labor practices have thrown them to the wolves. But maybe there are also deep-seated structural shifts preventing communities and individuals from tapping the great opportunities the modern economy offers.Regardless, as the seismic political events of 2016 make clear, the data alone may not tell you much about how the economy looks to millions of people or what might be done to make life better for them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Expects Fewer Foreign Tourists, Saying Trump Is to Blame", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time in seven years, New York City officials expect the number of foreign visitors to decrease, a drop they attribute to the protectionist policies and rhetoric of President Trump \u2014 saying that those moves are scaring off many of the visitors who have helped fuel the city\u2019s robust growth since the last recession.On Tuesday, the city\u2019s tourism marketing agency, NYC & Company, plans to announce that its forecast for international visitors has turned from positive to negative since Mr. Trump was elected in November. The city now expects to draw 300,000 fewer foreigners this year than in 2016, when 12.7 million international visitors came, a decline that will cost businesses in the city that cater to tourists at least $600 million in sales, the agency estimates.Fred Dixon, the chief executive of NYC & Company, said Mr. Trump\u2019s statements and actions had changed perceptions about the hospitality of the United States just as prospective tourists are making vacation plans for 2017. \u201cThe Europeans start coming to New York around Easter and continue through summer,\u201d Mr. Dixon said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s when you\u2019ll see the rhetoric out of Washington really having an impact on travel.\u201dHe said American tourism promoters were \u201cjust sort of holding our breath\u201d in anticipation of a revision of Mr. Trump\u2019s aborted plan to ban arrivals from seven mostly Muslim countries. \u201cRegardless of the specifics, it\u2019s pretty clear the message is going to be unwelcoming,\u201d Mr. Dixon said.News reports about that plan, which could be released on Wednesday, could further dampen interest in visiting New York City, which is the most popular American destination for foreign tourists, Mr. Dixon said.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The rest of the country is expected to see an even larger decline in foreign tourism over the next two years, said Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics, an international firm that forecasts travel trends for several cities in the United States, including New York. He said the annual number of foreign visitors to the United States could fall by 6.3 million between 2016 and 2018 because of reactions to Mr. Trump\u2019s words and actions, such as pledges to pull out of international trade agreements.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at a very challenging year for U.S. travel,\u201d Mr. Sacks said.He said indicators of interest in visiting the United States, including online searches for airline tickets and hotels, started dropping after the election. They dipped again after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and fell further after he signed an executive order on the travel ban, Mr. Sacks said.\u201cThe data are all showing a pretty dramatic shift in behavior and interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThat certainly accelerated since the executive order.\u201dMr. Sacks said his firm had a \u201csolid track record\u201d of forecasting tourism, but he added that there was less certainty in estimating what he called \u201cTrump impacts.\u201dForwardKeys, a Spanish company that tracks travel, said that it saw an \u201cimmediate slump\u201d in bookings of flights to the United States after the travel ban was announced, including a 13.6 percent drop in Western Europe.To combat the perception of a less hospitable climate, NYC & Company plans to start replacing some of its advertising overseas with billboards that declare that the city is \u201cWelcoming the World.\u201d Mr. Dixon said the city was \u201cdoubling down on our welcome message.\u201dAlicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said it was not New York City\u2019s style to turn people away.\u201cWe\u2019re a place that welcomes everybody,\u201d Ms. Glen said. \u201cIt\u2019s in our values and in our economic interest. We\u2019ll keep reminding visitors what we stand for, so we can keep this both the most internationally visited and the safest city in America.\u201dNew York still expects a slight increase in tourism this year, but only because of an increase in domestic visitors, Mr. Dixon said. NYC & Company forecasts that the city will attract 61.7 million visitors, up from 60.7 million in 2016, with an increase of 1.3 million domestic visitors offsetting the decline of foreign travelers.Before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the city had been expecting an increase of 400,000 foreign visitors in 2017, Mr. Dixon said. That swing will be very costly to the city\u2019s economy, he said, because foreign tourists stay longer and spend more freely than domestic tourists. On average, foreigners spend about $2,000 in the city, compared with about $500 for Americans.\u201cWe were looking forward to a really strong 2017,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. \u201cTravel is a very precious commodity and people have choices. Once the vacation of 2017 is gone, you don\u2019t get that back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going Home to Falluja, a City Slipping Back Into Turmoil", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes journalists are in Iraq\u2019s Sunni heartland to evaluate rebuilding efforts after battles with the Islamic State.FALLUJA, Iraq \u2014 Iraqi forces had taken Falluja from the Islamic State months before, and Sabah Rashid was more than ready to return home. But the police warned him not to go.Fleeing Islamic State fighters had rigged bombs all through his south Falluja neighborhood, and these had still not been cleared, they told him. Insurgent corpses were said to lay unrecovered.Mr. Rashid, 30, a determined sort, moved back into his ransacked house anyway \u2014 he and his family fled the Islamic State three years ago and did not want to wait. Last week, they were camped out in their sagging house with no heat, electricity or running water. They boiled water on a wood fire. And they waited with mounting frustration for promised government aid.The Shiite-dominated national government has not yet demonstrated that it can secure and rebuild this shattered Sunni city, soothe sectarian grievances or provide for 250,000 returning residents. Iraqi and American security officials now fear that if the Sunnis of Falluja are given no reason to trust the government, they may once again embrace the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.Local officials say Islamic State sleeper cells remain active, and many residents continue to aid the insurgents. Guerrilla attacks have resumed; in one of the most recent episodes, a suicide car bomb on Jan. 28 killed two police officers.The seeds of an incomplete victory were there from the start. Falluja had long been disaffected from the government, and it was the first Iraqi city to fall under Islamic State control. Even with the group mostly driven out, the government faced a widespread lack of trust.\u201cOf course, violations occurred in some places,\u201d by Shiite militiamen, said Salam Ajmi, a Falluja municipal councilman. But now, he said, some Sunni residents were cooperating with security forces to help root out Islamic State sleeper cells.A visit to Falluja by Times journalists showed that last summer\u2019s battle had left some sections of the city relatively unscathed, but had reduced others to rubble. Many streets were littered with crumpled buildings, collapsed roofs and burned-out cars, all coated with gray dust. The skeleton of a crushed Humvee lay near Mr. Rashid\u2019s home.For Mr. Rashid, the satisfaction of returning home was dimmed by resentment toward local Sunni officials charged with rebuilding the city.\u201cWe get nothing from them but promises \u2014 we are on our own,\u201d he said as his two young sons fed dry grass to the campfire.The family members survive on food purchased at a newly opened market in a nearby district. Their own Al Alamin neighborhood offered only a bleak panorama of bullet-pocked homes and deserted streets.\u201cFalluja has had some hard lessons \u2014 we hope this will be our last hard lesson,\u201d said Sheikh Talib al-Efan, the head of Falluja\u2019s local council, who has promised returnees that help is on the way.Mr. Efan spoke in a cold, darkened room, within a building he said had been used as an Islamic State headquarters and was now the council\u2019s makeshift office. The electricity sputtered on and off.Mr. Efan is a returnee himself. His three homes \u2014 one for each wife \u2014 were destroyed during the Islamic State occupation, he said. He has lived at a friend\u2019s house since returning in August.\u201cPeople have to expect delays,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be patient.\u201dThe United Nations Development Program said it had made stopgap repairs to the city\u2019s main teaching hospital and to five schools and health centers. The agency has restored rudimentary electricity and water in many areas, cleared debris and hired 300 locals to clean streets.Lise Grande, the United Nations deputy special representative in Iraq, said the agency\u2019s stabilization work was to help patch up Falluja until more permanent repairs could be made. The agency has spent $8.6 million of $18.5 million allocated \u2014 a small fraction of the amount needed to rebuild the city.Mr. Ajmi, the councilman, said the council had little funding. Depressed oil prices have kept Iraq\u2019s economy floundering. Life is precarious everywhere, he said, not just in Falluja.Hussein Ahmed, 53, who lived in a displaced-persons camp for three years, said he had lost patience with the council. He returned to Falluja to find his house wrecked \u2014 the third he has lost. Two previous homes were destroyed during battles against fighters for Al Qaeda in Iraq, he said.\u201cWe were hurt badly by Daesh,\u201d he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re being hurt by our own government.\u201dMr. Ahmed pointed to an expanse of toppled buildings: \u201cThis area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now.\u201dOther returning residents nodded as Mr. Ahmed added, \u201cI speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us.\u201dFalluja has endured tragedy on an epic scale since 2003.The city was pounded during repeated battles \u2014 first between the United States and Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces in 2003, then between American Marines and Al Qaeda fighters. Most insurgents were eventually evicted with the help of Sunni tribal fighters.But the insurgency was reborn as the Islamic State. It overran Falluja in December 2013, and the city became an important base for the group\u2019s operations. One reason the government assaulted the city last May, even before turning to the critical campaign for Mosul, to the north, was to curb a devastating car bomb campaign against Baghdad that was being operated from Falluja.Now, the United States military is working with Iraqi forces to prevent Islamic State fighters from rising up in Falluja again, said a spokesman, Col. John L. Dorrian. \u201cThey have proved very resilient,\u201d he said.Of the 320,000 people who fled Falluja for aid camps, about 250,000 have returned since mid-October, the United Nations said. They are desperate to live at home again, whatever the risk.In south Falluja, First Lt. Walid Mohammed of the police shook his head as Mr. Rashid and his children tended their campfire. \u201cWe told them the risk is all theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are responsible if anything happens, not us.\u201dElisabeth Koek, of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq, said about letting residents return to dangerous areas deprived of public services: \u201cThis is incredibly worrying.\u201dMr. Rashid said he returned even after a booby-trap killed a returnee in a supposedly cleared area nearby. After Mr. Rashid moved in, a woman was killed by an explosion on Jan. 31 as she was repairing her home in the same area, police said.Mr. Rashid said he was accustomed to danger. He lifted his shirt to reveal jagged, crimson scars on his belly from an Islamic State bomb that he said blew up the family car in late 2013. The blackened front seat lay in the front yard.A tall, gray-whiskered man suddenly appeared: Mohammed Saeed, 49, a neighbor whom Mr. Rashid had not seen since 2013. Mr. Saed had returned that morning, three years after fleeing. His home was dirty and bereft of electricity or water. But he was moving in.Mr. Saed kissed Mr. Rashid on both cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d he told him. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous, terrible place, but we are home.\u201dFalih Hassan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump\u2019s 2-for-1 Rule on Regulations Is No Quick Fix", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewPresident Trump intends to pare back a vast array of government regulations in fields like environmental protection, food and drug safety, and consumer finance. On Jan. 30 he ordered that for every new regulation it imposes, the government must get rid of two old ones.It is an interesting idea but a misguided one. Even if government regulations are sometimes a burden, they are clearly critical to the functioning of a modern economy and society.Yet while Mr. Trump\u2019s approach is wrongheaded, there is logic to it. The concept has backing in some behavioral economics and business circles, and is certainly popular among many of his followers, who are quite hostile to what they see as massive over-regulation. The emotional part of the issue is important, reflecting a long-term societal schism between highly business-oriented people and those of other persuasions.I can personally attest to the emotional side of the argument, since I see it reflected in my own extended family, where the Trump supporters tend to have strong business connections and seem to take regulation as a personal affront, as if it stands as a barrier to their self-actualization and personal fulfillment. They tend to disparage regulators, while I view these officials as unsung heroes. This division appears to be a core issue in our society, and if not dealt with properly, it could lead to the destruction of our immensely valuable regulatory framework.Putting emotions aside for a moment, there is indeed a problem \u2014 one recognized by both major political parties for decades \u2014 involving the need for incentives to get the level and tone of regulation right. Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order builds on a deregulation movement that gained considerable momentum with Milton Friedman\u2019s book \u201cCapitalism and Freedom\u201d in 1962 and the beginnings of the Thatcher-Reagan revolution in the 1980s.Mr. Friedman underscored problems of asymmetry in regulation: People who especially benefit from a particular regulation will be inclined to lobby or bribe government officials for it. On the other hand, members of the general public, who might suffer from such regulations, will not be attentive to the many rules that affect them, each in a small way. And once regulations are imposed, government officials may have little interest in deleting those that are mistakes. In short, government regulators may not always be properly incentivized to make sure the accumulated body of rules is actually benefiting the public, not just specific interest groups.Mr. Trump\u2019s two-for one executive order might be considered an application of behavioral economics to deal with an intractable dilemma. Tying the culling of old regulations to the imposition of new ones can be seen as a strategy for forcing regulators to overcome their inability to see problems created by past regulations that remain in force. The order might motivate them to divert time and energy away from their presumed enthusiasm for creating new regulations, using it to clean up the errors their predecessors left behind.But translating this attentional device into good regulatory policy will be difficult if not impossible, because the issues intrinsic to regulation are so subtle.The United States has historically wavered in its views of regulation and we are in danger of taking a wild swing once again. In the 19th century, for example, they were minimal. The first major federal regulator, the Interstate Commerce Commission, was created in 1887 to control fares charged by railroads. It was the beginning of the Progressive movement, which favored increasing regulations to protect the interests of the general public, sometimes irking the wealthy elite.By the Roaring Twenties, during the presidency of Calvin Coolidge, Progressivism was in retreat and regulations were in disfavor. Mr. Coolidge generally opposed government intervention in the economy on libertarian grounds, and some of his policies have a certain resonance in the Trump era: After all, Coolidge cut taxes on high-income people; appointed a very wealthy man, Andrew Mellon, as Treasury secretary; and restricted immigration by region of origin.In some respects, Coolidge was nothing like President Trump. Coolidge was a bland speaker, for example, who upheld decorum and traditional, even puritanical, values as the nation enjoyed a burst of personal and sexual liberation and extravagance. But he professed a faith in American business similar to that of the current president\u2019s, a tendency to think that not only could business do no wrong, but also that businessmen were the only people who matter.There was a swing back to a much stronger regulatory regime in the 1930s, with far tighter controls over banks and securities firms, and we still benefit from many of those changes. After further zigzags, we are now facing what could be a dangerously anti-regulatory environment.But we must remember that government needs to step in where private markets cannot function fairly on their own. Regulation is in the public interest in dozens of areas. Of course, we need to listen to aggrieved parties who feel that they are hurt by over-regulation and, when they have a good case, we should do something about it. But we shouldn\u2019t make the mistake of abandoning trust in the good works of regulators.The real solution to the problems that are the focus of the two-for-one rule is to provide better rewards, making government regulation a more attractive and respected career. The world is far too complex to make it possible to count up regulations meaningfully and impose a two-for-one rule.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shaky Jobs, Sluggish Wages: Reasons Are at Home", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ScenePresident Trump hasn\u2019t been saving jobs in the last few weeks, focusing his energy (and Twitter feed) on how to close the borders to immigrants instead.When he gets back to it, he might spend less time on the workers putting together air-conditioning units in Indiana and more \u2014 a lot more \u2014 on the maids and janitors who clean Trump golf resorts and hotels.Rather, it is to argue that by obsessing over how the manufacturing jobs of the 1970s were lost to globalization, Mr. Trump is missing a more critical workplace transformation: the vast outsourcing of many tasks \u2014 including running the cafeteria, building maintenance and security \u2014 to low-margin, low-wage subcontractors within the United States.This reorganization of employment is playing a big role in keeping a lid on wages \u2014 and in driving income inequality \u2014 across a much broader swath of the economy than globalization can account for.The trend grew as the spread of information technology made it easier for companies to standardize and monitor the quality of outsourced work. Many employers took to outsourcing to avoid the messy consequences \u2014 like unions and workplace regulations \u2014 of employing workers directly.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important part of the story that we haven\u2019t paid attention to,\u201d Mr. Weil told me.\u201cLead businesses \u2014 the firms that continue to directly employ workers who provide the goods and services in the economy recognized by consumers \u2014 remain highly profitable and may continue to provide generous pay for their work force,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe workers whose jobs have been shed to other, subordinate businesses face far more competitive market conditions.\u201dNonstandard employment arrangements like these account for nearly one in six jobs today. That is 24 million jobs, nine million more than 10 years ago.The rise of outsourced work adds an important twist to the standard understanding of America\u2019s growing wage inequality, which is based on the notion that technology has left less-educated workers behind \u2014 taking over their routine jobs while opening lucrative new possibilities for the better-educated.The sorting of workers into different classes of companies will further widen the earnings gap as the rewards of the most profitable among them \u201cincreasingly go to a more limited group of highly compensated and more-educated workers and to shareholders,\u201d Professor Katz explained.Manufacturing has gone through this process. General Motors in its heyday employed more than 600,000 workers in the United States, including the engineer, the man sweeping the shop floor and the woman serving coffee. Though the engineer certainly earned much more, the other two could share in G.M.\u2019s success. Norms of fairness, Mr. Weil argues, would limit the wage gap between workers of a single company, giving a boost to those at the bottom.The trend is not unique to manufacturing nor to outsourcing overseas, though. It is happening across the nation\u2019s brick-and-mortar workplaces and coursing through service industries, the fastest-growing segment of the labor market.Though the gig economy is still small \u2014 employing 0.5 percent of contingent workers, according to Professors Katz and Krueger \u2014 the technologies powering it are likely to fissure the American workplace further.This sorting would increase the slice of national income going to shareholders and reduce workers\u2019 share. The pattern is consistent with evidence that most of the widening of the nation\u2019s earnings inequality can be explained by growing pay gaps between organizations rather than within them.Over all, Professor Katz estimates, the sorting of workers into high- and low-end employers accounts for a quarter to a third of the increase of wage inequality in the United States since 1980.It\u2019s not an easy problem to fix, though. As Mr. Weil puts it, \u201cHow do you reattach some of the responsibility to the engine of value of these network business systems?\u201d Companies will continue to seek efficiencies by shunting work into these broader networks. And it would make little sense to adopt policies that forbid this kind of business organization. Encouraging unions, which many scholars have suggested as a tool to improve wage growth, could well accelerate the splintering.Whatever its difficulties, addressing the vast transformation underway in the organization of work seems more relevant than tilting at windmills in hopes of restoring American manufacturing to its 1950s state.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico City, Parched and Sinking, Faces a Water Crisis", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 On bad days, you can smell the stench from a mile away, drifting over a nowhere sprawl of highways and office parks.When the Grand Canal was completed, at the end of the 1800s, it was Mexico City\u2019s Brooklyn Bridge, a major feat of engineering and a symbol of civic pride: 29 miles long, with the ability to move tens of thousands of gallons of wastewater per second. It promised to solve the flooding and sewage problems that had plagued the city for centuries.Only it didn\u2019t, pretty much from the start. The canal was based on gravity. And Mexico City, a mile and a half above sea level, was sinking, collapsing in on itself.It still is, faster and faster, and the canal is just one victim of what has become a vicious cycle. Always short of water, Mexico City keeps drilling deeper for more, weakening the ancient clay lake beds on which the Aztecs first built much of the city, causing it to crumble even further.MOUNTTLALOCGrandCanalExtent of underlyingancient lake sedimentsSIERRA DEGUADALUPECITYCENTERNationalPalaceMEXICOCITYGrandCanalExtent of underlyingancient lake sedimentsSIERRA DEGUADALUPECITYCENTERNationalPalaceMEXICOCITYExtent of underlyingancient lake sedimentsGrandCanalNationalPalaceMEXICOCITYGrandCanalExtent of underlyingancient lake sedimentsNationalPalaceMEXICOCITYMOUNTTLALOCColored areas show how quickly the groundsank from October 2014 to May 2015GrandCanalMissingdata5 INCHES/YEARSIERRA DEGUADALUPE7 INCHES/YEARSANK AT A RATE OF9 INCHES PER YEARIZTAPALAPANEIGHBORHOODCITYCENTERNationalPalaceMEXICOCITYMissingdataColored areas show how quickly the groundsank from October 2014 to May 2015GrandCanalMissingdata5 INCHES/YEARSIERRA DEGUADALUPE7 INCHES/YEARSANK AT A RATE OF9 INCHES PER YEARIZTAPALAPANEIGHBORHOODCITYCENTERNationalPalaceMEXICOCITYMissingdataColored areas show how quickly the groundsank from October 2014 to May 2015GrandCanal5 INCHES/YEARMissingdata7 INCHES/YEARSANK AT A RATE OF9 INCHES PER YEARNationalPalaceMEXICOCITYMissingdataColored areas show how quickly the ground sank from October 2014 to May 20155 INCHES/YEARSANK AT A RATE OF9 INCHES PER YEARGrandCanalNationalPalaceMEXICOCITY\u00a0\u00a0It is a cycle made worse by climate change.

Sidewalks resemble broken china, and 15 elementary schools have crumbled or caved in.Much is being written about climate change and the impact of rising seas on waterfront populations. But coasts are not the only places affected. Mexico City \u2014 high in the mountains, in the center of the country \u2014 is a glaring example. The world has a lot invested in crowded capitals like this one, with vast numbers of people, huge economies and the stability of a hemisphere at risk.How climate change is challenging the world\u2019s urban centers.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.One study predicts that 10 percent of Mexicans ages 15 to 65 could eventually try to emigrate north as a result of rising temperatures, drought and floods, potentially scattering millions of people and heightening already extreme political tensions over immigration.The effects of climate change are varied and opportunistic, but one thing is consistent: They are like sparks in the tinder. They expose cities\u2019 biggest vulnerabilities, inflaming troubles that politicians and city planners often ignore or try to paper over. And they spread outward, defying borders.That\u2019s what this series is about \u2014 how global cities tackle climate threats, or fail to. Around the world, extreme weather and water scarcity are accelerating repression, regional conflicts and violence. A Columbia University report found that where rainfall declines, \u201cthe risk of a low-level conflict escalating to a full-scale civil war approximately doubles the following year.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s term for climate change is \u201cthreat multiplier.\u201dAnd nowhere does this apply more obviously than in cities. This is the first urban century in human history, the first time more people live in cities than don\u2019t, with predictions that three-quarters of the global population will be urban by 2050. By that time, according to another study, there may be more than 700 million climate refugees on the move.For many cities around the world, adapting to climate change is a route to long-term prosperity. That\u2019s the good news, where societies are willing to listen. But adaptation can also be costly and slow. It can run counter to the rhythms of political campaigns and headlong into powerful, entrenched interests, confounding business as usual. This is, in effect, what happened in New Orleans, which ignored countless warning signs, destroyed natural protections, gave developers a free pass and failed to reinforce levees before Hurricane Katrina left much of the city in ruins.Unlike traffic jams or crime, climate change isn\u2019t something most people easily feel or see. It is certainly not what residents in Mexico City talk about every day. But it is like an approaching storm, straining an already precarious social fabric and threatening to push a great city toward a breaking point.As Arnoldo Kramer, Mexico City\u2019s chief resilience officer, put it: \u201cClimate change has become the biggest long-term threat to this city\u2019s future. And that\u2019s because it is linked to water, health, air pollution, traffic disruption from floods, housing vulnerability to landslides \u2014 which means we can\u2019t begin to address any of the city\u2019s real problems without facing the climate issue.\u201dThere\u2019s much more at stake than this city\u2019s well being. At the extreme, if climate change wreaks havoc on the social and economic fabric of global linchpins like Mexico City, warns the writer Christian Parenti, \u201cno amount of walls, guns, barbed wire, armed aerial drones or permanently deployed mercenaries will be able to save one half of the planet from the other.\u201dAn element of magical realism plays into Mexico City\u2019s sinking. At a roundabout along the Paseo de la Reforma, the city\u2019s wide downtown boulevard, the gilded Angel of Independence, a symbol of Mexican pride, looks over a sea of traffic from the top of a tall Corinthian column.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.Tourists snap pictures without realizing that when Mexico\u2019s president cut the ribbon for the column in 1910, the monument sat on a sculptured base reached by climbing nine shallow steps. But over the decades, the whole neighborhood around the monument sank, like a receding ocean at low tide, gradually marooning the Angel. Fourteen large steps eventually had to be added to the base so that the monument still connected to the street.Deeper in the city\u2019s historic center, the rear of the National Palace now tilts over the sidewalk like a sea captain leaning into a strong headwind. Buildings here can resemble Cubist drawings, with slanting windows, wavy cornices and doors that no longer align with their frames. Pedestrians trudge up hills where the once flat lake bed has given way. The cathedral in the city\u2019s central square, known as the Z\u00f3calo, famously sunken in spots during the last century, is a kind of fun house, with a leaning chapel and a bell tower into which stone wedges were inserted during construction to act more or less like matchbooks under the leg of a wobbly cafe table.Loreta Castro Reguera is a young, Harvard-trained architect who has made a specialty of the sinking ground in Mexico City, a phenomenon known as subsidence. She pointed down a main street that stretches from the Z\u00f3calo and divides east from west, following the route of an ancient Aztec dike.The whole city occupies what was once a network of lakes. In 1325, the Aztecs established their capital, Tenochtitl\u00e1n, on an island. Over time, they expanded the city with landfill and planted crops on floating gardens called chinampas, plots of arable soil created from wattle and sediment. The lakes provided the Aztecs with a line of defense, the chinampas with sustenance. The idea: Live with nature.Then the conquering Spaniards waged war against water, determined to subdue it. The Aztec system was foreign to them. They replaced the dikes and canals with streets and squares. They drained the lakes and cleared forestland, suffering flood after flood, including one that drowned the city for five straight years.\u201cThe Aztecs managed,\u201d Ms. Castro said. \u201cBut they had 300,000 people. We now have 21 million.\u201dMexico City today is an agglomeration of neighborhoods that are really many big cities cheek by jowl. During the last century, millions of migrants poured in from the countryside to find jobs. The city\u2019s growth, from 30 square miles in 1950 to a metropolitan area of about 3,000 square miles 60 years later, has produced a vibrant but chaotic megalopolis of largely unplanned and sprawling development. Highways and cars choke the atmosphere with heat-inducing carbon dioxide \u2014 and development has wiped out nearly every remaining trace of the original lakes, taxing the underground aquifers and forcing what was once a water-rich valley to import billions of gallons from far away.The system of getting the water from there to here is a miracle of modern hydroengineering. But it is also a crazy feat, in part a consequence of the fact that the city, with a legacy of struggling government, has no large-scale operation for recycling wastewater or collecting rainwater, forcing it to expel a staggering 200 billion gallons of both via crippled sewers like the Grand Canal. Mexico City now imports as much as 40 percent of its water from remote sources \u2014 then squanders more than 40 percent of what runs through its 8,000 miles of pipes because of leaks and pilfering. This is not to mention that pumping all this water more than a mile up into the mountains consumes roughly as much energy as does the entire metropolis of Puebla, a Mexican state capital with a population akin to Philadelphia\u2019s.Even with this mind-boggling undertaking, the government acknowledges that nearly 20 percent of Mexico City residents \u2014 critics put the number even higher \u2014 still can\u2019t count on getting water from their taps each day. For some residents, water comes only once a week, or once every several weeks, and that may mean just an hour of yellow muck dripping from the faucet. Those people have to hire trucks to deliver drinking water, at costs sometimes exponentially higher than wealthy residents pay in better-served neighborhoods.Overseeing the city\u2019s water supply is a thin, patient man with the war-weary air of an old general: Ram\u00f3n Aguirre D\u00edaz, director of the Water System of Mexico City, is unusually frank about the perils ahead.\u201cClimate change is expected to have two effects,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe expect heavier, more intense rains, which means more floods, but also more and longer droughts.\u201dIf it stops raining in the reservoirs where the city gets its water, \u201cwe\u2019re facing a potential disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way we can provide enough trucks of water to deal with that scenario.\u201d\u201cIf we have the problems that California and S\u00e3o Paulo have had,\u201d he added, \u201cthere is the serious possibility of unrest.\u201dThe problem is not simply that the aquifers are being depleted. Mexico City rests on a mix of clay lake beds and volcanic soil. Areas like downtown sit on clay. Other districts were built on volcanic fields.Volcanic soil absorbs water and delivers it to the aquifers. It\u2019s stable and porous. Picture a bucket filled with marbles. You can pour water into the bucket, and the marbles will hardly move. Stick a straw into the bucket to extract the water, and the marbles still won\u2019t move. For centuries, before the population exploded, volcanic soil guaranteed that the city had water underground.Mexico City\u2019s water crisis today comes partly from the fact that so much of this porous land \u2014 including large stretches of what Mexico City has supposedly set aside for agriculture and preservation, called \u201cconservation land\u201d \u2014 has been developed. So it is buried beneath concrete and asphalt, stopping rain from filtering down to the aquifers, causing floods and creating \u201cheat islands\u201d that raise temperatures further and only increase the demand for water. This is part of the sprawl problem.Now, picture layered sheets of plastic. On a molecular level, clay acts sort of like that. It doesn\u2019t really absorb water. Instead, water settles between the sheets. When the water is drained, the sheets can collapse and crack. If all of Mexico City were built on clay, it would at least sink at the same rate and \u201csubsidence would be an anecdote,\u201d Mr. Aguirre said.But because the city is built on a mix of clay and volcanic soil, it sinks unevenly, causing dramatic and deadly fissures. In Iztapalapa, Pedro Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, director of ecological studies at the Metropolitan Autonomous University, climbed down into what felt like a ravine where a street had given way. He\u2019s been tracking the problem for years. Fifteen thousand houses in the area, he said, had been damaged by sinking ground.Deep below the historic center, water extracted from aquifers now can end up just beyond the city limits, in Ecatepec, at one of the largest pumping stations along the Grand Canal. The pump, completed in 2007, was built to move 11,000 gallons per second \u2014 essentially water that now needs to be lifted up from where the canal has collapsed, just so that it can continue on its way.The man in charge of this herculean undertaking is Carlos Salgado Ter\u00e1n, chief of the department of drainage for Zone A in Mexico City, a trim, no-funny-business official in a starched bright green shirt. According to Mr. Salgado, the Grand Canal today is working at only 30 percent of capacity because of subsidence. He admitted that it was a Sisyphean struggle to keep up with the city\u2019s decline. Parts of the canal around Ecatepec have sunk an additional six feet just since the plant was built, he said.He showed me around one morning. The canal is wide open, a stinking river of sewage belching methane and sulfuric acid. Apartment blocks, incongruously painted cheerful Crayola colors, hug the bank. A lonely tricycle sat in a parking lot near where the station\u2019s giant, noisy engines churn out greasy white foam that coats the black water.Mr. Salgado asked if I wanted a tour of the filters. \u201cThe smell can be unbearable, and it\u2019s very unhealthy,\u201d he cautioned.The district of Tlalpan is on the opposite side of Mexico City. There, Claudia Sheinbaum, a former environment minister who developed the city\u2019s first climate change program, is now a local district president. She has the slightly impatient, defensive mien of someone wrestling with an impossible mission.\u201cWith climate change, the situation will only get much worse,\u201d she said. A warming climate will only increase the city\u2019s problems with pollution, specifically ozone. Heat waves mean health crises and rising costs for health care in a city where air-conditioning is not commonplace in poor neighborhoods. She seconded what Mr. Aguirre had said about the threat of drought. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cif there is drought we are not prepared.\u201dFor the time being, Well 30 helps supply Tlalpan with drinking water. One recent morning, large trucks, called \u201cpipas,\u201d some with neat lettering that promised \u201cagua potable,\u201d crowded a muddy turnoff beside the highway. From a low cinder-block building, painted red, scrawled with graffiti and crowned in barbed wire, sprouted two long, angled pipes connected to dangling hoses. The arrangement of the pipes and hoses looked something like the gallows in a game of hangman.These pipes plunge 1,000 feet down to reach an aquifer. Trucks, endlessly, one after another, wait their turn to fill up, positioning themselves beneath the hoses.This is where residents of Tlalpan get water when they can\u2019t get it from their faucets. It takes more than 500 trips a day to satisfy the parched citizens of the district. Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, the district representative at the well, distributes assignments from a desk in the red building piled with stacks of orders that residents file. Drivers wait at his window, as at a fast-food drive-through, to pick up their assignments.\u201cThe pump is always working,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cAt least it is still good water.\u201dTo the east, in Iztapalapa, some wells tap into a noxious stew contaminated by minerals and chemicals. Angry residents wait in lines overnight to plead with pipa drivers, who sometimes pit desperate families against one another, seeing who pays the bigger bribe.Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, who helped manage the water supply for Iztapalapa for 32 years, said the health effects of contaminated water were clear to residents whose infants regularly broke out in rashes and whose grandparents suffered colitis.In some cases, the wait for water trucks can make the cable guy look punctual: Deliveries may be promised in three to 30 days, forcing residents to stay home the whole time, because orders are canceled if there\u2019s no one in the house when the trucks arrive.\u201cWater becomes the center of women\u2019s lives in places where there is a serious problem,\u201d points out Mireya Imaz, a program director at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \u201cWomen in Iztapalapa can spend all night waiting for the pipas, then they have to be home for the trucks, and sometimes they will ride with the drivers to make sure the drivers deliver the water, which is not always a safe thing to do.\u201d\u201cIt becomes impossible for many poor women to work outside the home,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole system is made worse by corruption.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much what I heard talking to women in Iztapalapa. Virginia Josefina Ram\u00edrez Granillo was standing in the courtyard of a community center in San Miguel Teotongo, a hilly neighborhood on the edge of the district, next to a wishful mural showing a woman washing clothes in her sink with a running faucet.\u201cWe line up at 3 in the morning for the pipa,\u201d Ms. Ram\u00edrez said, pointing toward a distant spot where the trucks arrive. \u201cWe wait for hours to get water that doesn\u2019t last a week, and usually there aren\u2019t enough pipas. Sometimes there is violence. Women sell their spaces in the line. If you\u2019re from the wrong political party, you don\u2019t get water. You have to show your party affiliation, your voting ID.\u201dPeople in rich neighborhoods on the other side of town, \u201cthey don\u2019t have to think about water,\u201d she added. \u201cBut for us it is something we think about all day, every day.\u201dFinally, there are places in Mexico City that even pipas can\u2019t reach, where the precariousness of the entire water system, and by extension the whole city, is epitomized in a few scruffy acres.Diana Contreras Guzm\u00e1n lives in the highlands of the district of Xochimilco, where the roads rise almost vertically and dirt byways lead to shanties made of corrugated tin, cinder block and cardboard. A young single mother, she lives with nine relatives in a one-room shack. Ms. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s father and three brothers are janitors. Her sister works in an office. To reach a bus to get to work, more than a mile down the hill, they set out at 4:30 a.m., leaving Ms. Guzm\u00e1n, most days, to care for four small children \u2014 and to deal with water.Once a week, a pipa delivers water farther up the hill, where the road is paved. When that happens, Ms. Guzm\u00e1n, a small, thin woman, spends two hours climbing up the hill and back down again, seven times in all, lugging 90 pounds of water on each return trip. Sometimes Josu\u00e9 and Valentina, two of the children, try to help, dragging half-gallon bottles. Ms. Guzm\u00e1n can\u2019t leave the house for long, she said, in case someone steals water from her cistern.For 100 gallons from the pipa, she pays 25 cents. But this doesn\u2019t begin to supply her family with enough water. So every day she also pays \u00c1ngel, a neighbor in his 70s who owns a pair of donkeys named Reindeer and Rabbit. The donkeys trudge plastic containers of water, four at a time, from a well down the hill.Ms. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s family earns $600 a month. They ultimately have to spend more than 10 percent of that income on water \u2014 enough to yield about 10 gallons per person per day.The average resident in a wealthy Mexico City neighborhood to the west, nearer the reservoirs, consumes 100 gallons per day, experts note. The wealthy resident pays one-tenth what Ms. Guzm\u00e1n does.\u201cIs there any clearer indication that everything about water in this city comes down to inequity?\u201d said David Vargas, whose company, Isla Urbana, produces a low-cost rainwater-harvesting system.I put this question to Tanya M\u00fcller Garc\u00eda, the city\u2019s secretary for the environment. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly breaking records for the warmest months,\u201d she said, handing over a report on Mexico City\u2019s sustainability plans. There are predictions that by 2080 the city\u2019s average temperature will have risen several degrees and that annual rainfall will have decreased 20 percent.Ms. M\u00fcller was defensive about the city\u2019s inability to supply every resident with clean water, insisting that the numbers of those unserved were exaggerated. She listed progressive new programs intended to combat pollution, preserve green spaces and reduce the demand for cars by improving mass transit. This city is full of brilliant people with good ideas, including a plan to create a water fund into which corporations drawing heavily on the water supply would pay \u2014 to help improve services in less advantaged areas. Another plan envisions a public park that would double as a rainwater collection basin. And there\u2019s a long-term agenda to turn the airport into a green, mixed-use district.Meanwhile, the Mexican federal government envisions constructing a giant new airport on a dry lake bed, exactly the worst place to build. It recently cut to zero federal money budgeted for fixing the city\u2019s pipes, Metro and other critical infrastructure. Partly this is just politics. The mayor of Mexico City has talked about running for president. The current administration doesn\u2019t want to do him any favors. At the same time, the federal government has its own agenda, promoting highways, cars and sprawl.The disconnect between local and federal officials is not unique to Mexico. Often big cities find themselves undermined by state and federal politicians catering to a different electorate, as if in the end the consequences won\u2019t be ruinous for everyone.\u201cThere has to be a consensus \u2014 of scientists, politicians, engineers and society \u2014 when it comes to pollution, water, climate,\u201d Ms. Sheinbaum, the former environment minister, stressed. \u201cWe have the resources, but lack the political will.\u201dIt turns out Ms. Sheinbaum herself lives in a house that can count on water from the tap only twice a month.So she, too, orders pipas to come to fill her cistern.Zoe Mendelson contributed research.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White.

{"Headline": "Trump Is Off to a Slow Start on Trade Promises", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump keeps firing verbal broadsides at Mexico and China, but so far his new administration has not acted to keep specific campaign promises about trade policy.Mr. Trump did not declare China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on his first day in office, as he had vowed, nor has he after his first month. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Thursday that his department was conducting a standard biannual review of the currency practices of China and other trading partners.Mr. Trump also has not initiated the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, something he promised to \u201cimmediately pursue.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a huge gap between rhetoric and reality,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow and specialist on trade policy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Mr. Trump made trade one of his signature issues during the campaign, excoriating what he described as failed policies that have allowed foreign countries, notably China and Mexico, to profit at Americans\u2019 expense. And he has not changed his tune since he moved into the White House.\u201cTake a look at Nafta, one of the worst deals ever made by any country having to do with economic development,\u201d Mr. Trump told the cheering crowd on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s economic undevelopment, as far as our country is concerned.\u201dBut the absence of clear action on China and Mexico is striking, both because Mr. Trump\u2019s language remains so bellicose and because the administration has moved quickly to keep many of the other campaign promises that it made.Mr. Trump has nominated a conservative judge to the Supreme Court and announced a freeze on federal hiring. He has reversed some Obama-era regulations and sharply shifted the government\u2019s policies on immigration. The White House is pressing Congress to approve a new health care plan and overhaul the tax code.Trade policy has emerged as perhaps the most notable exception.Mr. Trump\u2019s views on trade diverge widely from the mainstream of the Republican Party, more so than on any other issue of economic policy. And some Republicans were quick to warn Mr. Trump against protectionist measures, fearing they could damage American economic growth.\u201cThe main point I wanted to convey is that regardless of what action the incoming president takes on trade, he and his advisers should consider the effects on agriculture,\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, declared last month after meeting with Robert E. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be chief trade negotiator. \u201cI expect the new administration to work hard to maintain existing markets for Iowa and other farm states\u2019 exports and open new markets as well.\u201dMr. Trump said during the presidential campaign that he would declare China a currency manipulator on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his administration. He reiterated that commitment in his \u201cContract with the American Voter,\u201d which said, \u201cI will direct the secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.\u201dAnd on Thursday, Mr. Trump reiterated his longstanding view of China in an interview with Reuters. \u201cI think they\u2019re the grand champions at manipulation of currency,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dBut Mr. Mnuchin had already made clear hours earlier that the administration did not intend for anything to happen, at least immediately.In a televised interview with CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin said that China\u2019s currency practices would be evaluated on the same schedule as those of other American trading partners. The Treasury publishes biannual reports on April 15 and October 15.\u201cWe have a process within Treasury where we go through and look at currency manipulation across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go through that process. We\u2019ll do that as we have in the past. We\u2019re not making any judgments until we continue that process.\u201dSpecialists in currency policy say that they see no evidence that China is suppressing the value of its currency to increase exports, as it did in previous decades.The White House and the Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment.If the United States determines that China is manipulating its currency, a step the Treasury last took in 1994, the government would seek to reach an agreement with China, but could eventually impose tariffs on Chinese imports.The administration is also moving slowly on its pledge to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The White House must notify Congress 90 days before it begins renegotiation of a trade agreement. The Trump administration not provided such notification.The Mexican government triggered its own 90-day clock at the beginning of February, but officials are happy to watch and wait.\u201cWe are not in a hurry to change anything,\u201d the Mexican economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, told reporters on Thursday, noting that his counterparts in the United States have yet to \u201cdefine their objectives.\u201dOne reason for the stuttering start may be the paucity of administration officials. Mr. Trump has said that Wilbur Ross, his nominee for commerce secretary, will lead the renegotiation of Nafta and play a major role on trade policy. But Mr. Ross is awaiting Senate confirmation. A vote is scheduled for Monday.The Senate Finance Committee has yet to schedule a hearing on the nomination of Mr. Lighthizer, a Washington lawyer, as chief trade negotiator.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video Review: The Honda Civic Is Back as a Hatchback", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenYes, there once were two kinds of gasoline. And I grew up with only four television stations. But that\u2019s a different story.The once stubby Civic grew into sleek coupes and sedans. By 2005, automotive trends had changed so much that the very body style that set up Honda for success vanished from its American lineup.But everything old is new again. The Civic hatch is back. With 4.4 inches taken off the rear overhang, the aggressive sheet metal creases don\u2019t play out as smoothly as on the sedans. But even with less length, the hatchback remains more useful than the sedan or coupe because its yawning opening swallows 10-speed bikes whole (another thing popular back in the \u201970s).I drove the Sport model that retails for $22,175, plus those pesky taxes and such. The Sport, most easily spotted by its center-mounted exhaust, is a basic car. The only major option available is an $800 continuously variable automatic transmission. You want a better sound system? That\u2019s what the aftermarket is for.Or, move up to the Sport Touring, which throws in creature comforts plus Honda Sensing, a bundling of safety technology that includes automatic braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Sadly, that means you give up the excellent 6-speed manual gearbox I drove and adds about $7,000 to the price (which would have bought three 1973 Civics).The Sport is not the sportiest Civic \u2014 Si and Type R models are on their way \u2014 but it\u2019s tough to get more fun and practicality for your $22,000. It\u2019s the kind of car that, after a couple of miles, gets under your skin and pushes a smile onto your cheeks. Throw it into a corner and it happily obliges, then suggests you do it again.It is also a refined runner, displaying the kind of polished dynamics found on small luxury offerings a decade ago. There are baby bottoms less smooth than the 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. It puts out 180 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque when fed premium fuel. That\u2019s six more ponies than the standard Civic hatch models (which lack the Sport\u2019s more sophisticated knock sensor). And in another blast from the past, the engine is started with a key. The kind you insert and turn.Fuel economy will not disappoint. Uncle Sam rates the Sport with a manual gearbox at 30 miles per gallon in the city, 39 on the highway. I saw high 20s in mostly urban (and spirited) driving. Going with the automatic drops the highway figure down to 36.You\u2019ll commute comfortably until Sport\u2019s low-profile tires hit a sharp bump. Those go right on through the chassis to your backside with little filtering. Moderately bolstered seats can hold a wide range of drivers in place during spirited maneuvers.Without the Touring\u2019s sunroof, the cabin is dark and monochromatic. At least it\u2019s made with good-quality plastics. The leather-wrapped steering wheel feels as if it was destined for a car a full segment higher.With belts for three, the back seat has generous room for two average adults. And that\u2019s about it. There are no power ports, seat pockets or folding armrest in the back. Putting a cup of hot coffee in the door pocket is awkward and could result in spills or burned fingers. Ask me how I know. Again, it\u2019s a $22,000 car. Remind friends they didn\u2019t pay for an Uber.Unless the dual spoilers and faux front and rear venting are too severe for your retinas, the Civic Hatchback should be on the test drive list. That list includes the Chevy Cruze Hatchback, Ford Focus, Mazda 3, Toyota Corolla iM and Volkswagen Golf. Practical, affordable and offering a decent romp on a curvy road, the Civic has returned to its roots. Now, if only Led Zeppelin could reunite.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars Might Need Standards, but Whose?", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe PC revolution, the internet boom, the smartphone economy \u2014 all were propelled along by a common set of technological standards. So will a standard platform or operating system be necessary to get autonomous cars rolling, too?Car companies have come to realize that existing in-car systems, with their tangled layers of software and morass of hundreds of embedded processors, are slow and overly complex by today\u2019s computing standards. If autonomous cars are ever to become a reality, they will require even more powerful, more fully integrated and upgradable computing platforms, designers say.A more centralized approach could bring huge cost savings by reducing the number of processors used in a car and thus reducing the need for the cabling among those processors. Less wiring would also lower a car\u2019s weight to improve fuel economy, Mr. Shapiro said.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Mr. Montague said the challenge today is that every car has a unique constellation of electronic control units, sensors and microphones. The software must be specially tailored to each model.There is no shortage of companies vying to become the equivalent for self-driving cars of the Windows/Intel standard for PCs. Chip makers like Nvidia \u2014 as well as Intel \u2014 hope to establish their hardware as the new brains behind autonomous vehicles. Delphi, QNX and Waymo (the former Google self-driving project) are looking to put their software front and center as the operating system of choice. Each wants to sell its own car platform to automakers.The traditional automotive culture, however, has emphasized independence. And some industry experts point to economic factors that argue against settling on a standard platform. Being dependent on a single vendor can mean higher prices.\u201cAutomakers don\u2019t want to rely on Apple or Google,\u201d said Glen DeVos, vice president for software and services at Delphi. \u201cBut they also don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel all the time.\u201dEmblematic of that carmaker culture is Hyundai, which is mostly going it alone in working on its self-driving entry. The company recently demonstrated how far it has come, ferrying journalists in Las Vegas around in a self-driving version of its Ioniq electric compact car. Hyundai, which likes to emphasize that it even makes its own steel, has developed its own platform, striving for affordability.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use a common system,\u201d said Cason Grover, senior group manager for vehicle technology planning innovation at Hyundai. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to go down one path that hinders us in the future from introducing new innovations.\u201dBosch, which supplies safety and technology systems to automakers, including its own self-parking technology, acknowledges that a single, one-size-fits-all system would be easier to work with. \u201cBut it would be a killer for innovation,\u201d said Detlef Zerfowski, vice president for automotive system integration at Bosch.Douglas L. Davis of Intel, recently charged with spearheading that company\u2019s new self-driving car platform, Go, said, \u201cGiven the amount of computing power necessary for autonomous driving, we think it can benefit from greater commonality and predictable interfaces.\u201d\u201cMobileye already has the computer vision, for example,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if the technology is good, why re-engineer it and take two to three years to get it into a product?\u201dWhich design philosophy one chooses can have significant repercussions when it comes to the security of robotic cars, evoking visions of hackers causing mayhem by crashing cars and trucks into each other at highway speeds. It\u2019s a problem engineers are keenly aware of.\u201cHaving a common platform could have a downside,\u201d Mr. Wall at QNX acknowledged. \u201cIf there\u2019s a vulnerability in one car, it could mean there\u2019s a vulnerability in every car.\u201dConversely, Mr. Wall pointed out that de facto software standards mean that more programmers are focused on making those systems as secure as possible, versus having only a few coders working on a single, narrowly used program.But by developing as much of the technology as possible themselves, some automakers believe they can solve problems more quickly.\u201cA side benefit of controlling the entire thing,\u201d said Mr. Grover at Hyundai, \u201cis that we know everything that\u2019s going on.\u201dA lack of standards and a diversity of self-driving systems does present one other obvious challenge: Variety is not a virtue when cars must interact predictably with human drivers \u2014 and other robotic vehicles \u2014 to guarantee safety.Riding in Hyundai\u2019s self-driving Ioniq, for example, is like taking a Sunday drive with your grandmother. The car is extremely adept at staying squarely in its lane without ping-ponging back and forth, but it is also cautious in the extreme, stopping nine feet short of crosswalks and stubbornly refusing to go forward if a pedestrian looks poised to step off the sidewalk. It is behavior that can ignite road rage in nearby human drivers.By comparison, Delphi\u2019s test car, which uses an Intel computing platform installed in an Audi Q5, is more aggressive. It can easily merge into highway traffic and negotiate complex intersections. However, it treats pedestrians with less deference, taking right-hand corners more quickly \u2014 even though pedestrians may be contemplating entering the crosswalk.\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference in the algorithms and even sensor choices being used,\u201d Mr. Grover said, which can affect how collision-prevention and lane-keeping systems work. When autonomous cars do hit the road, he said, you could have a fair amount of variation in how they behave.\u201cThere are quite a few different approaches to creating autonomous systems,\u201d said Ralf Herrtwich of Here, which is making high-resolution maps for the next generation of vehicles. Mr. Herrtwich said the necessary standards might come not from the car platform itself, though, but from the communications side.Indeed, there are already cars like the 2017 BMW 5 Series that can broadcast information about road hazards over a cellular connection, but only other BMWs can make use of the warnings.Technology suppliers, platform vendors and automakers acknowledge that self-driving cars are still in their infancy and that as the vehicles mature, standards will be forthcoming.Most car manufacturers are still struggling just to establish standards across their own models and brands, Mr. DeVos of Delphi said.\u201cOnce that happens,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we can talk about how to work across different companies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Death on the Night Shift in Duterte\u2019s Manila", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANILA \u2014 Only five people had turned up dead. It was a slow evening.In the eight months of Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s presidency, reports on the drug war have caused concern around the world and in the Philippines, though the president\u2019s supporters cast the news as biased and the killings as necessary.Alarmed by the daily death tolls and tales of systemic abuse, I spent a weekend on the front lines with some of the journalists who track the mass death.The media can hardly keep up. \u201cThe night shift used to be boring,\u201d one reporter told me outside the press office of a police precinct. \u201cFires and domestic abuse and car accidents,\u201d he said. Now their stories on daily deaths, crooked cops and the exploitations of the powerful no longer shock.A nightly vigil is kept by a group of local and international reporters, documentary filmmakers and photographers. They call themselves \u201cnight crawlers,\u201d and they shadow the police who are armed with lists of alleged users and the mandate of door-to-door visits.These night crawlers wait for word from radio reports, text messages from funeral homes, calls from colleagues and tips from sources within the police force (though tips have become rare since the media brought international attention to the killings). Authorities are now more guarded, and often the only tip-off reporters receive is the departure from the precinct of \u201cscene of crime\u201d officers. As soon as their van leaves, a convoy of journalists gives chase, lights flashing and horns blaring, on a white-knuckle race through the streets of Manila as calls are made to sources in the area in an effort to find the location and beat investigators to it. Crime scenes have reportedly been altered, official statements often contradict witnesses, and the families of victims have accused police of intimidation.Media scrutiny has changed the way both murders and investigations are conducted. In recent months, killings have gone from the streets and into the privacy of homes. Police cordons are now established farther out from the scene, to ensure distance from photojournalists\u2019 cameras. Witnesses fear reprisals from authorities. Police officers hasten bodies to hospitals, which journalists cannot enter, clearing away crime scenes before they can be documented.As I examined the pool of blood that remained after police left, a teenager on a scooter rode up to have a look. I asked if he knew the victim. \u201cHe was my cousin,\u201d he said. I told him I was sorry. He shrugged. \u201cIt was expected.\u201dPolls show that the drug war remains immensely popular, but a similar majority say they are against all the killings. Critics of Mr. Duterte\u2019s methods say this is a war against the poor, because no drug lords, or politicians alleged to be protecting them, have been punished. After months of reports of poor Filipinos being brutalized, the situation changed only recently thanks to a high-profile death.On Jan. 30, authorities announced a temporary suspension of the drug war after a South Korean businessman living here was found to have been kidnapped by antidrug officers, strangled at the national Police Headquarters, cremated at a funeral parlor and flushed down a toilet \u2014 all while his wife was being extorted for a ransom of $100,000. Under pressure from South Korea, Mr. Duterte called the case an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and focused his rhetoric on \u201ccleansing\u201d the national police force, though he vowed to continue his crackdown on drugs until the end of his term.The killings, though, continue. The Duterte administration is accountable for sanctioning, condoning or being unable to prevent them, and for failing to bring the perpetrators to justice. What was once a dispute about facts surrounding such deaths has turned to public acceptance. It is now a moral question \u2014 to which there is no answer, only opinion and conjecture.\u201cIt\u2019s the new normal,\u201d a photojournalist told me. \u201cIt\u2019s easier and cheaper to kill them. We can only document it, for a time when Filipinos have regained their sanity.\u201dMore are now speaking out. A rally on Saturday against the killings, led by the Catholic Church, drew at least 10,000 people, and lawyers have volunteered to file cases for the families of four men allegedly killed by police. This week, a high-level officer linked Mr. Duterte to multiple crimes. These voices of protest echo what journalists have been saying for months.The work is taking a toll on the night crawlers. Some of the journalists suffer health problems or nervous tics from the hours they keep and the things they see. Many cover the beat in their spare time, their publications having moved on from the now-commonplace killings. For their trouble, the media have been called \u201cpresstitutes\u201d by Mr. Duterte\u2019s followers; some receive threats of rape, violence and death. I asked some journalists what keeps them going. \u201cGuilt,\u201d one said. \u201cAnger,\u201d added another. \u201cThe widows, whose pain I know well,\u201d said a third. \u201cThe families of all the victims,\u201d said a fourth.When the dawn broke that Sunday morning, most of us left the press office, with its badminton tournament trophies and pantheon of portraits of long-passed reporters who covered martial law and revolutions and coups d\u2019etats. Tomorrow the night crawlers will return to do what journalists have always done, and what they\u2019ll always do. Long after Mr. Duterte has gone and his most vociferous followers are footnotes in history, we will write about this terrible era of avarice, injustice and death.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Decade After Crisis, No Resolution for Fannie and Freddie", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorFannie Mae, the gigantic government-sponsored mortgage service entity, has guaranteed $1 billion of debt backed by Invitation Homes, the single-family rental business owned by the giant private equity firm Blackstone. In making the guarantee, Fannie is taking a big leap into the growing home rental market, in which Blackstone is the biggest player. But it\u2019s also a sign that the true comeback kids are not the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots but Fannie Mae and its cousin, Freddie Mac, both of which were supposed to be left for dead a decade ago.Fannie and Freddie were, thus, cast into purgatory. They were put under the supervision of the government, but the public still owned 20.1 percent of them.The idea was to gradually run down the entities\u2019 debt and come up with a better idea for developing a healthy and growing mortgage market free of the implicit government backing they long enjoyed. At the time, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said \u201cthere is a consensus today that these enterprises pose a systemic risk and they cannot continue in their current form\u201d and that the government would make a \u201cgrave error\u201d if they did not \u201cpermanently address\u201d issues involving the government-sponsored enterprises, or G.S.E.s.And that brings us back to the Blackstone deal, which illustrates Fannie\u2019s mission creep from helping people buy homes to helping people rent them. The guarantee was disclosed with Blackstone\u2019s sale of 25 percent of Invitation Homes in an initial public offering last week. Fannie is making the guarantee on collateral of about 50,000 rented single-family homes that Blackstone bought in foreclosure in the last few years. Never mind that the deal is a big subsidy for Blackstone and Invitation Homes. The downside \u2014 the government being liable for at least part $1 billion if there is a default \u2014 is real.Fannie\u2019s take: \u201cThis transaction is a great opportunity to continue to serve the growing single-family rental market.\u201d It added that the transaction would provide it with more information on the rental market itself.That\u2019s an expensive price tag just to learn about a market.There is no good solution that can satisfy the politics of a national mortgage market. The government is not willing to fully nationalize Fannie and Freddie because it is unwilling to acknowledge or accept the truth that the current mortgage market depends on government support. Private lenders are often unwilling to extend credit to many borrowers for the 30-year fixed-rate terms that have become the standard of American homeownership. Without support, there would be fewer mortgages made, and they would be shorter term and floating-rate, as they are in other countries.But none of these solutions are easy, and they all require a hard acknowledgment that the government is committed to supporting the mortgage market.With the election of Donald J. Trump there is some sentiment in the markets that the government will do something with the G.S.E.s. Indeed, the share price of Fannie hit a high of $5.50 a share shortly after the November election, up from about 20 cents during the financial crisis. The increase is a bet that the government will privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and allow the public holders to keep their shares. That would benefit fund managers like Bruce R. Berkowitz, a big owner of Fannie Mae preferred stock. Steven T. Mnuchin, the nominee for Treasury secretary, was on the Sears Holdings board with Mr. Berkowitz, and the expectation was that he would favor a spinout and recapitalization.In his Senate confirmation hearings Mr. Mnuchin demurred. Instead, he stated that he never endorsed \u201crecap and release.\u201dBut he added that Fannie and Freddie were among the administration\u2019s top 10 priorities.So that leaves the companies still in limbo.If the government really wants to preserve the 30-year mortgage market, it should simply limit these two entities to that loan product, and only that 30-year loan product. Everything else seems not only to preserve the tenuous position of Fannie and Freddie, but also to risk making them just instruments for unrestrained housing policy with lots of unintended consequences and risks.A simple limitation like this would make sense, but don\u2019t count on it. Given how hard it is for the government to even acknowledge what the problem is, expect the next administration in four to eight years to still be talking about what to do as Fannie and Freddie continue to be the key players in a multitrillion-dollar mortgage market, while still being government-owned. At least until the next crisis or scandal.A Deal Professor column on Wednesday about Fannie Mae\u2019s guaranteeing $1 billion in a home rental loan product misstated the state that the government put Fannie and Freddie Mac into in September 2008. They were put into conservatorship, not receivership.The column also misstated, in some copies, information about a fund run by Bruce R. Berkowitz, a big owner of Fannie Mae preferred stock. His fund, Fairholme, manages mutual funds, not hedge funds. And Steven T. Mnuchin, President Trump\u2019s choice for Treasury secretary, did not serve on its board; he was a member of the board at Sears Holdings, along with Mr. Berkowitz.And a quotation from Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings was rendered incorrectly in some copies. He said, \u201cMy comments were never that there should be recap and release,\u201d not \u201cthere never should be recap and release.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those who wanted to see the document had to go to the office of the Met\u2019s general counsel and read it under observation.After enjoying boom years, one of the most pre-eminent cultural institutions in the world is now struggling with missteps and the perils of overreaching at a time of uncertain resources. While many museums face financial and competitive pressures, the Met\u2019s troubles are magnified, given its stature on the world stage.How can a behemoth like the Met, the thinking goes, possibly stumble? Some curators and trustees have zeroed in on Thomas P. Campbell, the Met\u2019s director and chief executive since 2008, as well as the board that has backed him. The anguish can be intense, given the love that all involved have for the Met.\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy to see a great institution in decline,\u201d said George R. Goldner, who in 2014 retired after 21 years as the chairman of the Met\u2019s drawings and prints department and has since served as a consultant to the museum. \u201cTo have inherited a museum as strong as the Met was 10 years ago \u2014 with a great curatorial staff \u2014 and to have it be what it is today is unimaginable.\u201dDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by over 6,000 years of history at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We\u2019re here to help.Several people inside the museum, most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of losing their positions, said the Met under Mr. Campbell had tried to do too much too fast: overhiring in the digital department; overspending on an additional building, the Met Breuer, and on rebranding; overdrawing from unrestricted endowment funds to cover costs; emphasizing Modern and contemporary art at the expense of core departments; and pursuing the new wing before the financing was in place.Instead, the Met should have been contracting, given falling revenue from its retail stores and admission fees and rising expenses.At the same time, some hope that by reckoning with its troubles, the Met is poised to turn a corner.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the same page,\u201d said Keith Christiansen, the chairman of the Met\u2019s European paintings department. \u201cOne benefit from all this: It\u2019s brought the departments together with the administration to sit down at a common table, and that\u2019s something. Now what do we do to move forward and make sure the mission of the museum is not compromised?\u201dEfforts to right the ship have been difficult and painful. In addition to staff cuts, curators were asked to curtail spending for shows and acquisitions. The Met stages nearly 60 exhibitions a year, far more than most museums, but now expects to reduce its exhibitions to about 40 a year.Instead of moving forward with the architect David Chipperfield on a wing intended to help attract art and money from contemporary collectors, the Met has been forced to prioritize the replacement of its aging skylights and roof above the European paintings galleries.In an interview, Mr. Campbell acknowledged that the museum had \u201cbeen through a trying year.\u201d\u201cMy colleagues have every right to feel upset,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, one has to step back and look at the success of the institution.\u201dIn addition, the museum\u2019s attendance has increased to about seven million visitors a year, including the Cloisters. The Breuer, which opened in March, has drawn 557,000 visitors, exceeding projections.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole Modern art collection in the Breuer we didn\u2019t have before,\u201d said Hamilton E. James, a Met trustee. \u201cAttendance is at all-time records; critical acclaim has never been as good. An awful lot of wonderful things have gone on.\u201dMoreover, Met officials say, many cultural institutions have been grappling with a structural deficit \u2014 when costs exceed revenues, despite a strong economy. The Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum, for example, also recently offered buyouts \u2014 though they did not then move to layoffs. The New York Philharmonic has delayed the tentative date for opening its $600 million rebuilt hall to get a better sense of its cost. And the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is struggling to raise nearly half the $600 million needed for its expansion.While the Met charged Mr. Campbell with strengthening the museum\u2019s Modern and contemporary art activities, his focus on the Met Breuer and new wing has been controversial. Why try to compete with the new Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, some ask, instead of sticking to what the Met already does best?Mr. Campbell said he had aimed \u201cto sustain an environment in which scholarship could flourish and be the engine of our program, as well as to expand our audiences, to digitize the institution and to revisit what it is to be an encyclopedic museum.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve made remarkable progress, but these things are flexible, and they need modulation,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the same period, we have had to balance our expenditures and our income. In light of that, we\u2019re certainly doing some recalibration on the goals we\u2019ve set ourselves.\u201dSome critics say Mr. Campbell has been out of his depth \u2014 a tapestry curator thrust into the large shoes of the legendary Philippe de Montebello, with no experience running a major institution. (Mr. de Montebello did not have chief executive in his title until 22 years into his 31-year tenure as director.)Moreover, Mr. Campbell, by many accounts, has handled the economic crisis by hunkering down in a defensive crouch rather than reaching out to unite the staff \u2014 and the full board \u2014 behind his efforts. Internal critics say he failed to appreciate the upheaval caused by the turnover of three-quarters of the curatorial leadership through departures and retirements. They describe the pervasive sense that institutional memory is going out the door and the fear that the Met\u2019s mission to educate through scholarship has been overshadowed by its desire to attract millennials through social media.Mr. Campbell said internal relations was often a challenge at the Met, with its more than 2,200-member work force, and acknowledged that he could do better. \u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to open up communications \u2014 bringing people into briefings, in town hall meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve got it right yet, but we\u2019re heading in the right direction.\u201d\u201cI myself need to evolve my thinking and my interactions,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified those issues and taken steps to move forward in a very collective manner.\u201dThe Boston Consulting Group, hired a year ago pro bono to help with the Met\u2019s restructuring, was asked this month to interview staff members and trustees about their concerns because the museum recognized \u201cthat morale was challenged,\u201d said Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and chief operating officer. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that people feel empowered to say what they think.\u201dWhen Mr. Weiss, formerly the president of Haverford College, came to the Met last year, he set out to cut $31 million from a $332 million annual budget. He said Mr. Campbell had been open to making the changes required.\u201cWe have gone through a significant and difficult time,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cTom has been very supportive.\u201dDaniel Brodsky, the museum\u2019s chairman, said that Mr. Campbell and Mr. Weiss had taken appropriate steps toward financial stability and that he and his fellow trustees had not lost confidence in Mr. Campbell\u2019s capacity to lead.\u201cTom is a very bright person, and the board supports him,\u201d he said.Mr. James, the trustee, said many of the Met\u2019s struggles \u201cwere beyond the control\u201d of a chief executive. \u201cYou get bumps in the road, and you have to deal with them.\u201cThe leadership team of Tom and Dan \u2014 I view it very much as a partnership,\u201d he added. \u201cDan brings a discipline and a businesslike approach.\u201dStill, the Met\u2019s current retrenchment inevitably looks like a repudiation of much of Mr. Campbell\u2019s original agenda. He has been forced to let go many of his key hires, and his timetable for the new wing has been disrupted.But Mr. Campbell said he had not given up on his main goals to bolster contemporary art at the Met and broaden the audience in a technological age.\u201cI love the Met, I love the work I\u2019m doing here,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd I\u2019m very committed to seeing all of these many projects through.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Talks Tuition, Free for All", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEd TalkOne of President Trump\u2019s few statements about higher education finance reflected his desire to bring tuition prices down by cutting what he called administrative bloat and tapping endowments. Do you agree with that approach?We do have to do our best to make sure that colleges and universities are cost-effective and that endowments are not used to build 50,000- or 100,000-person football stadiums or for spending a fortune on four-star suites. Very often, however, many of the costs associated with colleges don\u2019t have a lot to do with education per se, whether it\u2019s health care for faculty or energy costs. And those are national problems that we have to address.So should they have to spend more of their endowments and should we restrict how they do spend them?I will certainly look at any legislation that comes up, and if it makes sense to me, I\u2019m happy to support it.But my focus right now is to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. I was pleased to see Governor Cuomo carrying the banner. I will be supporting any governor who wants to do this.Right now and for well over 100 years, we\u2019ve talked about public education in America as being K-12. So we have to change the definition of what free public education means in a changing economy. We used to be No. 1 in the world, in terms of the percentage of people who graduated from college and universities. Today, we are No. 11 among people 35 and under.Do you worry that a focus on covering the tuition costs for students at public schools implicitly encourages those universities to keep raising prices, in effect giving them cover to do so?I don\u2019t think so. What you\u2019ve seen in recent years is significant underfunding. But I think it\u2019s incumbent on those state legislatures and governors to make sure they are run cost-effectively and hire people who are capable of doing that.President Trump has suggested federal student loan forgiveness for all borrowers after 15 years of payment, instead of the 20 years that is standard in many instances now. Is that something you can get behind?It\u2019s a start, though I can\u2019t give you a definitive answer. What I proposed during the campaign was to immediately allow all people to refinance loans at the lowest interest rate they can find. That would be an incredible first step.So a family from Burlington, Vt., stops you on the street and asks how to figure out whether private colleges like Middlebury or Champlain are $40,000 a year better than the University of Vermont. What would you have them look at, and should the government demand that schools produce more data on actual value?We need to have as much information as we can about how a school performs, but \u201cvalue\u201d is a hard word to define. They can say, as they do at Champlain, that 88 percent of graduates are employed in jobs related to their goals, and that\u2019s important to know. On the other hand, I have a good friend who teaches poetry at the University of Vermont. There\u2019s probably not a great market for poets. But is that to say it\u2019s not important? You can\u2019t just look at things from a corporate perspective. Teaching poetry is important.This interview has been condensed and lightly edited.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Proposes New Rules to Steady Insurance Markets Under Health Law", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration proposed new rules on Wednesday to stabilize health insurance markets roiled by efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, by big increases in premiums and by the exodus of major insurers.The proposed rules, backed by insurance companies, would tighten certain enrollment procedures and cut the health law\u2019s open enrollment period in half, in hopes that a smaller but healthier consumer base will put the marketplaces on sounder financial footing and attract more insurance companies in states with limited choices.But part of the market\u2019s problem stems from President Trump\u2019s determination to repeal the health law while the White House and Congress struggle to find a politically acceptable replacement. Even as the Department of Health and Human Services worked to answer insurance company concerns, the Internal Revenue Service and Congress were taking steps that could add uncertainty to the jittery insurance economy.On Capitol Hill, conservatives declared that they are not about to accept a health law replacement that remotely resembles the Affordable Care Act. And the I.R.S. adopted a policy for the coming tax season that could weaken the requirement for people to have insurance. The tax agency said it was reversing one aspect of an Obama administration plan after Mr. Trump, on his first day in office, issued an executive order instructing agencies to reduce burdens imposed by compliance with the Affordable Care Act wherever legally possible.The proposed rules signal the Trump administration\u2019s urgency in trying to keep other insurers from fleeing the market after Humana\u2019s departure. The company said on Tuesday that it was losing money by insuring too many sick people without enough healthy ones enrolling. Humana had already scaled back its participation to 11 states this year, from 19 in 2016.Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, said Wednesday that the marketplaces were in \u201ca death spiral,\u201d and at a conference sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, he declined to say if his company would participate next year. And Molina Healthcare, one of the few insurers that seemed to be financially successful under the health law, reported on Wednesday that it was losing money in the marketplaces. It threatened to drop out if its concerns about a risk-sharing program requiring the company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to other insurers were not addressed.Dr. Patrick H. Conway, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the rules proposed on Wednesday \u201cwill help protect Americans enrolled in the individual and small group health insurance markets while future reforms are being debated.\u201dBut Democrats and consumer groups denounced the proposed rules, saying they would make it more difficult for people to enroll and increase costs for some consumers.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the rules sent \u201ca clear message to the American people: Patients are not a priority, and insurance companies are back in charge.\u201dUnder the proposed rules, the annual open enrollment period would be reduced to about six weeks from two months. The shorter time frame would be similar to the open enrollment periods for Medicare and for many employer-sponsored health plans.But the administration acknowledged that the shorter sign-up period \u201ccould lead to a reduction in enrollees, primarily younger and healthier enrollees\u201d who often sign up near the deadline.Other parts of the rules would limit opportunities for people to hold off on buying insurance until they get sick, a phenomenon that has loaded many health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act with more expensive, sick customers than they expected. By manipulating a system that now precludes insurers from rejecting customers with pre-existing medical conditions, consumers are avoiding the purchase of insurance when they are healthy and rushing in when they need it, insurers say.People can sign up after the deadline if they experience certain \u201clife changes\u201d like having a baby, getting married or losing employer-sponsored insurance. Insurers have told the government for several years that people who sign up in a special enrollment period use up to 50 percent more services than those who sign up in the regular enrollment season.Insurers and Republican members of Congress welcomed the proposed changes, which will be published in the Federal Register on Friday, giving the public until March 7 to comment. Final rules are likely to be issued in March or April. Insurers must decide by early May what kinds of health plans they will offer in 2018.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said the proposals were \u201cimportant first steps to rescue a collapsing Obamacare individual market.\u2019\u2019But insurers cautioned that the proposed rules, while helpful, would in no way provide a solution if, in a few weeks, Republicans introduce legislation to repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the requirement for most Americans to have coverage.Christopher W. Hansen, the president of the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society, said the tighter restrictions on special enrollment periods could \u201ccause problems for cancer patients,\u201d delaying treatment and reducing their chances of survival.Changes being made by the I.R.S. could weaken incentives for people to obtain insurance. The tax agency said it would accept and process tax returns even if taxpayers failed to indicate whether they had coverage, qualified for an exemption or were paying the penalty for going without insurance.The individual mandate, requiring most Americans to have insurance, was to be enforced through the tax system. The I.R.S. said the requirement was \u201cstill in force until changed by Congress.\u201d The government can deduct the amount of any penalty from refunds that would otherwise be sent to taxpayers. But it is unclear how it will use this authority.In the rules proposed Wednesday, the Trump administration said that it would generally allow states to determine whether insurance plans had enough doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to serve patients. The hope is that would lure more insurers into the market. Additionally, insurers could refuse to provide new coverage to consumers who failed to pay premiums owed in the previous year. If an insurer terminates coverage for nonpayment of premiums, it could require consumers to pay all past-due premiums owed to that insurer before restarting coverage.And insurers would be allowed to sell health plans covering a smaller share of expected costs. The administration said consumers would have \u201cmore coverage options\u201d as a result, but it acknowledged that some consumers could see increases in their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.Thomas Kaplan and Margot Sanger-Katz contributed reporting from Washington, and Reed Abelson from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wilbur Ross, a Billionaire Investor, Is Confirmed as Commerce Secretary", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate confirmed Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor, as commerce secretary on Monday, installing a key leader for the Trump administration\u2019s plans to overhaul trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.With the confirmation of Mr. Ross, the most important members of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team are in place just in time for looming fights over the budget, health care and tax legislation.Compared with some of Mr. Trump\u2019s other cabinet picks, Mr. Ross had his confirmation process move ahead with relative ease. He faced less resistance from Democrats than Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Andrew F. Puzder, whose nomination to lead the Labor Department was derailed.A former Democrat, Mr. Ross, 79, divested a significant portion of his holdings to avoid conflicts of interest before taking the helm of the Commerce Department. He also tried to temper some of Mr. Trump\u2019s views on trade, attempting to ease concerns that the United States is going to be engaging in trade wars.\u201cI am pro-trade, but I am pro-sensible trade,\u201d Mr. Ross declared at his confirmation hearing.But he takes the job with lingering questions about how his business experience will mesh with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade agenda.Mr. Ross has said that he wants to use his knowledge of the global economy to help improve the fortunes of lower- and middle-class Americans. He said last summer that he was attracted to Mr. Trump as a candidate because he believed that the country needed a \u201cmore radical, new approach to government.\u201dThe appointment of Mr. Ross fulfills Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to stock his cabinet with proven dealmakers. But it also opens the president up to criticism that he has veered away from his vows of populism by surrounding himself with plutocrats.Democrats have assailed Mr. Trump for assembling the wealthiest cabinet in American history, and on Monday they did not let up.On the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, accused Mr. Ross of having questionable business ties to Russia. He said Mr. Ross and the Trump administration had failed to be forthcoming about the matter and described it as a troubling pattern.\u201cThis is just another example of this administration abandoning transparency and trying to jam nominees through,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThis is another black mark on this nation\u2019s administration.\u201dMr. Ross is set to be sworn in on Tuesday at the White House.The Senate was also holding a cloture vote on Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for interior secretary. A full vote is expected for Mr. Zinke later this week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Divisions of Labor", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "The Future of WorkNew kinds of work require new ideas \u2014 and new ways of organizing.Supported byI was born into this elusive class and remain firmly connected to it through friendships and family. In the 1980s, for example, I personally anchored a working-class cultural hub in my own home on Long Island. The attraction was not me but my husband (then) and longtime friend Gary Stevenson, a former warehouse worker who had become an organizer for the Teamsters union. You may think of the Long Island suburbs as a bedroom community for Manhattan commuters or a portal to the Hamptons, but they were then also an industrial center, with more than 20,000 workers employed at Grumman alone. When my sister moved into our basement from Colorado, she quickly found a job in a factory within a mile of our house, as did thousands of other people, some of them bused in from the Bronx. Mostly we hosted local residents who passed through our house for evening meetings or weekend gatherings \u2014 truck drivers, factory workers, janitors and eventually nurses. My job was to make chili and keep room in the fridge for the baked ziti others would invariably bring. I once tried to explain the concept of \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d to some machine-shop workers and went off on a brief peroration against the Soviet Union. They stared at me glumly across the kitchen counter until one growled, \u201cAt least they have health care over there.\u201dBy the time my little crew was gathering in the ranch house, working-class aspirations were everywhere being trampled underfoot. In 1981, President Reagan busted the air traffic controllers\u2019 union by firing more than 11,000 striking workers \u2014 a clear signal of what was to come. A few years later, we hosted a picnic for Jim Guyette, the leader of a militant meatpacking local in Minnesota that had undertaken a wildcat strike against Hormel (and of course no Hormel products were served at our picnic). But labor had entered into an age of givebacks and concessions. Grovel was the message, or go without a job. Even the \u201cmighty mighty\u201d unions of the old labor chant, the ones that our little group had struggled both to build and to democratize, were threatened with extinction. Within a year, the wildcat local was crushed by its own parent union, the United Food and Commercial Workers.Steel mills went quiet, the mines where my father and grandfather had worked shut down, factories fled south of the border. Much more was lost in the process than just the jobs; an entire way of life, central to the American mythos, was coming to an end. The available jobs, in fields like retail sales and health care, were ill paid, making it harder for a man without a college education to support a family on his own. I could see this in my own extended family, where the grandsons of miners and railroad workers were taking jobs as delivery-truck drivers and fast-food restaurant managers or even competing with their wives to become retail workers or practical nurses. As Susan Faludi observed in her 1999 book \u201cStiffed,\u201d the deindustrialization of America led to a profound masculinity crisis: What did it mean to be a man when a man could no longer support a family?It wasn\u2019t just a way of life that was dying but also many of those who had lived it. Research in 2015 by Angus Deaton, a Nobel laureate in economics, with his wife, Anne Case, showed that the mortality gap between college-educated whites and non-college-educated whites had been widening rapidly since 1999. A couple of months later, economists at the Brookings Institution found that for men born in 1920, there was a six-year difference in life expectancy between the top 10 percent of earners and the bottom 10 percent. For men born in 1950, that difference more than doubled, to 14 years. Smoking, which is now mostly a working-class habit, could account for only a third of the excess deaths. The rest were apparently attributable to alcoholism, drug overdoses and suicide, usually by gunshot \u2014 what are often called \u201cdiseases of despair.\u201dThe other popular solution to the crisis of the working class was job retraining. If ours is a \u201cknowledge economy\u201d \u2014 which sounds so much better than a \u201clow-wage economy\u201d \u2014 unemployed workers would just have to get their game on and upgrade to more useful skills. President Obama promoted job retraining, as did Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate, along with many Republicans. The problem was that no one was sure what to train people in; computer skills were in vogue in the \u201990s, welding has gone in and out of style and careers in the still-growing health sector are supposed to be the best bets now. Nor is there any clear measure of the effectiveness of existing retraining programs. In 2011, the Government Accountability Office found the federal government supporting 47 job-training projects as of 2009, of which only five had been evaluated in the previous five years. Paul Ryan has repeatedly praised a program in his hometown, Janesville, Wis., but a 2012 ProPublica study found that laid-off people who went through it were less likely to find jobs than those who did not.No matter how good the retraining program, the idea that people should be endlessly malleable and ready to recreate themselves to accommodate every change in the job market is probably not realistic and certainly not respectful of existing skills. In the early \u201990s, I had dinner at a Pizza Hut with a laid-off miner in Butte, Mont. (actually, there are no other kinds of miners in Butte). He was in his 50s, and he chuckled when he told me that he was being advised to get a degree in nursing. I couldn\u2019t help laughing too \u2014 not at the gender incongruity but at the notion that a man whose tools had been a pickax and dynamite should now so radically change his relation to the world. No wonder that when blue-collar workers were given the choice between job retraining, as proffered by Clinton, and somehow, miraculously, bringing their old jobs back, as proposed by Trump, they went for the latter.Now when politicians invoke \u201cthe working class,\u201d they are likely to gesture, anachronistically, to an abandoned factory. They might more accurately use a hospital or a fast-food restaurant as a prop. The new working class contains many of the traditional blue-collar occupations \u2014 truck driver, electrician, plumber \u2014 but by and large its members are more likely to wield mops than hammers, and bedpans rather than trowels. Demographically, too, the working class has evolved from the heavily white male grouping that used to assemble at my house in the 1980s; black and Hispanic people have long been a big, if unacknowledged, part of the working class, and now it\u2019s more female and contains many more immigrants as well. If the stereotype of the old working class was a man in a hard hat, the new one is better represented as a woman chanting, \u201cEl pueblo unido jam\u00e1s ser\u00e1 vencido!\u201d (The people united will never be defeated!)The old jobs aren\u2019t coming back, but there is another way to address the crisis brought about by deindustrialization: Pay all workers better. The big labor innovation of the 21st century has been campaigns seeking to raise local or state minimum wages. Activists have succeeded in passing living-wage laws in more than a hundred counties and municipalities since 1994 by appealing to a simple sense of justice: Why should someone work full time, year-round, and not make enough to pay for rent and other basics? Surveys found large majorities favoring an increase in the minimum wage; college students, church members and unions rallied to local campaigns. Unions started taking on formerly neglected constituencies like janitors, home health aides and day laborers. And where the unions have faltered, entirely new kinds of organizations sprang up: associations sometimes backed by unions and sometimes by philanthropic foundations \u2014 Our Walmart, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United.I never expected to be part of anything like that again until, in 2004, I discovered a similar, far-better-organized group in Fort Wayne, Ind. The Northeast Indiana Central Labor Council, as it was then called, brought together Mexican immigrant construction workers and the native-born building-trade union members they had been brought in to replace, laid-off foundry workers and Burmese factory workers, adjunct professors and janitors. Their goal, according to the president at the time, Tom Lewandowski, a former General Electric factory worker who served in the 1990s as the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s liaison to the Polish insurgent movement Solidarnosc, was to create a \u201cculture of solidarity.\u201d They were inspired by the realization that it\u2019s not enough to organize people with jobs; you have to organize the unemployed as well as the \u201canxiously employed\u201d \u2014 meaning potentially the entire community. Their not-so-secret tactic was parties and picnics, some of which I was lucky enough to attend.The scene in Fort Wayne featured people of all colors and collar colors, legal and undocumented workers, liberals and political conservatives, some of whom supported Trump in the last election. It showed that a new kind of solidarity was in reach, even if the old unions may not be ready. In 2016, the ailing A.F.L.-C.I.O., which for more than six decades has struggled to hold the labor movement together, suddenly dissolved the Northeast Indiana Central Labor Council, citing obscure bureaucratic imperatives. But the labor council was undaunted. It promptly reinvented itself as the Workers\u2019 Project and drew more than 6,000 people to the local Labor Day picnic, despite having lost its internet access and office equipment to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.When I last talked to Tom Lewandowski, in early February, the Workers\u2019 Project had just succeeded in organizing 20 Costco contract workers into a collective unit of their own and were planning to celebrate with, of course, a party. The human urge to make common cause \u2014 and have a good time doing it \u2014 is hard to suppress.Barbara Ehrenreich is the founding editor of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project and the author of numerous books, including \u201cNickel and Dimed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angling for a Comeback, Democratic Governors Sharpen Focus on Jobs", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Democrats battle President Trump on a multiplying array of issues, from immigration and climate change to health care and transgender rights, a group of Democratic governors is pressing the party to set one concern above all the rest: jobs.Gathered in Washington for a conference of the National Governors Association, Democratic leaders from the states expressed optimism that Mr. Trump had opened the way for a Democratic comeback by governing from the hard right and in a haphazard manner.But they also warned that voters might not embrace Democrats as an alternative to Mr. Trump unless they presented themselves convincingly as champions of job creation, which they struggled to do in last year\u2019s presidential election. Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity, several governors said, will not necessarily usher Democrats back to power on its own \u2014 they must frame all their priorities in economic terms.Gov. Gina M. Raimondo of Rhode Island, a Democrat who is in her first term, said her party had too often failed to put jobs and economic opportunity at the forefront of its agenda. Democrats had erred, she said, by treating jobs merely as one issue in a \u201ccheck list\u201d of positions.In an interview, Ms. Raimondo mimicked the rote approach: \u201cAre you pro-choice? Check. Are you pro-transgender rights? Check. Are you pro-gay rights? Check. Are you pro-renewable energy? Check. Are you pro-good jobs? Check.\u201d\u201cMy own view is, we have to say: The whole game is job growth,\u201d Ms. Raimondo said. \u201cPeople feel left behind because they are left behind. People feel the playing field isn\u2019t level because it\u2019s not level. So let\u2019s level it.\u201dMs. Raimondo, 45, a former venture capitalist, stressed that she did not believe the party should change its liberal platform on social issues and called for fierce resistance to Mr. Trump.But she urged Democrats to define their agenda broadly as a matter of pursuing economic growth, \u201cequally distributed for people of color, women, immigrants, regardless of sexual orientation, who you love.\u201dGov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, the vice chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said Democrats had to make job growth their organizing theme on all subjects, including immigration and the Affordable Care Act. The most effective attacks on Mr. Trump, he said, would cast the president\u2019s policies as harmful to the economy.Behind closed doors, too, Democratic governors prodded the party to compete harder with Mr. Trump on kitchen-table issues. The president won a slim victory last fall in large part because his platform of trade protectionism and immigration restriction appealed to blue-collar whites in the Midwest, some of whom had voted for Democrats in the past.Mr. Inslee, who won a second term in November, said there was \u201cbroad-scale agreement that our economic message was not successful in the presidential race,\u201d and that the party needed a far more pointed appeal on economic matters.During a private meeting of Democratic governors on Saturday morning that included the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado argued that Democrats needed a clear positive appeal about job growth. In the debate over the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Hickenlooper, 65, said Democrats should highlight the health care-related jobs at stake, according to people who attended the meeting.Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Mr. Hickenlooper, confirmed his remarks.A number of the Democratic governors pressing for a stronger sales pitch on jobs are seen as potential presidential candidates, among them Mr. Inslee, Ms. Raimondo and Mr. Hickenlooper.And mirroring the role Republican governors played during President Barack Obama\u2019s time in office, Democrats in the states have vowed to rally opposition to Mr. Trump and battle his initiatives through legislation and lawsuits challenging his administration.In some respects, the opposition to Mr. Trump from blue-state leaders may be even more strenuous than what Mr. Obama faced from Republican governors. Unlike at the outset of Mr. Obama\u2019s term, when some Republican governors flirted with accommodating a popular new president, there is little apparent appetite among Democrats for conciliating Mr. Trump.But Democrats have suffered dire losses on the state level and now hold 16 governorships, most of them in solidly blue states like New York, California and Oregon. The party\u2019s governors are looking to the 2018 elections as a crucial opportunity to recover their standing in state capitals.Party leaders in Washington, like Ms. Pelosi, have also come to see winning governorships as a priority because of the power many state executives have in drawing congressional district lines. After the 2010 elections, Republicans had extensive control over the process of mapping congressional districts, helping them achieve a viselike grip on the House.While Democrats are hopeful that they can exploit the political backlash against Mr. Trump and his policies, there is considerable disagreement within the party about how best to deliver a message of contrast with the president.Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who won re-election last year in a state that Mr. Trump carried easily, said he believed Democrats would have to do more than oppose the president to return to power.\u201cI think we as Democrats have to have a narrative of what we\u2019re for, not just also what we\u2019re against,\u201d Mr. Bullock said.The jobs-first approach that many Democratic governors favor was on prominent display during a news conference on Saturday morning at a hotel in downtown Washington. A lineup of Democratic state executives took aim at the Trump administration, denouncing Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies.Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, who is the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, accused Mr. Trump of ignoring his campaign pledge to move quickly on a huge infrastructure program. And he branded Republican health care policies as job killers.\u201cWhat have they passed?\u201d Mr. Malloy asked about the Republicans. \u201cWhere is the jobs bill? Where is a better health care plan?\u201dSpeaking alongside Mr. Malloy, Mr. McAuliffe said Mr. Trump had caused \u201ctremendous damage\u201d with his approach to immigration, including the travel ban. Addressing himself to Mr. Trump, Mr. McAuliffe said, \u201cMr. President, spend your time on doing what you said you would do, and grow this economy.\u201d\u201cYou are hurting our ability to create jobs in our states,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to stop. Discrimination breeds hatred, and hatred is bad for the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In November, a record of almost 63,000 men, women and children slept in shelters on average every night.Your editorial sensibly shows how a proposed statewide rental supplement is the right program for this urgent moment. The Home Stability Support program addresses the most serious drivers of homelessness: the divide between shelter allowances and staggering housing costs, as well as the lack of financial support for families fleeing domestic violence.In the city, a three-person household with children can receive a $400 allowance. Yet by federal calculations, the fair-market rent of a two-bedroom unit in the city is $1,637. This gap puts too many New Yorkers on razor-thin budgets, so that any contingency, like a sickness or a lost job, can lead to evictions, homelessness and immeasurable distress from a disrupted life.By covering the subsidy gap, the program will keep families in their homes and neighborhoods intact.The program is already supported by a wide range of city and state officials. Legislators must pass the Home Stability Support program, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo should sign it into law.SEYMOUR W. JAMES Jr.Attorney in Chief, Legal Aid SocietyNew YorkAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Motors, Considering Exiting Europe, Talks About Selling Opel", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 General Motors floated the possibility on Tuesday that it could exit the large but troubled European market by selling its chronically unprofitable Opel unit to the French maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars.The potential deal would create Europe\u2019s second-largest carmaker, challenging the market leader Volkswagen, which is vulnerable because of an emissions scandal.For General Motors, a sale would free it from persistent losses in Europe and help fulfill pledges by its chief executive to improve overall profit margins and increase returns to shareholders.At the same time that the company has been struggling in the European market, it has been become increasingly reliant on China and its core North American market. More losses in Europe could undercut its ability to invest in those more lucrative regions, as well as fund new ventures into autonomous vehicles and mobility services.\u201cWhile G.M. has ambitious long-term plans for Europe, we currently see the business as mediocre at best,\u201d Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays, wrote on Tuesday. \u201cWhy not sell now, when Europe is steadier, versus trying to sell at a time when the market is in a downturn.\u201dStill, an agreement, between G.M. and PSA Group in France, would also link two of Europe\u2019s weakest carmakers, which have more production capacity than they need and few products able to compete in the lucrative luxury market.PSA is the European Union\u2019s third-biggest automaker, with 9.9 percent of the market in 2016, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The purchase of Opel, which holds 6.7 percent of the market, would help the company vault past Renault into second place.The latest potential deal will most likely face its own challenges. Opel\u2019s powerful labor representatives signaled that they would oppose a merger of the carmakers, which have little prospect of being competitive in the crowded European market unless they cut their work forces.Opel has been a problem for G.M. for decades. Once a serious rival to Volkswagen, it began losing market share in the 1990s, which was also the last time it made a profit. While the Volkswagen Group has become the world\u2019s biggest carmaker, Opel slipped to Europe\u2019s margins.\u201cOpel has been hemorrhaging money for the last 16 years, so hard decisions are on the table in Mary Barra\u2019s version of a profitable G.M.,\u201d said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book.The G.M. unit suffered from frequent turnover in top management, friction with labor representatives and products that buyers perceived as dull or inferior. Among other things, Volkswagen was faster to offer cars with diesel motors, which are popular in Europe because of their superior fuel economy compared with gasoline vehicles.Shares of G.M. closed up 4.8. percent on Tuesday.In 2009, the company was on the verge of selling Opel to a consortium made of Magna, an auto parts supplier based in Canada, and the Russian lender Sberbank. But the American carmaker pulled out of the deal at the last minute, reportedly because of fear that the takeover would give the Russians access to its patents and technology.Since then, Opel\u2019s financial situation has improved under the leadership of Karl-Thomas Neumann, a former Volkswagen executive. News of the merger talks came as G.M. reported that its European division had posted a loss of $257 million in 2016, an improvement from a loss of $813 million the year before.Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal also presents a chance for competitors to challenge the German carmaker\u2019s dominance. Volkswagen\u2019s market share, including other company brands like Audi and Porsche, slipped in 2016 to 23.9 percent from 24.6 percent the year before.But even combined, PSA and Opel would have a lot of catching up to do. Both lost market share in Europe last year to Renault and Fiat Chrysler. And all of the mid-price brands have lost buyers to BMW and Daimler, which makes Mercedes vehicles. Those two companies have increasingly offered products priced within reach of middle-class customers.For PSA, one advantage of a deal with Opel would be the potential to draw on German engineering expertise coveted by many buyers. A design center at Opel headquarters in R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany, provides G.M. with expertise in smaller cars.But Opel and PSA, based in Paris, suffer from a surplus of production capacity and are in countries where it is extremely difficult to close factories or lay off workers.Opel\u2019s future is further clouded by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. The country, where Opel vehicles are sold under the Vauxhall brand, is the unit\u2019s strongest market, accounting for almost a third of sales.The company also has factories in the British cities of Ellesmere Port and Luton, and its ability to move vehicles, components and people in and out of Britain will become more complicated after the country exits the European Union.Opel\u2019s labor representatives signaled skepticism about the deal. In a statement on Tuesday, the IG Metall union and the Opel workers council said they were surprised to learn of the talks. They said the talks represented an \u201cunprecedented violation\u201d of workers\u2019 legal rights in Europe to be consulted about major decisions.The labor representatives also said the deal bore scrutiny because of the past record of cooperation between PSA and G.M.PSA and G.M. announced an alliance in 2012 to save costs by buying components jointly and building some vehicles together. G.M. took a 7 percent stake in PSA at the time, but sold it the next year as PSA\u2019s finances worsened. The French government owns about 14 percent of PSA after providing the automaker with badly needed cash in 2014.The French company and G.M. continue to jointly produce some vehicles.Opel, which employs about 35,000 worldwide, sold 1.2 million vehicles last year. PSA, with about 180,000 workers, sold 3.1 million vehicles last year. Both companies depend heavily on sales in Europe, which has been suffering from slow economic growth for a decade.If the deal goes through, G.M. would be without a major presence in Europe for the first time in nearly 90 years.Adam Opel founded Opel in R\u00fcsselsheim in 1862. It originally produced sewing machines, later switching to bicycles and then automobiles. General Motors acquired an 80 percent stake in the company in 1929.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, Chad Bray from London, and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.Advertisement"}

But in Denmark\u2019s fast-recovering economy, they were hard to come by.More than a third of companies in this industrial and technically advanced nation can no longer recruit enough skilled workers to fill posts. Vacancies abound for I.T. specialists, computer scientists, engineers and mechanics, as well as for electricians and carpenters. The wages needed to lure them are creeping up. Affected firms are scaling back production, turning down contracts and postponing expansion plans.\u201cWe need more skilled workers, but we can\u2019t get them,\u201d said Mr. Enevoldsen, who recently joined other companies in a nationwide advertising campaign to lure talent. \u201cIf the labor shortage continues, it could sharply impact our growth, and growth in general.\u201dEurope\u2019s recovery is gaining traction fastest in the north, where Britain, Germany and Denmark\u2019s Nordic neighbors also pushing toward full employment. The unemployment rate has fallen in the United States as well, and some economists have expressed optimism the country may be headed in that direction.But the experience in Denmark shows what can happen with too much of a good thing.After a painful recession, unemployment is now at 4.3 percent, which is about as low as it can go without provoking inflation. During an economic boom a decade ago, joblessness fell as low as 2.4 percent, igniting an unsustainable spiral of higher wages and prices that the government desperately wants to avoid today.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see higher growth because we don\u2019t have the labor needed for that,\u201d said Steen Nielsen, the director of labor market policy at the Confederation of Danish Industry, the country\u2019s main business lobby group. \u201cWe may have to be happy with low growth rates in the future unless we can stimulate labor supply.\u201dSome employers have also looked to refugees to fill jobs, but few of the newcomers are readily employable in high-skilled work, and the government tightened policies recently to discourage more asylum seekers from coming in.Germany, which faces a shortage of engineers, nurses and other skilled workers, has taken the opposite tack, setting up training programs for refugees in an attempt to bridge the gap.In Denmark, some companies have resorted to creating jobs abroad.\u201cWe wanted to hire in our own country but it was impossible,\u201d said Janus Benn Sorensen, one of the company\u2019s three founders. \u201cWe still have vacant positions here, and we can\u2019t find anyone to take them.\u201dAt Sjorring, Mr. Enevoldsen tried for more than a year to add skilled welders and industrial designers to the 275-person work force. The company, which has won business from Volvo and Caterpillar, has a 20-acre factory in Denmark\u2019s forested north that runs a partly automated assembly line.He offered a salary bump of more than 2 percent, but raising wages further would crimp his margins. Though he managed to recruit some Eastern European workers, he still lacks manpower.Last year\u2019s delayed order for the European client, worth 600,000 euros, or $637,000, was eventually completed. But he worried that the labor shortage could keep Sjorring from reaching the next level.\u201cWe could have grown even more if we had the right people, that\u2019s indisputable,\u201d said Mr. Enevoldsen, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, who has turned to a headhunter to find eight welders and machine programmers.Others are having similar problems. Teccon Form, which makes tools for injection molding and employs around 20 designers and mechanical engineers, had to turn away potential customers last year because it couldn\u2019t expand staffing.\u201cThere\u2019s just not that many people out there who aren\u2019t in a job,\u201d said Michael Nederby, the company\u2019s managing director. He is now searching in Germany, Poland and Portugal for workers. \u201cThe problem will get worse in coming years.\u201dAnd not everyone who could be working is doing so: Around 92,000 Danes are collecting jobless benefits, and companies say many of them could be employed.The government is testing measures to encourage early retirees, students and recipients of disability pensions to work. Businesses are also lobbying lawmakers to intensify the teaching of technology and vocational skills in schools to churn out more young Danes prepared for a high-tech world.Even big companies feel the pinch. Microsoft\u2019s Denmark operation had trouble recruiting I.T. workers, then struggled to get marketing and sales representatives, said Marianne Dahl Steensen, the company\u2019s general manager in the country. Because of its scale, Microsoft is able to lure skilled foreign workers to Copenhagen, but keeping them is a top priority.\u201cWe make sure to have a very modern, flexible workplace,\u201d Ms. Steensen said. The company emphasizes gender and ethnic diversity, and works with refugees and the long-term unemployed to cultivate talent.For smaller Danish companies, solutions cannot come fast enough.Clio Online started with three employees and now has 90 in its crowded Copenhagen office, creating content for teachers and students, including real-time course materials about President Trump or the Women\u2019s March on Washington.The company quickly became Denmark\u2019s market leader. But ambitions to expand, thanks to orders from nearby Sweden or further afield in Saudi Arabia, whose government is digitizing libraries and educational texts, hit a ceiling.It opened its Ukraine office three years ago, but cultural differences slowed efficiency. For instance, employees would not proceed with a work request from the Danish team until they vetted it with higher-ups in Ukraine.The company\u2019s chief marketing officer, Thomas Overholt Hansen, estimates it lost up to \u20ac1.5 million in potential revenue last year as the labor shortage limited its ability to serve new clients.\u201cWe\u2019re losing money every day,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make America Greater: More Immigration", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ScenePresident Trump will make America smaller.For his plan, at the scale he promises, would shrink the American economy and impoverish the world. If greatness is what he pursues, a straightforward way to bulk up the economy \u2014 not to say bolster global growth \u2014 would be to allow many more immigrants in.The number does not consider many likely benefits from immigration. For instance, immigrants are younger. They are slowing the aging of the work force. Low-skilled immigrants may increase the labor supply of high-skilled natives, say, by providing cheap child care and releasing mothers to work. High-skilled immigrants contribute disproportionately to innovation, seeking patents at a higher rate than natives.Notably, the number does not include the economic rewards that accrue to the immigrants themselves: 26 million foreigners in the American labor market added some $2 trillion to the American economy last year, according to the National Academies report.Mr. Trump has not shown much interest in the well-being of people born outside the nation\u2019s borders. But even in the narrowest, most parochial sense, their income contributes to the nation\u2019s greatness. As Mr. Trump maneuvers to face off with China, he might stop to consider what the rivalry would look like if the United States were $2 trillion smaller.This is a challenge for not only Mr. Trump but also the entire crop of xenophobic, nativist leaders emerging all over the industrialized world: Few things would make the economic pie bigger than free flows of people from poor countries to rich ones. Immigration \u2014 not trade liberalization or the elimination of barriers to capital flows \u2014 offers the best shot at raising the incomes of the poor and increasing economic output around the world.A typical Pakistani worker who moved from Karachi to Los Angeles would at a stroke make more than six times as much. A Yemeni would raise his earnings 14.5 times. And this would not even require retraining. Someone flipping murtabak on the streets of Sana\u2019a would earn 15.5 times as much simply by coming to New York to flip burgers at McDonald\u2019s.These vast wage gaps underscore the critical value of place: The physical and social infrastructure of the United States automatically lifts the productivity of workers from the most backward countries. But the income differential also highlights how tough barriers against immigration truly are.If workers could move seamlessly across borders, wages of similar workers would tend to converge. The wage gap is a measure of the barriers that remain: An hour of work by a Pakistani in New York costs 6.5 times what an hour of the same Pakistani\u2019s time costs in Karachi. By contrast, the product of that Pakistani\u2019s work back home could enter the United States paying a tariff, on average, of only 3.5 percent.If barriers to immigration are orders of magnitude steeper than barriers to trade, removing such obstacles \u2014 allowing workers to flock to where they are most productive \u2014 would provide a much bigger impetus to the economy than any effort at trade liberalization.Immigration carries costs, of course. It weighs on the wages of the workers who directly compete with the newcomers. And yet they are small compared with the vast potential for gains.Even some of the most pessimistic analysts find relatively modest effects on domestic workers. George Borjas of Harvard, by no means a supporter of liberal immigration, has estimated that the newcomers who arrived in the United States from 1990 to 2010 reduced the wages of American-born high school dropouts over the long term by 3.1 percent \u2014 or some $900 a year.But that still leaves space for moderate liberalization. As Mr. Clemens argues, if only 5 percent of the population of poor countries were allowed to migrate to richer ones, the global gains would exceed those made from removing all policy barriers to merchandise trade and capital flows.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Moves to Roll Back Obama-Era Financial Regulations", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump on Friday moved to chisel away at the Obama administration\u2019s legacy on financial regulation, announcing steps to revisit the rules enacted after the 2008 financial crisis and to back away from a measure intended to protect consumers from bad investment advice.The executive order affecting Dodd-Frank is vague in its wording and expansive in its reach. It never mentions the law by name, instead laying out \u201ccore principles\u201d for regulations that include empowering American investors and enhancing the competitiveness of American companies. Even so, it gives the Treasury the authority to restructure major provisions of Dodd-Frank, and it directs the Treasury secretary to make sure existing laws align with administration goals.Mr. Trump\u2019s action on the fiduciary rule, which Democrats and consumer groups immediately denounced as a gift to Wall Street, could have a more concrete impact. His memorandum directs the Labor Department to review whether the rule may \u201cadversely affect\u201d investors\u2019 ability to access financial advice \u2014 and if it does, it authorizes the agency to rescind and revise the rule.Supporters of the rule describe it as a basic consumer protection to prevent brokers from taking advantage of vulnerable clients. The industry argues that the rule will expose it to a torrent of lawsuits and will increase costs that firms will pass on to consumers.Taken together, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions on Friday constitute an extensive effort to loosen regulations on banks and other major financial companies, even though the president campaigned as a champion of working Americans and as a critic of Wall Street elites. Mr. Trump said on Friday that his actions were intended to help both Wall Street and workers as his administration eases constraints on banks and allows them to lend more to companies, which could then hire more workers.\u201cWe expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can\u2019t borrow money,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the State Dining Room during his meeting with business leaders. \u201cThey just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.\u201dAs he announced his goals on financial deregulation, Mr. Trump sat beside Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant the Blackstone Group and the chairman of his business council, who said the panel would \u201cadvise the government on the areas where we could do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans.\u201dThe president had praise for Jamie Dimon, whose bank, JPMorgan Chase, was often a target of regulatory actions by the Obama administration.\u201cThere\u2019s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you\u2019re going to tell me about it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The meeting underscored the degree to which the architects of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic strategy are now some of the people he denounced in his campaign, which ended with a commercial that described \u201ca global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations.\u201d\u201cThe administration apparently plans to turn over financial regulation to Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs, and make it easier for them and other big banks like Wells Fargo to steal from their customers and destabilize the economy,\u201d said Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group that supports Dodd-Frank. \u201cThat betrays the promises Trump made to stand up to Wall Street.\u201dThe president\u2019s actions came just hours after congressional Republicans voted to repeal an unrelated Dodd-Frank rule, a sign that Mr. Trump will have some support on Capitol Hill to challenge a law he has called \u201ca disaster,\u201d and promised to do \u201ca big number\u201d to reshape.Now emboldened, House Republicans are also moving legislation to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Dodd-Frank, though they would need 60 votes to accomplish that, which seems unlikely. And they are considering potential ways to use the budget process to defund some aspects of the law, all of which comes on top of the president\u2019s executive actions.While the president cannot unwind Dodd-Frank with the stroke of a pen, his orders set the tone for the regulatory agencies enforcing the rules, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. And the orders could portend even more executive actions that direct the regulators to halt financial regulation.The president\u2019s approach to regulation sharply contrasts with his predecessor. President Barack Obama once remarked, \u201cI did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street.\u201dWall Street is expected to lobby Mr. Trump\u2019s financial regulators, at the S.E.C. and elsewhere, to modify rules and enforce them lightly.But there is a limit to what the regulators can do. Dodd-Frank is still the law, and it requires the regulators to enforce hundreds of Dodd-Frank rules. Under administrative law, the regulators must also formally propose any new rules and seek public comment.The Trump administration may have an easier time voiding the Obama-era Labor Department rule requiring brokers to act in a client\u2019s best interest when providing retirement advice. That rule is not explicitly part of Dodd-Frank.White House officials had considered a far more aggressive assault on the fiduciary rule, which would have immediately halted it for six months or more while the Labor Department reviewed its effects. The final memorandum appears to leave the regulation in place, but it also goes a step further, instructing the department to undertake what could be a lengthy new process for rewriting the rule if it is found to harm investors or financial companies.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s action will make it harder for American savers to keep more of what they earn,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.But Representative Ann Wagner, Republican of Missouri, called the effort to stop the fiduciary rule \u201ca labor of love for me.\u201dEven before the president acted, congressional Republicans on Friday started to chip away at Dodd-Frank. The Republicans used an unusual parliamentary procedure to repeal a rule that stems from the law with only a majority of votes, rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.The Senate voted 52 to 47 to void the rule, which requires oil companies to publicly disclose payments made to governments when developing resources around the world. The rule, which Dodd-Frank assigned to the S.E.C. to enforce, was tangential to the law\u2019s mission of reforming Wall Street, but lawmakers included it anyway with the hope of exposing bribes and corruption.Republicans are not done. Under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, Congress has at least 60 days to introduce legislation repealing major new regulations.Already this week, Republicans introduced legislation under the act to repeal a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule for prepaid debit cards.The Congressional Research Service has determined that rules sent to Congress on or after June 13 last year are vulnerable to repeal. The S.E.C. rule just missed that cutoff; it became final on June 27, making it fair game for Republicans to repeal, over the objections of antipoverty groups like Oxfam and the One Campaign.\u201cIf President Trump is serious about his promise to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 and protect American security, he will veto this dangerous bill immediately,\u201d Isabel Munilla, an Oxfam official, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Heir\u2019s Arrest in South Korea Intensifies Calls for Cleanup", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat situation is now unfolding in South Korea \u2014 but the prospects for a major housecleaning look uncertain.The unprecedented arrest on Friday of the de facto leader of Samsung, the largest company in the country, highlighted once again the outsize political influence of the largest family-run companies there. Critics of their power cheered the arrest of Lee Jae-yong, Samsung\u2019s vice chairman, as a major step toward curbing that authority.Still, others warned that the arrest would not necessarily lead to the sweeping changes they say South Korea needs to fight corruption and overhaul its economy.The arrest was \u201cjust the beginning,\u201d said Sim Sang-jeung, an opposition lawmaker who has campaigned for transparency at the largest companies. She warned against a tendency among the law enforcement agencies to treat major corporate chiefs with kid gloves.\u201cWe needed to see whether prosecutors ask for a sentence befitting his crimes and whether he is convicted with such a penalty,\u201d Ms. Sim said. \u201cOnly when he finishes serving such a lengthy sentence will people believe that the law is alive in their country.\u201dIt also raises questions about the fate of Samsung, a huge company whose electronics arm alone accounts for one-fifth of South Korea\u2019s exports.Wearing a well-tailored suit, Mr. Lee emerged through the metal detectors of a court in Seoul, the capital, on Thursday and past a news media gantlet to his car, which drove him to a detention center to await a decision. Early Friday morning, he learned that he would be staying at the detention center through his trial.\u201cWe are shocked and deeply worried,\u201d the Korea Employers Federation, a pro-business lobby, said in a statement about the arrest.\u201cSamsung is the global company that represents South Korea, and we fear that the vacuum in its management will weigh heavily on the economy by increasing uncertainty and hurt international credibility.\u201dReflecting the public mood, the governing \u2014 and usually pro-business \u2014 Liberty Korea Party said it respected the court\u2019s decision to arrest Mr. Lee and expressed \u201cregrets that the people have been again disappointed by the deep-rooted collusion between politics and business.\u201dThe police arrested Mr. Lee and took him into custody, an unprecedented move for a major Samsung official. But in terms of accusations of wrongdoing against a top executive, Samsung has been there before. Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, Samsung\u2019s chairman, has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion.Still, the elder Mr. Lee never spent time in prison. The fate of the young Mr. Lee, critics of the chaebol say, will be a test of the country\u2019s young democracy and judicial system.It will also be a test for Samsung. For the first time in its 79-year history, the company has been left leaderless. With Mr. Lee gone, there is no top executive to make long-term plans and strategic decisions.Samsung has an army of professional executives that manage day-to-day operations of its 58 subsidiaries. But analysts say that without a family-appointed leader, decision making will slow.Choi Gee-sung, the No. 2 lieutenant in the Samsung hierarchy and longtime right-hand man for Mr. Lee, will be the closest substitute to a top manager at the company while Mr. Lee is gone. But Mr. Choi is not a member of the Lee family and is expected to serve largely as a \u201cvassal\u201d caretaker who lacks the kind of sweeping authority and responsibility that Mr. Lee and his father have wielded in placing multibillion-dollar bets on investments or new technology.In one sign of disruption, Samsung delayed its annual reshuffle of senior managers, which it usually announces in December. Compounding concerns, Mr. Choi and his deputies are also being investigated by prosecutors in connection with the bribery scandal.Still, few believe Mr. Lee\u2019s arrest will challenge the family\u2019s ultimate control of the company. In 2008, facing corruption charges, Mr. Lee\u2019s father resigned from management, leaving the company to be run by loyal deputies, who served the family for decades and whose responsibilities were to ensure the father-to-son transfer of power.On Friday, Moon Jae-in, the opposition leader who tops surveys of potential candidates to replace Ms. Park, called the arrest \u201cproof that justice is still alive in South Korea.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Syrian Refugees, There Is No Going Home", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOUAIRI, Lebanon \u2014 In the makeshift tent settlements that dot fields and villages in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon, Syrian refugees are digging in, pouring concrete floors, installing underground sewerage and electric wires, and starting businesses and families.What they are not doing is packing up en masse to leave, despite exhortations from Syrian and Lebanese officials, who have declared that safety and security are on the march in neighboring Syria and that it is time for refugees to go home.But as a new round of peace talks convened Thursday in Geneva, Syrians interviewed at a randomly selected camp in the Bekaa Valley this week offered a unanimous reality check. Their old homes are either destroyed or unsafe, they fear arrest by security forces and they know that despite recent victories by pro-government forces, the fighting and bombing are far from over. They are not going anywhere.Nearly six years into a war that began with a security crackdown on protests against President Bashar al-Assad, countries once eager to see him ousted are now more focused on containing the migrant crisis and defeating the Islamic State, and are willing to consider a settlement that allows Mr. Assad to remain in power.That leaves many governments invested in vague hopes that such a settlement, however rickety or superficial, will somehow stop the metastasis of the Syrian crisis and ease fears of Islamic State terrorism \u2014 often conflated with concerns about ordinary Syrian refugees \u2014 that have fueled the rise of right-wing politicians.And it gives many countries a strong stake in declaring Syria safe for return, even without resolving the political issues that started the conflict, including human rights abuses by the Syrian government.But in a tent settlement in the village of Souairi, Syrians made clear that neither a fig-leaf deal nor an outright government victory would send many of them home.Every family interviewed had at least one member who had disappeared after being arrested or forcibly drafted by the government. The refugees said they cared less about whether Mr. Assad stayed or went than about reforms of the security system. Without an end to torture, disappearances and arbitrary arrests, they said, they would remain wary of going back.Virtually all said that they dreamed of going back, but that it was increasingly a dream for the next generation.\u201cIf the Lebanese president would offer me the choice of staying in prison forever here and going back to Syria now, I would choose prison,\u201d said Khaled Khodor, 23, who spent four days in a Lebanese jail for sneaking across the border.\u201cThey didn\u2019t torture me or beat me,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was fine. In Syria, if you\u2019re taken, you\u2019re gone forever.\u201dMr. Khodor is wanted by the Syrian authorities because he defected from the Syrian Army in 2012. He had two reasons, he said: his own horror at taking part in shelling the rebellious neighborhood of Baba Amr in the city of Homs and threats from rebels in his hometown.Mr. Assad has promised amnesty to soldiers who defected. But Mr. Khodor said a cousin of his who believed the offer had been detained in Syria five months ago and had not been heard from since.The only way he would go back, he said, is if there were international guarantees of his safety. Asked how that would work, he smiled and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I lost hope.\u201dThis camp near the Syrian border is more pleasant than many, without the open sewers or trash heaps that blight many others. About 40 families rent patches of land from Mahmoud Hussein al-Tahan, who said the money was about the same as what he used to make growing eggplants and tomatoes.Work is scarce, and most families are in debt to Mr. Tahan. A relief worker familiar with the camp said that only a small fraction of the children there were in school, and that parents said Mr. Tahan had made some of them work in his fields.Mr. Khodor\u2019s tent, which he shares with eight relatives, including his wife and three children, had a television, a stove and a concrete floor. Back home, his house has been destroyed.\u201cBut I don\u2019t care about the house,\u201d he said, adding that if he trusted that his family would be secure, \u201cwe could live in a tent like this in Syria.\u201dInstead, new refugees are still arriving.Mustafa Selim, 19, fled Syria with his mother and siblings just last fall. Battles had erupted near their house, and one brother had been arrested and forcibly drafted as he was traveling to his university. They do not know if he is still alive.\u201cThe regime is lying when they say it\u2019s safe and secure,\u201d he said. \u201cTo survive in Syria, you have to be a soldier. It\u2019s impossible to live as a civilian. And if you go to the army, it\u2019s kill or be killed.\u201dSome refugees are managing to build new lives. Naumi Qassim, 38, rents a truck and drives from camp to camp selling vegetables and yogurt to those who cannot reach markets. He makes enough money to rent a room within walking distance of a school.Still, his son, at 9, cannot read, he said. He said he believed that overwhelmed Lebanese schools shunted the worst teachers to the evening shift of classes packed with Syrians.Mr. Tahan, a gregarious man who sought to portray himself as the refugees\u2019 benefactor, dismissed the idea that they are harming the country\u2019s economy and straining social services. He said the government pushed that view to get more money from the United Nations.Refugees, he said, benefit the Lebanese, from the generator operators providing them with electricity, to the owners of shops where they spend their United Nations food vouchers, to landowners who benefit from their cheap labor. It is an argument often heard from international organizations, which say the burden of hosting the refugees is largely offset by the economic stimulus they provide, not to mention $1.9 billion in international aid in 2016 alone, the United Nations says.Mr. Tahan said he expected the Syrians to stay for years, based on his experience in Lebanon\u2019s civil war.\u201cWe had hundreds of Geneva conferences before the war ended, and years later, things are still not good,\u201d he said.In the camp, the new Geneva round inspired little hope. The refugees said neither the government nor the opposition negotiators represented them.Mr. Qassim, the vegetable seller, summed it up: \u201cThe opposition wants Assad to go. The regime wants to keep him. All their lives, they will never agree.\u201dStill, he hopes to return. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s too late, but we want our children to have a future in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no future here.\u201dMr. Khodor was more pessimistic. After so much killing, revenge will go on for generations, he said. \u201cSyria is finished.\u201dAt that, a neighbor who had just stopped in loudly objected. \u201cWhy? We want to go back!\u201d\u201cThis lady will take you back,\u201d Mr. Khodor joked, pointing at me.\u201cBut on the condition that no one will hurt me?\u201d he asked.Mr. Khodor laughed. \u201cWe need a miracle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make Syria vanish, and then make a new Syria.\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Move to Block Rule on Coal Mining Near Streams", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans on Thursday took one of their first steps to officially dismantle Obama-era environmental regulations by easing restrictions on coal mining, bolstering an industry that President Trump has made a symbol of America\u2019s neglected heartland.The Senate vote was 54 to 45, following a House vote for repeal on Wednesday.\u201cMake no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams,\u201d Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio who sponsored the move to reverse the rule, said on Wednesday. \u201cInstead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business.\u201dAfter a procedural vote on Thursday, final Senate action to cancel the rule is expected Friday, with Mr. Trump\u2019s signature to follow.Exxon had argued that forcing American oil companies to reveal payments to foreign governments would put them at a competitive disadvantage. Full disclosure could also have made it trickier for Exxon to pursue business deals in countries like Russia, where the state plays a central role.The Stream Protection Rule, which requires companies to restore mined areas to their original physical and ecological state and to monitor for environmental effects, would have effectively made mountaintop removal uneconomical, experts said \u2014 especially when coal prices remain depressed amid competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind and solar.But the rule was challenged in court almost immediately by Republican attorneys general in states across the country, as well as the Ohio-based coal giant Murray Energy. The company had previously filed 14,000 pages of comments opposing stronger regulations.\u201cThis unlawful and destructive rule is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to destroy our nation\u2019s underground coal mines and put our nation\u2019s coal miners out of work,\u201d Robert E. Murray, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in comments released ahead of Thursday\u2019s vote.The report also outlined the costs to industry: $52 million in annual compliance costs for the coal industry as a whole, of which roughly half was expected to be borne by mining operations in Appalachia. The rule could endanger up to 590 coal mining jobs in the region, the report estimated, though the losses would be partly offset by engineers and biologists that companies would need to hire to comply with its terms.Even without the rule, coal industry employment would shrink by more than 15,000 workers, from a total of 90,000 in 2012, the report noted.Still, on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump had pointed to coal mining\u2019s decline as a symptom of overzealous environmental regulation and the neglect of working-class Americans by coastal elites. He vowed that, as president, he would \u201cput our miners back to work\u201d \u2014 a promise that resonated with voters in battleground states, including those in Appalachia.Daile Rois, 56, lives about 2,000 feet from a shuttered coal mine outside Charleston, W.Va. The mine, Keystone Development No. 2, released debris and chemicals into two creeks that meet at the edge of her property and run past her home.After intense opposition from environmental groups, which documented streams clouded by sediment and monitored rising acidity levels, West Virginia\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection permanently closed the mine last year and ordered the operator to restore the site \u2014 a rare victory for local environmentalists.\u201cHere in West Virginia, many creeks run orange\u201d from the contamination, said Ms. Rois, who moved to West Virginia in 2012 with her partner to take care of elderly relatives.She called the Republican vote to repeal the Stream Protection Rule devastating, a move that would allow mines like Keystone to stay open.\u201cOf course I care about miners\u2019 jobs, and I care about their safety,\u201d Ms. Rois said. \u201cBut orange is not the color of water.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carlos Ghosn, Executive Who Revived Nissan, Will Step Aside", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Carlos Ghosn is stepping aside as the chief executive of Nissan Motor, more than 15 years after he took control of the Japanese automaker and helped save it from collapse, becoming in the process a rare and celebrated foreign executive in Japan.Nissan said on Thursday that Mr. Ghosn, who is 62 and was born in Brazil, would remain chairman of Nissan\u2019s board. He will continue to lead the global automobile alliance created during his tenure at Nissan, which also includes Renault of France and, since last year, Mitsubishi Motors of Japan.By pulling back from day-to-day control of Nissan, Mr. Ghosn ends years of speculation about the company\u2019s succession plans. Some analysts and investors had grown concerned that he was overstretched with his multiple roles.Nissan said its new chief executive would be Hiroto Saikawa, a 40-year company veteran who had served as Nissan\u2019s \u201cchief competitive officer\u201d and had led its operations in North America. Mr. Saikawa was appointed co-chief executive with Mr. Ghosn last year, a move widely seen as the beginning of a change in leadership.Mr. Saikawa also leads the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, the trade group representing Japanese carmakers.\u201cI have decided that the time is right\u201d for Mr. Saikawa to take over as Nissan\u2019s C.E.O., Mr. Ghosn said in a statement.\u201cAs Nissan\u2019s chairman,\u201d he said, \u201cI will continue to supervise and guide the company, both independently and within the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance.\u201dMr. Saikawa\u2019s appointment takes effect on April 1, Nissan said.Mr. Ghosn was dispatched to a struggling Nissan in 1999 by Renault, after the French carmaker bought a large stake in the Japanese company. The investment helped keep Nissan afloat and gave Renault, and by extension Mr. Ghosn, extensive power. In 2001, Mr. Ghosn was named Nissan\u2019s chief executive.He used that power to make radical changes. Sweeping aside Japanese sensitivities about protecting employees and longstanding business networks, Mr. Ghosn closed five domestic factories, cut 21,000 jobs and halved the number of Nissan parts suppliers, cementing the nickname he acquired in France, Le Cost Killer.His efforts earned him both fans and detractors, and set Nissan on a path to profitability. In the early 2000s, his life story was turned into a manga comic \u2014 perhaps the ultimate sign of celebrity status in Japan.Where some outright mergers in the auto industry have failed spectacularly \u2014 like Daimler\u2019s takeover of Chrysler, which fell apart a decade ago \u2014 Mr. Ghosn has championed a looser network of mutual shareholding and slowly deepening cooperation. The approach, he has said, gives the Renault-Nissan alliance more flexibility and has been crucial to its longevity.Mr. Ghosn said in the statement on Thursday that giving up the chief executive position at the company would allow him to devote more time to directing the alliance as a whole.\u201cI am committed to supporting the alliance as it evolves and expands, and will continue to serve each member of the alliance wherever and whenever necessary,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Greek Bomb in the E.U.\u2019s Foundations", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Greece, the wounds of history are never far from the surface. And this small country on Europe\u2019s periphery sits squarely on the fault lines of the many difficulties that face Western democracies today. For seven years now, Greece and its creditors have failed to defuse the European Union\u2019s first great crisis since the euro was adopted, despite the biggest bailout of a debtor in history. Donald J. Trump\u2019s election, the Brexit vote and the inexorable rise of anger and aggression in the politics of many nations further undermine the European Union and threaten the achievements and promise of liberal democracy itself.The problems that many European countries face today are present in Greece: the attractions of populist politics and the dead ends to which they lead; the shock of mass immigration and the reactions to it; an unpredictable United States administration that might swing between isolationism and intervention; the strains of economies that cannot sustain the promises of the past. These dynamics have shaped Greece\u2019s domestic politics and the country\u2019s relationship with its European Union partners, leading to today\u2019s dangerous impasse.Whatever the responsibility of the Greeks and their successive governments, playing with such sentiments released hidden emotions into mainstream politics in many countries (not least, Greece and Germany). Technical economic issues that should have been handled by the mechanisms of a shared currency suddenly became politically flammable.With European Union officials choosing not to close ranks around Greece in 2010 and deal with its debt as an in-house affair, the situation here today is worse than ever. But there is also greater divergence between European Union members and the International Monetary Fund.Germany faces national elections this fall and is not likely to favor debt relief for Greece. The Greek government may go for broke, calling elections instead of signing a deal. That would solve nothing and might make Grexit inevitable. With Britain\u2019s departure already underway, and with anti-European Union parties looking strong in the Netherlands, Italy, France and elsewhere, this would be another blow to the union.To deal with today\u2019s challenges, though, Europe\u2019s leaders will have to acknowledge the twin plagues of overreach and complacency that brought them to this dangerous point: overreach in going for the grand gesture \u2014 a currency union, ambitious expansion to include former Eastern Bloc countries, open borders and global markets; complacency about the consequences \u2014 neither within each nation nor at the European Union level.Now economic problems, immigration and aggressiveness strengthen nationalist demagogues everywhere, causing further disruption inside countries and between them. It will take a very strong declaration of faith to change this, to inspire people to defend the union. If the European Union\u2019s strengths and weaknesses \u2014 along with the perils that its collapse would cause \u2014 are not at the center of domestic political campaigns, Europe will not hold together. Solving the riddle of Greece, getting the country back on its feet without taxpayers elsewhere feeling cheated, would be a convincing sign of a new determination.Greece lies like a bomb in the European Union\u2019s foundations. The choices are defusing it, wishing it will go away ... or waiting for the blast.Nikos Konstandaras, the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

In 1971, the State Department established a formal \u201cdissent channel\u201d to ensure that its senior officials would consider differing views in formulating policy.So when 1,000 or so department employees explained through the established dissent channel that President Trump\u2019s executive order suspending visas for citizens of seven Muslim countries would not make our country safer, and why it would in fact sour relations with these countries, deprive us of intelligence and other resources needed to fight terror abroad, increase anti-American sentiment, thwart humanitarian efforts and hurt our economy, one would have expected senior officials to give them a careful hearing.Instead, the White House press secretary warned that dissenters \u201cshould either get with the program or they can go.\u201dOne need not agree with the dissenters to recognize that thoughtful dissent is not disloyalty but a patriotic duty.ROBERT S.

{"Headline": "Samsung\u2019s Leader Is Indicted on Bribery Charges", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The head of Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest conglomerates, was indicted on bribery and embezzlement charges on Tuesday, becoming one of the most prominent business tycoons ever to face trial in South Korea.Four other senior executives of Samsung were also indicted Tuesday, but not arrested, on the same corruption charges as Mr. Lee, and three of the four resigned. Those indictments had been expected and were not seen as indications of a threat to the Lee family\u2019s control of the business.South Koreans have grown weary of endemic corruption and the country\u2019s traditional leniency toward tycoons accused of white-collar crimes. For decades, presidents have entered office vowing to end such favoritism, but they all eventually backtracked. Anticorruption advocates say Mr. Lee\u2019s indictment and trial will be a test of whether the system can finally make a dent in those cozy relationships.Samsung, by far the largest of the chaebol, has long been a symbol of power and wealth in a nation that has transformed itself from an agrarian economy to one of the world\u2019s technological powerhouses. Samsung\u2019s market capitalization accounts for one-fourth of the value of all listed companies in South Korea, and its main unit, Samsung Electronics, alone ships 20 percent of the country\u2019s total exports.Mr. Lee was also accused of committing perjury when he insisted during a parliamentary hearing that he had never bribed Ms. Choi or Ms. Park. He still claims that the \u201cdonations\u201d Samsung paid out to Ms. Choi were coerced, suggesting that the company was extorted.Samsung has said it will try to clear Mr. Lee\u2019s name at trial. It did not immediately comment on his indictment on Tuesday. In the South Korean system, once a suspect is formally arrested, indictment automatically follows, unless evidence emerges that proves the person\u2019s innocence. Those cases are extremely rare.The elder Mr. Lee was convicted of bribery and tax evasion twice but never spent a day in jail. Each time, he was pardoned by the president and returned to the company. At least six of the nation\u2019s top 10 chaebol \u2014 which generate revenue equivalent to more than 80 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 are led by men once convicted of white-collar crimes.Ms. Park was identified as a criminal accomplice in November, when state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on charges of extorting tens of millions of dollars from Samsung and other chaebol by leveraging her connections with the president. But she was protected from indictment while in office.On Tuesday, the special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, added a bribery charge to the case against Ms. Choi, who is already on trial. He said Ms. Park could also face bribery and extortion charges once she leaves office. Ms. Park denies any wrongdoing, saying the money from Samsung was part of \u201cdonations\u201d that businesses provided to two foundations that prosecutors said were controlled by Ms. Choi.In the current scandal, Samsung was accused of making payments to Ms. Choi in exchange for a crucial vote by the government-controlled National Pension Service to support the 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates. The special prosecutor says Ms. Park ordered the pension fund to support the merger on Mr. Lee\u2019s behalf.The merger caused a loss of at least $123 million for the national pension fund, which held large stakes in the two affiliates, but it increased the stock value of the Lee family by at least $758 million, the prosecutor said.The four executives under Mr. Lee who were also indicted belonged to Samsung Electronics or to the conglomerate\u2019s powerful, secretive Corporate Strategy Office. Critics say the office worked mainly to tighten the Lee family\u2019s imperial control of the conglomerate and enforce the father-to-son transfer of leadership. On Tuesday, Samsung said it was disbanding the office as part of its effort to make its corporate governance more transparent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Leaders\u2019 Cheap Deal With Trump", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFor progressives, Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency so far has been a little like standing in front of one of those tennis ball machines \u2014 and getting hit in the face over and over again. Yet looking back, the blow that still has me most off-kilter didn\u2019t come from the new president himself. It came two weeks ago, when several smiling union leaders strolled out of the White House and up to a bank of waiting cameras and declared their firm allegiance to President Trump.Sean McGarvey, president of North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions, reported that Mr. Trump had taken the delegation on a tour of the Oval Office and displayed a level of respect that was \u201cnothing short of incredible.\u201d Mr. McGarvey pledged to work hand in glove with the new administration on energy, trade and infrastructure, while one of the other union leaders described the Inaugural Address as \u201ca great moment for working men and women.\u201d When Mr. Trump issued executive orders to smooth the way for construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, the same leaders rejoiced.A new administration can always count on many organizations to issue pro forma statements expressing a nonpartisan willingness to work with the new leader. Let\u2019s be clear: This was not that. This was a new alliance. As Terry O\u2019Sullivan, head of Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, put it on MSNBC: \u201cThe president\u2019s a builder. We\u2019re builders.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, has ruled in favor of employers far more frequently than workers.And it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at the implications of those pipelines, along with the rest of Mr. Trump\u2019s climate-change denying agenda. A warming world is a catastrophe for the middle and working classes, even more than for the rich, who have the economic cushions to navigate most crises. It\u2019s working and precariously unemployed people who tend to live in homes that are most vulnerable to extreme weather (as we saw during Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy) and whose savings, if they have any, can be entirely wiped out by a disaster.Moreover, a great many of those jobs would be in the building trades \u2014 jobs for carpenters, ironworkers, welders, pipe fitters \u2014 whose union leaders have been so cozy with Mr. Trump. These unions could be fighting for sustainable jobs in a green transition as part of a broad-based movement. Instead, they are doing public relations for the mostly temporary jobs Mr. Trump is offering \u2014 those building oil pipelines, weapons, prisons and border walls, while expanding the highway system even as public transit faces drastic cuts.The good news is that the sectors that have made common cause with Mr. Trump represent less than a quarter of all unionized workers. And many other unions see the enormous potential in a green New Deal.\u201cWe must make the transition to a clean energy economy now in order to create millions of good jobs, rebuild the American middle class, and avert catastrophe,\u201d George Gresham, president of 1199 S.E.I.U., the largest health care union in the nation, said in a statement two days after Mr. Trump\u2019s pipeline executive orders.Other unionized workers, like New York\u2019s Taxi Workers Alliance, showed their opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban by refusing fares to and from Kennedy Airport during the protests.For a long time, these different approaches were papered over under the banner of solidarity. But now some union heads are creating a rift by showing so little solidarity with their fellow union members, particularly immigrants and public sector workers who find themselves under assault by Mr. Trump.Today labor leaders face a clear choice. They can join the diverse and growing movement that is confronting Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda on every front and attempt to lead America\u2019s workers to a clean and safe future.Or they can be the fist-pumping construction crew for a Trump dystopia \u2014 muscle for a menace.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is China Pushing Trump to Talk to North Korea?", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeijing MemoBut if Beijing was sending a message to North Korea, it was also directing one at President Trump, who has complained that China was not putting enough pressure on North Korea.Now President Xi Jinping of China has essentially said: We have done our part in enforcing sanctions. Over to you, Mr. Trump.The challenge comes at a tantalizing moment. For weeks now, plans have been afoot for a North Korean government delegation to meet in New York in early March with a group of former United States officials who have long been involved in North Korea policy.Will the Trump administration issue visas to the North Koreans, a move that would suggest the new president is interested at least in hearing from Pyongyang through informal channels?There have been indications that Mr. Trump was willing to take a quite different tack from President Barack Obama.During his campaign, Mr. Trump said he was interested in sharing a hamburger with the 33-year-old leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. He seemed to suggest he had a smidgen of respect for, or at least curiosity about, the maverick leader, the most recent incarnation of a longstanding dynasty.\u201cIf the visas are issued, it will be a clear message that the Trump administration is prepared to go the extra mile and engage North Korea,\u201d said Evans J. R. Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary of state.There should be little expectation, he warned, of any policy shift by the North, which has shown every indication of wanting to continue building its nuclear program.The planned meeting, sponsored by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, headed by Donald S. Zagoria, falls far short of talks between the two governments and has been designed as an initial sounding board.\u201cI have been organizing such meetings with the North Koreans since 2003, and our goal is to increase mutual understanding as well as to encourage the kind of frank dialogue that may not be possible in official talks,\u201d Mr. Zagoria said.The gathering would be the first of its type in New York in five years because the Obama administration opposed holding even informal talks on American soil given North Korea\u2019s expansion of its nuclear weapons program. That North Korea is holding two Americans hostage was another impediment.Meetings with North Korean officials arranged by Mr. Zagoria and other groups were held in world capitals during the Obama era, including Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Berlin last year.The decision whether to allow the meeting to proceed in New York is now freighted with more than the usual complications.Without these two incidents, the Trump administration could have won praise for breaking the logjam with North Korea by allowing the New York meeting to go ahead, said a former participant in such meetings who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic.But the assassination of Kim Jong-nam would allow opponents of North Korean engagement to charge that granting visas only rewarded bad behavior, the person said.Soon after the killing, Republican and Democratic members of Congress called for the United States to return North Korea to its blacklist of states that sponsor terrorism, from which it was removed nine years ago.This annual show of force, not far from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea and off the Korean coast, has traditionally been viewed by North Korea as an American preparation for an attack against its forces.With the heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and Chinese-North Korean relations at a low point, the risk of a strong response by the North to the exercises \u2014 through the launch of missiles or a nuclear test \u2014 is higher than usual, said Peter Hayes, the executive director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability in Berkeley, Calif.\u201cWe are likely entering a new and extremely dangerous phase of the Korean conflict,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. He suggested ramping down the exercises to \u201cavoid inadvertent clashes and escalation to nuclear war, and to probe North Korean intentions.\u201dChina would like the Trump administration to deal directly with North Korea. Beijing\u2019s suspension of coal imports from North Korea was a signal that China was being tougher than usual, offering Mr. Trump a concession to bring Washington to the table with the North.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has stepped up his contacts with Chinese officials in recent days. On Tuesday he spoke by telephone with Yang Jiechi, China\u2019s top diplomat, and among the topics they discussed was how to handle North Korea.But how much impact a suspension of coal imports would have on the rudimentary and seemingly resilient North Korean economy was far from clear.The Foreign Ministry insisted Tuesday that the suspension of coal imports was a bureaucratic procedure. In the first six weeks of 2017 China had already imported almost all its annual quota of coal allowed under the United Nations sanctions, the ministry said.Zhang Liangui, an expert on North Korea at the Central Party School of the Communist Party, said he was not optimistic that any talks with North Korea, formal or informal, would result in a diminishing of the North\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\u201cNorth Korea has said more than 50 times that it will not participate in any talks that have denuclearization on the agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Trump could pull this off and talk the Koreans out of it.\u201dYufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Champion\u2019s Corner, a Real Coach Who Inspired One on \u2018The Wire\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBALTIMORE \u2014 The FedEx package containing the junior lightweight championship belt, intended for Gervonta Davis, arrived at the gym too early in the day.Davis often trains late into the night, running the streets of Baltimore, and sleeps until midday. So it was his coach Calvin Ford \u2014 he sleeps much less, sometimes just an hour a night \u2014 who found the attempted-delivery note when he got to Upton Boxing Center, a gym in one of the city\u2019s most blighted neighborhoods.Ford, along with Kenny Ellis, another of Davis\u2019s coaches, runs the training sessions at Upton five nights a week, showing young people the angles of the trade and keeping them off the same streets that Davis makes his training ground.The coaches have been involved with fighting, in one way or another, for most of their lives. Ellis, 49, is a bearded former amateur boxer who has coached at Upton since 2005. And Ford, 52, was once a violent lieutenant in the Boardley-Burrows drug organization, which controlled parts of West Baltimore in the 1980s.\u201cIf I had to shoot you, I\u2019d shoot you,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIf I had to stab you, I\u2019d stab you. If I had to beat you up with my hands, I\u2019d beat you up with my hands.\u201dIn 1988, Ford was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy. He served 10 years in a federal prison, where he learned to box. He started coaching after he was released, eventually cultivating a national amateur champion.That attracted the attention of Ed Burns, a police detective who had investigated Ford \u2014 and who became one of the creators of the HBO series \u201cThe Wire.\u201d He used Ford as a model for the character known as Cutty, an ex-con who opened a gym after realizing that the streets he returned to had grown harder than he could handle.Today, Ford is a soft-spoken man who wears track suits and reading glasses secured by a bejeweled chain, a jarringly endearing detail for someone who teaches others how to inflict pain efficiently. And he is a father figure to dozens of children who have been coming to him for nearly two decades for lessons that reach far beyond a three-minute round. Davis, his first world champion, and the youngest living professional titleholder, has been called the future of boxing by no less an authority than Floyd Mayweather Jr.When Davis, 22, entered the gym a few hours later to find a heavily taped cardboard box on the reception desk, it was Ford who handed him the scissors.Inside was a deep-red belt with a large gold logo of the International Boxing Federation, earned with a seventh-round knockout of Jos\u00e9 Pedraza, who was heavily favored, in Brooklyn on Jan. 14.\u201cStrap me up,\u201d Davis said through a stifled grin.Ford, wearing a beanie with #STRAPSEASON printed on the front, put the belt on the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Davis. The new champion posed for a picture under banners that included Angelo Ward, who trained here before he was shot to death in 2012, and a scowling version of Davis\u2019s younger self, draped in belts and medals a decade ago.Now, with a new belt over his shoulder, Davis glowed.\u201cI might walk up and down the avenue,\u201d he said, gesturing to the street outside.Last year, 318 people were killed in Baltimore, the second-highest homicide total for the city on record; 2015 was worse. So far this year, the city is averaging nearly a murder a day.Ford and Ellis know children who were \u2014 and still are \u2014 linked to those troubling statistics. Children, forced to fend for themselves after the killing of a parent, slipping into the current of incarceration. Young men with no prospects other than the easiest one available \u2014 the economy of addiction.Davis, whose mother struggled with drug abuse during his youth and whose father spent time in prison for selling drugs, is one of the fortunate ones. Others have not been so lucky.\u201cKids fall out of school because they saw the kid that they hang with get gunned down in the street,\u201d Ellis said. After witnessing a murder, \u201cyou got to go to school the next day!\u201d he added. \u201cHow can you do a test? How can you pass?\u201dThe kids who come through the gym\u2019s doors at least have a chance to learn how to cope with the hopelessness outside, where, Ellis said, violence claims \u201ca body every day.\u201d\u201cSometimes you hear gunshots, you look around the gym, like, \u2018We got some in here that ain\u2019t getting shot,\u2019\u201d he said.Upton is not far from where Freddie Gray was arrested in 2015, leading to the ride in a police van that left him with a spinal cord injury that killed him a week later. The drugstore that was looted and burned during the riots after his funeral is six blocks away.The neighborhood has the largest percentage of returning criminal offenders in the state, said Nick Mosby, a former mayoral candidate and City Council member who is now a state legislator.\u201cAny barometer of success of a community, unfortunately in that ZIP code, will typically tilt towards a very unhealthy community,\u201d said Mosby, whose wife, Marilyn, was the state\u2019s attorney who prosecuted the Baltimore police officers charged in Gray\u2019s death. (None were convicted.) \u201cPoverty level, education level, unemployment rate, health disparities, you name it.\u201dMosby said the children here were facing adult issues. \u201cAt the age of 7, 8, 9, 10, they\u2019re taking care of themselves, they\u2019re taking care of younger siblings, they\u2019re going out, figuring out what they\u2019re going to eat every day.\u201dUpton, where it costs $65 a year to train, is a refuge.The city funds the gym, though for many years Ford helped out of his own pocket \u2014 including paying for trips to out-of-town competitions.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how many cars I ran through,\u201d Ford said, laughing.Such sacrifice has helped generate good will in the community. Upton stands apart.\u201cYou notice when you walked up on the corners, you ain\u2019t see nobody standin\u2019 on my corners,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThey ain\u2019t gonna have that nonsense around us. That show you that the people \u2014 city, street people \u2014 cares about what we are doing.\u201dEven with Davis\u2019s success, and the national attention it has brought to Upton, the loss of previous fighters \u2014 those who the coaches said decided to \u201cgo left\u201d and give in to the streets \u2014 weighs heavy.Ray Davis, a fighter Ellis trained as a teenager, is in jail after ending up on his own when his father was shot at a corner store. Ronald Gibbs, a 17-year-old nationally ranked amateur, was stabbed in the heart in 2012 in a dispute defending his sister. That same year, Ward, the fighter under whose banner Gervonta Davis had his picture taken, was shot nine times. He was two fights into his professional career.\u201cEvery day, his friends would come here and wait for him to finish training so they could run the streets,\u201d Ellis said of Ward. \u201cI said, \u2018Man, you can\u2019t have one foot in the streets and one foot in the gym. It\u2019s not gonna work.\u2019\u201dThe day that Ward was killed, Ellis said, he was in his car when he received the text. \u201cAnd where he got killed was like three minutes from where I was driving, so I drove around there. And they had the yellow tape around him.\u201dAfter locking his belt in its case, Gervonta (pronounced Jer-VON-tay) Davis drove a few blocks northwest and stood in front of the home he once shared with his mother and grandmother, a bitter wind tunnel of a block dotted with abandoned rowhouses. Garbage spilled into an alley framed by a rowhouse with no roof. An open Bible lay on a stoop, its pages fluttering.Davis pointed out a cactus a few doors down. He used to touch it every day as he walked to and from the elementary school at the end of the block, a child\u2019s personal challenge to himself ahead of a career of stinging hands.When he was 7, Davis and one of his older brothers moved in with his grandmother, after bouncing between a group home and their uncle\u2019s house. Being new to West Baltimore, the boys were quickly forced to defend themselves.Davis\u2019s mother, Kenya Brown, said school officials who had contacted her about his frequent fighting had told her that he was \u201ca menace to society,\u201d but she insisted he was not an instigator. After her brother took Davis to Upton, and he took to the sport, \u201cpeople really started trying him more,\u201d she said.\u201cHe was light-skinned, always been short,\u201d said Brown, 43. \u201cHe had to get staples because somebody hit him in the head.\u201dAt his gym, Ford has a policy: If one of his fighters disrespects a teacher or starts a fight at school, the fighter has to spar with everyone in the gym that night. For Davis, it was less a stick and more a carrot.\u201cHe loved it,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI used to have to bring guys from different cities come down here that was bigger than him, just to punish him, and then he was beatin\u2019 them up.\u201dDavis\u2019s father, Garrin, said Upton allowed his son to avoid the lure of the streets that ensnared so many others. But it took work.\u201cHe made a lot of sacrifices,\u201d said Garrin Davis, who got clean after his last stint in prison. \u201cA lot of the friends that he had, because he made the choice to come here, he didn\u2019t end up where they at.\u201dGervonta Davis\u2019s defensive instincts in the ring, and his calm demeanor, hew to the style of Mayweather, who has taken on the dual role of being Davis\u2019s promoter and mentor. He is undefeated in 17 professional fights. All but one of his victories was by knockout.His success presents new challenges: the thorny world of professional boxing, and the rigors of grooming and marketing himself to be a pay-per-view star. And then there are the myriad voices in his ear. Between rounds at the Pedraza fight in January, Davis had information coming at him from the coaches in his corner and from Mayweather, who was vociferously dispensing advice from ringside.\u201cI\u2019ve been navigating him for years,\u201d Ford said, \u201dso he\u2019s always gonna hear my voice. But Floyd\u2019s been to that land I haven\u2019t been to. So he have to listen to him.\u201dWith those challenges, however, comes opportunity. Davis\u2019s aptitude for boxing is inexorably linked to his troubled background: There is not much in the ring that can hurt him more than the tentacles of his city\u2019s drug trade already have. And that gives him an authenticity that rings true for his community.\u201cHis whole stance, his whole posture, his whole demeanor is Baltimore,\u201d said Mosby, who has taken Davis to schools and juvenile prisons for outreach talks. \u201cAnd these kids recognize that. Young folks will get behind an individual like Gervonta, more so than any policy that we\u2019re able to create, more so than any other public service announcement, any other potential opportunity.\u201dWhen Davis won his title in Brooklyn in January, Ford and Mosby said, a surprisingly large contingent seemed to have made the trip to support him. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have told me we weren\u2019t in Baltimore,\u201d Mosby said.The enthusiasm from the city for one of its own is not lost on Davis. He and Ford want his next fight to be in Baltimore; it would the first title bout here for a world champion from the city.Davis has chosen to remain in Baltimore, rather than uproot himself to Las Vegas to be in Mayweather\u2019s immediate circle. By staying, he believes, he can honor the people who helped raise him \u2014 Ford and Ellis.\u201cMore than myself, they deserve the belt,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey go through a lot. You got to look at it. The people before me, the boxers that they lost. People that they put their blood, sweat and tears into. And the fighters that \u2018go left,\u2019 it\u2019s not right for Calvin and Kenny.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Quiet Giant of Investing Weighs In on Trump", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookHe is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of. His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $795 on Amazon, and a new copy sells for as much as $3,500.Perhaps that\u2019s why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump \u2014 and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry \u2014 has quietly become the most sought-after reading material on Wall Street.He is Seth A. Klarman, the 59-year-old value investor who runs Baupost Group, which manages some $30 billion.While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as \u201cThe Oracle of Boston,\u201d where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised.In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing \u201cperilously high valuations.\u201d\u201cExuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from America-first protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers,\u201d he wrote.\u201cPresident Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhile they might be popular, the reason the U.S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don\u2019t work, they actually leave society worse off.\u201dIn particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of pro-growth policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump\u2019s stimulus efforts \u201ccould prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors.\u201dAnd he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy\u2019s growth over the long term.\u201cThe Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cThe large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today\u2019s artificially low levels.\u201dMuch of Mr. Klarman\u2019s anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership style. He described it this way: \u201cThe erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound decision-making.\u201dHe also linked this point \u2014 which is a fair one \u2014 to what \u201cTrump style\u201d means for Mr. Klarman\u2019s constituency and others.\u201cThe big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he\u2019s apparently deliberately so; he says it\u2019s part of his plan.\u201dWhile Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, \u201cIf things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst.\u201dMr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner.While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: \u201cHis words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president.\u201dIn his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. \u201cDespite my preference to stay out of the media,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander.\u201dFrom the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund\u2019s money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years.What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election \u2014 about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet \u2014 wrongly so far \u2014 that the stock market would fall; he lost about $1 billion.Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes \u2014 he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s index \u2014 he blamed the influx of money into the industry.\u201cWith any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cNo surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured.\u201dHe continued, \u201cTo many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product.\u201dThe lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity.Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes \u2014 at least that finance geeks will appreciate \u2014 is what he says is the irony that investors now \u201chave gotten excited about market-hugging index funds and exchange traded funds (E.T.F.s) that mimic various market or sector indices.\u201dHe says he sees big trouble ahead in this area \u2014 or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit.\u201cOne of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E.T.F. activity is that it will tend to \u2018lock in\u2019 today\u2019s relative valuations between securities,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote.\u201cWhen money flows into an index fund or index-related E.T.F., the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership),\u201d he wrote. \u201cThus today\u2019s high-multiple companies are likely to also be tomorrow\u2019s, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings.\u201dTo Mr. Klarman, \u201cstocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it.\u201d\u201cThis should give long-term value investors a distinct advantage,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become.\u201dHow Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here\u2019s a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: \u201cIn matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.\u201dThe DealBook column on Tuesday, about the investor Seth A. Klarman, referred incorrectly in some copies to a statement he issued criticizing Donald J. Trump last year. It was related to Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of a judge\u2019s Mexican heritage, not a recording in which Mr. Trump talked about groping women.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon Blames \u2018Media Lynching\u2019 for His Campaign Crisis", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAll the facts are perfectly legal and transparent,\u201d he said.Mr. Fillon lashed out at the news media, insisted that the work his wife had done for him was real, defended his own ethics and said he was staying in the race. \u201cThere has been a press campaign of unheard-of violence,\u201d he told reporters.While it is legal for members of Parliament to hire family members, it is not clear that Mr. Fillon\u2019s wife or children actually did much for the money, and the scandal has fed public disillusionment with a cosseted political establishment.As Mr. Fillon has plummeted in the polls, the presidential race has unexpectedly opened up to two maverick candidacies. The far-right National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen and an independent, Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister, are now seen as likely to face each other in a runoff in May.If Ms. Le Pen wins, it could mean the disintegration of the European Union \u2014 she has vowed to hold a referendum on France\u2019s membership \u2014 and would be further evidence of the tide of authoritarian populism sweeping parts of the West.A Le Pen victory is still considered unlikely, but the political tides on both sides of the Atlantic have proved unpredictable, and the race is being closely watched for its potential impact across Europe.The Socialist Party, tainted by the unpopular president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has been almost a nonfactor in the race. Mr. Fillon\u2019s fall now signals the cratering of both of France\u2019s establishment parties.It looks like a catastrophe for his center-right Republican Party, which has no fallback candidate.On Monday, Mr. Fillon joked grimly that the only Plan B was \u201cB\u00e9r\u00e9zina\u201d \u2014 a reference to Napoleon\u2019s disastrous 1812 defeat in Russia. But it was far from clear that his performance on Monday, combative and pugnacious, would be enough to salvage his candidacy.He mostly blamed the news media for his troubles, and he offered no proof that his wife had carried out substantive tasks \u2014 essentially merely repeating his first defense.Mr. Fillon apologized to French voters for what he called an \u201cerror\u201d in employing her, but he noted that many other members of Parliament hired family members.\u201cIf the system needs to be reformed, reform it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are old practices that aren\u2019t acceptable.\u201dHe suggested there was a conspiracy to deprive French voters of the \u201conly candidate\u201d who was proposing real change.\u201cThe goal is to wipe out the choice the voters made in the primary,\u201d he told reporters at the news conference. \u201cThey are doing this because I am proposing a program of total change. But you can\u2019t steal their choice from them.\u201dBut Mr. Fillon did not directly rebut suggestions by his wife, Penelope Fillon, made long before the scandal broke, that she had never done any work for him.On Monday, her husband was able to say only: \u201cShe was first and foremost my companion in work. She was discreet.\u201dHe said that she had handled \u201ccorrespondence\u201d and represented him in \u201ccultural manifestations\u201d in his district in rural western France. But there was no documentation of any work.At the same time, the old interview with Mrs. Fillon revealed, poignantly, a politician\u2019s wife who had spent years in her husband\u2019s shadow. She felt that her intelligence and accomplishments were underused and worried about how her children perceived her.Mrs. Fillon is seen in much of the French news media as a victim in the scandal \u2014 perhaps exploited by a husband of modest means whose social circle nonetheless included moneyed aristocrats and others of wealth. Her husband said on Monday that his wife\u2019s remarks had been taken out of context.Repeatedly, Mr. Fillon expressed his contempt for and anger at the news media.\u201cThis campaign against me is defamatory,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of you has a question about the violence of these accusations against me.\u201d\u201cPolitically assassinate me, as you have done for 10 days now, that poses a real problem,\u201d Mr. Fillon said. \u201cBut the French are realizing this,\u201d he added, vowing to carry on with his campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pruitt Emails: E.P.A. Chief Was Arm in Arm With Industry", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, now the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, closely coordinated with major oil and gas producers, electric utilities and political groups with ties to the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch to roll back environmental regulations, according to over 6,000 pages of emails made public on Wednesday.Environmental groups rushed to condemn the correspondence.\u201cThis extensive trail of emails reads like a yearslong chain of love letters between soul mates,\u201d said Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group.An Oklahoma judge ordered the release of the emails in response to a lawsuit by the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal watchdog group. Many of the emails are copies of documents previously provided to The Times, which examined Mr. Pruitt\u2019s interaction with energy industry players his office helps regulate.The companies provided him with draft letters to send to federal regulators in an attempt to block regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas wells, ozone air pollution and chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the technique of injecting chemicals underground to extract oil and gas, the emails show.Industry executives and Mr. Pruitt held secret meetings to discuss more comprehensive ways to combat the Obama administration\u2019s environmental agenda, and companies and the organizations they funded repeatedly praised Mr. Pruitt and his staff for the assistance in their campaign.In a March 2013 letter to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office, William Whitsitt, then an executive vice president of Devon, referred to a letter his company had drafted for Mr. Pruitt to deliver, on state stationery, to Obama administration officials. Mr. Pruitt, meeting with White House officials, made the case that the rule to rein in methane emissions would harm his state\u2019s economy. His argument was taken directly from Mr. Whitsitt\u2019s draft language.\u201cTo follow up on my conversations with Attorney General Pruitt and you, I believe that a meeting \u2014 or perhaps more efficient, a conference call \u2014 with O.I.R.A. (the O.M.B. Office of Information and Regulatory Analysis) on the B.L.M. rule should be requested right away,\u201d Mr. Whitsitt wrote to a senior member of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s staff, referring to the section of the White House Office of Management and Budget that coordinates regulations throughout the government. \u201cThe attached draft letter (or something like it that Scott is comfortable talking from and sending to the acting director to whom the letter is addressed) could be the basis for the meeting or call.\u201dIn an email from January of that year, Mr. Whitsitt thanked Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office for pushing the Bureau of Land Management to loosen a proposed regulation on fracking.\u201cI just let General Pruitt know that B.L.M. is going to propose a different version of its federal lands hydraulic fracturing rule thanks to input received \u2014 thanks for the help on this!\u201d Mr. Whitsitt wrote.\u201cThis argument is more credible coming from a state,\u201d Richard Moskowitz, general counsel at the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, wrote to one of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s aides.Later that year, Mr. Pruitt filed petitions against both those rules.On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Pruitt addressed career E.P.A. employees to assuage unease with \u2014 and even rebellion against \u2014 their new boss. Mr. Pruitt praised the employees for their years of public service and promised to listen to them.\u201cI believe that we as an agency, and we as a nation, can be both pro-energy and jobs and pro-environment. But we don\u2019t have to choose between the two,\u201d he told employees, even as he stressed that federal authority should be diminished, and that regulatory powers and oversight of pollution should be left largely to the states.\u201cFederalism matters,\u201d he said.The E.P.A. and the White House did not respond to requests for comment on the emails.The emails do not appear to include any request for his intervention explicitly in exchange for campaign contributions, although Mr. Pruitt was separately working as a member of the Republican Attorneys General Association to raise money from many of the same companies.The Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s office withheld some documents, asking the judge to determine if they can be exempted from the order requiring their release. Other open-records requests from the Center for Media and Democracy, The Times and other news organizations remain pending.An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Roderick Hastie, an employee at the law firm Hunton & Williams.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Probably a Bad Idea to Sell Stocks Because You Fear Trump", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket Timing\u201cSo should I cash out of the stock market?\u201dThis is the question I\u2019ve heard from several liberal-leaning friends in the last few months. I get a few emails in this vein every time the stock market hits new highs, as it did on Friday.They are worried that the combination of high share prices and an erratic president mean that the only direction for stocks is down. They are considering shifting some of their assets into cash or bonds.The short and safe answer to give them is: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d But there\u2019s also a long answer.Letting one\u2019s political opinions shape investing decisions is a good way to lose money. Whether a given chunk of your savings should be in stocks, bonds or cash depends on your appetite for risk and when you\u2019re going to need that money. It shouldn\u2019t be shaped by whether you love or hate the current occupant of the White House.First, much of the movement in stocks has little to do with what the president of the United States does. It would be silly to credit Bill Clinton with the dot-com boom that took place during his presidency, or to blame George W. Bush for the collapse of it.But even when the action in Washington is driving markets, it is easy to be blinded by your political opinions. The response to the financial crisis by the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve in early 2009 succeeded at ending the recession and setting the United States economy on an expansion that continues to this day.There\u2019s certainly no guarantee that the stock market will continue to rise under the Trump administration. There are ways that the outlook for investors could get better, and also plenty of ways for them to get worse.It\u2019s very likely there will be corporate tax cuts and deregulation, both of which benefit companies\u2019 bottom lines in a pretty direct and measurable way. It is optimism about those policy priorities that has driven the market rally since Election Day. Throw in some extra government spending on the military and public infrastructure, and you have a recipe for speedier growth.Maybe the pragmatic, pro-business figures in the Trump administration will prevail in internal battles, meaning that, whatever you think of the broader policy agenda, there could be boom times for corporate bottom lines.There are, of course, darker possibilities.President Trump could spark a trade war that could turn into a global recession. Military conflict could break out with a major trading partner like China or could disrupt oil supplies in the Middle East. And a small crisis could spiral into something bigger because of Mr. Trump\u2019s seat-of-the-pants management style.Whatever probability you assign to positive and negative outcomes, it\u2019s hard to dispute that the range of possibilities for what the global economy will look like in four years is uncommonly large. All else being equal, more variation in the economic future means that stocks are riskier.It\u2019s also true that by many measures stock valuations are high. Investing $100 in the S.&.P 500 buys only about $4.69 in annual earnings, down from $5.06 before the election. There is always the possibility of a major correction \u2014 something that would be true no matter who was in the Oval Office.If that scares you, your money probably shouldn\u2019t be in the stock market. If you are planning to tap into those investments in the next few years and a 25 percent drop would be devastating, that\u2019s all the more reason to limit your exposure to the market. Stocks tend to offer good long-term returns, but can deliver low or negative returns for many years at a time.Moving money out of stocks because you need it within the next few years and can\u2019t stomach that kind of risk is one thing. But making a move just because you lack confidence in President Trump could be a case of letting ideology trump investing discipline.An earlier version of this article misstated the professional affiliation of Barry Ritholtz.

{"Headline": "Where the Booze Can Kill, and Putin Is Deemed a \u2018Good Czar\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIRKUTSK, Russia \u2014 The overworked cleaning woman realized that her grown son was not just sleeping off his habitual hangover in the Siberian city of Irkutsk when she discovered \u2014 to her horror \u2014 that he had quietly gone blind.To many outsiders, including President Trump and his inner circle of advisers, Russia is riding high today, strutting about the globe. It wields its clout both openly, by sending its military into Ukraine and Syria, and surreptitiously, warping politics in Europe and America through a sustained campaign of propaganda and cyberwarfare.Most of the afflicted in Irkutsk started that Saturday night in December just like Mr. Mukhamadeyev, trotting out to a local kiosk or small corner store to buy \u201cboyaryshnik\u201d \u2014 \u201chawthorn\u201d in Russian, lending the product a false holistic air. The label called it bath oil and warned against drinking the contents, but it was common knowledge that bootleggers produced the rotgut specifically as poor man\u2019s vodka.\u201cEverybody drank it because it was the cheapest,\u201d wailed Zoya Mukhamadeyeva, 59, Mr. Mukhamadeyev\u2019s mother, tearfully kissing childhood photographs of her only son.The working-class neighborhood of Novo-Lenino, where the bulk of the victims lived in this provincial capital some 2,600 miles east of Moscow, is in many ways a snapshot of the growing poverty in Russia.\u201cThe situation is typical for the whole country. It just happened here,\u201d said Yuri Pronin, the editor of Baikalskiye Vesti, a local independent weekly.It was not supposed to be this way. Over the 16 years that Vladimir V. Putin has served as either president or prime minister of Russia, the standard of living had inched upward in the neighborhood, even as it soared in cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg. Squat, five-story banks of numbing gray Soviet apartment blocks gave way to cheerfully colored, 10-story buildings constructed around appealing playgrounds.Imported cars clogged the parking lots. Pizzerias and health clubs vied for the residents\u2019 spare rubles.As he imposed order on the economy and cut back press and political freedoms, Mr. Putin promised in return better lives for all Russians, laying out a series of targets for 2020.At least 60 percent and maybe even 70 percent of Russia\u2019s 143 million population would join the middle class. Average salaries would rise to 40,000 rubles a month (more than $1,000 then; less than $700 at current exchange rates). Russians would live far longer, with life expectancy for both men and women reaching 75.During the recession, those and other benchmarks have receded.Nationwide, the ranks of people who consider themselves middle class has dropped to around 50 percent. The average wage of 36,703 rubles would have to be 55,000 in 2017 rubles to equal Mr. Putin\u2019s target. In the Irkutsk region, the number of people living below the poverty line \u2014 officially 10,000 rubles per month, about $170 \u2014 has grown to about 20 percent from 17 percent before the crisis.In Siberia, residents traditionally raise a birthday toast \u201cto Siberian health,\u201d as if the harsh climate forges a stronger constitution. In reality, people in the Irkutsk region die at age 67 on average \u2014 59 for men \u2014 compared with 77 in Moscow. The climate and the drinking, as well as inferior medical services, take their toll.The overall population of Irkutsk is also shrinking. \u201cPeople constantly discuss the lack of prospects here,\u201d said Mikhail Rozhansky, the head of the Center for Independent Social Research and Education.While the modern apartments and new cars lend Novo-Lenino a patina of prosperity, the people have little work and dwindling savings, said Andrei Kolganov, who spurned a Moscow career to become a clown in the neighborhood, parlaying that into a successful children\u2019s entertainment center. Problems spiraled after 2014.\u201cThe majority of the people in this neighborhood drink illegal alcohol,\u201d Mr. Kolganov said during an impromptu tour. \u201cYou can see that people don\u2019t live that badly. But they don\u2019t have work, nobody needs them, so they drink. It\u2019s a Russian tradition.\u201dEven some local people were shocked by the number of seemingly comfortable people who drank the tainted alcohol \u2014 nurses, teachers, drivers \u2014 people with steady if low-paying jobs. Some victims just keeled over on the street, residents said, and others were discovered dead days later in their apartments.\u201cEverybody knew that it was not bath oil. That label was just meant to fend off the inspectors,\u201d Mr. Kolganov said. \u201cWhat really shocked people is that those who died wanted to give the appearance that they were doing well, but they lacked the money to buy decent vodka.\u201dAlthough sold under different names for decades, even from vending machines, the basic product remained uniform. Boyaryshnik was packaged in a 250-gram bottle of almost 95 percent alcohol that cost about $1, and could be diluted to create a normal-size bottle of what was considered vodka. A 500-gram bottle of legal vodka, with all government taxes paid, costs around five times as much.After the mass poisoning, investigators discovered that some bootleggers had produced a batch of boyaryshnik using methanol instead of ethanol. Even a small amount of methanol is fatal, as it destroys the central nervous system, including the optic nerve.That Sunday, seeing her son lying practically comatose, Mrs. Mukhamadeyeva, who juggles three cleaning jobs, summoned a doctor living in the building. He discovered that Renat had gone blind without saying anything.Later that night, Mrs. Mukhamadeyeva said, she encountered bedlam in the emergency room. Even as her son was wheeled into the intensive care unit, she said, four corpses were carted out. Told to wait, she watched a woman on a stretcher die by the admitting desk.\u201cDoctors were running here and there, but they could not seem to do anything,\u201d she said. Fomepizole, a methanol antidote often used in American emergency rooms, is not certified in Russia, and ethanol, which affects the metabolism of the poison, is only randomly available in its intravenous form.The local department of health did not respond to queries about the treatment the victims received. Local press reports, however, quoted doctors as saying that the patients who lived among the 123 affected had apparently also consumed vodka or other alcohol made with ethanol \u2014 in effect, drinking an antidote.Even before the poisonings, market vendors in Novo-Lenino had noticed that residents were getting poorer. Shoppers bought more cabbage and macaroni, less meat. Any discounted produce sold first.That mirrors changes nationwide. After two years of recession and what consumers say is roughly a doubling of food prices, government statistics indicate that the average Russian eats markedly less meat, fish, dairy products and sugar, while consumption of potatoes, melons and vegetables has jumped. About half of all Russians grow a portion of their own fruits and vegetables.Such changes were not limited to the poor. Some people with suburban dachas who seeded lawns during the fat years have since dug them up to plant potatoes, said Larisa Kazakova, a local opposition activist.\u201cEveryone tries to grow their own potatoes,\u201d said Mr. Kolganov, laughing when told that a few university professors had denied knowing anyone in such dire straits. \u201cDo you think a university professor is going to confess to you that he has to plant potatoes to get by?\u201dUntil the vodka tragedy, nobody protested the economic plight.\u201cWe all saw the difficulties as temporary,\u201d explained Alexander Rasstrigin, a businessman of ample girth who owns the Progress Plus street market.\u201cBefore the sanctions, people lived quite well,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople took out loans. They were confident about tomorrow. They bought cars. They were sure there would be stability.\u201dNow it seems as if everyone can afford only half, or less, of what he or she could before. Pensioners in particular count every kopeck, Mr. Rasstrigin said.\u201cWe buy fewer extras,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot afford expensive cheese. I cannot afford good kielbasa. I don\u2019t buy any delicacies.\u201dThe poisoning even roused a rare protest, but only among vendors incensed after city bulldozers began smashing their 30 market stalls. They felt they were being scapegoated for the illicit vodka trade, which the police had long tolerated, if not controlled. Boyaryshnik has since been banned \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 and some two dozen local police officials, bureaucrats and dealers have been detained, but no major suppliers.Asked about the poisonings at a news conference, Mr. Putin criticized \u201csupervisory bodies\u201d for failing to prevent the tragedy, but ultimately blamed unidentified foreigners. Given that experts estimate the bootleg trade represents 20 percent of the national alcohol market, nobody expects it to disappear soon.Describing their protest later, a small knot of women grew agitated. \u201cLet people see how Putin really manages this country, see how poor people really live!\u201d yelled one.Tatyana, 58, a short, stout fishmonger, said she lived on a pension of about $133 a month. She ate normally one week every month, she said, then subsisted on bread and butter.\u201cWe suffer while those in power eat black caviar by the spoonful,\u201d she said, miming a person shoving a spoon into his mouth.\u201cSpoonful?\u201d scoffed Elena, another vegetable seller. \u201cThey gorge on buckets of the stuff!\u201dIn a curiously Russian dynamic, they avoided blaming Mr. Putin personally.\u201cThe president says that small business should be protected, but lower-level bureaucrats continue with their dark deeds and as a result we will all end up unemployed,\u201d Mr. Rasstrigin said.The vendors were convinced, as Russians have been for centuries, that if only the czar knew of their plight he would surely intervene. \u201cTell Moscow, tell Putin, that they are closing the market,\u201d Elena pleaded.Mr. Putin is expected to win a fourth term as president in 2018, ensuring him another six years in office. His unmet pledges on issues like life expectancy do not enter the calculus of most voters, analysts said.Older Russians in particular remain grateful to Mr. Putin for ending the chaos and lawlessness of the 1990s, while over all he has made Russians feel better about themselves and their country\u2019s standing in the world.\u201cI like Putin. He is a good czar, and Russia needs a czar,\u201d said Mr. Kolganov, the businessman, stressing that he wanted to avoid excessive criticism or praise.\u201cHe is protecting us; how can we say anything against him?\u201d he added. \u201cIf he did not do some of what he promised, well, how can one person do everything?\u201dAn article last Sunday about the role that Russia\u2019s grinding recession played in the deaths of 72 people in the Siberian city of Irkutsk who drank what they thought was cheap vodka referred incorrectly to methanol, the poison. Although it is not available in Russia, a drug called fomepizole is an antidote to methanol; it is not the case that there is no antidote. (In addition, ethanol, a component of alcohol, is used as an antidote because it affects the metabolism of methanol.)Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Irkutsk, and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Graft Allegations Grow Against Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, French Presidential Hopeful", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, the newspaper published new accusations, reporting that Ms. Fillon had held the bogus job for even longer than initially reported \u2014 from 1988 to 1990, between 1998 and 2007 and finally from 2012 to 2013 \u2014 and that she had been paid 831,440 euros, or nearly $900,000, much more than the figure published last week.The allegations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has pledged to reduce wasteful spending and has fashioned himself as a stern and honest politician, untouched by the corruption scandals that have plagued some of his opponents.Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 also reported that Mr. Fillon paid two of his five children as parliamentary aides when he was in the Senate, the upper house of Parliament, from 2005 to 2007. In an interview on French television last week, Mr. Fillon said that he had hired them temporarily for their expertise as lawyers.But the French news media was quick to point out that the children, his oldest daughter and a younger son, were not lawyers at the time, only law students, and Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 reported on Wednesday that they were paid a total of \u20ac83,735 as full-time parliamentary aides, or over $90,000.Under French law, it is not illegal for members of Parliament to hire relatives as aides, provided that the work is genuine. But the initial report in Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 prompted prosecutors in Paris to open an investigation to determine if Ms. Fillon actually did the work.Investigators have searched Mr. Fillon\u2019s office at the National Assembly and questioned his wife and him, as well as Marc Joulaud, Mr. Fillon\u2019s former parliamentary deputy.Mr. Fillon has denied wrongdoing and has said he would only drop out of the race if placed under formal investigation and charged.His supporters have mounted a confusing defense of Ms. Fillon, with some suggesting, for instance, that she was never seen in Paris because she worked exclusively in Sarthe, the region of France that Mr. Fillon represents. Others suggested the opposite. Antonin L\u00e9vy, Mr. Fillon\u2019s lawyer, was mocked on social media for suggesting that the work of a parliamentary aide was not always \u201ctangible.\u201dThe investigation is also focusing on Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9\u2019s report that Ms. Fillon was paid \u20ac5,000 a month from May 2012 to Dec. 2013 by La Revue des Deux Mondes, a political magazine owned by Marc Ladreit de Lacharri\u00e8re, a wealthy friend of Mr. Fillon\u2019s. Ms. Fillon is suspected of having done little besides a handful of short literary reviews.Speaking to right-wing lawmakers on Wednesday, Mr. Fillon accused his opponents on the left of orchestrating an \u201cinstitutional coup\u201d and asked his colleagues stay loyal to him, according to French news reports.Thierry Sol\u00e8re, a Republican lawmaker who is also a spokesman for Mr. Fillon, said later that \u201cnobody\u201d would prevent Mr. Fillon from reaching the first and second rounds of the presidential election. But others in the party openly questioned Mr. Fillon\u2019s candidacy on Wednesday.In France, any number of candidates can run in the first round of voting, but only the two top vote-getters make it to the runoff. This year, the first round is set for April 23, and the runoff for May 7.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Confirms Scott Pruitt as E.P.A. Head", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenators voted 52 to 46 to confirm Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who has built a career out of suing to block the E.P.A.\u2019s major environmental rules and has called for the dissolution of much of the agency\u2019s authority. One Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, crossed party lines to vote against Mr. Pruitt, while two Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both from coal-rich states where voters generally oppose environmental rules, voted for him.Democrats railed all night on the Senate floor against Mr. Pruitt and urged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to delay the confirmation vote until after next Tuesday, when the Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s office is under order to release about 3,000 of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry.But the effort did little but deprive Democrats of sleep.Democrats say the emails to be released on Tuesday could reveal more, and possibly disqualifying, information about those relationships.\u201cI reminded my colleagues that the release of these documents could be imminent and that we would be wise wait to vote on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s nomination until we had the opportunity to review them \u2014 and shame on us if we didn\u2019t,\u201d said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee.\u201cMr. Pruitt has been nominated by a man who, as a nominee, as a president-elect and now as president, has made clear his goals to degrade and destroy the E.P.A.,\u201d Mr. Carper said. \u201cLike many things President Trump says, we ask ourselves, \u2018Did he mean it?\u2019 With the nomination of Mr. Pruitt, it\u2019s clear he did.\u201dFor many Republicans, that appears to be part of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s appeal. During the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell became a leading opponent of the president\u2019s climate change agenda, particularly its centerpiece, a set of E.P.A. regulations intended to shut down heavily polluting coal-fired power plants and replace them with wind and solar power. Those rules, if enacted, could disproportionately hurt the economy of Mr. McConnell\u2019s coal-rich state.Mr. Pruitt, who has expressed skepticism about human-caused global warming, has been a key architect of the legal battle to overturn the rules.\u201cPruitt is just the candidate we need at the helm of the E.P.A.,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHe\u2019s exceptionally qualified. He\u2019s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the real-world consequences of E.P.A. actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the long-term.\u201dMr. McConnell added: \u201cWe should confirm him. Doing so will represent another positive change in Washington that can give hope to families in Kentucky and across the nation who are still recovering from the last eight years.\u201dWithin days of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s swearing-in, Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies, people familiar with the White House\u2019s plans said.Already, Mr. Pruitt has begun work to reshape the environmental agency. Among the candidates he has interviewed for top positions are several former senior staff members in the office of his fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe, who has become known as Congress\u2019s most prominent denier of the science of global warming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here Comes the Bride. Now Count the Rest.", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 A modern Indian wedding might include a dayslong celebration, ornate invitations, elephants covered in finery and a bride adorned in gold.But in an effort to curb such extravagant spending, lawmakers in one Indian state have imposed new regulations to limit wedding celebrations to an intimate 400 or 500 guests.On Monday, Jammu and Kashmir State issued an order that one official said was aimed at closing the gap between the rich and the poor. Under the new regulations, weddings will be capped at 400 to 500 guests and organizers can serve just 14 dishes \u2014 seven vegetarian and seven nonvegetarian options. Engagement parties will be capped at 100 guests, and penalties can be imposed on violators.\u201cDuring the last 20 months, we have been receiving complaints from the public that rich people are spending huge amounts during the marriages,\u201d said Chowdhary Zulfkar Ali, the state minister for the Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs. \u201cPoor people were forced to spend the money on the marriage ceremonies of their daughters and sons.\u201dThough it would appear difficult to enforce the order, which will take effect on April 1, Mr. Ali said the government would issue penalties for noncompliance.\u201cMarriages can be stopped; the banquet hall can be seized,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be penalized and they can be imprisoned even if anybody violates the government order.\u201dThe urge to mark weddings as lavish affairs is partly cultural, said Sonalde Desai, a sociologist at the University of Maryland and the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi who studies changes in Indian families, including marriage practices.\u201cFor the bride\u2019s family, there is the expectation that if they don\u2019t pay for a really lavish wedding, their daughter will not be treated well in their marital homes,\u201d she said.But rising incomes have raised the ante of what lavish means in India, and the poor often take out loans to pay for weddings.Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s action was not the first official effort to rein in wedding spending. Ranjeet Ranjan, a member of Parliament from the impoverished Bihar State, has proposed a bill that would curb wedding expenditures nationally.She hopes that the bill will be introduced in Parliament next month. It would set a limit on wedding expenses of 500,000 rupees, or about $7,500, a pittance for even a typical middle-class wedding.Under Ms. Ranjan\u2019s proposal, families who spend more than $7,500 would have to contribute one-tenth of the wedding\u2019s costs to a fund that would go toward paying for the weddings of poor families.\u201cThere is undue pressure from society to have a lavish wedding, even when you can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Ms. Ranjan said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people spend a lifetime\u2019s worth of money in two days.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman reported from Mumbai, and Nida Najar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s self-awareness about culture and respect for different perspectives. It\u2019s comfort with ambiguity. It\u2019s the skill to investigate the world through questions. Empathy and humility are big pieces of all of it.\u201d\u201cI saw that I needed to teach so that my students could contribute anywhere in the world,\u201d Kelly said.In a unit on nutrition, for instance, students explore foods from around the world, graphing diets against life spans. \u201cWe compared diets high in starchy vegetables with places where they eat dark green or sea vegetables,\u201d she said. The connections the students drew were powerful: They learned that people in China live longer than black people in America. They discovered that wherever the American diet was introduced, life spans declined.In a unit on death, Kelly added an exploration of 11 funeral rites. Students learned that in Ghana, caskets are woven in the shape of objects beloved by the deceased; in South Korea, a person\u2019s remains may be pressed into jewelry; and in Tibet, the mountaintop \u201csky burial\u201d in the open allows a dead person\u2019s soul to exit the body and be reincarnated. \u201cI asked them to choose five rituals that would be a good fit with their values and cultures,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI wanted them to make connections, to see how other cultures see life and death.\u201d\u201cEvery class that I\u2019ve revised to include international representation,\u201d she added. \u201cI found that the students made more connections because they had a cultural anchor. And when I assessed what they retained I got content-specific vocabulary because it stuck, especially where they could see aspects of themselves and of people they knew. And the questions I got were better. I stopped getting \u2018what\u2019 questions and started getting \u2018why\u2019 questions, and \u2018what if\u2019 questions.\u201dAt Mill Valley Middle School in California, two teachers, Rod Septka and Maggie Front, working with more affluent students, have seen this approach evoke a similar response. When the recent drought in California was daily news, they looked at how people in the state were conserving water. Then they examined how people cope with water-related problems in Bangladesh, Israel, Sudan, Bolivia, China, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Peru and Syria. The students did extensive research and data gathering. One student was astonished that so many people around the world couldn\u2019t just go into their kitchen and get water from a tap. Then the water crisis in Flint, Mich., became news, and they looked at water access in terms of wealth and race. That led a student who had been previously disengaged in school to discover her activist voice, said Front. And studying water rights brought her to a related concern: women\u2019s rights.\u201cA lot of this helps the kids to understand what actions they can take toward solving world issues,\u201d said Front. \u201cIt\u2019s not the mission to create activism, but that tends to come out of it.\u201dIn a culminating experience, the students, working in twos, carried five-gallon buckets of water for half a mile. They experimented with ways to do it efficiently, while minimizing spillage, and collected data about time, distance and volume to calculate how long it would take them to provide water for their family. \u201cIt was a lot harder than they thought,\u201d said Septka. \u201cIt gave them a newfound appreciation for people who have to do things differently than we do.\u201dEach of these teachers described learning alongside the students, making mistakes, and improving their own global competence in the process.\u201cBy and large, our curriculum in the United States is a European great civilization approach \u2014 Plato to NATO \u2014 with some add-ons for cultural diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the condition we live in is fundamentally global. There\u2019s literally nothing that\u2019s not connected far beyond our borders.

{"Headline": "What Nelson Peltz Is Up To With His $3.5 Billion Stake in P.&G.", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsProcter & Gamble has proved a tough target. A fellow corporate agitator, Bill Ackman, plowed some $1.8 billion into the company in mid-2012. After helping push out the chief executive to bring back a former boss, A. G. Lafley, Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square exited the position after just two years without the big return he typically expects from his concentrated investments.Since Mr. Ackman\u2019s departure, Procter & Gamble has made some further progress. Mr. Lafley was replaced by David Taylor, a veteran of the company who promised to keep streamlining the enterprise. Procter & Gamble offloaded Duracell batteries and the beauty brands Clairol and Covergirl. Even so, moving the share price at the $230 billion titan has been difficult, opening the door for Mr. Peltz.Breaking up the company may be one option. Although Mr. Peltz unsuccessfully pushed such an idea at Pepsi, analysts from Bernstein already have sent letters to Mr. Taylor and the board supporting the idea. Gillette could be an area of focus for Mr. Peltz. Procter & Gamble paid more than $50 billion for it in 2005, but the razor operation has come under increasing pressure from start-ups like Harry\u2019s that offer cheaper alternatives through subscription services that cater to younger consumers. Unilever recently bought a Gillette rival, the Dollar Shave Club, giving it a stronger backer.Either way, Procter & Gamble at least offers some downside protection for Mr. Peltz. Consumer staples are often resilient when the economy starts to crack. P.&G. has one of the most consistent dividend track records of American companies, a feature that investors especially prize when stock prices stagnate.The United States is already at near full employment, and the stretch of growth since 2009 is one of the longest in the country\u2019s history. That suggests another recession may not be far off. Odds are that Mr. Peltz has something bigger in mind, but he picked a good time to try scrubbing up Procter & Gamble.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "R. Alexander Acosta, Law School Dean, Is Trump\u2019s New Pick for Labor", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Moving quickly after his first choice for labor secretary withdrew his nomination amid controversy, President Trump made a seemingly safe selection on Thursday in R. Alexander Acosta, a Florida law school dean and former assistant attorney general.In Mr. Acosta, Mr. Trump has chosen a nominee with deep experience in labor relations, law and education. The pick answers concerns about the lack of diversity in the Trump administration, in that Mr. Acosta would be the first Hispanic in the president\u2019s cabinet. And his chances of being confirmed appear relatively high, since Mr. Acosta, currently the dean of Florida International University\u2019s law school, has made it through the Senate process three times for different roles.\u201cAlex is going to be a key part of achieving our goal of revitalizing the American economy, manufacturing and labor force,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he called on the Senate to confirm Mr. Acosta swiftly.A Miami native, Mr. Acosta\u2019s most relevant experience to the job of labor secretary is his time at the National Labor Relations Board, where he was a member from 2002 to 2003, under President George W. Bush. Mr. Bush later tapped Mr. Acosta to be assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, one of the highest positions at the agency.He went on to become the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where his office prosecuted the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the terrorism suspect Jose Padilla and founders of the Cali cartel. He achieved the conviction of Charles Taylor Jr., the son of Liberia\u2019s former leader, for torture. His official biography said his office also prosecuted several bank-related cases and targeted health care fraud.Mr. Acosta\u2019s record and writings will undergo close scrutiny in the weeks before his confirmation hearing. But some of the most outspoken skeptics of the previous labor nominee, the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder, have already expressed optimism and open-mindedness about Mr. Acosta.\u201cI am thrilled that at long last, we have a Hispanic in this cabinet,\u201d said Javier Palomarez, president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, who was critical of Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign.Labor groups that assailed Mr. Puzder as being anti-worker applauded the choice of Mr. Acosta.\u201cUnlike Andy Puzder, Alexander Acosta\u2019s nomination deserves serious consideration,\u201d said Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. trade union. \u201cIn one day, we\u2019ve gone from a fast-food chain C.E.O. who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it.\u201dIf confirmed, Mr. Acosta could also help smooth the relationship between Mr. Trump and American Muslims who have accused him of fomenting religious discrimination. Testifying before Congress in 2011 at a hearing about the civil rights of American Muslims, Mr. Acosta made a forceful appeal that they should be viewed as any other American community would. \u201cNow is a good time to remember that no community has a monopoly on any particular type of crime,\u201d he said.Despite the early praise Mr. Acosta has received, it is far from certain that his confirmation will be easy. Progressive groups, such as the Democratic \u201csuper PAC\u201d American Bridge, were busy on Thursday digging through his background and looking for stains on his record. One area of potential concern is a 2008 investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, which looked into whether hiring practices and case assignments at the civil rights division he led were based on political affiliations. A report on the case found that Mr. Acosta had ignored warning signs about such problems.Another pitfall could be a 2004 letter to a federal judge in Ohio that Mr. Acosta sent while he was at the Justice Department, justifying \u201cvote caging\u201d in the presidential election. The practice, in which private citizens in Ohio challenged the eligibility of African-American voters, was widely seen as a Republican strategy to disenfranchise minorities.Both issues came up when Mr. Acosta was interviewing to become dean of the University of Florida\u2019s law school in 2014. Michelle Jacobs, a professor at the school, said that she and her colleagues were uncomfortable with how Mr. Acosta explained the vote-caging case. She also said Mr. Acosta had described paying lip service to lawmakers when called to testify before Congress.\u201cI feel that he lacked some transparency, and he didn\u2019t show a full appreciation for ethical obligations,\u201d Ms. Jacobs said. \u201cWe felt it deeply enough that we eliminated him from the list of candidates.\u201dBut colleagues of Mr. Acosta\u2019s at Florida International University said he was widely liked as a leader of the law school, striking a healthy balance of being detail-oriented without micromanaging. A father of two daughters and a lover of science fiction, Mr. Acosta is known within his department for being humble and genial.\u201cI was actually stunned that Donald Trump would make such a sensible choice,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Gabilondo, an F.I.U. law professor who has worked closely with Mr. Acosta. \u201cHe\u2019s a very mature person with a sense of decorum, and I think he\u2019ll make a very big contribution to the administration.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Turns to Manufacturing Executives to Help Develop Jobs Plans", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, who has repeatedly promised to bring jobs back to the United States, turned to manufacturing executives on Thursday to help him develop measures to do just that, giving powerful business leaders a potentially influential hand in shaping his still-evolving economic policies.\u201cMy administration\u2019s policies and regulatory reform, tax reform, trade policies will return significant manufacturing jobs to our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House, sitting around a large table with members of his cabinet and two dozen manufacturing executives. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be based on bringing our jobs back \u2014 the good jobs, the real jobs. They\u2019ve left and they\u2019re coming back. They have to come back.\u201dMr. Trump has yet to outline specific proposals for overhauling the tax and regulatory systems, rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure or reshaping the work force, all of which would be essential to accomplishing his ambitious employment goals. He told the group that his campaign pledge to create jobs had played a major role in his winning the White House, and on Thursday he dispatched his cabinet and senior staff members to gather input from the executives on what those packages should look like.But the president suggested his job-creation strategy was still something of a blank slate.\u201cWe\u2019re going to then go through the room very, very carefully,\u201d Mr. Trump said to the executives as reporters were escorted out of the State Dining Room so that he and the business leaders could meet privately. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out how we bring more jobs back.\u201dManufacturing executives appeared elated to be asked.\u201cThank you for the opportunity in bringing the language of business back to the White House,\u201d said Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical. \u201cI\u2019m here to make chemistry sexy again.\u201dMarillyn A. Hewson, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said she was \u201cvery excited about the fact that this is one of the first actions that you want to take on.\u201d\u201cDo you think Hillary would have asked for $700 million?\u201d Mr. Trump asked, referring to Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the presidential election. \u201cOh, boy. I assume you wanted her to win,\u201d he added, as Ms. Hewson appeared to shake her head in silence.The president also singled out Greg Hayes of United Technologies, parent company of Carrier, praising its decision last year to keep hundreds of jobs in the United States.\u201cDid you bring any more of those jobs back?\u201d Mr. Trump asked Mr. Hayes on Thursday.United Technologies and many of the other industrial firms Mr. Trump would like to see increase hiring in the United States are under intense pressure from Wall Street, especially activist investors and hedge funds, to generate faster earnings growth. That has forced companies like Mr. Hayes\u2019s to embrace cost cuts, and to move production from the United States to cheaper locations like Mexico, although profit margins are high, and United Technologies\u2019 stock has been a strong performer.Shares of United Technologies are up 73 percent over the past decade, ahead of the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index\u2019s 66 percent gain over the same period.At Emerson Electric, represented on Thursday by chief executive David Farr, the work force has shrunk to 103,500 from 131,600 over the past three years.Campbell Soup, whose chief executive, Denise Morrison, sat a few chairs from Mr. Trump in the State Dining Room, has cut employment over the past three years to 16,500 from 20,000, or 18 percent.\u201cGood soup,\u201d Mr. Trump said as Ms. Morrison introduced herself, though there was no mention of jobs.The president appeared relaxed and in his element in the room of executives, at one point interrupting to ask Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, to tell a story about watching Mr. Trump make a hole-in-one on the golf course.\u201cI actually said I was the best golfer of all the rich people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \"Then I got a hole-in-one, so it was sort of cool.\u201dBefore the meeting, the executives huddled privately in small groups with cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across from the West Wing, trading ideas for job creation initiatives. They complained about the ways in which current tax policy and uncertainty about the fate of federal regulations, particularly environmental restrictions, hurt their profitability and competitiveness. The comments came in portions of the meeting witnessed by reporters under ground rules requiring that individual speakers not be named.Senior administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, wondered aloud about how to pay for a substantial infrastructure initiative \u2014 Mr. Trump has proposed $1 trillion \u2014 and how to replicate the success of countries like Germany in keeping manufacturing jobs while stepping up the pace of automation.During a session on taxes and trade, executives and senior officials agreed that the business tax rate should be reduced and that the United States should move toward a so-called territorial tax system in line with many other nations, according to a White House official who described the meeting afterward on the condition of anonymity. Under such a system, countries tax corporations solely on the income generated within their borders.But the executives were split over the plan\u2019s components, the official said, with those whose companies depend on imported goods raising concerns about one approach being discussed that would effectively place a 20 percent tax on imports.Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals about his position on the idea, which has been advocated by House Republicans, first expressing opposition, and then saying he was open to the possibility.On Thursday, he said the approach could spur job creation, telling Reuters in an interview: \u201cI certainly support a form of tax on the border.\u201dNelson D.

Oddly, several of the people do not make any attempt to run from the advancing soldiers.The soldiers then saunter up to the wounded, blasting them in the head with assault rifles from a few feet away. Many of the victims look young; several are women.None carry guns.These images are part of a battlefield video that was shared with The New York Times on Friday and that, thanks to Congolese human rights activists, has begun to make the rounds on Facebook and other social media.Several analysts said that the footage revealed a government-sponsored massacre of civilians and that the video could be used as evidence of war crimes.Human Rights Watch, Western diplomats and United Nations officials said they were investigating the video, which was consistent with United Nations reports this week of Congolese government soldiers ruthlessly crushing a local militia in the Kasa\u00ef-Central Province.\u201cThe video shows shocking footage of killings and executions of civilians by uniformed personnel,\u201d said a statement by the United Nations peacekeeping department.

The country is nearly lawless, and the government forces are known to be brutal, underpaid and among the most dreaded.But it is rare to have such powerful, graphic evidence of the blas\u00e9 taking of human life.\u201cLook, they are dying,\u201d the soldiers said in Lingala, the language of central Congo, as they blasted the civilians. \u201cWatch how they get killed like animals.\u201dHuman rights activists said that the video was filmed by a Congolese government soldier who was part of the execution squad and that the soldier may have felt bad about what happened and leaked it to assuage his conscience. The camera was right behind the soldiers as they raised their rifles.The soldiers did not even take cover when they opened fire. Analysts said it was clear that the soldiers knew that their targets posed no threat. At least 13 bodies could be seen in the video.A rebel army called the M23 is agitating again in the east, along with several dozen other rebel groups.The commodities-based economy continues to nose-dive.Just this week, the government announced that it did not have the money to hold an election in 2017, after the ruling party agreed a few weeks ago to do just that. Under Congo\u2019s Constitution, Mr. Kabila should not even be in office now. His second and final term was over in December. He is deeply unpopular, increasingly isolated and suspected of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through fraudulent mining deals.\u201cNone of these conflicts are directly related to each other, but they are proliferating around the country because the government is weak and contested,\u201d said Jason Stearns, the director of the Congo Research Group, a research project based at New York University.\u201cThe government is also paranoid, which is why it feels it needs to take a hard line toward any movements,\u201d he added.The video appears to have been filmed within the past 10 days, analysts said, during the government\u2019s military operations to quash the Kamuina Nsapu militia. The militia is an offshoot of a local movement in Kasa\u00ef whose followers have challenged the government over local autonomy. Some of the group\u2019s followers believe in traditional magic.It seems the video was filmed as the government soldiers were approaching about a dozen Kamuina Nsapu followers who were standing together in a rural road, chanting.\u201cThey are not scared to die, so we will show them,\u201d one of the soldiers says.Several of the victims were wearing garlands of leaves. Analysts said they might have believed the leaves \u2014 or the chanting \u2014 would protect them from bullets. That may be one reason the people did not run or dive into the bushes when the first gunshots rang out.\u201cWe are deeply concerned at the reported high number of deaths, which if confirmed would suggest excessive and disproportionate use of force by the soldiers,\u201d the statement said.Lambert Mende, Congo\u2019s information minister, said the video was not filmed in Congo, but possibly another African country, and that it was an attempt by nongovernmental organizations \u201cto destroy the image of the D.R.C.\u201dSteve Wembi contributed reporting from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Kim Jong-nam Killing, a Common Migration Tale Takes a Dark Turn", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNGHIA BINH, Vietnam \u2014 Growing up in this village of rice paddies and banana trees, Doan Thi Huong was known as a gentle girl and a diligent student, her brother said.She left home at 17 to study pharmacology in Hanoi, the capital, and has returned home only about twice a year in the decade since, said her brother, Doan Van Binh. He said that he rarely pressed his sister for details about her life, and did not realize until a few days ago that she had been working in Malaysia.\u201cI only hoped she was well,\u201d Mr. Binh said in an interview on Thursday.But until her life took that bizarre turn, Ms. Huong\u2019s story appears to have been a very familiar one.Ms. Huong\u2019s Facebook page suggests that she led a peripatetic lifestyle, moving between hotel rooms in Cambodia and Malaysia in recent weeks. While stressing that they had no information about Ms. Huong\u2019s particular situation, experts said that Vietnamese women who work as escorts, masseuses, prostitutes and waitresses in Southeast Asia\u2019s wealthier cities, particularly Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, often follow a similar pattern of movement.Ms. Huong\u2019s posts from Malaysia, which showed her smiling coyly in portraits and videos, hardly seemed those of a hardened assassin. Photos showed ice cream, chicken wings and a smiling gray teddy bear propped up on a hotel bed.\u201cLife is food,\u201d Ms. Huong wrote in one post under her alias, Ruby Ruby. \u201cI can eat very much.\u201dNghia Binh, Ms. Huong\u2019s hometown, lies in the Red River Delta, a largely agricultural, densely populated region in northern Vietnam that has severe unemployment. Hundreds of thousands of workers from the delta and other regions have emigrated to Japan, Malaysia, South Korean and Taiwan in recent years.Malaysia hosted nearly 2.5 million international migrants in 2013, according to the United Nations data, making it the largest destination for migrant workers after Thailand in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a group of 10 countries with a combined population of more than 600 million.Many migrants, including tens of thousands of Vietnamese, travel to Malaysia through formal labor contracts that are governed by state quotas and arranged through accredited labor brokerages.But that process can be corrupt, exploitative and expensive, requiring workers to pay thousands of dollars to brokers, experts say. One result is that some immigrants leave their jobs to work in the shadow economy, or bypass formal contracts altogether.Because Vietnamese are permitted to travel without visas in Singapore and Malaysia for 30 days at a time, many Vietnamese escorts and prostitutes travel in a constant loop through the three countries, said Nicolas Lainez, an anthropologist in Singapore with the Paris-based School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences.The lifestyle appeals to them, Mr. Lainez said, because the working schedules offer flexibility as well as a higher income \u2014 from about $700 to $7,000 per month, compared with just a few hundred dollars for a job on a factory assembly line.Ms. Huong\u2019s Facebook photographs and the attached location information indicated that she had visited Malaysia twice this year \u2014 first in early January and again in early February, days before Kim Jong-nam was killed.Her Facebook page, which appears to have been shut down, had shown no sign of Nghia Binh, her hometown. But her father, Doan Van Thanh, said that she visited the village during the Tet holiday that began in late January.Mr. Thanh said that when Ms. Huong arrived, she was short of money and came bearing only one gift: a bonsai plant worth 100,000 Vietnamese dong, or about $5. She also asked her stepmother, Mr. Thanh\u2019s wife, for a loan of 50,000 dong. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me anything about going abroad,\u201d he said.Her brother, Mr. Binh, said that he was still struggling to digest the news that Ms. Huong, who had never been a quarrelsome sibling, was now a murder suspect.\u201cShe loves everyone,\u201d he said, \u201cand everyone loves her.\u201dChau Doan reported from Nghia Binh, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, in Optimistic Address, Asks Congress to End \u2018Trivial Fights\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, in his first address to a joint session of Congress, defended his tumultuous presidency on Tuesday and said he was eager to reach across party lines and put aside \u201ctrivial fights\u201d to help ordinary Americans.He called on Congress to work with him on overhauling health care, changing the tax code and rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure and military.But he raised new questions about his policy priorities and how he plans to achieve them, especially on immigration.But in his speech, Mr. Trump never mentioned legalizing undocumented people and over all held to the tough-on-immigration theme of his campaign.\u201cThe time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides,\u201d the president said at the White House, according to people in attendance who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the meeting.The idea is a sharp break from the crackdown on immigrants in the United States illegally that Mr. Trump ordered in his first weeks in office and the hard-line positions embraced by his core supporters that helped sweep him into the White House.But Mr. Trump made only a glancing reference to an immigration overhaul in his speech, calling for a new \u201cmerit-based\u201d system that would admit only those able to support themselves financially. Over all he took a hard line on immigration, much as he had during the campaign.Times reporters analyzed President Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday and the Democrats\u2019 response, which was delivered by former Gov. Steve Beshear of Kentucky.\u201cAs we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.\u201dBut in contrast with the dark themes of his inaugural address, Mr. Trump\u2019s speech to Congress was a more optimistic vision of America and what he called the promises ahead. The themes were largely Republican orthodoxy, delivered soberly and almost verbatim from a prepared text. Mr. Trump read from Teleprompters and appeared restrained and serious.Republicans interrupted dozens of times with standing ovations, although Democrats mostly sat stone-faced. Mr. Trump presented himself as eager to put aside some of the vitriol of his presidency.\u201cThe time for small thinking is over, the time for trivial fights is behind us,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears.\u201dReporters from The New York Times fact checked President Trump\u2019s first address to Congress.The most emotional moment of the speech came when Mr. Trump recognized Carryn Owens, the widow of William Ryan Owens, a member of a Navy SEAL team who was killed during a commando raid that the president authorized in Yemen. Ms. Owens sobbed as Mr. Trump said, \u201cRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity.\u201dMr. Trump said that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had guaranteed him that it was a \u201chighly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence.\u201d Mr. Trump has been criticized for the raid, including by Mr. Owens\u2019s father, with some arguing the operation was botched. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had blamed Mr. Owens\u2019s death on \u201cthe generals\u201d who oversaw the mission.Although Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has been defined by executive orders and pronouncements, his speech appeared to be an attempt to open a new phase and reflected his need for cooperation from Congress.\u201cMy administration wants to work with members in both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clean water and rebuild our military infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The issues represented by the guests of the first lady, Melania Trump, as well as by representatives and senators at President Trump\u2019s first address to Congress.Mr. Trump laid out the broad outlines of a health care overhaul that papered over divisions among Republicans about how to structure it, calling for a plan that uses tax credits and tax-advantaged savings accounts to help Americans buy insurance, and promising a \u201cstable transition\u201d from the existing system.Yet he made no mention of an array of challenges abroad, including Syria, North Korea and Russia. Nor did Mr. Trump criticize one of his favorite foils, the \u201cfake news\u201d media. He did pledge his full support for NATO after questioning the need for the alliance, and argued that his demands that nations contribute more money to NATO had paid off.\u201cI can tell you that the money is pouring in,\u201d Mr. Trump said without providing examples or specifics. \u201cVery nice.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Trump offered no specifics on his suggestion earlier in the day that he might seek a comprehensive immigration overhaul. Such a move would be a significant turnaround for Mr. Trump, whose campaign rallies rang with shouts of \u201cbuild the wall!\u201d on the Mexican border. In January, he signed an executive order directing the deportation of any unauthorized immigrant who has committed a crime or falsified a document. The standard could apply to virtually any of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally.The White House did not dispute Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks to the anchors, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, said she had not witnessed the conversation and was therefore unable to confirm it.\u201cThe president has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he\u2019s made clear that he\u2019s open to having conversations about that moving forward,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cRight now, his primary focus, as he has made over and over again, is border control and security at the border and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe, and those priorities have not changed.\u201dMr. Trump defended that order in his address to Congress.\u201cIt is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThose given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America \u2014 we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\u201dThe speech reflected the war Mr. Trump is fighting with himself and his inner circle. Even as he held out the possibility of legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants, Melania Trump, the first lady, was hosting the families of victims of violent crime by such immigrants \u2014 a way of highlighting the president\u2019s belief that immigrants who lack legal status pose a grave threat to Americans and should be feared and removed, not embraced.Mr. Trump singled out the victims\u2019 families, saying, \u201cYour loved ones will never be forgotten.\u201dGiving the official Democratic response, former Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky offered an implicit contrast to the president by noting his own humble background and military service, accusing Mr. Trump and his \u201ccabinet of billionaires and Wall Street insiders\u201d of favoring banks and the wealthy over ordinary people.\u201cYou and your Republican allies in Congress seem determined to rip affordable health care away from millions of people who most need it,\u201d Mr. Beshear said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. It\u2019s life and death for people.\u201dFor Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, the president turned to the top advisers who helped develop his inaugural address: Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist. The two were still working on the speech late Monday, aides said.Maggie Haberman, Glenn Thrush and Richard Perez-Pena contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Do Billionaires Have in Common? Big Bucks, and Not Much Else", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat do Larry Ellison and Ingvar Kamprad have in common? They are both billionaires. But that may be one of the few characteristics they share.Billionaires may have enormous spending potential, but they certainly exercise that power differently. Some live lavishly and enjoy being in the headlines, while others live frugally, if not anonymously. There are big spenders and those who give it away.His fellow billionaire Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, bought 74-acre Necker Island in the Caribbean in 1979. It operates as a private luxury resort, with room for 34 adults and six children at about $2,300 each per night. He also bought nearby Mosquito Island in 2007, the site of former President Barack Obama\u2019s recent vacation. Mr. Branson is a serial blogger and Twitter user, sending out inspirational messages about entrepreneurship, conservation, music and travel.Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, is unmistakable on the high seas in his $250 million superyacht, Octopus, which has two helicopter pads, a submarine, a glass-bottom swimming pool and a recording studio, not to mention room for 26 guests. Recently, he has been known to host a celebrity-studded party on Octopus during the Cannes Film Festival. But he has a serious side, too. Mr. Allen last year gave $295 million to brain and cell science, wildlife conservation, global health and climate change.But not all billionaires like to be so obvious. Chuck Feeney, who built an empire of duty-free shops and a multibillion-dollar fortune along the way, has worked since the 1980s to give all that money away, as quietly as possible.Forbes magazine once called him the \u201cJames Bond of philanthropy\u201d for his work through his charity, the Atlantic Philanthropies. The foundation has given away $8 billion to education, science, health care and human rights projects around the world and made its final grant last year. It plans to close for good in 2020.The fact is, most \u201cordinary\u201d billionaires live quietly. \u201cUnlike what the public thinks, the majority of these people come out of the middle class or even poverty,\u201d said Jim Grubman, a clinical psychologist who wrote \u201cStrangers in Paradise,\u201d a book about how people adjust to becoming wealthy.\u201cThe billionaire lifestyle makes for good TV, but below the surface is a much bigger portion of people who are salt-of-the-earth families just concentrating on raising their kids and running their businesses,\u201d said Mr. Grubman, who is a consultant at Cambridge Family Enterprise Group, an adviser to wealthy families.Asia is an active area of billionaire creation, with one person reaching that threshold every three days, according to a study released in October by UBS and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.Asia\u2019s two richest men are Jack Ma, founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, with a $26 billion net worth, and Wang Jianlin, a real estate mogul with $29 billion to his name who also holds stakes in a Spanish soccer club and the Hollywood film production company Legendary Entertainment.In 2015, The Economist reported on the party Mr. Wang held to celebrate his deal to buy Infront Sports & Media, which has marketing rights to World Cup soccer. The magazine said that Mr. Wang favored \u201cprivate jets and flashy yachts (he owns Sunseeker, the British maker of the sleek craft seen in James Bond films),\u201d and that the party featured strobe lights, disco music and leggy beauties.In the winter, many flock to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland; the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah; and New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations on St. Barts, where people can rent their own eight-bedroom beachfront villa for $420,000 a week.In the summer, some of the richest flock to Britain for the Henley Royal Regatta, the Royal Ascot horse races, and Wimbledon, where a center-court season ticket at the men\u2019s championship final this year has a market value of $3,300.So far, 156 billionaires and their families have committed to the cause, according to the profiles listed on the pledge\u2019s website. The group also includes the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, his wife, Priscilla Chan, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk and the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Opposition to Trump Propelled by Employees, Not Executives", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late September, a group of tech leaders started a well-publicized effort to raise $100,000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324.For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent.No longer.Nearly 100 technology companies said that President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries would violate both immigration law and the United States Constitution.\u201cSilicon Valley is stepping up,\u201d said Sam Altman, who runs the valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, Y Combinator. \u201cThe companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don\u2019t support.\u201dIt is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable \u2014 not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.\u201cPeople voted with their feet, and Travis listened,\u201d said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. \u201cWe need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.\u201dResistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a voice with the president if you didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.\u201dWhen President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, he upended the fates of people who had waited for years to get into the U.S. Here are portraits of those affected by the ban.Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,\u201d said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey all have the same leanings.\u201dMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google\u2019s former slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is the most forceful expression of this.\u201cIf you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,\u201d Mr. Shotts said.Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards,\u201d and saying it would create \u201cmuch collateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dThe immigration battle is in Microsoft\u2019s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\u201cIn 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,\u201d said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. \u201cThe most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.\u201dMr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous \u201cfor the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren\u2019t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can\u2019t fix the monetization of fake news.\u201dPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.\u201cI\u2019ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,\u201d said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.He talked about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which asks women, \u201cWhat would you do if you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201d Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women\u2019s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.\u201cWe have to protest in public,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "As Trump Vows Building Splurge, Famed Traffic Choke Point Offers Warning", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBREEZEWOOD, Pa. \u2014 Millions of people who travel between the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest each year fight through Breezewood, Pa., a strange gap in the Interstate System. A leg of Route I-70 brings drivers north from Washington and Baltimore to plug into the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the great road network that runs west to the heartland cities of Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Chicago.She is not alone. Many other drivers vent similar \u2014 often profane \u2014 anger and confusion about this notorious choke point. As a Washingtonian from northern Indiana who transits Breezewood for family visits, I have often wondered the same thing \u2014 a question that became more galling after my younger son, jolted by our sudden deceleration into the area\u2019s stop-and-go traffic, threw up all over the back seat.The answer lies at the intersection of politics and transportation policy. At a time when President Trump wants to spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure, the story of Breezewood offers a vivid case study in governance over such projects. It shows how legal quirks, powerful politicians and opaque bureaucratic procedures can influence decisions about how to spend taxpayer dollars.One result is what critics call the preservation of an inefficiency that benefits a few while imposing widely dispersed costs on many.I admit I have become a little obsessed with Breezewood, which sent me on a journey into its history.To get around that law, planners built the loop through Breezewood, giving drivers the theoretical option of avoiding the turnpike.Decades later, the social and environmental costs of this arrangement have swollen. I asked the American Transportation Research Institute, which studies congestion using data from GPS trackers on freight trucks, to scrutinize Breezewood. The institute estimates that about 1.5 million trucks make the connection through Breezewood each year. The same methodology suggests that about 3.5 million passenger vehicles do, too.His family\u2019s businesses alone employ about 200 people, he said, and his family has taken out millions of dollars in loans to upgrade facilities they cannot move elsewhere. He called the prospect of a bypass a \u201csword of Damocles\u201d hanging over Breezewood.\u201cAny second, someone could come in and say, \u2018Time\u2019s up, the faucet is turned off, no more business is going to be coming off that road,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bittner said in an interview. \u201cAnd then what do I tell the bank? How do I pay the loan off? How do I keep employing people? Where do they find jobs?\u201d\u201cThe ideal solution would have been to build a direct connection a quarter-mile down the road,\u201d Mr. Dawida said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do that, but at least they did something.\u201d Nevertheless, he said, when he goes to the beach each year, \u201cI psychologically still can\u2019t stop in Breezewood. I can\u2019t.\u201dProposals for a Breezewood bypass \u2014 salted with phrases like \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201cextreme congestion\u201d and \u201chas been a nightmare for 50 yrs\u201d \u2014 rolled in. Yet when the state finished the plan last August, it had no proposal for ramps connecting the turnpike and the Interstate. Instead, it called for resurfacing Breezewood\u2019s roads.At each stage, officials said, projects are reprioritized or removed, but rarely, if ever, added to the list. People mind their own areas rather than telling others what to do.So, for a bypass to be considered, essentially Breezewood\u2019s own Bedford County must propose it. Will it choose to damage its own economy?The question answers itself.\u201cIt\u2019s just not an issue that really appears on the radar for us,\u201d said Donald Schwartz, the Bedford County planning director. \u201cIt\u2019s just not anything of a priority that\u2019s been brought up through my office since I\u2019ve been here, these five years.\u201dAnd that was that.As I was finishing my research, I found Ms. Wonderlick\u2019s Twitter post questioning why Breezewood exists, found her phone number and called her with the answer. She said she was glad to learn it. But as she contemplated many more years of slogging through Breezewood on family drives to Milwaukee, she sounded disappointed that no amount of infrastructure spending appears likely to fix it.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that it is designed, and still exists, as a tourist trap,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they want to protect the interest of the town, and I very much understand that. But I do think it would be interesting for them to think about the needs of all the travelers and truckers who go through that area.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Misunderstood Genius of Russell Westbrook", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "FeatureFollowing the departure of his superstar teammate, Russell Westbrook was left to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder all by himself. That\u2019s when something special happened.Supported byNow, in Philadelphia, in front of the ushers and ball boys, Westbrook practiced his cotton shot. He backed up almost to half-court, squared his huge shoulders, dipped, charged, stopped, rose, fired \u2014 and missed. He backed up and tried again. Again he missed.It was only warm-ups, but everything surrounding Westbrook in that moment seemed historic, and the misses struck me as a bad sign. I watched him shoot 11 times from the same spot and make only three. At one point, he missed five in a row. Russell Westbrook was cold. The cotton shot, at a very inconvenient moment, seemed to have turned to iron.As season openers go, this game was unusually loaded with expectations. It was a sort of Independence Day: the first game of Westbrook\u2019s professional career without Kevin Durant as his teammate. For eight seasons, Westbrook and Durant were one of the great inscrutable duos in all of sports, superstars with wildly opposing personalities and playing styles, overachieving together in Oklahoma City, one of the smallest markets in the N.B.A. Durant was basketball\u2019s greatest prodigy since LeBron James, a mild-mannered, long-limbed scoring genius with a baby face and a golden jump shot. Westbrook was the scowling underdog on a never-ending mission to prove the entire universe wrong.On the scale of creative tension, Westbrook-Durant fell somewhere between Lennon-McCartney and Goofus-Gallant. They clashed and blended, encouraged and diminished one another, in ways that were hard to parse. Durant led the league in scoring; Westbrook led the league in turnovers. Durant was the metronome; Westbrook the guitar solo. Durant was the scenic cliff; Westbrook the waterfall raging primally over the top of it. Occasionally, TV cameras would catch the two of them squabbling during a timeout, but they always appeared at the media table together afterward to insist that they were friends and brothers. Durant once called Westbrook his \u201chype man\u201d \u2014 the Flavor Flav to his Chuck D. The whole relationship was a puzzle. Were they real friends, work friends, secret rivals, frenemies, secret real-world frenemies? On sports TV, Westbrook and Durant inspired as much talking-head bloviation as a celebrity affair.The most surprising thing about the partnership, however, was how well it worked. Westbrook and Durant turned the Oklahoma City Thunder, against all odds, into one of the reigning powers in the N.B.A. In 2012, when both stars were still only 23 \u2014 an age at which most players are just beginning to find their footing \u2014 the Thunder made it all the way to the finals. In a six-year span, they reached the Western Conference finals four times. (It took major injuries to keep them out.) The only thing Durant and Westbrook never did together was win a championship. They came agonizingly close, including last season, when they held a 3-1 lead in the playoffs against the mighty Golden State Warriors. But they never could quite push over the top. Still, it seemed inevitable that their day would eventually come.Until last July, when Durant blew everyone\u2019s minds by leaving Westbrook, suddenly and gracelessly, to join the aforementioned Warriors, making their superteam even more super. Just like that, Westbrook was on his own. The hype man was out front. And anyone who knew anything about basketball was dying to see what would happen next. It seemed less like a question of sports than a Zen koan: What is the sound of one hand clapping?If anyone could answer that, could explore its full range of sonic possibilities, it was Russell Westbrook. The sound might be wonderful or terrible, or wonderfully terrible, or it might be nothing at all. The only certainty was that we were all about to hear it, at maximum volume, for an entire season.\u201cHe scared!\u201d the people behind me kept screaming.This storm of negativity triggered one of those Westbrook moments when he seems to pop out of space-time. Off a Sixers turnover, Westbrook took the ball near half-court, charged toward the rim, drew a hard foul and still somehow exploded forward, twisting between two defenders, to toss in a layup from a steep angle. He stood there for a second after the whistle, berating the crowd. A courtside fan \u2014 a bespectacled white man in a bulging Allen Iverson jersey \u2014 screamed back at Westbrook and flipped him off with both hands.Westbrook\u2019s face, in happy moments, is smooth and boyish, with deep dimples and a classic beauty mark on his cheek; his facial hair grows in tiny sparse wisps that suggest an eighth grader who hasn\u2019t yet learned how to shave. (Westbrook claims that he has never actually shaved.) But now his sweet face changed. The bright, round eyes narrowed and darkened; the lips twisted into a sneer. Westbrook, when he needs it, has weapons-grade powers of stinkface, and he unleashed their full nuclear payload on the fan. He pointed him out to the referees in disgusted disbelief. Security came to escort the man away. Westbrook was still shaking his head in fury as he stepped up to make the free throw, and on the next few possessions he seemed lit up by anger, driving and passing and scoring so relentlessly that the fans behind me stopped taunting him and grew quiet, then started complaining about the man in the Iverson jersey, asking why the hell he had thought it was a good idea to antagonize Westbrook in the first place. Animated by rage, Westbrook carried his team, and by halftime the score was tied. Westbrook walked off the floor cursing fiercely.With just under three minutes left and the Thunder trailing by 3 points, Westbrook dribbled hard at the basket and, without any apparent shadow of self-doubt, stopped to rise for a pull-up jumper \u2014 precisely the shot I had watched him clank so many times before the game. Now, however, he made it, and then with around a minute left he did it again, giving the Thunder the lead, and in the end, as the crowd gurgled on its own disappointment, the Thunder won by 6 points. Westbrook\u2019s final stat line was dangerously overstuffed: 32 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists. He should probably have had closer to 15 assists, but that stat depends largely on the skill of the players around you, and with this group, nine seemed like a minor miracle.After the game, Westbrook sat at his locker wearing only a towel, with the veins bulging out of his legs so hard he looked like a map of the human circulatory system. (Joe Sharpe, the Thunder\u2019s head trainer, told me that Westbrook could probably be a bodybuilder if he wanted to.) Slowly, while the media watched in silence, Westbrook started getting dressed. He put on underwear covered with the words \u201cWhy Not?\u201d \u2014 Westbrook\u2019s personal slogan, which he invokes to justify everything from his fashion choices to his shot selection. (As he tweeted once, apropos of nothing: \u201cWHYNOT?!!! #whynot #whynot\u201d) He pulled on a pair of skinny black jeans, ripped at the knees, then a bright yellow sweatshirt that said, on the front, \u201cParanormal: Out of the Ordinary.\u201d Over this he put on a denim jacket.It was, I thought, an interesting outfit.But there was one more piece, and it was the coup de gr\u00e2ce: Over his jeans, Westbrook pulled on a kilt.He rubbed some Vaseline on his face and turned to face the media for an official round of questions. As usual, he spoke to the reporters without ever looking at them. It was as if he were being interviewed by the locker-room door, with which he maintained fierce eye contact, with occasional follow-up questions from the ceiling tiles or the carpet.Why are you wearing a kilt? someone asked.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Westbrook said.And so began life after Kevin Durant.Triple-doubles are difficult and rare. You don\u2019t stumble into one \u2014 it takes a special kind of player, a dominant generalist. Even the outliers capable of achieving them tend to get only a handful per year; Magic Johnson, the modern king of the stat, got 18 in his best season. A triple-double is not a statistical parlor trick, like hitting for the cycle in baseball. It actually captures the essence of basketball, the way the game allows every player to do everything on the floor whenever the opportunity arises. To get a triple-double, a player has to control the action physically, strategically and socially; he has to become a funnel through which the energy of an entire game pours.Westbrook has always had the potential to ring up triple-doubles, and in past seasons he has put together impressive flurries of them. This season, he has gone bananas. Some games, it feels as if Westbrook\u2019s stats are moving in fast-forward \u2014 as if he is pulling numbers out of wormholes that only he can access. One night, Westbrook generated 10 assists in only 15 minutes; another, he finished with 26 points, 11 rebounds and 22 assists \u2014 totals not seen since Johnson himself. For years, the popular narrative stressed how much Durant was sacrificing to fit in next to Westbrook. It has become clear that the opposite was certainly just as true.When Durant left last summer, some fans speculated that Westbrook might have a chance to pull this madness off. Rational people, myself included, responded with scornful laughter. It was absurd, particularly for a player who was only 6-foot-3 and surrounded by mediocre shooters. To actually average a triple-double would be not only historic and impressive but also a little weird, almost disturbing.But this is where we have to take into account Russell Westbrook\u2019s personality.\u201cHe\u2019s a different dude,\u201d Anthony Morrow, a Thunder shooting guard, told me.\u201cHe\u2019s weird, yeah,\u201d Steven Adams said. He paused. \u201cBizarre.\u201d He paused again. \u201cNot normal.\u201dWestbrook is not merely a superelite athlete (he is commonly referred to as the most athletic player in the N.B.A.); he also has a highly unusual mind. He is moody, stubborn, loyal and fiercely private, a control freak and a perfectionist. Outside a very small circle of family and friends, he refuses to be known. The triple-doubles, their sheer unreasonableness, are as much a reflection of this personality as of any particular basketball skills. Each time he registers one it is like a signal \u2014 a ping from the sealed box of his private mind.\u201cPlayer?\u201d he said. \u201cPlayer!?\u201d It was as if he had never thought of his father that way before. \u201cMan, they argued the whole time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I remember most. They played for five minutes and argued for 40 minutes. All day.\u201dWestbrook\u2019s father was strict and devoted, determined above all to keep his family out of the way of trouble. When Westbrook showed an interest in basketball, his father devised endless drills that they ran through, just the two of them, for hours at a time. They focused on the midrange jumper, the cotton shot, practicing it off one foot and two feet, on the move and standing still. Westbrook learned to identify all the possible ways you can mess the shot up: being off balance, moving too fast, not having your feet set. \u201cA lot of times, I make it when those things are not right,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all my dad. That\u2019s all him and myself, basically.\u201dWestbrook constantly invokes his family \u2014 his parents, his brother, his wife \u2014 to explain why he is the way he is, but he won\u2019t allow reporters to talk to them. When I asked if I could speak with his father or brother, he told me he would ask his mother instead \u2014 and then added, immediately: \u201cMy mom never talks. She never talks. She doesn\u2019t like to talk.\u201d (I never spoke with her.)As a high school player, Westbrook was spectacularly unheralded. He was the shortest kid on his team, not even able to dunk until his senior year. Although he already possessed most of the qualities that would eventually make him great \u2014 the crazy speed and fearlessness, the motor that never stopped \u2014 basketball was fundamentally a game of size, and Westbrook didn\u2019t have it. A lifetime of arguing on playgrounds looked as if it might be his best case.Then came a miraculous growth spurt. Toward the end of high school, Westbrook shot up seven inches, from 5-foot-8 to 6-foot-3. Suddenly, all his intangible gifts were attached to formidable size. Westbrook was still not an elite recruit \u2014 it was too late for that \u2014 but he was good enough to earn a last-minute scholarship to U.C.L.A. after one of its star players declared unexpectedly for the N.B.A. draft. Westbrook was a bench player, a defensive specialist; his job was to enter the game and wreak havoc. During his freshman year, he averaged only nine minutes and 3 points a game. That same year, at the University of Texas, the freshman Kevin Durant was playing 36 minutes a game and averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds \u2014 by many reckonings, the greatest freshman year in N.C.A.A. basketball history.During his sophomore year, Westbrook played more of a central role at U.C.L.A., and his powerful dunks made him a hero of ESPN highlight reels. Still, no one was in danger of confusing him with Kevin Durant, who was by then winning N.B.A. Rookie of the Year. Westbrook\u2019s second-year averages remained relatively modest \u2014 13 points, four assists, four rebounds \u2014 but it was enough to entice the Seattle SuperSonics (soon to be, scandalously, the Oklahoma City Thunder) to take him in the 2008 N.B.A. draft. They picked him fourth, a position almost everyone else thought was a serious reach. As a Seattle Times columnist put it the day after the draft: \u201cEquipped with two first-round picks, they came away with Westbrook and Serge Ibaka. That\u2019s like getting two free airline tickets and booking trips to Gary, Ind., and Kosovo.\u201d No one was more surprised on draft night than Westbrook himself, who was afraid he wasn\u2019t going to be picked at all. \u201cI was like: Damn, am I gonna be the only one left in the greenroom?\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is about to be embarrassing.\u201dIn theory, in the beginning, Westbrook and Durant seemed like a perfectly complementary pair: the scrappy defensive specialist next to the once-in-a-generation scorer. Westbrook could defer to Durant on offense and cover his shortcomings on defense. Instead, Westbrook took over the team.He had few of the skills that defined a traditional point guard: panoramic vision, flawless ball-handling, a deadly outside shot. But his personality was more suited to leading than Durant\u2019s was. This, in fact, was a major part of why the team drafted Westbrook, for his unique psychological profile: his ability to withstand crushing stress and pressure and doubt without losing confidence or focus. Many of Westbrook\u2019s elite skills were mental, and he would need them right away. The Thunder started his rookie season 3-29, and there were serious debates about whether they were the worst team ever. Westbrook led the league in turnovers, and the team\u2019s ownership was widely reviled for stealing the franchise from Seattle. Even when the Thunder\u2019s fortunes changed the following season, when they made the playoffs and almost beat the world-champion Lakers, and then the following season, when Westbrook averaged 22 points a game and became an All-Star and the team made it all the way to the Western Conference finals \u2014 even then, it wasn\u2019t particularly easy. A narrative was beginning to develop: Westbrook was a volatile, reckless ball hog, an inferior player who refused to defer to the clearly superior Durant.Early on, Cheeks and other coaches bullied Westbrook around the floor while he dribbled to improve his ball-handling. When Westbrook had emotional outbursts in the middle of games, Cheeks was the one to talk him down. They still work together early every morning: Westbrook is always the first player to the gym, hours before practice starts, and he will pull Cheeks out of the morning coaches\u2019 meeting so they can run through shooting and post moves.\u201cHe\u2019s a driven man,\u201d Cheeks told me. \u201cHe\u2019s a very disciplined person. Never late, always on time.\u201dI asked Cheeks if he\u2019d ever been around a player like Westbrook.\u201cI \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know many with that explosiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cThe power and the speed.\u201dWhat about Barkley? Or Allen Iverson?\u201cCharles was powerful, but he didn\u2019t have the speed of this guy,\u201d Cheeks said. \u201cIverson\u2019s a good name. He played like that \u2014 that same ferociousness, same competitive drive.\u201dBut Iverson, infamously, was not a fan of practice, and Westbrook treats every practice as if it\u2019s Game 7 of a playoff series. This is something that surprised Billy Donovan, the Thunder\u2019s head coach, when he joined the organization last season. Even at the beginning of a morning walk-through, when the coaches were just trying to get everyone loosened up, Westbrook would take his first touch of the ball and explode as if he\u2019d been shot out of a cannon to throw down a tomahawk dunk. He is like this always. \u201cWe play 82 games,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThere are gonna be nights when your team just doesn\u2019t have it. Four games in five nights, you\u2019re tired, you\u2019re beaten down, it\u2019s a long trip, there\u2019s flight issues. Russell is so unique that it doesn\u2019t happen to him. It\u2019s nuts.\u201dThe answer is: Several, but only Russell Westbrook has been unreasonable enough to do it in consecutive years. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough to relax and be cool,\u201d Westbrook told me. \u201cJust be chillin\u2019 and be cool.\u201dI asked Semaj Christon, one of the Thunder\u2019s backup point guards, what it was like to guard Westbrook in practice every day.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not fun,\u201d Anthony Morrow told me. \u201cI done seen him literally hurt people, on offense, and it\u2019s not an offensive foul.\u201dIn the swirling cloud of contradiction that surrounds Westbrook, one paradox stands out. He often looks, on the court, like a force of pure chaos: a wild, petulant, fire-breathing hothead. And yet he is also, especially in his personal life, relentlessly devoted to order and control. He builds his days around a series of inflexible routines: calls to his parents, a designated parking spot, morning shooting on Court 3. He expects every room to be neat and clean, at work and at home.Before games, Westbrook always eats a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, and it must be prepared just so: bread cut on a diagonal, fillings spread very thin. (In Oklahoma, the team chefs know exactly how to do it, but on the road Westbrook can\u2019t trust anyone, so he makes it himself.) Three hours before tipoff, Westbrook warms up; at T-minus-60 minutes he goes to chapel. When the pregame countdown clock hits precisely 6:17 \u2014 never a second more or less \u2014 Westbrook leaps off the Thunder\u2019s bench and screams, \u201cTwo lines,\u201d initiating the team\u2019s final layup drill. I asked Westbrook if there was some kind of numerology behind this \u2014 a June 17 birthday, a favorite Bible verse. \u201cNo particular reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI just do it. Nothing special.\u201dWestbrook is unbelievably attuned to the tiniest details of his shoes. He has his own personal rack at the practice facility. \u201cMost guys, I can just bring a pair of shoes,\u201d the Thunder\u2019s equipment manager, Wilson Taylor, told me. \u201cRussell wants a certain pair. He knows which are for games, which are for practice. He determines which shoes are coming on a road trip.\u201d When Nike sent Westbrook its latest model, the Jordan 31, he wasn\u2019t happy with the sole flexibility, so he asked the company to build him a special hybrid using the previous model\u2019s sole. Even in that custom shoe, however, the insoles aren\u2019t thick enough for Westbrook, so Taylor replaces each of them by hand.On the court, what looks like madness is often deliberate. Westbrook is obsessive about studying film. He insists on knowing every play from every position. Steven Adams told me that Westbrook occasionally wakes him up in the middle of the night, on the team plane, to show him an angle he might have missed. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie, bud,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWatching video, especially after a game, at like 2 in the morning \u2014 it\u2019s rather hard to stay up. He maintains the same focus. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dEveryone had stories like these. I got the feeling that Westbrook\u2019s personality, the sheer intensity of his presence, is an energy field that seeps into every square centimeter of the Thunder organization. When Westbrook is around, everyone is aware of him, and he is never not around. Players arrive at the gym in the morning to find Westbrook already there. Sometimes they come in at night to put up extra shots, and Westbrook will already be there again, in the weight room, working out. You can begin to imagine how Kevin Durant, a talent with equal or greater claim to the organization but not nearly Westbrook\u2019s force of personality, might have been driven to look for his own space elsewhere.Although everyone who works with Westbrook gushes about him endlessly \u2014 he is loyal and generous and as real as a human could ever possibly be, they say \u2014 he also has a talent for keeping the people around him slightly on edge. He has a foulmouthed, teasing charm, and a formidableness that makes people think twice, and often a third and fourth time, before mentioning something they\u2019re not sure he\u2019ll like. Perhaps this tension is another way Westbrook has found to maintain focus, in himself and in others \u2014 the social equivalent of grinding a blade across a rough stone to keep it sharp.He shut down questions with ruthless efficiency. The P.R. staff had mentioned to me that Westbrook was famous in the organization for giving everyone nicknames: Alfalfa, Ace Ventura, Snakes on a Plane. I asked him what nicknames he\u2019d given his teammates.\u201cThose are my secrets,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t let out secrets.\u201dThe most revealing thing took place afterward, when Westbrook went into the P.R. office to banter with the staff. He sat down to look over a stack of contracts. (Westbrook handles most of his own business; he often sits in the back of the practice facility to pay his bills.) He admired a new addition to the room \u2014 a big, free-standing, color-coded season schedule \u2014 and asked the P.R. guys if he could have it. They said no, they were using it to plan the season, but they would be happy to get another one printed out especially for him. Westbrook asked why he couldn\u2019t just take this one right now, and then they could get another schedule printed for themselves. That way he wouldn\u2019t have to wait. He was the player, he said. Shouldn\u2019t he have priority?Even in the middle of the P.R. office, in other words, Westbrook was having a P.R. problem. He was being a jerk. Watching this performance in person, however, even immediately after my unsuccessful interview, I could see why everyone liked him anyway. Westbrook wasn\u2019t only a jerk, or at least not uncomplicatedly a jerk. By traditional social standards, saying the things Westbrook was saying is bad manners. But that\u2019s in the same way that, by traditional basketball standards, it\u2019s a bad idea to charge into a one-on-four fast break and pull up for a contested free-throw-line jumper. He was a social gambler as well as a basketball gambler, one of those people who know how to play on the line between charisma and rudeness, teasing and affection, especially among people he likes.Westbrook started to sign his stack of documents. He held the pen in his left hand.\u201cLittle-known fact about Russell,\u201d one of the P.R. guys said to me. \u201cHe shoots with his right hand, it says he\u2019s right-handed in the media guide, but he writes with his left.\u201dWestbrook\u2019s head snapped up. He looked straight at me, where I was leaning against the door frame.\u201cDon\u2019t put that in your article,\u201d he said.I told him we could make a deal: I would keep it out of my article if he would tell me one of his teammates\u2019 nicknames.\u201cYou don\u2019t get to bargain with me,\u201d Westbrook said \u2014 and then he added a curse word with so much venom it made me laugh out loud. He went back to signing papers with his left hand.Rebounding has always been one of Westbrook\u2019s superpowers. He is athletic enough to leap through vast spaces, strong enough to bully people in close combat and, most important, persistent enough to get himself, with unholy urgency, to the places around the rim most likely to yield rebounds. I have seen Westbrook streak in from a distant corner of the floor to tip in a missed 3-pointer off the glass \u2014 a hurtling, perfectly timed run that looked almost like a center fielder\u2019s sprinting back to leap and steal a home run just as it cleared the wall.In the end, every rebound comes down to one small coordinate somewhere near the basket: a grapefruit of space that materializes suddenly, unpredictably, and then disappears in a second, almost like the golden snitch in quidditch. Westbrook is frighteningly good at getting to that elusive point before anyone else, almost regardless of his starting position, and making it his own. He owns the grapefruit of space.\u201cSome of these rebounds over power forwards and centers \u2014 that\u2019s will,\u201d Morrow told me. \u201cYou see it in his eyes. It\u2019s just a level of focus and will that I have never seen before. Never. Nobody. I\u2019ve been around a lot of focused dudes, but to be consistently like that \u2014 that\u2019s crazy.\u201dAt Madison Square Garden, Westbrook needed 11 rebounds to cross the sacred threshold, and started with the Knicks\u2019 first shot: It came off the back of the rim, and Westbrook casually took it out of the air with his left hand. Three minutes later, a 3-pointer rattled in and out and popped directly into Westbrook\u2019s hands. The ball seemed to seek him out, over and over, and when it didn\u2019t, he was perfectly willing to go out of his way to get it. In the second quarter, Westbrook rained down a storm of stats on the Knicks that included a series of crucial and difficult rebounds, several of which looked even more impressive because they came at the expense of Kristaps Porzingis, New York\u2019s gigantic young center, who at 7-foot-3 is a full foot taller than Westbrook. Twice, Porzingis blocked Westbrook\u2019s shot only to see Westbrook end up with the ball; another time, Westbrook sprang off both feet and violently snatched a rebound out of Porzingis\u2019s very high hands.By the end of the first half, Westbrook had already collected nine rebounds and was on the brink of a triple-double, which Knicks fans were openly cheering for him to get. The triple-double arrived 79 seconds into the second half, at which point the journalists around me started tweeting furiously that, at only 20 minutes of game action, it was the fastest triple-double of the modern era \u2014 until the Thunder P.R. staff pointed out that, as a matter of fact, Westbrook did one the previous year in under 18 minutes. (Westbrook now holds the second-, third- and fourth-fastest triple-doubles in N.B.A. history.)Even with his triple-double secured, Westbrook would not stop rebounding. My favorite of the night was his 14th: he drove, drew three defenders, passed to a teammate for a wide-open jump shot and ended up deep out of bounds. Instead of just hanging out there, admiring his handiwork, Westbrook turned, tracked the shot with his eyes, saw that it was falling short and, at precisely the moment the ball hit the front of the rim, exploded into the air with shocking intensity. It did not look like a normal professional basketball player trying to get his hand on a ball to extend a possession late in the third quarter of the 19th game of the season. It looked like a man in the middle of a winner-takes-all dunk contest against the Devil himself to prevent the incineration of planet Earth. It looked as if Westbrook were insulted by the very concept of distance, and so he annihilated it, soaring and spearing the ball out of the air from between two waiting Knicks. Spike Lee, courtside, was standing to celebrate the initial missed shot, but when Westbrook came flying in to seize it, he clutched his head in exasperation and hopelessness and despair.By the time the game ended, Westbrook had 27 points, 14 assists and 17 rebounds \u2014 far more than he needed. He was officially averaging a triple-double, and then some.This came in the middle of what would turn out to be a streak of seven straight games with triple-doubles \u2014 a feat so outrageous it was last done by Michael Jordan in 1989. Westbrook and his numbers became a leaguewide spectacle. A few weeks later, after hundreds of questions about it, Westbrook expressed annoyance at the whole phenomenon.\u201cHonestly, man,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cthis triple-double thing is kind of getting on my nerves. People think if I don\u2019t get it, it\u2019s like a big thing. When I do get it, it\u2019s a thing.\u201d He added, \u201cFor the 100th time, I don\u2019t care.\u201dBut this of course was hard to believe, because Westbrook cares about everything.Open, closed, open, closed.Eventually, a line of third graders formed, and Westbrook prepared himself by stockpiling, methodically in his left hand, a supply of bookmarks and bracelets, which he would hand to the kids as they came through. One by one, the students walked to the bus door. When they saw Westbrook sitting at the top of the stairs, they were variously awed or thrilled or confused or stoic.\u201cAre you really Russell Westbrook?\u201d a little boy asked him.\u201cYes,\u201d Westbrook said.\u201cI met you at a gas station before!\u201d one girl said.\u201cI was at the game last night!\u201d another said.\u201cI was, too!\u201d Westbrook answered.He directed the third graders toward their favorite reading: Captain Underpants, Goosebumps, Bunnicula, Bad Kitty. (The Thunder\u2019s backup point guard, Semaj Christon, was in the back, helping them find specific books.) \u201cHave fun in school,\u201d Westbrook told everyone as they left the bus.Midway through the session, a boy stepped onto the Book Bus with one of his shoelaces dragging behind him.Westbrook looked down at the floor.\u201cTie your shoe, man,\u201d he said.The boy looked down, too, then kept walking to the back of the bus and picked a book.When the boy re-emerged, Westbrook handed him a bracelet and a bookmark.\u201cHave fun in school,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd tie your shoe up.\u201dThe boy walked off the bus, shoelace still flopping around.\u201cDon\u2019t forget to tie your shoe!\u201d Westbrook shouted out the door.From that point on in his Book Bus session, Westbrook\u2019s focus was locked onto the children\u2019s shoelaces, a strangely high percentage of which seemed to be loose. \u201cYour shoe is loose,\u201d Westbrook would say as a child walked onto the bus. \u201cTie your shoe up.\u201d He was cheerful but firm; he seemed genuinely concerned. Dozens of kids passed through the bus, and Westbrook scrutinized each of their shoes, and not a single loose lace was allowed to pass without comment. Over and over, he told the kids to tie their shoes. Even when the laces were not all the way untied, just trending in that direction, Westbrook pointed it out: \u201cTie your shoes up.\u201d It was as if he had identified a public safety epidemic that he was single-handedly going to fix, one child at a time.One boy stepped onto the bus with both of his shoes intentionally untied, laces dragging like catfish whiskers.\u201cYou like to wear your shoes like that, huh?\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I used to do, so I get it. But you gotta tuck \u2019em in.\u201d And before the boy could go back and get his book, Westbrook actually knelt down on the floor of the bus and tucked the boy\u2019s shoelaces into the sides of his shoes.After a while, the Book Bus session ended, and the kids and the players took a photo together outside, and then all the kids returned to their classrooms, laces safely snug on their feet, and Russell Westbrook drove off in a white Cadillac sedan, flexing his mind-muscle on other problems.The departure last summer of Kevin Durant \u2014 a pillar of stability for almost 10 years, a player who had talked all his career about how he wanted to stay with the Thunder forever \u2014 was magnified, for locals, by the knowledge of this history. This is what happens in OKC. Talented people leave, dreams die, booms go bust. Especially when things seem to be at their best, everything tends to fall apart.After Durant left, there was endless speculation that Westbrook would leave, too, and it would have been hard to blame him if he had. Looking around the league, Westbrook would have seen almost nothing but bigger cities with stronger teams and better restaurants and livelier fashion scenes \u2014 any one of which would have bent over backward for the chance to add him to its mix. Instead, Westbrook signed a contract extension to stay in Oklahoma. It was, in some ways, a crazy choice, unreasonable on many levels, which made it of course the perfect Westbrook thing to do.Westbrook once told me that growing up in Los Angeles, he had no idea Oklahoma City even existed. And yet he has become, in his odd balance of chaos and control, his volatile lurching toward greatness, a sort of human embodiment of the place. Westbrook was already beloved in OKC, but his decision to stay turned him into a legend. The city was hung with banners saying \u201cWHY NOT?\u201d and the tallest skyscraper lit up with Westbrook\u2019s name: \u201cTHANK YOU RUSS.\u201d\u201cThere are people in Oklahoma City who hold themselves differently because of Russell Westbrook,\u201d Sam Presti, the Thunder\u2019s general manager, told me. \u201cI mean that literally. They stand up straighter. People, not necessarily athletes, draw confidence from him and his disregard for the judgment or labeling from others. I\u2019m confident that there are a lot of people in this city that go into job interviews saying to themselves: \u2018Come on, you\u2019ve got this \u2014 be Westbrook, think Westbrook.\u2019 And that might actually help them get the job, and if they don\u2019t, they walk out feeling sorry for the person that missed the opportunity to hire them.\u201dThis is the lesson of Russell Westbrook. In a deeply imperfect world \u2014 a world where a shooting touch will suddenly abandon you at the worst possible moment, where your teammates might not be good enough to make a win possible, where an economy might suddenly collapse for no apparent reason, where the decency of strangers cannot be presumed \u2014 in a world like that, Westbrook\u2019s approach to life might actually be the most rational one. You control the things you can control (family, daily routines, the occasional big choice) and outside that you fling yourself with wild abandon, every day, at every object that seems worthy of pursuit. In the absence of guarantees, in the absence of certainty, in the new American volatility, we can bank on only one thing: total presence, total sincerity, total effort, all the time. That is the sound of one hand clapping.Westbrook\u2019s critics have been very loud for many years. They are quieter today, but they\u2019re still out there, disputing the magnitude of his triple-doubles by pointing to his high turnover rate and his low shooting percentage, his inefficiencies, his mistakes. But, as Billy Donovan, the Thunder\u2019s head coach, told me, this is missing the point. \u201cBefore you go to the criticism,\u201d Donovan said, \u201cyou have to understand Russell Westbrook. The No. 1 thing for him is how hard he competes. It starts there. That doesn\u2019t mean he plays a perfect game, doesn\u2019t mean that he never turns the ball over, doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t miss a defensive assignment. But when the ball is loose on the glass or on the floor, when it requires energy and passion and fire \u2014 Russell is bringing that. So many players live with regret: They could have done a little bit more, been more committed, worked harder. I think he\u2019s going to have a great level of peace when his time is done. He\u2019s going to be able to move on with his life. He\u2019s going to have peace in his heart.\u201dAnd the second half of the season may actually be better. Westbrook\u2019s self-mythology \u2014 his belief that he is an underdog \u2014 was no doubt stoked last month when he learned that, despite all his exorbitant numbers, despite his decision to stay in Oklahoma, despite the game-winning shots and the surprising success of his relatively untalented team, he was not chosen to start in this year\u2019s All-Star Game. His spot was taken by a player more popular with N.B.A. fans, the ever-sunny Steph Curry \u2014 Kevin Durant\u2019s new point guard. So Westbrook did what he does and launched himself into his next triple-double.An article on Feb. 5 about the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball player Russell Westbrook misspelled part of the name of a rapper.

{"Headline": "Ecuador Votes as Latin America\u2019s Left Sags, a Generation of Icons Gone", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQUITO, Ecuador \u2014 For most of Luis Garc\u00eda\u2019s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of this tiny Andean country: Rafael Correa, the leftist leader of Ecuador\u2019s so-called citizens\u2019 revolution.But when Mr. Garc\u00eda went to the polls Sunday, Mr. Correa was not on the ballot. Unsatisfied with the options that remained, Mr. Garc\u00eda, a 33-year-old musician who first voted for Mr. Correa in 2006, chose to simply scribble over his ballot, rendering it invalid.\u201cI don\u2019t feel represented now,\u201d he said.That feeling of malaise among the left has been spreading throughout Latin America as, one by one, a generation of iconic leaders has departed the stage, brought down by death, elections, impeachment or, in Mr. Correa\u2019s case, term limits. They were known by many names, including the New Left, and ruled the length of the continent with big promises and bigger personalities.Picking up the mantle of the revolutions for which the region became famous in the 1960s and 1970s, these leaders expanded education, increased subsidies for the poor and built roads, highways and hospitals. But they often ran roughshod over those who tried to check their power, from judges to international lenders.And now, nearly all are gone.\u201cThese are not isolated events; it is a great reversal,\u201d said Gabriela Rivadeneira, the president of Ecuador\u2019s National Assembly, controlled by Mr. Correa\u2019s Alianza Pa\u00eds party, which for years rubber-stamped his reforms with few questions asked. \u201cWe are now the place that the region is looking at for what comes next.\u201dMr. Correa was a larger-than-life and often contradictory figure, an American-educated economist who regularly flipped between the mold of a fiery populist and the pragmatism of a studied technocrat.By most accounts, poverty and inequality decreased in Ecuador as Mr. Correa funneled oil revenue into everything from raising the salaries of teachers to rebuilding the country\u2019s highways and expanding clinics into the Amazon region. It helped that the price of oil was more than $100 per barrel for some of his tenure. Wealth flowed into the capital, Quito, whose streets bustle with new cars and S.U.V.s as workers dig a vast new metro system below.But whether Ecuador\u2019s leftist agenda will continue when Mr. Correa leaves office is unclear. There is the question of oil revenue, for one.As in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, the social programs in Ecuador that lifted millions out of poverty were underwritten by a commodities boom that sputtered out years ago. Government revenue, around $25 billion a year when oil prices spiked, has now shrunk to less than half that, $11 billion, mainly because of the declining price of oil.That has left the country heavily indebted to China. Ecuador\u2019s economy ground to a halt last year after growing, on average, 4 percent or more from 2006 to 2014.\u201cThe model has reached its end because the money has run out,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Robalino, a conservative banker at the Pichincha College of Economists in Quito.Mr. Robalino said Ecuador\u2019s next president, regardless of political affiliation, would need to take a tougher line on spending, reduce the number of government workers and cut subsidies like the ones used to reduce gas prices for all Ecuadoreans.That is the stance championed by the conservative opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso, a wealthy banker from Mr. Correa\u2019s hometown, Guayaquil, who finished second in the last election against him in 2013. Mr. Lasso is promising to roll back public spending while eliminating more than a dozen taxes, which would mean the loss of billions of dollars from state coffers.\u201cWhat a government should do is facilitate entrepreneurship,\u201d Mr. Lasso said in a TV interview during the campaign, adding that he thought Mr. Correa generated too much employment through public-sector jobs.Lenin Moreno, the leading left-wing candidate, has promised to do more with less, borrowing when necessary. In a response to written questions, Mr. Moreno said that despite the collapse of oil prices, Mr. Correa had avoided cutting social programs and gas subsidies used by the poor. Mr. Moreno said he would continue that policy if the left won.With about 80 percent of ballots counted on Sunday night, Mr. Moreno, 63, a former deputy of Mr. Correa, was leading with 38.8 percent, just more than a point short of the threshold needed to avoid a second round in April. Analysts said that if the numbers held, they would create an opening for Mr. Lasso, who was in second place, to unite his and the remaining opposition votes and potentially capture the presidency.If Mr. Moreno wins, he will face the challenge of setting himself apart from his predecessor and his legacy. Mr. Correa has said he will move to Belgium after his term ends, but some argue that if the left remains in power, Mr. Correa will try to influence politics from behind the scenes.\u201c\u2018I command, I direct,\u2019 is how he thinks,\u201d said Jorge Le\u00f3n, a political scientist at the Central University of Ecuador.Mr. Le\u00f3n pointed to an authoritarian streak in Mr. Correa that also became a hallmark of leftists in several other South American countries. After changing the Constitution \u2014 a move that allowed him to be re-elected twice \u2014 the president proposed allowing himself to run for a fourth time. (He backtracked when it became clear that popular opinion was against him.)Mr. Correa also tried to make life difficult for his critics during his time in office. He sued journalists, toughened defamation laws and even took over TV channels whose owners criticized him. More recently, he tried to close an environmental group that was stirring up opposition to a planned copper mine in the Amazon.It will be up to Mr. Correa\u2019s successor to decide whether to build on his legacy or reverse it. But those who have tried to forge a different path in the region have faced troubles.President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, despite his vow to revive the country\u2019s economy with market-oriented policies, has had trouble attracting investment to his country, noted Franklin Ram\u00edrez, a professor at the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Quito. Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, has been dogged by corruption allegations similar to those that brought down leftists.\u201cIt\u2019s a little early to speak of the end of a cycle here\u201d for the left, Mr. Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cThe hegemony of the left has ended,\u201d he said, but added that it was not clear what would replace it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Case of Nigeria\u2019s Missing President", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn April 2015, Muhammadu Buhari became the first opposition politician to defeat a sitting president in Nigeria, in a mostly free and fair election. Mr. Buhari, a former army general, who ruled Nigeria for 18 months from 1983 to 1985, had a reputation for being incorruptible and a disciplinarian.When Mr. Buhari returned to the Aso Rock presidential villa, Nigerians were disgruntled by reports of widespread graft by government appointees, and public services were on the decline. His election was supposed to usher in change, but less than two years later, he has been acting as if tending to the country\u2019s needs should come on his own schedule.On Jan. 19, Mr. Buhari left for a 10-day holiday to London; it seemed odd to leave the warmth of Abuja for the misery of English winter. By early February, Nigerians were told that Mr. Buhari had extended his trip for unspecified medical tests. No return date was given. Who can begrudge a 74-year-old the medical tests he is said to be undergoing in London?It incited a severe scarcity in foreign exchange that hasn\u2019t abated yet. Nigerians weren\u2019t able to purchase things abroad or pay tuition fees for students in Europe, the United States and elsewere in Africa.President Buhari is from the predominantly Muslim north, and the protests erupting among predominantly Christian southerners are a reminder of Nigeria\u2019s fragile ethnic fault line. Things are particularly fraught in the Niger Delta. The area remains impoverished, and past governments, including Mr. Buhari\u2019s in the 1980s, have done little to change that.In the north, the violent Boko Haram extremist group isn\u2019t yet vanquished. As a candidate, Mr. Buhari had promised to tame Boko Haram, and he has reclaimed areas it controlled under his predecessor. In probably his greatest success to date, he has galvanized a demoralized military and pushed the group out of large swaths of the Nigerian northeast that seemed to have been ceded to them by his predecessor.Mr. Buhari should know the effect of his silence. In 2010, President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua left Abuja for medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. He returned months later on life support, to die at home. The secrecy was galling then, and it is now. Mr. Buhari\u2019s phone conversation with President Trump has helped assuage rumors of his death. Yet his refusal to address Nigerians is a matter of serious concern.Last year, Mr. Buhari went to Britain for treatment of an ear infection. A Lagos businessman tells me many feel he\u2019s back there for the same reason: his inability to hear the voice of the people of Nigeria. President Buhari ought to reach out to the people. Our patience is wearing thin.Frankie Edozien is the director of New York University\u2019s Reporting Africa program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 30-Years War in Vietnam", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67It should go without saying that the Vietnam War is remembered by different people in very different ways. Most Americans remember it as a war fought between 1965 and 1975 that bogged down their military in a struggle to prevent the Communists from marching into Southeast Asia, deeply dividing Americans as it did. The French remember their loss there as a decade-long conflict, fought from 1945 to 1954, when they tried to hold on to the Asian pearl of their colonial empire until losing it in a place called Dien Bien Phu.The Vietnamese, in contrast, see the war as a national liberation struggle, or as a civil conflict, depending on which side they were on, ending in victory in 1975 for one side and tragedy for the other. For the Vietnamese, it was above all a 30-year conflict transforming direct and indirect forms of fighting into a brutal conflagration, one that would end up claiming over three million Vietnamese lives.The point is not that one perspective is better or more accurate than the other. What\u2019s important, rather, is to understand how the colonial war, the civil war and the Cold War intertwined to produce such a deadly conflagration by 1967.Without World War II, the struggle in Vietnam might have played out very differently.The Japanese had occupied French Indochina (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) in 1940, and they left the fascist Vichy French government, allied with Tokyo\u2019s German partner after the fall of France in 1940, in charge of day-to-day affairs. This collaboration ended in early 1945, as the Allies terminated the German hold on Europe and prepared to defeat the Japanese in Asia. In March, worried that Vichy troops would turn on them, the Japanese overthrew the French, ending 80 years of colonialism. A few months later, the Japanese capitulated, creating a power vacuum in Vietnam.Ho Chi Minh and his Communist-led Viet Minh nationalist front seized the opportunity. On Sept. 2, 1945, Ho proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Taking power, however, was one thing; holding onto it was another. Within days, Allied troops landed to disarm Japanese forces. The British debarked in southern Indochina below the 16th parallel, while Chinese nationalist troops occupied the north. In the wings, the leader of a newly liberated France, Charles de Gaulle, ordered his men to re-establish colonial rule. Unable to maintain order, three weeks later the British allowed the French to dislodge the Viet Minh from Saigon, triggering war below the 16th parallel.Accompanying the Chinese troops in the north were Vietnamese nationalists long opposed to Ho and his Communist Party. Local Chinese commanders preferred, however, to keep Ho\u2019s Vietnam in place in order to avoid the chaos occurring in the south. They imposed a coalition government on Ho, but did little more. This uneasy truce between Vietnamese Communist and anti-Communist nationalists broke down when the Chinese withdrew in mid-1946, leaving their allies at the mercy of the Communists, who swiftly defeated them before focusing on the French. Despite Ho\u2019s sincere efforts to negotiate decolonization peacefully, the French wanted Indochina back. Full-scale war broke out in December 1946.The French refusal to decolonize enabled the Communists to monopolize the nationalist mantle as they bogged the French down in a guerrilla war. Nationalists working with the French begged them to decolonize before it was too late. But even when the French finally created the State of Vietnam in 1949, led by the ex-emperor Bao Dai, they refused to grant it full independence.The arrival of the Cold War in Asia following the Chinese Communist victory in 1949, and the start of the Korean War a year later, strengthened the French hand. By casting themselves as the Asian front line of the free world\u2019s struggle against global communism, the French persuaded the Americans to abandon their anticolonialism in favor of supporting France in Indochina.This strategy came with a price, though. The French may have used the Americans, but the Americans used the French \u2014 their army, their administration, their State of Vietnam and its troops \u2014 to indirectly fight the Communists in Indochina. The United States created a Military Assistance Advisory Group in 1950, funded counterinsurgency programs and stepped up C.I.A. operations. By 1954, the Americans were paying for more than 70 percent of the French war \u2014 because it was their war, too. Chinese Communists pushed back, directly in Korea by sending in troops, and indirectly in Vietnam by sending their own advisers and arming a new regular army for Ho, the People\u2019s Army of Vietnam, or P.A.V.N. All of this transformed Vietnam into the deadliest war of decolonization of the 20th century.By 1954, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap commanded a divisional army and was ready to engage the French in a series of set-piece battles. This army carefully organized an epic siege of the fortified French camp at Dien Bien Phu, carrying artillery across mountainous terrain to destroy the air base supplying colonial troops. When the guns fell silent on May 7, 1954, the French Army had suffered its greatest colonial defeat since losing Quebec in 1759, and the Vietnamese Communists had proved they could fight conventional battles \u2014 and win. No other 20th-century war of decolonization produced a Dien Bien Phu.But fighting big battles came at a cost, for this type of war required the enormous mobilization of people. In 1953, Ho\u2019s party initiated a land reform program to encourage peasants to support the war. It also harshly overturned the landed and commercial classes as part of the communization of the state. The problem was that this dual military and social revolution exhausted the population. When the Chinese joined the French to reach a cease-fire, Ho agreed that he could push his people no further. The Communists had won a battle at Dien Bien Phu, but not the war. And behind the French, Ho knew, stood the Americans. On July 21, 1954, the Communists accepted a cease-fire at Geneva that separated the country in half at the 17th parallel, with elections to follow in two years.Something else happened as the French looked to exit Indochina at Geneva. One of the few non-Communist nationalists to have refused to collaborate with both the colonialists and the Communists stepped off the fence: Ngo Dinh Diem. Bao Dai had named him prime minister in June 1954, in a last-minute bid to prevent the French from handing over Vietnam to the adversary. The Americans feared the same thing and began rapidly pivoting their support to him.When France and China agreed at Geneva to hold elections to unite the two Vietnams, Diem and his newly enthusiastic supporter, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, took note but signed nothing. Geneva may have ended the French war, but it did not end America\u2019s indirect one. Instead the Americans replaced their reliance on the French colonial state to contain Communism in favor of working through an independent, non-Communist Vietnamese state led by their \u201cmiracle man.\u201d As long as Washington did not tread on this new nation\u2019s sovereignty and Diem did not endanger the decade-old American strategic investment in Vietnam, indirect containment could continue.After Geneva, Communists and anti-Communists focused on taking over their respective states, consolidating their political power and promoting economic development with their allies. The Communists completed land reform in 1956 as part of plans to collectivize the economy along Soviet lines. Dissent was crushed as Ho\u2019s party extended its Communist state to all the north. Diem ordered the French Army out and pushed Bao Dai aside as he created a republic in 1955 under his family\u2019s authoritarian control. He neutralized religious and political groups before going after remaining Communists and anyone else who opposed him. Diem welcomed American aid and advisers, but he rejected direct military intervention.This is where Le Duan, the veteran Communist who had run the party\u2019s war in the south against the French, enters the picture. Since Geneva, he had painted a dire picture of what was happening below the 17th parallel: Not only had Diem and the Americans rejected the idea of holding elections, but Diem\u2019s repression was also destroying what little remained of the party\u2019s southern network. Although Hanoi\u2019s leaders balked at resuming war outright, unsure of Sino-Soviet support and worried that the Americans would send in troops, in 1959 Le Duan persuaded the party to intervene indirectly in the south or risk losing it forever.This new strategy reactivated the Ho Chi Minh Trail to bring southward thousands of administrators (most of whom were native southerners sent north after Geneva). They formed a competing southern proto-state in the form of the National Liberation Front, created in 1960, and protected by the People\u2019s Liberation Armed Forces \u2014 what came to be known, to its enemies, as the Viet Cong. That same year, Le Duan assumed the party\u2019s leadership. He reactivated the Central Office of South Vietnam to run this indirect civil war to bring down Diem\u2019s state and unify the country on Hanoi\u2019s terms before the Americans could intervene.Diem did fall, but not his state. In 1963, the Kennedy administration watched in shock as the N.L.F. greatly expanded its hold over the countryside. Diem\u2019s half-baked counterinsurgency projects forcing millions of peasants into strategic hamlets, as well as his relentless attacks on non-Communist opponents, created the red-hot discontent on which the insurgency thrived. In June 1963, a Buddhist monk immolated himself in downtown Saigon in a sign of protest. Worried that Diem\u2019s policies were playing into Communist hands, South Vietnamese generals sought American support for a plan to overthrow their president. The Kennedy White House approved, and on Nov. 2 and 3, 1963, a military coup ousted Diem, killing him in the process.The question now was whether Washington or Hanoi would intervene directly. Starting in 1963, Le Duan pushed for gradual, direct military intervention, meaning the dispatch of P.A.V.N. troops southward. The hope was that, together with the N.L.F./P.L.A.F., Hanoi could take the south before the Americans could escalate.Not everyone in the party agreed, however. Some, including Vo Nguyen Giap, advised caution, pointing out the dangers of provoking the Americans into the conflict head on especially when the Soviets were advocating superpower d\u00e9tente. Le Duan, however, knew that he could count on China\u2019s Mao Zedong, who was highly critical of the Soviets and their lack of revolutionary backbone. In early 1964, the party approved direct intervention in the south.Lyndon B. Johnson also had to choose. Would the new president continue America\u2019s indirect war? Would he cut his country\u2019s losses and get out? Or would he send in American troops to save the South? Like Le Duan, Johnson chose war.Following an attack on an American helicopter base at Pleiku in early 1965, Johnson opened a sustained air war against Vietnamese targets above and below the 17th parallel, and authorized troops to land in the south in March. A few months later, American and P.A.V.N. troops clashed in the highland valley of Ia Drang, the first of many big battles to come. It was in the same area where P.A.V.N. regiments had decimated French mobile groups a decade earlier.By 1967, almost 500,000 American troops were in Vietnam, as Hanoi sent its own boys southward. The second half of the 30-Years War for Vietnam was now underway, with a vengeance.Christopher Goscha is an associate professor of international relations at the University of Quebec at Montreal and the author of \u201cVietnam: A New History.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Welcome Back, Wall Street. Now Pay Us Back.", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionIf only we had been clever enough to take Donald Trump neither literally nor seriously, we would have known that after vilifying Wall Street throughout his campaign, he would embrace it once he got to the Oval Office.And, just like that, Wall Street is swarming the Trump administration and steering financial policy. On Feb. 3, Mr. Trump invited the members of his Strategy and Policy Forum to the White House. Stephen Schwarzman, the group\u2019s chairman and the billionaire co-founder of the Blackstone Group, was seated at Mr. Trump\u2019s right. Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, sat across from him. Mr. Trump said he expected to cut \u201ca lot out of\u201d the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that re-regulated Wall Street after the financial crisis.\u201cThere\u2019s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie,\u201d Mr. Trump said, presumably meaning that there was nobody better to help him dismantle Dodd-Frank than Jamie.That afternoon he signed an executive order signaling that among his \u201ccore principles\u201d is his determination to repeal the law. Just off Mr. Trump\u2019s left shoulder, beaming, was Gary Cohn, formerly the president of Goldman Sachs, now the director of the National Economic Council. Waiting in the wings were more Goldman alumni, including Stephen Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, and Steven Mnuchin, his pick for Treasury secretary.Now that Wall Street has been welcomed back to Washington, it should use its return to the corridors of power to repair its tarnished reputation and to restore public confidence in the markets. That\u2019s the least Wall Street can do after exacerbating one of the worst financial crises in history and then carrying on as if nothing bad had transpired. Mr. Trump can help make this happen, but only if he trades the repeal of Dodd-Frank for a wholesale reform of how bankers, traders and executives are compensated on Wall Street. A new system that rewards prudent risk-taking and holds people personally and financially accountable for their actions is a prerequisite to restoring our faith in Wall Street.It\u2019s been a rough eight years in exile for the big banks. Barely three months into the job, President Obama told the chief executives of the nation\u2019s most powerful banks that his administration was the only thing standing \u201cbetween you and the pitchforks.\u201d Later he said he did not get elected to help out \u201ca bunch of fat-cat bankers.\u201d There were well-deserved public floggings of bankers in Congress and in front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. And in July 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank law, a complex set of rules governing what bankers and traders could do to make money and the risks they could take, intended to prevent another financial crisis.Dodd-Frank and other financial regulations adopted around the same time have made it much harder for Wall Street to do what it does best: provide much-needed capital to businesses that want it. They are often cited, correctly, as a big culprit behind what Lawrence Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, refers to as \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d an economy that is \u201cstuck in neutral\u201d and condemned to a mere 2 percent annual gross domestic product growth rate.Meanwhile, Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department forced the big firms \u2014 or more accurately their shareholders \u2014 to cough up more than $200 billion in fines as punishment for, among other things, the role the banks played in knowingly packaging shoddy mortgages into securities and then passing them off as AAA-rated investments. We were led to believe these exorbitant fines were the same as justice, but that\u2019s not remotely true, especially since many of the facts about what happened were whitewashed as part of the settlements and no individual Wall Street bankers, traders or executives have been held responsible for their wrongdoing.No surprise, Wall Street also became a convenient whipping boy for ambitious politicians like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Their popularity increased exponentially as they fingered Wall Street. Even Hillary Clinton (to keep Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren at bay) and Mr. Trump (to burnish what seemed to be his populist credentials) got in on the act. As a result, most people don\u2019t know what to make of Wall Street anymore. The combination of silly regulation and relentless demagogy took its toll. The pendulum against Wall Street had swung too far.And then suddenly it swung back. Since his election, Mr. Trump has laid out the red carpet for private-equity billionaires, hedge-fund moguls and Wall Street bankers. It\u2019s about time we stopped flogging Wall Street, but we shouldn\u2019t forgive it, either. These rich white men need to take advantage of their second chance to help the American economy get back on a more secure footing, one that works for everyone, not just for the elites.Mr. Trump seems determined to gut most of Dodd-Frank. \u201cI have so many people, friends of mine that have nice businesses, they can\u2019t borrow money,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.\u201dHe\u2019s got a point. Parts of the Obama-era regulations make sense and should be kept: for instance, demanding that big banks have more capital and less leverage; requiring that often-risky financial derivatives be traded on exchanges so that their pricing is more transparent; and ensuring that brokers have their customers\u2019 best interests at heart when advising them on their retirement accounts \u2014 the fiduciary rule, which Mr. Trump is unfortunately likely to eliminate.But many provisions are overly burdensome. According to the law firm Davis Polk, there are more than 22,000 pages of Dodd-Frank-related rules. \u2014 more pages than in 34 copies of \u201cMoby Dick.\u201d These days, nearly one out of every five Wall Street employees does nothing more than monitor what the other four do. One particularly nonsensical requirement penalizes big banks for trying to help clients buy and sell bonds without forcing them to pay a higher price (when they buy) or to receive a lower price (when they sell).If Mr. Trump does even a portion of what he promised he would do \u2014 and he\u2019ll need congressional approval to do much of anything \u2014 Wall Street will applaud, and smarter regulation will probably serve as a catalyst to get the economy humming again. But repealing the bad regulations, let alone the good ones like the fiduciary rule, will do nothing to rehabilitate Wall Street\u2019s image or overcome the view that the markets are rigged against the average investor.The 2008 financial crisis badly hurt Wall Street by removing all doubt that the people who work there are in it for themselves (and their fat paychecks) regardless of the consequences of their poor judgment on the rest of us. That perception must be changed if we want ordinary Americans to benefit from a functioning Wall Street.So while Mr. Trump and his banker buddies whittle away at Dodd-Frank, they need to do something else as well: junk Wall Street\u2019s compensation system, which continues to reward bankers for making big bets with other people\u2019s money and does nothing to hold them accountable when the bets go bad. We need to replace this system with one that rewards people when they succeed but penalizes them when they fail.To do this, the government could require that the leading executives at each big bank \u2014 the top 500 or so people \u2014 put their own assets on the line in the event of a bankruptcy filing, bailout or default. Creditors and shareholders would have what\u2019s called a first lien against executives\u2019 co-op apartments, Hamptons houses, art collections and bank accounts. This would go beyond a now doomed Dodd-Frank proposal to claw back bonuses. Only something like this would properly align risk and reward on Wall Street, and help to prevent the next financial crisis.This is actually how Wall Street worked once upon a time, when it was just undercapitalized small firms in which partners invested their own hard-earned capital. They lived with a daily existential threat that they could lose everything because of a foolish trader or an unscrupulous banker. But this changed in 1970, when the brokerage firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette sold a portion of its stock to the public. One Wall Street firm after another followed, with the climax coming in May 1999, when Goldman Sachs went public. Virtually overnight, Goldman\u2019s partners were worth tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars.Wall Street was no longer gambling with its own money, but with the public\u2019s. As a result, for the past 47 years, Wall Street has been rewarding its star performers for generating as much revenue as possible, without a particular concern for how it was done. The only wonder is why it took so long for the 2008 crisis to come along.People are pretty simple. If you reward them to take big risks with other people\u2019s money, that is exactly what they will do. So sure, Mr. Trump, go ahead and work to repeal what you don\u2019t like about Dodd-Frank. Try to increase G.D.P. growth to 4 percent. Ratchet up the supply of high-paying jobs. Move millions of people out of poverty into the middle class. An untethered Wall Street will help make that possible.But the repeal of burdensome regulations cannot be done in a vacuum. Wall Street must also be forced to change its compensation system to one where there is real accountability for the bad behavior of bankers, traders and executives. Accidents are inevitable. Wall Street needs \u2014 and wants \u2014 seatbelts and speed limits.William D. Cohan is the author of the forthcoming \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Takes First Step Before Talks With U.S. on Nafta", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The Mexican government said on Wednesday that it was beginning a 90-day consultation with the country\u2019s Senate and private sector before talks with the United States to review the North American Free Trade Agreement.President Trump has said he wants to renegotiate Nafta to obtain a better deal for the United States, calling the accord the \u201csingle worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\u201d He has threatened to pull the United States out of Nafta, which includes Mexico and Canada, if he cannot negotiate more favorable terms.Under the United States\u2019 Trade Promotion Authority laws, the White House must inform Congress at least 90 days before any new trade agreement is signed. While it was not immediately clear whether the Trump administration gave notice to Congress on Wednesday, the Mexican government plans to go through a similar process, according to a statement from Mexico\u2019s foreign and economy ministries. Negotiations are expected to begin in May.The possibility of any talks at all seemed remote last Thursday when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceled his trip.He has said repeatedly that Mexico will not pay for the wall, which Mr. Trump made the centerpiece of his presidential campaign, despite a projected cost of billions of dollars and questions raised by his secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, over how effective it would be.The phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was presented as having improved relations somewhat, though there was no agreement on the wall or on whether Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s trip would be rescheduled.Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, said that talks with White House officials had continued after the call, leading to Wednesday\u2019s announcement.Nafta is almost a quarter of a century old, and in that time, it has turned Mexico into a manufacturing powerhouse that ships cars, appliances, electronics, medical equipment and produce north of the border.But investment by American companies in Mexico, as they shut down factories at home, has made Nafta the focus of searing arguments against free trade.While the Mexican government is intent on preserving Nafta and the $1.4 billion in two-way trade that crosses the border every day, uncertainty over the agreement\u2019s fate has led to pressure on the Mexican peso and worries that companies will delay investment.In response, the Mexican government is working to seal agreements with other partners. It is updating its accord with the European Union and looking at bilateral deals with countries like Argentina, Australia and Brazil.\u201cWe want to reach an agreement,\u201d Mr. Videgaray said, referring to Nafta, \u201cbut we have to be prepared for all scenarios.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here is a list of some of the most important.When a reporter pressed Mr. Trump on the claim, he laid the blame elsewhere. \u201cI was given that information,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump said the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld a temporary restraining order on his targeted travel ban, was \u201cin chaos.\u201dThere is no evidence of that. The decision by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s three-judge panel in the travel ban case was unanimous.Mr. Trump also claimed that the court was \u201ca circuit that has been overturned at a record number.\u201d He was apparently referring to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reversal rate, which the president cited correctly: \u201cI find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time.\u201dBut that was not the highest rate among the nation\u2019s 13 appeals courts. The Sixth Circuit (87 percent) and 11th Circuit (85 percent) each had a greater percentage of reviewed decisions reversed. For all appellate court cases in that period, the Supreme Court reversed decisions about 70 percent of the time.Last month, the economy added 227,000 jobs, even though the unemployment rate is already low. The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits continues to hit lows not seen in decades.Mr. Trump\u2019s claim is incorrect on at least two points.First, the company\u2019s American assets were equal to 20 percent of the country\u2019s uranium production capacity \u2014 not its produced uranium, as Mr. Trump suggested.Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct to hedge on the news media\u2019s approval rating was right. The news media does not enjoy a great reputation among Americans, according to a variety of polls in recent years, but Congress fares worse.Mr. Trump went on to say that aside from a federal district judge\u2019s decision to temporarily halt the ban, its rollout had been \u201cperfect.\u201d By most measures, that is far from true.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Approval Ratings Are Down. How Much Does It Mean?", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisapprovalDonald J. Trump won the presidential election as the least popular candidate in the polling era. He assumed the presidency with the lowest approval rating of any incoming president.And his ratings have continued to fall. The question isn\u2019t whether it\u2019s bad for Mr. Trump and the Republicans, but how bad.Usually, presidents ride high at the start of their terms. After one month, presidents average around a 60 percent approval rating. Even re-elected presidents with considerable baggage, like Barack Obama or George W. Bush, still had approval ratings around or over 50 percent.The worst data for Mr. Trump comes from live interview telephone surveys like Pew Research and Gallup, which pin his approval rating among adults around 40 percent.The most recent Gallup survey, the first conducted entirely after the resignation of Michael Flynn as national security adviser, has Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating down to 38 percent, with 56 percent disapproving (a differential of minus 18).Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings aren\u2019t just bad for an incoming president. They\u2019re bad for a president at any point in a term.Here\u2019s what it took for past presidents to reach an approval rating differential of minus 15 or worse:\u25a0 Harry Truman reached it in September 1946, after serving in office for more than a year. His ratings had been slipping since the end of World War II, in part because of the pain of demobilization and a wave of labor strikes. His party lost 55 seats in the midterm elections that year.\u25a0 Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s approval rating and differential never fell as low as Mr. Trump\u2019s current ones. Neither did John Kennedy\u2019s.\u25a0 Lyndon Johnson had already decided not to run for re-election, and his approval rating dropped beneath 40 percent, with a differential of minus 18, in an August 1968 poll. He was facing strong criticism over the war in Vietnam.\u25a0 In the midst of the Watergate scandal in July 1973, Richard Nixon refused to turn over White House tapes. By mid-August, Gallup registered Mr. Nixon at a differential of minus 18 and an approval rating of 36 percent. Leading up to his resignation a year later, his ratings were mired in the 20s.\u25a0 Gerald Ford didn\u2019t win the 1976 election, and his ratings were often weak \u2014 he fell into the upper 30s \u2014 but a majority of Americans never disapproved of his performance in Gallup surveys, and he didn\u2019t come close to reaching minus 15.\u25a0 Jimmy Carter was dragged down to differentials greater than minus 20 by midsummer of 1979, after the Iranian revolution brought a new round of oil shocks.\u25a0 A recession with 10 percent unemployment was enough to drag Ronald Reagan\u2019s approval rating to 35 percent by early 1983, with a minus-21 differential, although that level of unpopularity didn\u2019t last long.\u25a0 A weak economy cost George H.W. Bush in early 1992. The unemployment rate peaked at 7.8 percent, and he was facing a third-party challenge from Ross Perot. In June of that year, his differential was greater than minus 15.\u25a0 Bill Clinton\u2019s ratings fell into the upper 30s in June 1993, as the debate over whether to allow gays in the military peaked in Congress, but his disapproval rating didn\u2019t go over 50 percent in that period. He fell to around a minus-15 differential in Gallup polls in September 1994, just after his attempt at health care reform was declared dead. Two months later, the Democrats lost control of Congress.\u25a0 Hurricane Katrina reached Category 5 status on Aug. 28, 2005. A few days before, Gallup released a survey showing George W. Bush\u2019s approval rating down to 39 percent, with a differential of minus 16. The Iraq War and high oil prices had already taken a toll on his standing.\u25a0 Mr. Obama\u2019s approval rating finally fell beneath 40 percent in August 2011, with differentials of around minus 15 and slightly worse. It was when the economy was still staggered after the Great Recession, just after the debt-ceiling crisis and well after the Democrats lost control of Congress.So no, not great company. It is especially striking how low Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings are given the state of the national economy.But there are at least a few reasons for Mr. Trump and the Republicans to think things aren\u2019t quite as bleak as Gallup, Pew and the history of presidential approval ratings might suggest.For one, there are reputable polls with more favorable findings for Mr. Trump. A recent Fox News poll of registered voters gave Mr. Trump a 48 percent approval rating. Registered voters are whiter and older than all adults, which explains part of why Mr. Trump fared better in the Fox poll. But it doesn\u2019t explain it all; the Pew Research survey gave Mr. Trump a 42 percent rating among registered voters.Similarly, online surveys have consistently shown Mr. Trump with a higher approval rating than those conducted by telephone. On average, Mr. Trump\u2019s ratings have been 10 points better in online polls.It\u2019s not the first time that live interview and online surveys have split over Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity. He did better in online surveys throughout the Republican primary, leading many to speculate that there was a hidden Trump vote of poll respondents who were afraid to admit their support to a live interviewer \u2014 a phenomenon known as social desirability bias.But the results didn\u2019t quite back up the theory in the end. Mr. Trump won the primaries by the comfortable margin predicted by live interview telephone surveys, not the landslide implied by online polls. And the gap between online and live interview pollsters faded during the general election. Mr. Trump actually fared better in the final live interview polls than the final online polls. The live interview polls also came closer to the mark in the national popular vote.Does that mean the live interview polls are right this time? Not necessarily. In general, taking an average of polls is a safer way to go. By that measure, Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating is in the low-to-mid 40s.The Republicans can also breathe easier about congressional control because so many are safely ensconced in reliably Republican districts. The Republican grip on the House is so strong that it gives the party a much better chance to ride out a president\u2019s weak approval ratings than in the past.Here\u2019s one way to think about it: Democrats might not take the chamber with a victory on the scale of their huge win in 2006, when they gained 30 seats, or on the scale of the Republican sweep in 2010, which garnered 63 seats. With so many Republican seats safely out of play, a similarly impressive win might still leave the Democrats short of House control.In 2006 and 2010, Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama had approval ratings near or above 40 percent on Election Day. So if you had to make a rough guess, you would probably say that Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating would probably need to be even lower for House control to become a true tossup.Let\u2019s imagine a rough model of congressional elections since 2002, based on recent presidential election results by congressional district and the president\u2019s approval rating. You would guess that Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average heading into the midterm election would need to be around 35 percent for the Democrats to be an even-money bet for a House takeover. You should note that the pre-election approval polls are often polls of likely voters, an even whiter and older group of voters than registered voters, so Mr. Trump\u2019s rating among all adults would probably need to be a bit lower.But really, what\u2019s striking is that we\u2019re even having this conversation at all at this time. In general, a president\u2019s approval rating is at its peak in the first month. Mr. Trump could easily slip further. If his ratings average falls into the mid-to-low 30s, the Republicans could be in serious trouble.An Upshot article on Feb. 18 about the approval ratings of presidents referred incorrectly to Gerald R. Ford\u2019s bid for the presidency in 1976. He was seeking election to a full four-year term; he was not running for re-election. (He was first appointed vice president and then ascended to the presidency after Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation.)Advertisement"}

Justin Timberlake cried the president a river. The event was barren of A-listers. Except for one.There she was, Caitlyn Jenner, in an off-the-shoulder navy gown, cheering on the new president. \u201cRepublicans need help understanding L.G.B.T.Q. issues,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here to help!\u201dThere are times when I feel like my friendship with Caitlyn is one unending Thanksgiving dinner, with me always fleeing the table in tears. But I do believe that if we\u2019re all going to survive the next four years, we have to learn not only how to talk with one another, but to listen.Listening is no easy thing. When I spent six weeks on a bus last year with Caitlyn as part of her reality show\u2019s road trip, I asked her how she could possibly be a Republican. She replied, \u201cEvery conservative guy out there believes in everybody\u2019s rights.\u201d I shouted back, \u201cThat is a lie!\u201d Then I hit her with a rolled-up newspaper, demonstrating exactly how bad I am at the whole listening thing.There is, and ought to be, room for a wide range of identities within the L.G.B.T. movement. But how can queer people side with the party that has devoted much of the last quarter-century to demonizing us and opposing our rights?As a friend once observed, queer Republicans remind him of \u201cthe pig in the chef\u2019s hat and apron holding a fork and knife on the front of a sign for a barbecue joint.\u201d Surely that pig must know that things aren\u2019t going to end well.But Caitlyn isn\u2019t alone. According to Gallup, 21 percent of L.G.B.T. Americans are or lean Republican.The Trump administration claims it supports gay and trans rights, as evidenced by its decision last month to preserve Barack Obama\u2019s workplace protections. \u201cThe president is proud to have been the first ever G.O.P. nominee to mention the L.G.B.T.Q. community in his nomination acceptance speech,\u201d a White House statement said.L.G.B.T. conservatives argue that they are not \u201cone-issue voters,\u201d that while the rights of queer Americans are important, they are not the only factor. There are a lot of issues that constitute political identity, and as it turns out, some voters feel that their own rights are not the most urgent.I admit that I really don\u2019t get it. So in that spirit of \u201clistening,\u201d I called Caitlyn again.She was driving her car \u2014 \u201ca 1960 Austin-Healey bug-eyed Sprite\u201d \u2014 to the shop. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a country,\u201d she told me, \u201cwe don\u2019t have L.G.B.T. issues.\u201dI wasn\u2019t quite sure what she meant. So she went on: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have a thriving country. I want every trans person to get a job. I want a thriving economy. I don\u2019t want massive government on top of everything we do.\u201dWhy did she go to the inauguration? \u201cI was working,\u201d she said. \u201cI had an objective when I went there to meet as many people and open as many doors as I possibly could, and I was able to accomplish that. Trump is really fine when it comes to these issues.\u201dMike Pence, she said, \u201cis a different story.\u201d Given that he opposed the repeal of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d and said that gay couples would cause a \u201csocietal collapse,\u201d this seemed to me like an understatement.\u201cPence was happy to see me,\u201d she said. \u201cIn so many ways, we have a lot of things in common. I\u2019m a Christian. I\u2019m also a Republican, and I\u2019m also trans. My faith played a very big role in what I\u2019m doing. And I would love to explain my story to him.\u201dAs I listened, I wondered whether L.G.B.T. rights really ought not to be the most conservative of causes. Above all else we want to be left alone, without interference, to live our lives with truth and grace. What could be more conservative than that?And yet the modern Republican Party seems to have no problem interfering with people\u2019s privacy when it comes to sexuality and gender identity. From abortion rights to opposition to marriage equality, the Republicans have advocated more government intrusion into private lives, not less.Caitlyn is aware of this. And she warns that if there\u2019s no progress on these issues, conservatives should be prepared \u201cfor the wrath of Caitlyn Jenner coming down upon you.\u201dWould that include voting for a Democrat?\u201cI could never see myself voting for a Democrat, especially right now. I think we\u2019ve lost the Democratic Party. I think it has been hijacked by left-wing, radical agendas.\u201d\u201cIncluding L.G.B.T. rights?\u201d I asked.\u201cBoy,\u201d said Caitlyn. \u201cYou keep going back to L.G.B.T. rights.\u201dYeah, I told her. I do.I\u2019m truly hopeful that outreach by Caitlyn \u2014 and others \u2014 will succeed, and that life will get better, for all of us.If it doesn\u2019t? Well, you know.

{"Headline": "Lee Jae-yong, Samsung Heir, Is Arrested on Bribery Charges", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The de facto leader of Samsung, Lee Jae-yong, was arrested Friday on bribery charges, a dramatic turn in South Korea\u2019s decades-old struggle to end collusive ties between the government and powerful family-controlled conglomerates.Mr. Lee, Samsung\u2019s vice chairman, was taken to a jail outside Seoul, the capital, soon after a judge at the Seoul Central District Court issued an arrest warrant early Friday.He is accused of paying $36 million in bribes to President Park Geun-hye\u2019s secretive confidante, Choi Soon-sil, in return for political favors. Those are alleged to include government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that helped Mr. Lee, 48, inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, Lee Kun-hee, the chairman.Samsung, whose market capitalization accounts for one-fourth of the value of all listed companies in South Korea, is a potent national symbol of power, wealth and technological innovation. Mr. Lee is the first head of the conglomerate ever to be arrested on corruption charges. Other charges against him include embezzlement, illegal transfer of property abroad and committing perjury during a parliamentary hearing.South Koreans have grown increasingly fed up with corruption scandals. When huge crowds took to the streets in recent months to demand Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment, they also called for the arrest of Mr. Lee and other chaebol leaders.All presidents, including Ms. Park, have entered office vowing to end favoritism and collusion with the chaebol, but they all later backtracked, arguing that the corporate titans were too important to the national economy to be arrested or given long sentences.While Mr. Lee\u2019s arrest was welcome news to many in South Korea, some fear that even if he is convicted he will be pardoned.The arrest is a hard-won victory for the special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, who has been struggling to establish a bribery case against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park.\u201cGiven the newly presented criminal charges and the additional evidence collected, the legal grounds and need for arresting him are recognized,\u201d the judge, Han Jeong-seok, said Friday when he issued the arrest warrant.The prosecutor must indict Mr. Lee within 20 days.In a statement, Samsung said, \u201cWe will do our best to ensure that the truth is revealed in the court proceedings.\u201dThe prosecutor is preparing to bring bribery charges against Ms. Park as well, although she cannot be indicted while she is in office. If she is removed and indicted, she will be the first South Korean leader on trial for corruption since two military dictators, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, were convicted of bribery in the mid-1990s.Samsung was the most generous among a handful of conglomerates that each contributed millions of dollars to two foundations controlled by Ms. Choi, the president\u2019s confidante, or signed lucrative contracts with companies run by Ms. Choi or her associates.They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice, but they brought no charges against the businesses, which they saw as victims of extortion. But the special prosecutor, who has since taken over the investigation from state prosecutors, has called Samsung\u2019s contributions bribes that were exchanged for political favors from Ms. Park.Mr. Lee and Samsung argued that the \u201cdonations\u201d Samsung paid out to Ms. Choi were coerced, suggesting that the company was extorted. Ms. Park also denies any wrongdoing, saying that the donations from Samsung and other business were voluntary.While his father remained bedridden, Mr. Lee and loyal executives have tried to speed up a transfer of management control over the conglomerate. Now those efforts have effectively backfired, with the prosecutor asserting that the 2015 merger, a crucial piece in the succession plan, was facilitated through bribery.Samsung\u2019s dozens of subsidiaries are run by professional managers. But in the cultlike corporate culture of the chaebol, only the so-called owner chairman can decide on multibillion-dollar investments, the kind of huge bets that have allowed Samsung to move quickly into a new market or stay ahead of its competitors in smartphones, memory chips and flat-panel screens.Pro-business groups warned that Mr. Lee\u2019s arrest would create a \u201cmanagement vacuum\u201d at Samsung, leaving it leaderless and shy of investment. Many Koreans also fear that Samsung\u2019s troubles would hurt the national economy. The conglomerate\u2019s main company, Samsung Electronics, alone accounts for 20 percent of the country\u2019s exports.Over the decades, the South Korean government and the judiciary have often cited the impact on the economy when they decided not to arrest chaebol chairmen accused of white-collar crimes or gave them light or suspended sentences.Mr. Lee\u2019s father was twice convicted of bribery and tax evasion but has never spent a day in jail. Each time, he was pardoned by the president and returned to management. At least six of the nation\u2019s top 10 chaebol, which generate revenue equivalent to more than 80 percent of gross domestic product, are led by men once convicted of white-collar crimes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study Finds Only Modest Gains by Women and Minorities on Fortune 500 Boards", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen and minorities occupy nearly 31 percent of the board seats of Fortune 500 companies, a small increase over the last four years, a new study has found.While that is the highest level in the six years of the study, white men continue to hold more than two-thirds of the positions.The data for 2016 \u2014 from the Alliance for Board Diversity, an association of groups promoting inclusion of women and minorities in boardrooms, and Deloitte, a professional services firm \u2014 underscores that companies have made only incremental progress in promoting diversity in boardrooms.Corporate boardrooms with directors of varied backgrounds are still relatively unusual. Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffee behemoth, drew public notice last month when it announced that it would add three minority directors. If approved by shareholders, the expanded 14-person board will be 29 percent women and 36 percent minorities.\u201cWith the current rate of progress, we aren\u2019t likely to see the number of minorities and women increase to our target of 40 percent representation until the year 2026,\u201d said Ronald C. Parker, the chairman of the Alliance for Board Diversity. \u201cThis is not acceptable. Corporations need to do more to keep pace with the country\u2019s changing demographics.\u201dMany companies, however, continue to turn to people who have had chief executive experience, and these tend to be men. In addition, only a small number of board seats turn over in any given year \u2014 about 350 around the country \u2014 which makes it difficult to quickly increase the numbers of women and minorities. The total number of Fortune 500 board seats last year was 5,440, down slightly from 5,463 in 2010.Most boards range from nine to 11 people \u2014 which some companies argue is a reason for the lack of board directors with more diverse skills than those conventionally accepted for board candidates. The relatively low turnover \u2014 the average tenure is eight to 10 years \u2014 and the small number of companies that have term limits also make the move to broader inclusion less rapid than advocates would like.A possible bright spot for increasing diversity is that many board members are in their 70s, meaning they are likely to step down in the coming years.African-American men increased their presence in Fortune 500 boardrooms by 2 percent. Their female counterparts increased their portion of seats by 18.4 percent. But the report also found that African-Americans had the highest rate of serving on multiple boards.This indicates, Mr. Parker said, \u201cthat companies are going to the same individuals rather than expanding the pool of African-American candidates for board membership.\u201dHispanics made a small net gain of six board seats, for a total of 188 seats, or 3.5 percent of the total \u2014 compared with the 17 percent they represent in the United States population. Asians, including Asian-Americans, or Pacific Islanders occupied 167 seats, or 3.1 percent of the total.The numbers at Fortune 100 companies are higher in terms of diversity, Mr. Parker noted, with 35.9 percent of women and minorities, outpacing the nearly 31 percent for Fortune 500 companies. Even so, the gains for women and minorities have been meager since the Alliance began collecting data for Fortune 100 companies in 2004. Thirteen years ago, the diversity figure was 28.8 percent. The study verified each company\u2019s total number of directors and board composition against Securities and Exchange Commission annual filings.The report mentioned several companies as being among the most diverse, including Prudential Financial, PepsiCo, Aramark and Nordstrom. Those companies had at least one female director and a director who was African-American, Asian, Hispanic or Latino.More women are being recruited with technology skills as companies adjust to the current economy, said Deborah DeHaas, the chief inclusion officer at Deloitte, who worked on the report.Even so, women and minorities claimed few of the most powerful board seats, which include leading committees on corporate audit, compensation or governance, Ms. DeHaas said.An article last Monday about a study of diversity on boards of Fortune 500 companies referred incorrectly to one of the study\u2019s findings. Last year, Hispanics held a total of 188 seats, a net gain of six board seats from 2012; Hispanic men did not gain eight board seats in that period.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Immigration Facts Donald Trump Doesn\u2019t Like", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialLet\u2019s be clear: The moral case against President Trump\u2019s plan to uproot and expel millions of unauthorized immigrants is open-and-shut. But what about the economic cost? This is where deeply shameful collides with truly stupid.ICE and the Border Patrol already refer more cases for federal prosecution than the entire Justice Department, and the number of people they detain each year (more than 400,000) is greater than the number of inmates being held by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for all other federal crimes.That is blank-check, steroidal enforcement \u2014 and Mr. Trump and the Homeland Security secretary, John Kelly, want more.Mr. Trump also talks about a 2,000-mile, double-thick, very high wall along the border from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex. There are already 700 miles of fencing on the border, plus watchtowers, sensors, floodlights and razor wire, and boots and all-terrain vehicles on the ground and drones in the air. In 2009 the Government Accountability Office estimated the cost of the existing fence at $2.8 million to $3.9 million per mile, but that was for the relatively easy stretches.But wait \u2014 didn\u2019t Mr. Trump also say the cost to America would actually be zero, since he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, even though Mexico says it won\u2019t? He did. But then he said Mexico would reimburse us for the wall, which is to say \u2026 who knows? Mr. Kelly\u2019s memos include a plan to catalog United States aid to Mexico, suggesting that he is looking for money to raid for a Trump wall fund, and that this so-called wall remains firmly in the realm of delusion.Now let\u2019s examine the cost to the economy.It\u2019s ridiculous to have to explain this to the president, but: If you take a population of 11 million people out of the country, or force them deeper underground, the economy will not be healthier. If you have to find foster parents for millions of abandoned American children of deported immigrants, society will not be stronger. Shrink our immigrant-rich economic sectors, send all that entrepreneurial energy to Canada and Mexico \u2014 America will not be better off.Pull immigrants and refugees out of the declining Rust and Bible Belt cities and towns that they have been repopulating and revitalizing. Bleed the immigrant populations of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Who benefits? Not America.While we wait for Mr. Kelly to achieve his boss\u2019s bleak vision, we will have created a population of increasingly vulnerable, exploited noncitizens and Dreamer youths whose educations hit a dead end after high school. All that intellectual and economic potential, the prospect of rising incomes and tax payments, will have been squandered.But squandering is the whole point. The \u201cdeportation force\u201d may or may not hit its 11 million target, the wall may or may not stretch from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico, but terror and intimidation have already spread through immigrant communities. And this is what the nativists who have been schooling the president want.The larger costs to the economy, and the dire human toll, do not concern them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting Racial Bias on Campus", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEd Talk Shaun R. Harper has been at the center of the racial debate of the past year \u2014 first, as protests illuminated the concerns of students of color, then as the Trump triumph emboldened some to commit overt acts of bias, particularly against Latino and Muslim students. In his new book, \u201cRace Matters in College,\u201d due out in June from Johns Hopkins University Press, he provides a pathway for campuses struggling with these very issues. A leading scholar on racial equity in higher education, Dr. Harper will in July be leaving the University of Pennsylvania, where he founded and directed the Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education, and joining the University of Southern California, where he will teach and start up a similar center with big ambitions. One priority is a survey to assess the racial climate on the nation\u2019s campuses. What is your reaction to the environment on campus following the Trump election and inauguration?The uptick in reports of racial bias reinforces my argument as to why it\u2019s so important that colleges and universities be responsible for white students having access to a proper course of study in race. I was also struck by how many white people on college campuses were shocked to learn that there was so much racism in America. In fact, I use the election to address in my book why even the most educated white people were so na\u00efve and blind to the realities of race. What prompted you to write your book?I saw this as an opportunity to help people understand that universities didn\u2019t just all of a sudden become racist. They\u2019ve been racist and exclusive from the start. I wanted to call attention to both the problems and the opportunities. When I say the opportunities, I mean the opportunity to actually force higher education institutions to follow through on their commitment to diversity. What makes you think universities breed racism?On most predominantly white campuses, people of color are overwhelmingly represented in food service, grounds keeping, custodial roles and fairly low-paid secretarial roles; and they are tragically underrepresented among tenured faculty members, deans, provosts and presidents, people who are in power. This sends a message to black and Latino students that they aren\u2019t really valued. To their white counterparts, their expectation is that people of color work at the lowest levels of the organizations they lead. For example, the guys on the field are black men, but the coaches, commissioners and top executives at the N.C.A.A. are overwhelmingly white men. There is some real asymmetry there. If universities fail to address these issues in a meaningful way, what are the long-term effects?White people never thought before about their own underpreparation to even think about race, talk about race, and achieve racial equity. Companies and newsrooms say they want to achieve racial diversity but don\u2019t know how. This is extremely consequential for our democracy. Our conversation about race in higher education has to start to include white people and pay some attention to their preparation, because otherwise, we\u2019re going to continue to see an oversupply of white people in leadership positions in all sectors of our society and our economy. These are the people who will eventually shape public policies and teach future generations. What about the diversity training campuses are offering? Doesn\u2019t that help?The one-time talks during freshman orientation, regardless of whether it\u2019s an hour or all day, do not provide a deep enough course of study in race and diversity. It has to go beyond orientation. In your book, you see diversity issues incorporated in the curriculum. That includes math. Explain.Race studies continue to be incredibly compartmentalized. Ethnic studies programs tend to still be the only place where people can find a meaningful course of study on race. We absolutely need ethnic studies courses. But we also need for race and diversity to be thoughtfully integrated across the curriculum.There\u2019s a real opportunity to get young people excited about math when you can situate the word problems in contexts that are culturally familiar to them. If you\u2019re teaching accounting, it might be that you have people learning through pro bono work with a local organization that serves communities of color. How important is it that colleges and universities change their approach to educating students?What actually happens in college to prepare people for citizenship in a racially diverse democracy? I want students to hold their universities accountable for making good on the promises that are found in mission statements and elsewhere about commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and so on. And I don\u2019t want it to just be students of color. I want white students to also hold their professors accountable for not sending them into the world as what I term accidental racists.Interview has been condensed and lightly edited.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tax Overhaul Would Be Great in Theory. Here\u2019s Why It\u2019s So Hard in Practice.", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewHouse Republicans have an ambitious plan for overhauling the way American businesses are taxed.A short list of the plan\u2019s potential benefits looks awesome: It would give companies more incentive to keep jobs in the United States, less to overextend themselves on borrowed money and provide vast savings by reducing what companies spend on tax lawyers, who help them game the current system.Yet these changes could also set off a cascade of more harmful effects. The plan could shift trillions of dollars of wealth from Americans to foreigners; set off an emerging markets financial crisis; wreak havoc in global oil markets; and cause sustained harm to the American higher education and tourism industries (including, as it happens, luxury hotels with President Trump\u2019s name on them).Welcome to the real world. The tax code has been flawed and inefficient for a very long time, precisely because fixing it could be so terribly disruptive. In a nutshell, the corporate tax issue provides an excellent case study of the problem of \u201cpath dependency\u201d in public policy.But that is not what happened. Instead, lawmakers took what seemed to be a logical approach: They focused on taxing businesses on their profits. Today, that choice shapes arrangements in every corner of the economy. It affects the values of currencies and financial assets. Every business has devised its structure and organization to maximize its advantage within the existing system.Given all that, any fundamental change in the corporate tax code will create powerful ripples \u2014 some quite predictable, others less so \u2014 across the business and financial landscape. Essentially, for a politician trying to decide whether to support the new legislation, the question boils down to whether you think the potential long-term gains are big enough to justify the probable short- and medium-term disruptions.A closer look at the disruptions that moving toward a \u201cdestination-based cash flow tax\u201d would create makes clear why it would be no small event.The tax has a feature called \u201cborder adjustment,\u201d under which exports are not taxed but imports are. That, at first glance, may seem to penalize companies that import goods, like retailers, and subsidize those that export, like makers of jumbo jets. But economists believe the change in the tax code would lead to shifts in the currency markets that offset those moves, namely to a sharp rise in the value of the dollar compared with other currencies.But beyond the obvious problems, the proposed change in the tax code would cascade through the economy in many other ways.A 25 percent rise in the value of the dollar, the most widely used currency on the planet, would have enormous consequences. Supporters think the dollar will rise that much if the plan is enacted \u2014 indeed, it must happen, to avoid sticking Americans with much higher prices for imported consumer goods.That means that a steep run-up in the value of the dollar generally makes those debts more onerous, and causes big trouble for countries including China, South Korea and Turkey. Consider that the Asian financial crisis in 1998, the Latin American crisis in 2001 and an emerging markets slump in 2015 all had their roots in debt problems and a spike in the dollar.What\u2019s more, global markets in oil and other commodities are priced in dollars, so a dollar spike could unleash hard-to-predict reactions from commodity producers. Oil would become much more expensive, and oil price shocks have helped set off recessions in the not-too-distant past.Perhaps the most irony-rich consequence of such a tax overhaul \u2014 which would, presumably, be signed by President Trump \u2014 would be the damage to the tourism and education sectors in the United States. These businesses would have a serious problem, unlike conventional exporters \u2014 companies that ship things overseas, say.For the exporters, the disadvantages caused by a run-up in the dollar would just cancel out the advantage received from changes in the tax system. But businesses that are not exporting anything across the border would suffer from the damage of a more expensive dollar without receiving advantages from border adjustment.All of these sectors would see their prices rise because of the dollar run-up, without any countervailing tax benefit.Lest any of these ripple effects seem like academic abstractions, keep in mind that tax changes can have powerful spillover effects. Some obscure provisions around depreciation rules in the 1986 tax reform act set off a downturn in the commercial real estate industry that, in turn, was a major factor in the 1990 recession.The problem of policy path dependency isn\u2019t limited to the tax system, of course. The Obama administration faced it when it began to overhaul the health care system eight years ago. Many liberals argued that the United States should move toward a Canadian-style system in which the government pays for all health care, called a single-payer system. The Obama team saw that approach as appealing in theory, but too disruptive in practice; so many Americans had become accustomed to receiving health insurance through their employer that it didn\u2019t seem feasible to make a wholesale shift to a new and, perhaps, more efficient system.In other words, decisions that lawmakers made decades or even a century ago have essentially locked us into ways of doing things, as the cost of changing looms more heavily than the potential benefits of trying something different.And people who have much to fear from a change tend to be louder than those who have something to gain, a central dynamic that tilts policy in the United States toward small-c conservatism.All of this is frustrating for anyone who believes that the existing system, whether for corporate taxes or health care, is broken and needs radical reform.

{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen Echoes Trump\u2019s Bleak Populism in French Campaign Kickoff", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLYON, France \u2014 The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen delivered a grim populist kickoff to her burgeoning presidential campaign on Sunday, warning thousands of her flag-waving supporters of \u201ctwo totalitarianisms,\u201d globalization and Islamism, that want to \u201csubjugate France.\u201dMs. Le Pen\u2019s dark picture of a weakened France troubled by bureaucrats and burqas was a striking echo of themes being sounded across the Atlantic. France, a prosperous country with the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, was depicted as a besieged wreck. In a packed hall here, she made a point, in an hourlong speech brimming with nationalist fervor, of praising President Trump and the Americans who had elected him, as her supporters shouted forcefully, \u201cThis is our country!\u201dAmericans, she said, had \u201ckept faith with their national interest,\u201d even as she promised to do the same for France, saying the French had been \u201cdispossessed of their patriotism.\u201dWhether it will sell in a country undoubtedly frightened by terrorism and weary of unemployment hovering around 10 percent is unclear, but it is certain that Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front party is closer than it has ever been to gaining power in France after over 40 years of existence. Polls show that she is very likely to reach at least a second round of voting in France\u2019s two-stage electoral process this spring.The weekend\u2019s campaigning in this prosperous southeastern metropolis \u2014 her likely runoff opponent, Emmanuel Macron, the centrist former economy minister, also drew thousands to a rally across town on Saturday \u2014 offered a taste of the fierce electoral battle to come and a rerun of some of the American election\u2019s dynamic.The populist Ms. Le Pen, 48, offered up a forbidding dystopia in urgent need of radical upheaval, much like Mr. Trump did. The boyish Mr. Macron \u2014 he is 39 and has created a nonparty political movement that has suddenly caught fire \u2014 spoke of \u201creconciling\u201d France and of \u201cworking together,\u201d and repeatedly addressed more than 10,000 supporters in a giant stadium as \u201cmy friends.\u201d France would certainly stay in the European Union, in his view, and there would be none of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s war on globalization.The crowd spilled onto the grounds outside the stadium, forcing many to watch Mr. Macron on huge screens. He took a backhanded slap at Mr. Trump, promising refuge in enlightened France to American scientists, academics and companies \u201cfighting obscurantism\u201d at home. They would have, \u201cas of next May,\u201d the date of the presidential runoff, \u201ca homeland, and that will be France,\u201d Mr. Macron promised.The candidates both present themselves as outsiders \u2014 Mr. Macron served in the Socialist government but is not a Socialist, while Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party has never held power \u2014 but the crowds at the two rallies were a study in contrast. Judging by a dozen-odd interviews, Mr. Macron\u2019s group was peppered with teachers, doctors, academics, civil servants and men who described themselves as \u201cheads of companies.\u201dIn contrast, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s crowd was full of factory workers and former soldiers, and it adored her thundering opening line: \u201cI\u2019m against the Right of money, and the Left of money. I\u2019m the candidate of the people!\u201dStill, the slickly produced two-day National Front event at Lyon\u2019s modernist conference center, full of party functionaries in blazers scurrying about, showed how far the party has come from its disreputable ragtag origins in the early 1970s, when it emerged as a xenophobic coalition of former Nazi collaborators and disgruntled veterans of the Algerian war who had not forgiven the country\u2019s leaders for having agreed to Algeria\u2019s independence \u2014 like Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, the party\u2019s founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen.She has effectively kicked him out of the party. But Ms. Le Pen\u2019s populist tirade echoed with many of the former patriarch\u2019s themes. She delivered her speech against a screen projecting the words \u201cIn the Name of the People,\u201d and it was full of immigrants committing crimes, jihadists plotting attacks and European Union bureaucrats stealing jobs from the French.Ms. Le Pen promised to crack down on all of them. Clearly buoyed by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory after years of electoral defeats in France \u2014 \u201cThe impossible becomes the possible,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said of it \u2014 she offered a sketch of what her presidency might look like. She promised to hold a referendum within six months on European Union membership, which she called a \u201cnightmare,\u201d secure the country\u2019s borders and pull France out of NATO. Foreigners, she said, were eating up France\u2019s social benefits and offering little in return. \u201cOur benefits are distributed to people all over the world,\u201d she said.But in contrast to Mr. Trump, for Ms. Le Pen restoring what she called \u201csovereignty\u201d to France appeared as an end in itself. She offered no return to a golden age of prosperity for her country, promising instead to \u201crestore order\u201d within five years. Ruin was just around the corner, in her telling. \u201cAfter decades of cowardice and laissez-faire, our choice is a choice of civilization,\u201d she said. \u201cWill our children live in a country that is still French and democratic?\u201dThe crowd ate it up. \u201cShe\u2019s got a real program, in the name of the people, for the workers, and by the workers,\u201d said Eric Fusis, a 58-year-old retired military officer from the Doubs. \u201cIt\u2019s for the nation, and not for the financial sector and the banks,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You Might Not Want to Take Away a Billionaire\u2019s Money", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThere is a problem with billionaires: They\u2019ve got way more money than any human deserves.But if you were simply to take it all away from them, you would, in many cases, be doing more harm than good.In my teens, when I saw hungry people on the streets of New York I started to dream of expropriating money from the wealthy to feed the poor. My father, who rose from Depression-era poverty in Scranton, Pa., to modest affluence as a New York City businessman, tried to set me straight on the subject.\u201cThink it through,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might bring some justice to the world and you\u2019d help some needy people. But you\u2019d lose what people like the Rockefellers have done for the common man, the museums, the parks, the libraries, the schools, and the contributions to medical research, and on and on. It\u2019s no small thing.\u201dThen, my dad said, consider the horrendous cost of expropriation in countries that have tried it \u2014 the bloodshed, the lost lives, the ruined families, the economies stunted by revolutionary violence. In the 1980s and 1990s, I spent time as a reporter in countries that had endured such ordeals \u2014 particularly post-Cultural Revolution China and Russia before and after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.That Mr. Mnuchin overlooked perhaps $100 million is unfathomable for many people. It is, in fact, roughly equivalent to the total net worth of more than 1,200 typical American families. And $1 billion is more than 12,000 of those households, according to the Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances of 2013.My father died in September 2015, a month before his 93rd birthday, while the presidential primary campaign was still underway. Income inequality was a big issue. In his insurgent campaign on the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders focused on it directly. Despite his wealth, Mr. Trump addressed it too, indirectly, promising to restore lost jobs and prosperity to downtrodden Americans. And perhaps he will accomplish that.It is not impossible, after all, to imagine a small elite of extremely wealthy people\u2019s presiding over an economy that provides a rising standard of living for everyone else, especially for people at the bottom. America has had wealthy politicians before, Rockefellers among them, and some have attempted such a feat. Two wealthy presidents came from New York \u2014 aristocratic cousins named Roosevelt \u2014 and both pushed for what was sometimes considered \u201crevolutionary\u201d redistribution of wealth in the United States, as my father periodically reminded me.He advocated \u201ca progressive tax on all fortunes beyond a certain amount,\u201d adding that such a tax should make it impossible for \u201cthe owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual.\u201dThat didn\u2019t happen on his watch.But his younger cousin President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a pragmatic Democrat, said in 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression, that it was high time to take risks and help suffering people. \u201cAbove all, try something,\u201d he said. \u201cThe millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach.\u201dChanges in the tax system \u2014 which, for the most part, will favor the wealthy \u2014 are widely expected under the Trump administration and the Republican Congress.My dad isn\u2019t around to discuss any of this now but I know what he would say, and I say it to my own son. I tell him that our flawed civil society is nonetheless precious and that all of us, billionaires included, need to do whatever we can to make it more just.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joyous Africans Take to the Rails, With China\u2019s Help", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDJIBOUTI \u2014 The 10:24 a.m. train out of Djibouti\u2019s capital drew some of the biggest names in the Horn of Africa last month. Serenaded by a chorus of tribal singers, the crush of African leaders, European diplomats and pop icons climbed the stairs of the newly built train station and merrily jostled their way into the pristine, air-conditioned carriages making their inaugural run.\u201cIt is indeed a historic moment, a pride for our nations and peoples,\u201d said Hailemariam Desalegn, the prime minister of Ethiopia, shortly before the train \u2014 the first electric transnational railway in Africa \u2014 headed toward Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. \u201cThis line will change the social and economic landscape of our two countries.\u201dBut perhaps the biggest star of the day was China, which designed the system, supplied the trains and imported hundreds of engineers for the six years it took to plan and build the 466-mile line. And the $4 billion cost? Chinese banks provided nearly all the financing.But few places are being reshaped by China\u2019s overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century.Much of that spending has been directed at rail projects that planners hope will transform the way Africans travel and do business with one another, and the rest of the world.That worries some African officials and longtime experts, who fear the loss of American influence and largess \u2014 and the good will that is often produced by desperately needed infrastructure projects.Amadou Sy, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the United States was also missing opportunities to cultivate loyal customers.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for new markets, Africa is the place to be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, the U.S. is not leveraging Africa\u2019s huge potential. By contrast, the Chinese are there, and they are willing to take risks.\u201dChina is placing more than $14 billion worth of bets here in Djibouti, a geopolitically strategic speck of a country beset by soaring poverty and unemployment. The projects include three ports, two airports and a pipeline that will bring water from Ethiopia, its landlocked neighbor and a regional economic power that depends on Djibouti\u2019s ports for 90 percent of its foreign trade.Also on the drawing board are a series of Chinese-built, coal-fired power plants that would ease summertime electricity failures and help fuel a new tax-free manufacturing zone that officials hope will turn Djibouti into a Hong Kong-style entrep\u00f4t and international shipping hub.Aboubaker Omar Hadi, chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, said he hoped the new railway linking his country to the Ethiopian capital would be just the first leg of a long-dreamed trans-Africa route, from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.\u201cThe train is already a game-changer,\u201d he said, noting that it will cut to 12 hours what until now had been a grueling three- or four-day trip by truck.Mr. Hadi praised the Chinese for going all in after Western banks declined to help finance the nation\u2019s glaring infrastructure needs.\u201cWe approached the U.S., and they didn\u2019t have the vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not thinking ahead 30 years. They only have a vision of Africa from the past, as a continent of war and famine. The Chinese have vision.\u201dNot everyone is comfortable with China\u2019s vision. Some worry about the leverage China wields and what happens when countries fall behind on loan payments.For Djibouti, the debt is especially daunting, amounting to 60 percent of its gross domestic product. But Ilyas Moussa Dawaleh, the country\u2019s finance minister, dismissed such concerns, saying Djibouti\u2019s heady 6.7 percent growth rate would allow it to meet its loan payments.\u201cIf we don\u2019t take this risk now and develop our infrastructure, we will remain stuck in poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cCome back in a few years, and you will find that Djibouti has become the logistics hub of the continent.\u201dOthers worry about the Djiboutian government\u2019s lack of transparency, its authoritarian impulses and a vexing legacy of official corruption. Mohamed Daoud Chehem, a leader of Djibouti\u2019s embattled opposition and a former presidential candidate, said the lack of information about the terms of China\u2019s loans raised questions about potential malfeasance.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about billions of dollars and complete opacity,\u201d he said. \u201cHave there been kickbacks to government officials? There is no way to know.\u201dOthers wonder what will happen to the system after the Chinese leave. European imperialists in Africa built a skein of lines, most of which fell into disrepair in the decades after their colonies achieved independence.Jamie Monson, the author of \u201cAfrica\u2019s Freedom Railway,\u201d a book documenting the legacy of the Chinese-built train linking Tanzania and Zambia, said long-term maintenance could be more challenging than initial construction. Built during the Cold War and hailed as a symbol of Chinese-African friendship, the train, the Tazara Railway, has struggled to maintain regular service, prompting talk of a Chinese takeover.\u201cWithout proper maintenance comes problems, which can have a huge impact on a regional economy and local people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d she said.Although workers from China did much of the technical and engineering work, thousands of Djiboutian and Ethiopian laborers were hired to lay tracks and dig tunnels, helping to head off some of the local resentment that has dogged other Chinese projects in Africa. The system will be operated by Chinese conductors for five years and then turned over to local citizens, many of them trained in China.After a boisterous opening day ceremony in the broiling sun, only the best-connected attendees were allowed to board the train, which filled with applause and song as it glided out of the station.Daha Ahmed Osman, 34, a tech specialist who works for the Djiboutian government, displayed a wide grin as he watched the arid, harshly beautiful landscape spill across the train\u2019s picture windows.He predicted that the new train would transform Djibouti and Ethiopia, and eventually all of Africa. \u201cFor this, we have the Chinese to thank, because they shared with us their money and their technology,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than anything we thank them for showing confidence in us.\u201dAn article on Feb. 8 about the debut of Africa\u2019s first electric transnational railway, built by China, referred incorrectly to the $50 billion a year in financial transactions that affect Chinese companies in Africa. They are earning that amount, not spending it.Advertisement"}

Just for the record, massive military buildups tend to precede a war. My bet would be with Iran, possibly before the midterms. But that\u2019s not the issue here, although it\u2019s scary.There are plenty of theories about this anger. I won\u2019t bore you with them because they\u2019re pretty familiar by now, but what it comes down to is that a lot of people are pretty sure they\u2019re getting cheated. If you think the world has screwed you, you get mad.They notice that the attempt to squeeze the last cent of profit out of any operation has also squeezed the last trace of sentiment out of what passes for human interaction. They see that technology serves relentless efficiency, and somewhere in that efficiency life gets joyless and existence precarious. They note that good unions, retirement benefits, manufacturing jobs, overtime and health care get eliminated or curtailed in pursuit of that last cent.They observe how put-together types with attitude and little qualification can make a bundle buying and eviscerating solid companies that actually produce things or setting up consultancies that trade on connections at the money-influence margins of politics. They know that if something goes wrong with the rigged system the losses will get \u201csocialized.\u201d Regular schmucks who work a shift will pay while insiders walk away. That\u2019s how things have been since the 21st century began. The fix is always in.So why should people not conclude that there\u2019s no moral code any more, no discipline, no parenting, no backbone, and what\u2019s needed is some guy to shake up the system, blow it up, and put some moral standards back and remind everyone once in a while who has the big stick and can use it to keep everyone in their corners?(O.K., the guy in question happens to be a study in immorality, but if you think logic is an adequate guide to human conduct you really need to think again.)Hence that big military buildup after eight years of consistent no-drama common-sense: It\u2019s one of those \u201cintermittently\u201d moments (we were about due).You\u2019re sitting in the middle of the country sharpening dull needles with fingernail files to be sold on the street for $25, or taking too many prescription opioids to calm the nerves before a presentation, or taking the coating off an opioid and cooking it down to liquid form, and straining it and shooting it up, or trying to cope with a couple of foster kids and a criminal record \u2014 and hell the country looks ready for a shake-up. It really does; and this guy is angry for you against all the phony intellectuals who have no idea.Don\u2019t underestimate that anger or the number of Americans who still believe Trump is the most honest president in history.It\u2019s a small thing, but I was on a short British Airways flight the other day from Amsterdam to London and BA in its brilliance wanted to charge me about three bucks for a cup of tea. Talk about the last cent!Now maybe Alex Cruz, the BA chief executive, is a smart guy, but whoever came up with the notion of charging BA customers for a \u201ccuppa\u201d is a fool intoxicated by the bottom line. Next there will be a charge for oxygen.No big deal, except that the system that produces such rip-offs is ripe for the furies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Kelly and Tillerson Visit Mexico, Their Reassurances Differ From Trump\u2019s Stance", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 In the White House, President Trump was telling American chief executives on Thursday that the days of being treated unfairly by Mexico \u2014 on trade, on immigration, on crime \u2014 were over.\u201cYou see what\u2019s happening at the border: All of a sudden, for the first time, we\u2019re getting gang members out,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to his instructions to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a military operation.\u201dBut in Mexico, his homeland security secretary, John F. Kelly, was saying the opposite, trying to tamp down fears of a military operation and to assure the public that American soldiers would not be used to police the border.\u201cI repeat: There will be no use of military in this,\u201d Mr. Kelly said at a news conference on Thursday, appearing with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. \u201cAt least half of you try to get that right, because it continues to come up in your reporting.\u201dMr. Trump has a penchant for dropping unwelcome surprises during visits between the United States and Mexico. Last month, on the first day of a trip to Washington by Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to build a wall between the two countries.Then, this week, just before Mr. Kelly and Mr. Tillerson touched down in Mexico, his administration released policies that vastly expanded the potential for deportation of undocumented immigrants.Mr. Trump is certainly not the only American president to clamp down on illegal immigration. His predecessor, Barack Obama, deported record numbers of immigrants, including gang members. But Mr. Trump\u2019s actions and disparaging remarks about Mexico have helped push relations between the two countries to their lowest point in decades.His steady stream of provocative policies and statements has enraged the Mexican public and left their leaders to consider their own leverage in the event of a meltdown in ties between the two countries, whether on trade, migration or security.On Thursday, the contradictions between the president and his top staff raised a pressing question: Which version of Washington will come to bear on Mexico in the coming months? Will it be the aggressive approach of the president or the more reassuring stance of Mr. Kelly, who will be assigned to oversee some of the proposals likely to antagonize Mexico the most?\u201cLet me be very, very clear,\u201d Mr. Kelly said, assuring Mexicans that the rules for deporting people from the United States had not fundamentally changed \u2014 another possible contradiction of his boss. \u201cThere will be no, repeat no, mass deportations.\u201dThe statements during the visit offered a startling departure from past trips to Mexico by American diplomats. Four officials \u2014 two from Mexico and two from the United States \u2014 walked into a large ballroom with grim faces and made carefully worded comments without taking any questions.It was the kind of cautious staging normally seen after tough negotiations between adversaries, not talks between friendly neighbors. No one suggested that a breakthrough had been made.\u201cTwo strong sovereign countries from time to time will have differences,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray of Mexico called it a \u201ccomplex moment in the relationship.\u201dIn the last month, Mexican officials have shown cautious restraint, and even silence, in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, often to the frustration of the Mexican people.Their logic, officials say, is cleareyed: To descend into a fight with the United States would serve no one, least of all the Mexican people who are spoiling for a harder line against Mr. Trump.But that is not to say the Mexicans are without recourse. While they are hoping to avoid a confrontation, the whispers of discontent have started to spread.The minister of economy has said there will be no trade talks without similar talks on security and migration, twin areas of vulnerability for the United States.And Mr. Videgaray, responding to a directive from Mr. Trump broadening the scope of deportations in America, has vowed to bring to the United Nations any actions by the United States to send non-Mexicans to Mexico.Mexico is keenly aware of its leverage in the bilateral relationship: billions of dollars in agricultural purchases by Mexico, a decade of security cooperation to dismantle cartels and intercept drugs destined for the United States, and the detention of hundreds of thousands of migrants passing through Mexico on their way to America\u2019s southern border.On trade, putting aside the supply chains of vehicles and electronics engineered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, agriculture is a major vulnerability for the United States. Mexico is an immense purchaser of American farm goods.The nation is the No. 1 purchaser of American corn, dairy, pork and rice. Mexico purchased nearly $2 billion of corn in 2016 and also bought large amounts of soybeans, wheat, cotton and beef.A Mexican lawmaker recently proposed a bill to redirect purchases of corn away from the United States, a tactic that could devastate American corn farmers in the heartland of Mr. Trump\u2019s base. Both Brazil and Argentina offer alternatives to the American Corn Belt, experts and officials say.\u201cThere are a lot of jobs in agriculture that are dependent on Nafta in America,\u201d said Gregorio Schneider, the founder of TC Latin America Partners, a New York-based private equity firm that invests in Mexico. \u201cYou are talking about the center of the United States.\u201dOn national security, Mexico also plays a large role. The government could slow down extraditions to the United States, keeping sought-after drug lords like Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, known as El Chapo, instead of sending them north. It could also stop deporting American fugitives who have fled to Mexico.Perhaps more threatening to the United States would be a reconsideration of Mexico\u2019s participation in the drug war. For more than a decade, the Mexican authorities have cooperated in arresting top cartel leaders and intercepting drug shipments destined for the United States.Mexico could also leverage its participation in the sharing of intelligence. The vast majority of drugs funneled \u2014 and tunneled \u2014 through Mexico are not for domestic consumption.\u201cWe receive information from Mexican authorities on a daily basis that helps us better target drugs smugglers at the border,\u201d said Gil Kerlikowske, who was the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection in the Obama administration. \u201cThese are ties we want to strengthen, not weaken.\u201dMr. Kerlikowske said Mexican federal police officers were stationed in Tucson and in Laredo, Tex., where they assist American law enforcement in identifying drug cartels and human smugglers by sharing information in Mexican criminal history databases.Likewise, American Customs and Border Protection officers are assigned to a joint program in Mexico City, where they share information on possible drug traffickers through the use of American law enforcement databases.In 2015, joint operations between the Border Patrol and Mexican law enforcement led to the discovery of 30 drug tunnels and about 80,000 pounds of drugs.Whether policing the southern American border to prevent unwanted migrants from entering the United States or examining passenger manifests to ensure terror-related suspects cannot enter through Mexico, the authorities here have been a critical component of America\u2019s national security strategy.In 2014, Mexico launched Plan Frontera Sur to safeguard its southern border from migrants trying to enter from Central America. The plan has essentially served as a dragnet 1,000 miles south of the Texas border, catching hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans en route to the United States.Some experts and officials have suggested that Mexico could simply ease up on its border patrols, granting passage to large numbers of Central Americans. That would not only swamp the American authorities, but might enable potentially dangerous migrants to slip into the country.Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, tried later in the day to clarify the contradiction between Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Kelly\u2019s remarks. He said that Mr. Trump had not meant to characterize the deportation efforts as a military operation, arguing that the president had been using the word \u201cmilitary\u201d as an adjective.\u201cIt\u2019s being done with precision,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.The meetings here on Thursday produced a modicum of agreement between the United States and Mexico. Both Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Kelly acknowledged the significance of border cooperation to address the flow of migration from Central America to the United States.It is a topic that Mr. Kelly, who led more than 1,000 military personnel of the United States Southern Command, knows something about. He has in the past outlined a more balanced approach to protecting the borders, saying security cannot \u201cbe attempted as an endless series of \u2018goal-line stands\u2019 on the one-foot line at the official ports of entry or along the thousands of miles of border between this country and Mexico.\u201dThis could place him once more at odds with the mandates of his boss, Mr. Trump, whose executive order to build a wall will fall directly among Mr. Kelly\u2019s responsibilities.Elisabeth Malkin and Paulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington.Advertisement"}

In 2013, President Obama, at the express request of the Defense Department, created a program for military families to prevent the deportation of military spouses, parents and children. This program alleviated a major source of anxiety and fear for service members and their families.I have personally experienced the hardship of deployments to combat zones, and know the incredible importance of family stability during that trying time. This week, this administration rescinded the Parole in Place program, harming thousands of military families across the country. This is another example of the careless excess of the administration\u2019s immigration policy.It is unconscionable to reverse a policy that strengthens our military and our veterans. That the program was not even named in the memo demonstrates either a lack of awareness, or worse, a casual disregard of the effect that this will have on those most vulnerable members of our military.

South Korea has several, but the best known outside the country are Hyundai, LG and Samsung. Others include Hanjin, Kumho, Lotte and SK Group.Chaebol are generally conglomerates of affiliated companies. LG, for example, makes smartphones, televisions, electronic components, chemicals and fertilizer. It also owns Korean baseball and basketball teams. Hyundai, which makes the Hyundai and Kia cars that are popular in the United States and other countries, also makes elevators, provides logistics services, and runs hotels and department stores.They rose from the ashes of the Korean War. After the conflict ended, officials steered relief funds and cheap loans to businessmen who promised to rebuild the country. The government also protected homegrown industries from foreign competition to help them develop. The recipe proved to be potent: Chaebol played a major role in South Korea\u2019s rise as an industrial giant in the following decades.South Korea\u2019s recipe for growth also fostered tight ties between the government and businesses.Take the example of Park Chung-hee, a general and the father of the current president, who took power in South Korea after a 1961 coup. He led an effort to rev up the South Korean economy \u2014 and he used many of the companies that became chaebol to do it. His government steered money to companies that chased his economic goals, such as emphasizing exports.The dynamic shifted somewhat as South Korea transitioned to a democracy in the 1980s. By then, the chaebol had become so economically powerful that they held considerable political sway. Politicians began to rely on the companies\u2019 political and financial support to get elected.They are. But time will tell whether it will result in change.Despite those concerns, chaebol executives are widely believed to be treated with kid gloves.

{"Headline": "National Debt Dips. Trump Crows. Well, Sure, but \u2026", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a message posted on Twitter on Saturday, President Trump highlighted a dip in the national debt during his first month in office, contrasting it with an increase in the first month of the Obama administration.The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.The numbers are broadly accurate, but the lack of attention to them is for good reason: Neither president bore responsibility for changes in the federal debt in his opening month in the White House. The slight decline cited by Mr. Trump \u2014 a drop of 0.06 percent, according to Treasury data \u2014 is a temporary fluctuation, not a change in direction.The federal debt is determined by the government\u2019s decisions about taxing and spending, and by the strength of the American economy. The debt was increasing rapidly in early 2009 because the economy was in free fall, and because of policy decisions made during the administration of President George W. Bush.The exact amount of the debt bounces around that trend line because the Treasury borrows money by selling securities with maturities \u2014 or repayment dates \u2014 ranging from 28 days to 30 years. That creates an irregular pattern of inflows and outflows from the federal cash box.The president leveled his complaint on Twitter not long after Herman Cain, a former Republican presidential candidate, raised a similar criticism on \u201cFox and Friends Weekend.\u201dThe daily Treasury reports also show that the national debt increased by $212 billion from Jan. 20 to Feb. 20 in 2009.Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, issued a statement applauding the president for focusing on the national debt while noting that \u201cthe improvement this early in his term has to do with normal fluctuations in spending and revenues rather than new policies he has implemented.\u201dWhile presidents do not exert immediate influence over the size of the national debt, Mr. Trump will have his chance to make an impact.He has proposed tax cuts that would reduce federal revenues, as well as tariffs on imports that would have the opposite effect. He has also proposed reducing federal spending in some areas while increasing it in others, like defense and infrastructure.The performance of the economy will also play an important role. Economic growth generates more tax revenue and reduces federal spending on social welfare programs.The national debt increased sharply during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term as the government increased spending in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The debt grew more slowly during his second term as the economy improved and tax increases brought more money into the government\u2019s coffers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Treads Cautiously With Trump. So Far.", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut some question how long their caution will last in the face of a Trump administration that has brought a new level of hostility and confrontation to a relationship that under President Barack Obama was stable, if brittle.Mr. Trump added his own blustery Twitter message as a prelude to the American actions:Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the American-educated diplomat who has been the country\u2019s most prominent spokesman to the West, publicly played down the Trump administration\u2019s threats on Friday in a restrained rejoinder via his own Twitter account:Other Iranian officials have also responded mildly to the Trump administration.A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, said on Thursday, \u201cIt is a shame that the U.S. government, instead of thanking the Iranian nation for their continued fight against terrorism, keeps repeating unfounded claims and adopts unwise policies that are effectively helping terrorist groups.\u201dMr. Flynn also made clear that the challenge to Iran extended beyond the missile test, holding Tehran responsible for an attack on a Saudi warship by Houthi rebels in Yemen, who the United States says are supported by Iran. Iran denies that, but the remark was taken as a veiled warning about Iran\u2019s support of regional proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shiite militias in Iraq.\u201cThe Trump administration condemns actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout the Middle East and place American lives at risk,\u201d Mr. Flynn said on Wednesday.\u201cTrump is not predictable for Americans, not for Europeans and not for us,\u201d said Nader Karimi Joni, an analyst close to the government of President Hassan Rouhani. \u201cHe and his team are not trustworthy. They will not honor any agreement. Nothing good is coming from this.\u201dCertainly not for Mr. Rouhani, a moderate who came to power promising to ratchet down tensions with the West, cinch a nuclear deal and get Iran\u2019s economy moving again. Now, all those goals are in jeopardy, and Mr. Rouhani\u2019s re-election this spring is far from assured.On Thursday, an aide to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks \u201chollow rants\u201d and said that they \u201cwould bring losses for his country\u2019s national interest.\u201d And a former foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said that Iran would continue to test missiles.Mr. Trump has filled his foreign policy team with advisers like Mr. Flynn and the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, who consider Iran to be the greatest cause of instability in the Middle East, if not the world, and who say the Obama administration treated Tehran with kid gloves.When Iran test-fired a missile on Sunday, it did not announce the launching on state television, something the country\u2019s leadership usually likes to do to send a message to its adversaries. Missile tests are commonplace in Iran, but Sunday\u2019s muted approach was clearly meant to test the Trump administration\u2019s reaction.Mr. Flynn did not elaborate on what he meant by saying Iran was on notice. But in Iran, many agreed that whatever it meant, it did not bode well.\u201cWhen they say we are put on notice, it means we should be very careful,\u201d said Soroush Farhadian, a reformist journalist. \u201cWe need self-restraint. Our military men need to be prevented from making blunders. One incident in the Persian Gulf can lead to conflict right now.\u201dIn recent months, speedboats belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have made a practice of aggressively approaching United States naval vessels, then veering off. During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed that if they tried that under his watch, he would \u201cblow them out of the water.\u201d There have been no reported incidents since Mr. Trump took office.Ayatollah Khamenei was uncharacteristically quiet during a visit on Thursday to the martyr\u2019s graves, usually a moment for brief remarks about current affairs. Mr. Rouhani\u2019s position is more delicate. He has been promoting ties with the United States. And though he executed the nuclear agreement with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader has also been critical of the deal.Having tied his political future to the nuclear agreement and having promised to normalize relations with the West, Mr. Rouhani is rapidly losing influence, analysts say. He now finds himself faced with an American travel ban for his citizens and an American president who thinks the nuclear pact \u201cis a really, really bad deal.\u201dHard-liners are deeply critical of Mr. Rouhani and are increasingly dismissing him as a figure of the past, a man who may have been the right answer in the Obama era but is the wrong one now. Many expect the next president to be a far more combative figure, in the mold of the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\u201cFor this Trump, we need to talk and act tough,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst. \u201cMr. Rouhani speaks beautiful words, but they are empty.

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Taboos, Once a Bulwark Against the Far Right, May Now Be Enabling It", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterPOTSDAM, Germany \u2014 As the far right rises across Europe, its ascent in Germany has seemed among the most alarming and puzzling.For decades, Germany was thought to be inoculated against far-right politics by its history with Naziism and the Holocaust. But today, Germany is experiencing a resurgence of the right \u2014 driven, at least in part, by its effort to overcome past misdeeds by suppressing any vestige of nationalism.Since World War II, trying to define the German national identity, much less celebrate it, has been taboo. Doing so was seen as a possible step toward the kind of nationalism that once enabled the Nazi regime. Flags were frowned upon, as was standing for the national anthem.But spurred by a sense of lost control over the country\u2019s borders, economy and politics, many Germans are reaching for a shared identity but finding only an empty space. Into that vacuum slipped the Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing party with recent polls showing support at 12 percent, ahead of some mainstream parties.Only the AfD, whose populism puts it far outside of mainstream political norms, is openly promising to fulfill a desire for patriotism that would be routine in most other countries.The result is that a social and political norm intended to stifle the far right is now empowering it. That focus on identity has allowed the AfD, even if it is unlikely to win enough votes to govern, to shape the national conversation to its advantage, and to present itself as the champion of ordinary Germans.The AfD rally in a snowy square in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, was scheduled to last precisely 30 minutes. It started promptly, ran like clockwork and ended with an instruction to the crowd to pick up any litter on the ground.Such respect for rules and punctuality is something Germans are good at, said several attendees, who clustered in the glow of the small stage, stomping their feet against the numbing cold.But mostly the mood was one of frustration. A woman in a shearling coat, who asked not to be named out of fear of anti-right-wing discrimination, said that she hoped the AfD would help heal Germany\u2019s \u201cbroken self-confidence.\u201dA chemist with a doctorate, she personified the way that Germany\u2019s identity gap has allowed the AfD to extend its appeal beyond the far-right fringe and into the middle-class mainstream.\u201cOnly in Germany, I found it very strange, people don\u2019t want to say \u2018I am German,\u2019 \u201d she said. Because the party was the only one willing to challenge that taboo, it was the AfD\u2019s message she absorbed.\u201cIt is easier to say what you are against than what you are for,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this might be more true in Germany, where the national identity was built on \u2018never again.\u2019 \u201dFor decades, German politicians worked to layer any sense of Germanness beneath a European identity.The influx of refugees into the country in recent years has caused particular stress, Professor Ben-Ghiat said. \u201cIn Germany, you\u2019re not even allowed to say you\u2019re proud to be German. You have to say you\u2019re European,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when these people come in, what are they left with?\u201dWhen people feel a loss of control, they seek a stronger connection to a group identity, and also become more interested in making their group more powerful, Professor Fritsche said he had found in his research. Germany\u2019s traditional political parties have been reluctant to indulge that desire because of political taboos. But the AfD has proved adept at exploiting it.That strategy was on full display the night of Jan. 17 at a beer hall in Dresden, ground zero for Germany\u2019s far-right movement. Hundreds of AfD supporters had gathered for a speech by Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, one of the party\u2019s fastest-rising figures.Addressing the crowd, Mr. H\u00f6cke looked every inch the ordinary German politician, besuited and with a white-toothed grin and an unseasonable tan. But what he said went far beyond the norms of German politics.Germans are \u201cthe only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,\u201d he said, a thinly veiled reference to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. Germans had \u201cthe mentality of a totally vanquished people,\u201d he argued, but it was time for the country to re-embrace its history and develop a positive relationship with its identity.The crowd\u2019s applause shook the floors, a noisy manifestation of how thrilling transgression can feel in a rule-bound society.\u201cThe foundation of being able to move forward is identity,\u201d Mr. H\u00f6cke later elaborated in an interview. \u201cThere is no people that has given more to humanity than Germany. It is a great and old people, and it would be sad if it were to sink.\u201dMr. H\u00f6cke is an extreme figure within his own party, and his speech provoked a backlash from AfD\u2019s national leadership. But his message demonstrates how the party has broadened its appeal: by telling Germans they should have a proud national identity, a message that in Germany could come only from the political fringes.That has resonated with middle-class supporters like Julian W\u00e4lder, 21, a law student who had helped to organize the event in Dresden. He said that his journey to the AfD began with his frustration at the identity taboo.\u201cThe definition we have right now of tolerance in the German political landscape is self-deprecating to a degree that it\u2019s actually self-destructive,\u201d Mr. W\u00e4lder said. \u201cEverything will be tolerated except for being a German.\u201dFocusing on identity allows the AfD to present itself as a protector of ordinary people \u2014 punching up against the nation\u2019s political elite, rather than attacking vulnerable refugees portrayed by the party as a threat to the nation.That approach, accusing the elite of stifling debate over German history and culture, could be especially appealing to Germans desperate to restore a sense of control over their country.\u201cThis will be very attractive to people who perceive their own lives as without control,\u201d Professor Fritsche said.But as mainstream parties become more focused on defending against the far-right upstarts, the AfD\u2019s populist agenda is trickling into their policies and messaging \u2014 raising the possibility that the party\u2019s political influence could outpace its electoral gains.Frauke Petry, the party\u2019s national chairwoman, said that the AfD\u2019s ideas were already shaping the national conversation, even if they were not yet able to shape national legislation.Professor Fritsche\u2019s research suggests that Ms. Petry could be correct, as right-wing parties become more visible. \u201cWhat would really be dangerous is to have a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in which people feel a likely right-wing shift, and this leads to a perceived norm shift,\u201d he said.There are signs that is already happening. Chancellor Angela Merkel opened her re-election bid in December by announcing a more populist agenda. She took a harder line on immigration and called for a ban on Islamic veils that cover the full face, saying they \u201cdo not belong to us\u201d and should be \u201cforbidden wherever that is legally possible.\u201dAnd although she did not name the AfD directly, she expressly tried to reclaim the identity issue, saying that who \u201cthe people\u201d are was something for all to decide, \u201cnot just a few, no matter how loud they are.\u201dMr. H\u00f6cke was unmoved by her rightward shift. He called Mrs. Merkel a \u201cchancellor-dictator\u201d who had broken German law by opening the country\u2019s borders to refugees, and he demanded an end to her \u201cregime.\u201d\u201cWe Germans have to be self-aware,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cWe can see our state falling apart; it\u2019s falling apart before our eyes. It\u2019s about survival.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Below are excerpts from the conversation.What\u2019s your read on Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee order?We didn\u2019t become the sixth most powerful economy in the world by kicking people out of our state. Whether it was the Okies or the Mexican immigrants or the folks who have made Silicon Valley what it is today, we welcome people who want to work hard.... So we\u2019re not interested in denying people an opportunity to make our state better simply because they come from a particular part of the world or practice a particular religion. And quite honestly, I don\u2019t think the U.S. Constitution looks at it that way either.What about the threat to withhold money from sanctuary cities?If all of the sudden you allowed a pseudo King George Washington to essentially say, \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t want to do what I want you to do? Then I\u2019m going to take your money.\u2019 No. You\u2019re essentially getting to be king one way or the other. And you\u2019d be an intrusive federal government.And so there are standards by which the federal government can utilize resources \u2014 funds which, by the way, have come from the very citizens of the state of California that the federal government may want to deny the funds to.Is there any impediment to the government deporting California\u2019s unauthorized immigrants?The Constitution was as much a document to keep the federal government from intruding on what the states wanted to do as it was a document to bind them together as a United States of America.... And so when it comes to public safety, that\u2019s not up to the federal government to tell Los Angeles, Sacramento or the state of California how to go about conducting the enforcement of laws to provide public safety.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)To escape the madding crowd, San Franciscans need not go far.Omar Huerta, 26, shared a view he captured in December of the sunset peeking through the park\u2019s trees.In the late 1800s, Lands End was developed as a seaside destination.He also built the Sutro Baths, a three-acre complex of fresh and saltwater swimming pools that was open to all.

{"Headline": "How Trump Might Become a Workplace Disrupter", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdventures in CapitalismLet\u2019s say Donald J. Trump wants to make good on his promise to improve the lives of American workers.Let\u2019s imagine this White House, which came to power free from the political debts typically owed to unions or Wall Street, is genuinely focused on helping the nation\u2019s miners, waitresses and Uber drivers.What, then, should President Trump do?This is a potentially transformative moment, not just within politics, but also inside millions of companies grappling with a changing economy and expanding worker demands. So over the past few weeks, I asked more than two dozen labor thinkers \u2014 from both the right and left; former officials and government skeptics; union leaders and strident capitalists \u2014 what kinds of federal innovations could remake American working life. I particularly asked for bipartisan ideas.In general, and surprisingly, there is broad enthusiasm about the future of American work (even as there are sharp disagreements about whether this president\u2019s policies will help or hurt workers).\u201cThere are lots of new opportunities we wouldn\u2019t have even dreamed about a few decades ago,\u201d said Andy Stern, former president of the S.E.I.U., one of the largest labor unions. \u201cThere are great ideas out there, and people who want to experiment. But so much depends on what the government is willing to encourage.\u201dIn particular, say both corporate chieftains and organized labor advocates, there is an opportunity for agencies like the Labor Department to become innovation catalysts, using technology to rethink how workers are trained and find jobs. The government could revolutionize employee benefits by making them more portable. And federal departments could become knowledge centers, spreading good ideas from state to state.Many of these ideas draw on the creativity that has remade places like Silicon Valley. Take, for instance, how the internet has changed the way white-collar workers find jobs.\u201cYou don\u2019t find a lot of blue-collar workers on LinkedIn,\u201d said Seth Harris, deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama. \u201cBut the unemployment system reaches tens of millions of blue-collar workers each year. If government got more sophisticated about using technology to train workers with the skills companies need, and to encourage online job matching, that could transform things.\u201dImproving job training isn\u2019t a far-fetched concept. Nearly every major university and college now offers online curriculums that evolve, semester to semester, in response to new technologies or what employers say they are looking for. But those innovations have not much influenced how the Labor Department spends billions each year on training for unemployed workers.\u201cThere\u2019s strong bipartisan support for work force development,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cBut right now, the private sector changes so quickly that by the time we get a training program in place to help out-of-work truck drivers learn computer programming, what we\u2019re teaching is out of date. We can change that.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, the Labor Department is perfectly poised to use technology to reduce what is known as \u201cfrictional unemployment\u201d \u2014 in which jobs go unfilled because workers and companies have trouble finding each other.Most online career marketplaces, like LinkedIn, cater to college-educated professionals. But, as Mr. Harris pointed out, LinkedIn is not primarily designed to help waiters or home health aides find work. And because such workers often have less money to pay for online memberships, those kinds of networks are less likely to emerge on their own.However, Mr. Trump\u2019s new labor secretary could create those marketplaces, as well as encourage companies to train people on the job. \u201cWe need more apprenticeship programs,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.Right now, such programs are hobbled by regulations that make it hard for companies to take on midcareer interns. But \u201cthere\u2019s support from both parties for helping workers learn,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a partisan issue.\u201dThis White House could also expand the concept of employment to benefit the millions of Americans who are freelancers, independent contractors or otherwise part of the \u201cgig economy.\u201d\u201cIf you make it easier to hire more people, that\u2019s both pro-business and pro-worker,\u201d said Oren Cass, the domestic policy director of Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. But in recent decades, as courts and regulators tussled over what, exactly, constitutes an employee, \u201cwe\u2019ve made it harder to hire, even as it\u2019s gotten easier to become Uber, a company that succeeds with hardly any formal employees,\u201d Mr. Cass said.Companies like Uber are terrified to offer benefits like health care. At Uber, for example, that increases the chances that a court will declare a driver an employee, which requires Uber to pay insurance and taxes, and makes the company liable if a driver harasses a passenger or causes an accident.\u201cBut what if there was a category of employment that was somewhere between a full-time employee and an independent contractor?\u201d Mr. Cass asked. \u201cWhat if Uber could say to a driver, \u2018We\u2019re willing to contribute to your health care costs, but we don\u2019t want to be on the hook for everything.\u2019\u201dCreating a new category of employment could be risky for workers. Companies could opt to do away with formal employees altogether, and make it harder for workers to organize to fight for their rights. But such innovations could also be paired with flexible protections for workers, like \u201cportable benefits.\u201d Government policies could let employees transfer their health care plans or 401(k) accounts as easily as they switch cellphone carriers. That might push companies to compete for workers with the same ferocity that Verizon battles AT&T.Ideas like these have been around for a while, but have been stymied by old political divisions. Mr. Trump, however, is a disruptive force.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity right now for the Labor Department to redefine its role, to help people stop thinking about the relationship between companies and workers as always win-lose,\u201d said Eric Liu, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton and author of the forthcoming \u201cYou\u2019re More Powerful Than You Think: A Citizen\u2019s Guide to Making Change Happen.\u201d\u201cIf Trump is smart, he\u2019ll start stealing ideas from the right and left,\u201d Mr. Liu added.He could also steal from successful companies by publicizing good ideas. Companies like Costco and Allstate, which have prospered by giving employees higher wages and better benefits, deserve more attention. They haven\u2019t been feted by this administration yet, but they should be. The White House should also propagandize the workplace nudges and experiments that help both workers and a company\u2019s bottom line.It is, of course, unclear if these are the kinds of ideas Mr. Trump or his cabinet will embrace. But there are strong reasons to hope they might. Mr. Trump was elected largely by workers. He is, uniquely, a president not beholden to union orthodoxies or industrial dogmas.In the most recent election, workers showed how powerfully they can upend political prognostications when they want to \u2014 and how much they are willing to cross party lines to get what they want.\u201cI\u2019m not at all convinced Trump actually cares about workers,\u201d Mr. Perez said. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to be surprised.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Romanians Against Corruption", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAt least the Romanian government didn\u2019t trot out the usual justifications when it enacted a measure easing penalties for official corruption \u2014 that it greases the wheels in moribund bureaucracies, that it augments the wages of underpaid civil servants, that it rewards enterprise. It made its move stealthily on the night of Jan. 31 with an \u201cemergency decree,\u201d which does not require parliamentary approval.Official corruption runs deep in Romania. In recent years, however, Romanians have been heartened by the successes of a special anticorruption agency, the National Anticorruption Directorate, which has brought thousands of cases to court, including some that involve senior officials.Among them is Liviu Dragnea, the powerful head of the Social Democrats, who is ineligible to be prime minister because he is serving a two-year suspended sentence for electoral fraud and is facing abuse-of-power charges. His party decisively won elections in December, a year after it was ousted by similar protests. Like the elected leaders in Hungary and Poland, the Social Democrats took their victory as a mandate to do whatever it takes to pursue their aims. The party proposed a law to pardon those serving five years or less for certain crimes \u2014 a measure it said was intended to ease overcrowding in prisons. Then came the \u201cemergency decree\u201d that, among other things, would not send officials to prison if their take was less than 200,000 lei ($47,000).It is not entirely clear whether the measures would have cleared Mr. Dragnea to serve as prime minister. But it looked that way to the public. Even after the decree\u2019s withdrawal, protesters persisted \u2014 under Romanian law, if the decree was in effect even briefly, the exonerations may have taken effect.Mr. Dragnea and his allies blamed political foes for the protests. But the Romanians in the streets were not there to assail a specific party. They were there to demand a real end to the corruption that pervades their political culture and saps their economy and their democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Farmers Backed Trump, but Now Fear Losing Field Workers", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMERCED, Calif. \u2014 Jeff Marchini and others in the Central Valley here bet their farms on the election of Donald J. Trump. His message of reducing regulations and taxes appealed to this Republican stronghold, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest bases of support in the state.As for his promises about cracking down on illegal immigrants, many assumed Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges were mostly just talk. But two weeks into his administration, Mr. Trump has signed executive orders that have upended the country\u2019s immigration laws. Now farmers here are deeply alarmed about what the new policies could mean for their workers, most of whom are unauthorized, and the businesses that depend on them.\u201cEverything\u2019s coming so quickly,\u201d Mr. Marchini said. \u201cWe\u2019re not loading people into buses or deporting them, that\u2019s not happening yet.\u201d As he looked out over a crew of workers bent over as they rifled through muddy leaves to find purple heads of radicchio, he said that as a businessman, Mr. Trump would know that farmers had invested millions of dollars into produce that is growing right now, and that not being able to pick and sell those crops would represent huge losses for the state economy. \u201cI\u2019m confident that he can grasp the magnitude and the anxiety of what\u2019s happening now.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies could transform California\u2019s Central Valley, a stretch of lowlands that extends from Redding to Bakersfield. Approximately 70 percent of all farmworkers here are living in the United States illegally, according to researchers at University of California, Davis. The impact could reverberate throughout the valley\u2019s precarious economy, where agriculture is by far the largest industry. With 6.5 million people living in the valley, the fields in this state bring in $35 billion a year and provide more of the nation\u2019s food than any other state.The consequences of a smaller immigrant work force would ripple not just through the orchards and dairies, but also to locally owned businesses, restaurants, schools and even seemingly unrelated industries, like the insurance market.Many here feel vindicated by the election, and signs declaring \u201cVote to make America great again\u201d still dot the highways. But in conversations with nearly a dozen farmers, most of whom voted for Mr. Trump, each acknowledged that they relied on workers who provided false documents. And if the administration were to weed out illegal workers, farmers say their businesses would be crippled. Even Republican lawmakers from the region have supported plans that would give farmworkers a path to citizenship.\u201cIf you only have legal labor, certain parts of this industry and this region will not exist,\u201d said Harold McClarty, a fourth-generation farmer in Kingsburg whose operation grows, packs and ships peaches, plums and grapes throughout the country. \u201cIf we sent all these people back, it would be a total disaster.\u201dMr. McClarty is not just concerned about his business, but also about his work force, he said. Many of them have worked for him year-round for more than a decade, making at least $11 an hour. After immigration officials audited his employee records a few years ago, he was forced to let go of dozens of employees.\u201cThese people had been working for us for a long time, and we depended on them.\u201dMany growers here and across the country are hopeful that the new administration will expand and simplify H-2A visas, which allow them to bring in temporary workers from other countries for agricultural jobs. California farmers have increasingly come to rely on the program in the last few years.But Mr. McClarty and others say that legalizing the existing work force should be the first priority. While they support the idea of deporting immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, they oppose forcing people to leave the country for minor crimes, like driving without a license. Since the election, they have continued to call their congressional representatives and lobbied through trade associations, like the Western Growers Association, whose chief executive is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s agricultural advisory board.Farmers are also anxiously awaiting the administration\u2019s plans to alter longstanding trade agreements. Mr. Trump has said he will pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement if he cannot negotiate better terms for the United States. Growers would benefit if Mr. Trump negotiated more favorable terms. But backing out of the agreement entirely could provoke retaliation from Mexico that would hurt California\u2019s agricultural industry, which earned $21 billion from trade last year.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s programming computers or picking in fields,\u201d he said, \u201cAny time you\u2019re admitting substitutes for American labor you depress wages and working conditions and deter Americans.\u201dThe prospect has business owners in the valley on edge. Patricia Pantoj runs a travel agency in Madera, north of Fresno, where the city\u2019s approximately 60,000 residents are predominantly Latino and work in the fields. This year, she said, fewer people than ever before traveled back to their hometowns in Mexico.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to risk it,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is scared, even if they have papers.\u201dA few doors away from the travel agency, Maria Valero said all the customers at her gift shop were undocumented.\u201cIf they went away, I would be out of business tomorrow,\u201d she said.Jhovani Segura, an insurance agent in Firebaugh, near the southern end of the valley, said that as much as 80 percent of their new car insurance policies came from undocumented immigrants who, under a new state law, became eligible for driver\u2019s licenses in 2015.\u201cIf there were mass deportations, we would have to cancel half of our policies,\u201d he said.In Ceres, north of Merced, the public school district is the largest employer by a large number, and many of the jobs were created to support the children of immigrants. Administrators say any crackdown would result in huge job losses and would reduce funding, which is distributed by the state based on need, for all the children in the district.Most of the workers in Mr. McClarty\u2019s vineyards and orchards have well-established lives in the area.Javier Soto, 46, bought a home for his family of five in Reedley, a city of 25,000 that calls itself \u201cthe world\u2019s fruit basket.\u201d He has worked for Mr. McClarty\u2019s farm for the last six years and his supervisor knows he is here without papers.\u201cIt is more scary now that he is really the president and we see what he is doing,\u201d Mr. Soto said.They are hopeful Mr. Trump will not make good on most of his threats. \u201cQuien m\u00e1s habla, menos hace,\u201d they tell each other \u2014 the more you talk, the less you do. There are too many of them, they reason, to throw them all out.\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting and praying, hoping that somebody can convince them that we are not hurting anyone by being here,\u201d said Isabel Rios, 49, who has been picking grapes for the last two decades. Like most women in the fields, she covers her face with a bandanna to protect against the blaring sun, dust and pesticides. Her two children, 9 and 18, are American-born citizens and she worries what will happen to them if she is sent back to Mexico. \u201cWho will benefit if we are not here?\u201dMr. Marchini, the radicchio farmer, said he felt similarly after seeing generations of workers on his family farm send their children to college and join the middle class. Mr. Marchini\u2019s family has farmed in the valley for four generations and he grew up working side by side with Mexican immigrants.He said that no feasible increase in wages or change in conditions would be enough to draw native-born Americans back into the fields.It was the other conservatives, Mr. Marchini said, who were out of touch about how to deal with foreign workers. \u201cIf you find a way to get in here,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a need for what you do.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a Central Valley farmer in some later references. As noted in earlier references, he is Harold McClarty, not McClatchy.An article on Friday about farmers in California\u2019s Central Valley worried about President Trump\u2019s immigration policy misstated the northern edge of the geographical region. The Central Valley stretches from Bakersfield, in the south, to Redding \u2014 not Sacramento \u2014 in the north.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Immigrant Shock: Can California Predict the Nation\u2019s Future?", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemographic ShiftThe political ads warned that illegal immigrants were dashing, by the millions, over the Mexican border, racing to claim taxpayer-funded public services in California.Not: Are we post-racial? But: How will we handle the racial change that is only going to accelerate?Sociological studies suggest that increasing contact between groups can yield familiarity and tolerance. But it can also unnerve, especially in communities where that rapid change is most visible \u2014 and when politicians stand to gain by exploiting it. California lashed out at diversity before embracing it.\u201cThe United States just went through its Prop. 187 moment,\u201d Mr. Pastor said of this presidential election. The question is whether the rest of the country can adjust faster to demographic change \u2014 or with less conflict \u2014 than California did. \u201cWhy go through all of our pain? That was no fun, and it dashed a lot of people\u2019s lives. We underinvested in education. We over-imprisoned, so we got a lot of people locked out of the labor market. We broke apart a lot of families because of anti-immigrant sentiments. We did a lot of stupid things to ourselves.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s example suggests that the very demographic trend Democrats believe will benefit them in the long run could aid Republicans in the near term. At least, that remains true so long as Republican candidates like Mr. Trump or Mr. Wilson position themselves in opposition to immigration or policies perceived as aiding minorities.Mr. Trump fared particularly well in the parts of the country where demographic change is accelerating. Scholars say that it\u2019s the change in diversity that helps explain how a community responds. So an influx of Hispanics into Chicago may not be noticeable, but a few new immigrant families into small-town Pennsylvania is.Map the most diverse corners of the country, and historical gateways like Chicago pop out.But look instead where the recent change has been sharpest \u2014 typically starting with a modest number of nonwhite residents \u2014 and a different set of places emerges.In the general election, voters were more likely to shift to Mr. Trump in the counties with the strongest growth in the Hispanic and nonwhite populations since 2000, according to research from a coming book by Ryan Enos, a Harvard political scientist. It appears in survey data, Mr. Enos argues, that this shift in 2016 was driven by whites who had previously voted Democratic \u2014 and who don\u2019t appear to have responded in the same way to rising diversity before Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.The long-term Democratic bet on demographic destiny assumes that minority voters who support the party today will continue to in the future. But it also assumes that today\u2019s white Democrats will stay with the party as the context around them shifts. Evidence like Mr. Enos\u2019s suggests there\u2019s no guarantee, particularly regarding the timeline of tolerance. White voters in California may have eventually been persuaded that their Hispanic neighbors were no threat to the local economy or their children\u2019s classrooms, but white voters in Midwestern small towns may have been unnerved by the change around them enough for a meaningful shift in votes in this past election.But it\u2019s also happening because nonimmigrant minorities have been dispersing from central cities. And they\u2019re all moving to places with less experience incorporating difference.\u201cLook at New York: For generations, one of its functions in some ways has been to absorb newcomers,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cContrast that with smaller towns in, say, the Midwest. While many of those at some point long ago had ethnic diversity \u2014 there were Germans and English and maybe some Dutch mixed in \u2014 they don\u2019t really have that kind of institutional infrastructure.\u201dThe smaller towns may not have many classes in which English is taught as a second language, or elections with significant nonwhite voting blocs.\u201cWhen I talk to people about their concerns about immigration, they often talk about language,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cThey talk about being uncomfortable having to \u2018press 1 for English,\u2019 or seeing Spanish-language signs. They talk about the feeling of dispossession that comes from having lived for a long time in a community and seeing it change.\u201d\u201cIn this brew that generates anti-immigrant sentiment, there needs to be a politicizing factor,\u201d Mr. Hopkins said. \u201cThere needs to be a politician, a set of politicians, or a party who call attention to immigration, who make it an issue.\u201dThere needs to be, well, a Mr. Trump.There is no neat tipping point, no level of diversity beyond which the backlash inevitably gives way to greater tolerance. The volume of political bluster matters. So does the level of segregation, because diversity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean communities are integrating. So does the kind of contact that occurs when different groups bump up against one another.That\u2019s a different kind of contact than occurs when we pass strangers in the supermarket aisle, or encounter Spanish-language signs. And even in the most demographically diverse cities, there is often little integration of schools, neighborhoods and workplaces.In Mr. Enos\u2019s earlier work, he found that white voters in the most segregated counties nationally were five to six percentage points less likely to vote for Barack Obama in 2008 than white voters in the least segregated places, with a similar effect within states. That suggests that the nature of contact matters not just for disarming prejudice but for shaping politics. And often, when new groups come into a community, they immediately segregate.\u201cThat happens very quickly, and you have this period where you have the worst possible circumstances for intergroup relations,\u201d Mr. Enos said. A new, growing group raises threat levels for longtime residents. And with segregation and without enough time, the two have little chance for positive interaction. \u201cWho knows how long that time lasts,\u201d Mr. Enos said, \u201cbut at some point that worst possible circumstance eases.\u201dCalifornia moves on as Arizona, with its later waves of demographic change, takes up the vanguard of anti-immigration politics. Communities develop the institutions they lacked. The political advantages of exploiting change recede.\u201cIn the long run, America is pretty good at coming to terms with that and moving past it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the long term is measured in terms of decades.\u201dIt may be measured in the difference between where California is today and where the country is about to go.An earlier version of this article misstated the academic affiliation of Daniel Hopkins, a political scientist. He works at the University of Pennsylvania, not Penn State.Advertisement"}

Skyscrapers don\u2019t exist; instead there are captivating gingerbread-style houses with fanciful latticework. The local cuisine, which reflects its hodgepodge of cultures, is intriguing and delicious but not fancy: The best meals are eaten on the street and at cafeteria-style counters, not in high-end restaurants, which tend to be Europeanized.

Head for the cluster of white tents, bright lights and music and stroll through, picking up corn soup flavored with vinegar and studded with chunks of carrots and corn on the cob, pholourie (dumplings, lightly fried and served with a sweet dipping sauce), chicken feet and cow heels pickled with slices of cucumber (called souse). Then finish with a bag of the sweet and savory \u201cchow\u201d: slices of peeled fruit, often underripe mango, salted and doused with a peppery garlic sauce. Dinner for two, around 100 Trinidad/Tobago dollars, or about $15. Vendors on the perimeter of the park will open a fresh coconut for 10 dollars. Drive north from the Green Market to Maracas Bay, along a narrow road of hairpin turns with gorgeous views from the cliffs\u2019 edge down to the water. Maracas Bay is the most popular beach within reach of the capital, and on Saturdays it can get crowded with people swimming in the clean, warm sea backed by lush green hills.

{"Headline": "China and North Korea Reveal Sudden, and Deep, Cracks in Their Friendship", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 For decades, North Korea could count on China as a loyal ally despite the erratic behavior of the ruling Kim dynasty. Beijing held its tongue, even as its neighbor engaged in saber rattling, nuclear testing and bombastic threats.\u201cAt first many people thought it was a fake commentary,\u201d Cheng Xiaohe, associate professor of international studies at Renmin University, said of the tirade against China, published in the North\u2019s state-run news media on Thursday. \u201cIt is a big surprise that North Korea has launched such a strong attack against China. I expected an angry reaction \u2014 but not this strong.\u201dThe disclosure that a chemical weapon banned under international treaties was used in the attack is sure to put more pressure on China\u2019s relations with North Korea, which some Chinese analysts say are at their lowest point since the founding of the North as a separate country after World War II.The disclosure \u201cmakes things worse,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to kill the half brother. It\u2019s more wrong to have used banned chemical agents.\u201dEarlier this month, the North issued a more indirect takedown of Beijing in its government newspaper Minju Joson, signaling a growing rift. Shortly afterward, China announced the suspension of coal imports.The burst of criticisms from Pyongyang \u2014 coupled with Beijing\u2019s coal ban \u2014 suggested boiling tensions between China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, 63, who sees himself as a global leader, and Mr. Kim, 33, an eccentric dictator.Mr. Xi is said to have low regard for Mr. Kim, who has not visited China and is not known to have been invited.Despite past periods of turbulence, including under Mao Zedong, both sides have more or less tried to preserve a polite public veneer of amity. But the friendship was a myth, said Shen Zhihua, a professor of history at East China Normal University.The Chinese government has always viewed North Korea as a \u201cvassal country,\u201d he said in an interview with Phoenix Television on Thursday, shortly before the North Korean editorial was published.\u201cYou can go through the People\u2019s Daily from 1949 to this day, we have never said a single word of ill, all words of praise,\u201d about North Korea, said Mr. Shen, who is one of China\u2019s pre-eminent historians on the North. \u201cMeanwhile, the North Korean newspapers do not speak ill of China.\u201dEven as the relationship has noticeably worsened in recent weeks, China has maintained public restraint. An editorial in Global Times, a state-run tabloid that sometimes reflects the thinking of senior government officials, noted on Friday that the suspension of coal imports was \u201cfair\u201d and in keeping with United Nations sanctions.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also kept up that facade. \u201cChina and North Korea are friendly neighbors, and we are willing to work with the North Korean side in joint efforts to develop healthy and stable relations,\u201d said Geng Shuang, the ministry spokesman.\u201cIt is only a preliminary result published by Malaysia, and there is not conclusion on this yet,\u201d Mr. Geng said.It was not immediately clear how much China\u2019s ban on coal imports would affect North Korea\u2019s ability to look after its population. And at least publicly, China said that it was imposing the ban only because it had already fulfilled its coal quota allowed under United Nations sanctions.That seemed to suggest that Beijing may have already paid Pyongyang for the coal it imported in the first 50 days of this year, money that would go to the North\u2019s cash-starved government, experts said.In the last week, the American secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has spoken with China\u2019s senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, about North Korea.President Trump has said China can do significantly more to persuade the North to scale back its nuclear program, even as Beijing has told Washington that it holds limited influence. The latest flare-up is likely to further weaken that leverage, while illustrating the resistance of Kim Jong-un to China\u2019s arguments in favor of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\u201cIn terms of diplomacy, I see no solution,\u201d said Yan Xuetong, the director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University. Mr. Yan, writing in the Chinese news media this week, said that China had no choice but to accept the North as a nuclear-armed state. That was because China had only two options: either a nuclear North Korea that was friendly toward China or a nuclear North Korea that was unfriendly, he wrote.\u201cI am very pessimistic about this issue,\u201d Mr. Yan said.Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art of the Deal in Afghanistan", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe United States can best achieve its objective of denying international terrorists sanctuary in Afghanistan by implementing an integrated diplomatic and military strategy.The immediate goal is to defend the country\u2019s government and strategic assets. In the medium run, we need to continue trying to stabilize that country\u2019s shaky political order and keeping its state and security forces trained and funded. Over the long term, the United States would have to support efforts to build a more self-sufficient economy linked to Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors.A political settlement, not just with the Taliban but also with Pakistan and other regional states, is essential for moving beyond the medium term. Reaching a settlement would require the United States to keep an open-ended troop presence as its main bargaining chip, while demonstrating willingness to discuss and negotiate a timetable for complete troop withdrawal with Afghanistan, its neighbors and the Taliban.Some Americans and Afghans, looking only at the short run, hope President Trump will strengthen the position of the United States and the Afghan government against the Taliban. Mr. Trump discussed sending more troops in a December telephone call with President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, The Wall Street Journal reported. He may exert stronger pressure on Pakistan to stop harboring the Afghan Taliban and employ tougher military measures against the Taliban in Afghanistan, though there is no basis for believing that either of those measures would work better than they have for the past 15 years.Hopes that Mr. Trump would sustain such fruitless measures fly in the face of his own words. In October 2015 he told Chris Cuomo of CNN that Afghanistan was a \u201cmess\u201d and that \u201cwe made a terrible mistake getting involved there.\u201d Mr. Trump added that he \u201cwould leave the troops there, begrudgingly.\u201dThe United States has 8,400 troops in Afghanistan and finances the Afghan security forces and the rest of the state at a cost estimated to be around $4 billion a year. The Trump administration is unlikely to sustain that level of spending, since it is reportedly considering how to cut federal spending by $10.5 trillion over 10 years.Stabilizing Afghanistan with less United States assistance would require an end to Pakistan\u2019s harboring the Taliban and a political settlement in Afghanistan. But geographic and geopolitical factors limit how much the United States can pressure Pakistan. The United States needs Pakistan for access to landlocked Afghanistan. In 2011, after several incidents, Pakistan closed United States ground transit. Access through Iran is impossible. In 2011 Russia allowed supplies to transit to Afghanistan from the north. Today, it would either refuse or exact a heavy price, probably in Europe. Is Afghanistan more important than NATO?Efforts to change Islamabad\u2019s behavior work best in cooperation with its \u201call-weather friend,\u201d China. Senior officials in Beijing told me last December that China\u2019s cooperation with the United States in Afghanistan would continue regardless of differences over the South China Sea, North Korea or trade. Challenging the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, as Mr. Trump has started to do, would end all United States-China cooperation, including on Afghanistan.The administration\u2019s counterterrorism policy would make a political settlement impossible, which is probably fine with Mr. Trump. A peace process requires differentiating the Taliban from global jihadists, integrating the former so as to isolate the latter. The leaked draft of an executive order to revive torture and re-establish black sites, however, referred to \u201ca global armed conflict with ISIS, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other associated international Islamist terrorist groups,\u201d and made no distinction among them.Any effort presupposes a United States presence, however begrudging, in Afghanistan. Anti-Taliban Afghans have seen the United States as a protector rather than occupier, but will their welcome survive an American president who believes \u201cIslam hates us\u201d and bars Muslim refugees from our shores?The United States could quickly wear out its welcome as the Trump administration bars Muslim refugees. Any moves to send new prisoners to Guant\u00e1namo, torture detainees, inflict more civilian casualties, bar Afghans from entering the United States, tolerate or encourage the persecution of Muslims in the United States, or move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem will hurt American ability to work in Afghanistan.Expanding the economy requires cooperation with neighbors to connect Afghanistan to markets. Regional states have started infrastructure projects that could do so. China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative will link western China to the Middle East, Europe, Central Asia and South Asia. It includes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (C.P.E.C.) from Xinjiang to the Gwadar port on Pakistan\u2019s Arabian Sea shore. Crises in United States-China or United States-Pakistan relations would make Afghan integration with C.P.E.C. even harder than it is now.Afghanistan has an alternative to C.P.E.C. Iran and India are developing the Iranian port of Chabahar and connecting it to Afghanistan\u2019s main highway. The three countries signed a transit agreement last May. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, concerned about the Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean, visited New Delhi in January to confirm Japanese participation. On Jan. 28, thanks to the relaxation of sanctions after the nuclear agreement, Iran announced contracts for $3.2 billion in direct investment in projects on the coast around Chabahar. President Trump could cooperate with India and Japan, but additional sanctions on Tehran could hinder investment in Chabahar and inhibit implementation of the transit agreement.If America is first on Mr. Trump\u2019s list of priorities, the \u201cmess\u201d in Afghanistan seems to be pretty far down. Afghanistan\u2019s future will depend on the United States as much as it will on China, India, Russia, Iran and Pakistan. The United States could help shape regional arrangements that would do more to stabilize Afghanistan and stop terrorism than a thousand drone strikes, but not if we view our presence solely as part of a global war on Islamist terrorism and make it impossible to engage Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors.Barnett R. Rubin is the director of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Regional Program at the Center on International Cooperation, New York University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Question for the U.S. Economy: How Much Room Is There to Grow?", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsThe most important issue for the United States economy in 2017 and beyond is whether it\u2019s near its speed limit.It has taken eight years of glacial expansion, but the nation is closing in on what economists believe to be its full productive capacity. It\u2019s nearing that level of activity in which nearly everybody who wants a job has one, and factories and offices are cranking at full speed.If the economy grows just 2.5 percent this year, gross domestic product will reach the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate of the nation\u2019s economic potential by the end of the year. If the Trump administration succeeds at achieving the 4 percent growth the president has said he seeks, we\u2019ll be there by the Fourth of July.If there is in fact more room to grow beyond the budget office\u2019s estimate of \u201cpotential G.D.P.,\u201d an economic boom remains possible. If there isn\u2019t, higher growth will translate into inflation, not higher output and incomes. The question for the Trump administration, the Federal Reserve and every American who wants a higher paycheck is how much slack there really is in the economy.Economic slack takes the form of empty warehouses and office parks; of machines that run eight hours a day when they were built to run for 12; and, most important, millions of Americans who might be coaxed to work in a booming economy but who aren\u2019t even looking for a job now.If there is a lot of slack, then the Trump administration\u2019s ambitious growth targets look more plausible, and the Fed should move slowly on raising interest rates so as not to choke off the expansion just as it\u2019s getting going. If there\u2019s not very much \u2014 if this is about the best the nation can expect to do \u2014 then either the Fed will raise rates more quickly to choke off growth or inflation will burst higher, or both.Astronomers can\u2019t observe a black hole directly; they can determine where one is only by measuring how it affects nearby matter. Potential output is similar. For all the apparent precision of reports from government agencies, potential G.D.P. isn\u2019t something that can be directly measured. It\u2019s a judgment based on other evidence.In assessing how close we are (or aren\u2019t) to full capacity, it helps to look at America\u2019s industrial parks and office complexes. The Federal Reserve watches the industrial sector by measuring what is called factory capacity utilization. American companies were operating factories at 75.7 percent of their potential in January. That\u2019s roughly the rate they\u2019ve been at for the last five years.Experience suggests it could go higher. In the spring of 2007, the rate was 79.5 percent. It was above 80 percent for the better part of the 1990s.In other words, the manufacturing sector would seem to have room to produce more stuff even without expanding factory floors or adding equipment. At Caterpillar, the giant maker of heavy equipment based in Peoria, Ill., Jim Umpleby, the chief executive, told analysts last month that, even as it closely managed costs, \u201cwe\u2019re also preserving capacity for a potential increase in business whenever that comes.\u201dEconomic slack is trickier to measure in the service sector; good luck judging whether, say, an insurance company is operating below or at its full potential. But one window into it is the office vacancy rate.Nationwide, 15.8 percent of office space was vacant in the final months of 2016, according to the real estate information firm Reis. That was down from a recent high of 17.6 percent in 2011 \u2014 but could still have room to fall. In the last expansion, it fell as low as 12.5 percent, implying that millions of square feet of offices are sitting idle, ready for white-collar workers to fill them.\u201cVacancy has fallen, but there are still some large blocks of space out there,\u201d said John Ferguson, president of the Southeast division of the commercial real estate firm CBRE. \u201cA tenant can typically find a short-term solution if they need to, even if it\u2019s not perfect for the long term.\u201dOne thing to keep an eye on: Development of new office space has been relatively depressed since the 2008 recession, which raises the possibility that the remaining vacant space could be filled up quickly with little new supply arriving to fulfill the demand. Mr. Ferguson sees it in Atlanta, where he is based, and in other Southern cities like Nashville and Charlotte, N.C.\u201cIn the last cycle 10 years ago, there were six new office towers added in Buckhead,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said, referring to an affluent Atlanta neighborhood. \u201cIn this cycle, there\u2019s one.\u201dThe biggest factor that will determine how much room the United States economy has to grow is the supply of workers.The unemployment rate is the most common measure of slack in the labor market, and it suggests that full employment has very nearly arrived: The 4.8 percent unemployment rate is roughly what Fed officials believe is the long-term rate that won\u2019t provoke inflation, and not far from the 4.4 percent low in the last expansion.But there are important wrinkles. Millions of Americans left the labor force entirely in the aftermath of the last recession. And there are \u201cmissing\u201d workers, people who do not count as unemployed because they are not looking for a job but might be available to work \u2014 and contribute to G.D.P. \u2014 if things were rosier.To people who work on employment issues, there is both good news and bad. \u201cA third to a half of the people on the sidelines, it wouldn\u2019t take much to employ tomorrow,\u201d said Stefani Pashman, chief executive of Partner4Work, a work force development group in the Pittsburgh area. \u201cThe other half are much tougher to employ,\u201d often facing challenges from drug use, criminal records and transience.In all these areas, the evidence points to an economy not being quite on the verge of overheating, but also not offering huge potential for growth.Perhaps the best argument for policy makers to be cautious about putting the brakes on economic growth with rapid Fed interest rate increases is how much we don\u2019t know about why growth has been so disappointing over the past several years.Here\u2019s a weighty fact: In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office published long-term projections of potential G.D.P. that assumed the United States would grow around 2.7 percent a year for the ensuing decade. It didn\u2019t. Growth in both the labor force and worker productivity underperformed those projections. So the reality we\u2019re living in underperforms that theoretical potential by $2.2 trillion, or 14 percent.One possibility of what went wrong is that the damage of the deep 2008 recession had lasting effects, both pulling some Americans out of the work force and causing businesses to underinvest in innovations. Weak demand for goods and services damaged the capacity of the economy, producing a vicious cycle.If officials at the Fed and in the Trump administration try to run the economy a little hot \u2014 to keep pursuing faster growth even as the economy gets close to or above potential G.D.P. \u2014 it would be a chance to do the reverse, to create a virtuous cycle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Swaggers Into Hungary as Europe Wonders About U.S.", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo years later, as Mr. Putin landed on Thursday for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era, it was a different story. Both men feel vindicated. There is talk of lifting the economic sanctions placed on Russia for its land grab in Ukraine. Their brand of nationalism has moved from the fringe to the mainstream.There was a note of triumphalism, even a bit of swagger, in the air.\u201cWe all sense, it\u2019s in the air, that the world is in the process of a substantial realignment,\u201d Mr. Orban said in a news conference after Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cWe believe this will create favorable conditions for stronger Russian-Hungarian relations.\u201dEven so, beneath the triumph lies a strain of uneasiness. The visit is expected to be fairly low-key, an indication of the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration, analysts say. President Trump\u2019s intentions remain unclear, and the prospects of a grand bargain between Washington and the Kremlin are highly uncertain.In the meantime, leaders across Europe have been forced to recalculate the best way to balance pressures in the East and West. Nowhere is that challenge felt more keenly than in Central and Eastern Europe, historically torn between Russia and the West.That means European and global leaders are closely scrutinizing the visit. They are looking for hints of how aggressive Mr. Putin and populist leaders like Mr. Orban will be in capitalizing on this new international climate and on Mr. Trump\u2019s stated desire for better relations with Moscow.If Thursday\u2019s post-meeting news conference is any indication, any hints of aggression are well buried. Both leaders focused on economic issues, such as Russian energy deals, and emphasized the need for international cooperation.\u201cI provided information in great detail on our assessment of what is happening in eastern Ukraine and what, in our opinion, is happening in Syria,\u201d Mr. Putin said \u2014 which, he added, underlines the need for more global cooperation to fight terrorism.Many here, skeptical that the Americans and Russians will actually bridge the chasm of interests dividing them, are injecting a note of caution about the balancing act ahead for leaders like Mr. Orban and his governing right-wing party, Fidesz.Andras Racz, a Russia expert and associate professor at Pazmany Peter Catholic University in Budapest, predicted that the reset in relations between the United States and Russia would result in \u201ca brief honeymoon, but nothing else, soon overwritten by conflicting interests.\u201dAs for Hungary, \u201cthere is no trust on the Russian side towards Orban,\u201d Mr. Racz said. The Hungarian leader has been seen mostly as a useful tool for weakening European Union unity, he said.And the feeling is mutual, said Balazs Orban, director of research for the Szazadveg Foundation, a think tank that advises the Fidesz party.\u201cFidesz doesn\u2019t feel chemistry with the Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think they are friends of Hungary, necessarily.\u201dThe warmer relations of recent years, he said, had more to do with economic necessity and Hungary\u2019s dependence on Russian energy.Indeed, Zoltan Kovacs, Viktor Orban\u2019s spokesman, said in an interview that both nations would treat Mr. Putin\u2019s visit as \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d with energy policy and a Russian deal to build a nuclear power plant in Hungary at the top of the agenda.It was not clear how significant a role, if any, the thorniest issue between Russia and the West \u2014 the sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States after the seizure of Crimea \u2014 would play in the meeting. But Mr. Putin is clearly eager to have the sanctions lifted, and to sow divisions in the European Union on that policy and others.Hungary may be among the nations most susceptible to Mr. Putin\u2019s maneuvering to remove the sanctions. Mr. Orban has voted with other European nations to support them, as a show of solidarity.When Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, visited Moscow last week to prepare for Mr. Putin\u2019s visit, he described the sanctions as \u201ccounterproductive and harmful\u201d: an indicator, some thought, of weakening Hungarian resolve.And that pattern held on Thursday, when neither leader mentioned the word \u201csanctions\u201d in their public statements.Mr. Orban, though, did allude to the sanctions, saying that some nations in \u201cthe western side of the Continent have shown very anti-Russian policies,\u201d which have harmed the Hungarian economy \u201cfor reasons which are beyond us.\u201dMr. Orban\u2019s hosting of Mr. Putin is the first part of a busy year of global outreach. Efforts are underway to arrange a meeting with Mr. Trump \u2014 the timing and location are still under discussion \u2014 and Mr. Orban is also planning a visit to Beijing and a meeting with Turkey\u2019s increasingly autocratic leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\u201cOrban has collected some credits in the international sphere,\u201d said Balazs Orban, the researcher, who is not related to the prime minister. \u201cHe forecast everything correctly, like immigration.\u201dNow, seeing a potential ally in Washington to balance the one in Moscow, the prime minister intends to cash those credits.\u201cHe understands geopolitics is changing,\u201d Balazs Orban said: The notion that all nations need to embrace globalism and \u201cthe liberal world order\u201d is no longer automatically accepted.The Hungarian prime minister\u2019s chief opposition comes from the far-right Jobbik Party. Its leader, Gabor Vona, said in an interview this week that he had \u201cvery mixed feelings about Donald J. Trump\u2019s election,\u201d and that he was unsure how seriously to take Mr. Trump\u2019s talk. He said he would wait \u201cto see what will be unfurled.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. Vona said Jobbik would welcome a grand bargain between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.\u201cWe will only be happy if relations between the U.S. and Russia improve,\u201d he said. If that bargain includes the creation of new \u201cspheres of influence\u201d for Russia and the West, as Mr. Putin dearly wishes, so much the better.In such a world, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, Mr. Kovacs, made clear that Hungary would be working for more latitude to pursue its own interests, even while staying in the European Union.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to step out of the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reform it,\u201d turning it from a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d into an alliance of more independent, sovereign nations whose leaders can govern without what Mr. Kovacs characterized as undue influence from the organization\u2019s bureaucrats in Brussels.\u201cAt the same time, we all sense there is going to be a resetting of the relationship with Moscow, and Hungary would like to be there,\u201d Mr. Kovacs said. \u201cIt is not a bipolar world anymore. It is a multipolar world that is emerging.\u201dBalint Bardi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The business takes a cut, in the double digits, from a boutique\u2019s margin from each sale. By contrast Yoox Net-a-Porter, the world\u2019s largest luxury commerce site by sales, buys and holds products from brands before selling them directly to consumers.\u201cI have always been a huge admirer of Natalie,\u201d Mr. Neves said after the announcement. \u201cShe opened the door for an entire generation of entrepreneurs and demonstrated that luxury had an online future long before anyone else.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a true visionary and we are delighted to have her on board,\u201d he added.The addition of Ms. Massenet to the group\u2019s leadership team comes at a time of heightened competition and volatility in the online luxury space, as both new and established players jostle aggressively for market share. Ms. Massenet said that, after a decade of received wisdom that suggested online fashion sales were detracting from those made offline, Farfetch had impressed her with the fact that it could boost retail sales via both digital and bricks-and-mortar channels.\u201cFarfetch is an example of the \u2018collaborative economy,\u2019 when businesses historically seen as competitors work together to offer the best possible customer experience and support the world\u2019s luxury fashion brands,\u201d she said. \u201cThe industry is undergoing a period of immense and rapid change, so I love that Farfetch can boost both sides of the business.\u201dThe timing of her arrival into the C-suite could prove financially fortuitous for Ms. Massenet; Farfetch, which was valued at almost $1.5 billion in its most recent funding round last year, is reported to be planning an initial public offering for late this year \u2014 the same period in which the company could become profitable. Both Mr. Neves and Ms. Massenet declined to comment on the possible stock market float on Tuesday.Speculation about Ms. Massenet\u2019s next steps has been rife within the fashion industry, ever since her acrimonious departure from Net-a-Porter in September 2015, just five months after it had announced a merger with Yoox. Federico Marchetti, the founder of Yoox, is now the merged group\u2019s chief executive; it generated sales of 1.8 billion euros, or $1.9 billion, a rise of nearly 18 percent from the previous year.Ms. Massenet said on Tuesday that she looked forward to spending a \u201cconsiderable amount of time\u201d talking to Farfetch\u2019s majority shareholders about brand partnerships and a number of \u201cexciting strategic projects and developments in the pipeline.\u201d As with most nonexecutive chairman roles, her new position is not a full-time, in-house role.\u201cOne thing I have learned as part of my tenure as chairwoman of the B.F.C. is that while I may not always be there on a daily basis,\u201d she said. \u201cI am \u2014 and will \u2014 still able to effect and guide a team without always being in the office.\u201dFor some, the arrangement leaves open the possibility that, for Ms. Massenet, taking on another major role is not out of the question.Advertisement"}

Malnutrition rates have soared above emergency levels, and countless people have died of hunger, United Nations officials said.\u201cOur worst fears have been realized,\u201d said Serge Tissot of the Food and Agriculture Organization, part of the United Nations.So far, the famine has affected a relatively small area in the northern part of the country, where the conflict between the government and rebel groups has been most intense. Thousands of people in that area have fled their homes, and many are living deep in the swamps or sweltering bush and surviving off wild plants and filthy water.Battles are still raging in many parts of South Sudan, and United Nations officials fear the famine could soon spread.\u201cOver a quarter of a million children are already severely malnourished,\u201d said Jeremy Hopkins, a Unicef official in South Sudan. \u201cIf we do not reach these children with urgent aid, many of them will die.\u201dSouth Sudan constitutes one of the biggest emergencies in Africa, perhaps the largest. The country broke off from Sudan in 2011 after decades of guerrilla warfare. After two years of peace, South Sudan cracked open in internecine conflict that pitted armed men from the largest ethnic groups against each other. Each side fields tens of thousands of battle-hardened soldiers who often target civilians.The United Nations has more than 10,000 peacekeepers in South Sudan, which is relatively few for a rugged country nearly the size of Texas, that is crawling with armed groups that keep splintering.One of the gravest problems in South Sudan is access for aid groups. Both the government and the rebels have attacked humanitarian convoys and warehouses, making it difficult to deliver aid to the hardest-hit areas.\u201cThe entire humanitarian community have been trying with all our might to avoid this catastrophe,\u201d said Joyce Luma, the South Sudan director of the World Food Program.But, she warned, \u201cthere is only so much that humanitarian assistance can achieve in the absence of meaningful peace and security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It didn\u2019t matter that the place had no connection to the British university or that this Oxford was a small town north of Detroit. \u201cMy father,\u201d Korbin said, \u201creally likes the idea of an Oxford diploma.\u201dEven as U.S.-China relations have slipped toward mutual antagonism, the flood of Chinese students coming to the United States has continued to rise. Roughly 370,000 students from the mainland are enrolled in American high schools and universities, six times more than a decade ago. Their financial impact \u2014 $11.4 billion was contributed to the American economy in 2015, according to the Department of Commerce \u2014 has turned education into one of America\u2019s top \u201cexports\u201d to China.It is a strange historical moment when the elites of a rising power send their only sons and daughters, products of China\u2019s former one-child policy, to the schools of a geopolitical rival. Yet the idea of a liberal Western education exerts an almost talismanic hold over China\u2019s ruling classes. While the country\u2019s educational emphasis on rote memorization churns out some of the world\u2019s best test-takers, many Chinese families harbor worries that diverge sharply from those of the tiger parents of popular conception. They fret about the toll competition exacts from their coddled offspring; they wonder if their child\u2019s creativity is being stifled. Even President Xi Jinping, who is presiding over a crackdown on Western influences in China\u2019s schools, allowed his daughter to attend Harvard. According to a 2016 survey conducted by a Shanghai-based research firm, 83 percent of China\u2019s millionaires are planning to send their children to school abroad. The average age, according to the poll, has dropped to 16 today from 18 in 2014 \u2014 the first time it has reached the high-school level.In 2005, only 641 Chinese students were enrolled in American high schools. By 2014, that student population approached 40,000 \u2014 a 60-fold increase in a single decade \u2014 and it now accounts for nearly half of all international high-school students in the United States. \u201cParents realize that they have to start earlier if they want their children to get into a top U.S. university,\u201d says Nini Suet, founder of Shang Learning, a boutique consultancy with headquarters in Beijing that charges $25,000 to $40,000 to help Chinese kids prepare for and apply to American boarding schools. \u201cFamilies are looking for any edge they can get.\u201dAs a new administration vowing \u201cAmerica First\u201d settles into the White House, there is uncertainty about how long this phenomenon can last. It already faces headwinds within China. A slowing economy has cut into family savings, and a depreciating currency makes American educations more expensive. There are also fewer Chinese students to go around: The population of 18-to-23-year-olds has dropped by nearly a quarter in the last decade.But the exodus of Chinese students continues for now, driven not just by a push from China but also by a pull from the United States. For each rich Chinese kid who enters an American school \u2014 whether public or private, college or high school \u2014 the multiplier effect means that entire communities can be buoyed by the buying power of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.That\u2019s the hope, at least. The reality is more complicated. Much of the money spent by Chinese families desperate for American diplomas ends up with the intermediary companies that connect them with cash-hungry schools. These matches have yielded unusual results. According to an article in Foreign Policy magazine, nearly 60 percent of the high-school students end up in religious schools, despite coming from the world\u2019s largest atheist state. (Their parents welcome the messages of safety, discipline and moral values that emanate from these faith-based institutions.) Another cohort winds up in what are effectively diploma mills, which confer visas and credentials but little adult supervision.Public high schools are the newest frontier: Less than 5 percent of all Chinese \u201cparachute kids\u201d (as they\u2019ve come to be called) are currently in public schools, but certain U.S. school districts have begun to rely on them to offset budget cuts and increase cultural diversity at the same time as private academies are reaching saturation points.Few public school districts have deeper ties to China than Oxford, Mich., outside Detroit. In 2010, the town sought to create the first pipeline of Chinese students into a public high school, one that embodied its high school\u2019s motto \u2014 \u201cwhere the globe is our classroom\u201d \u2014 even as it brought tuition money to the school. As the number of foreign students grew, other Midwestern schools sought to emulate Oxford\u2019s success. But when a Beijing education company proposed building a multimillion-dollar dormitory for Chinese students on the Oxford campus, a community battle ensued.His father insisted that this wasn\u2019t just about family prestige or future job prospects. \u201cI also want my son to understand, in a way that I never could,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the world is bigger than Shenyang, bigger than China.\u201dKorbin immersed himself in Americana: football games, big-box stores, even a Christian megachurch with its own rock band. He was hardly alone in his American adventure. Michigan has become a particularly popular destination for Chinese public-high-school students in the United States, and more than a dozen kids from Shenyang lived nearby. Even at Oxford, where Korbin and 23 other students ended up because their academic program in China and its agent, the BCC International Education Group, had partnered with the school, there were another 19 Chinese kids brought in by a Beijing-based company, Weiming Education Group. The two crowds didn\u2019t mix much, in part because most of the Weiming students lived in a dormitory at Rochester College, a liberal-arts Christian school half an hour away. Korbin felt lucky with his American home stay.His life in America was very different from that of his predecessors. When the first Chinese students arrived in the United States in the wake of the Cultural Revolution \u2014 and later, after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre \u2014 many were so poor that they collected aluminum cans or worked janitorial jobs to survive. Today\u2019s Chinese students tend to be far wealthier than their American counterparts, particularly in public high schools. Even among the middle-class students at Oxford, the Chinese kids stirred up envy, and some resentment, by flaunting multiple versions of just-released iPhones. (Korbin had only one.) The Chinese boys carried hundreds of dollars in cash and often wore a different pair of designer sneakers \u2014 Nike, Puma, Adidas \u2014 each day. Korbin\u2019s Chinese housemate, Oscar Kou, who liked to talk about his father\u2019s fleet of luxury cars, spent several thousand dollars on a laptop so powerful that it blew out the fuses in their host family\u2019s house.Making American friends wasn\u2019t as simple as Korbin had imagined. In the hallways at Oxford High School, whose student body numbers 1,845, the Chinese kids clustered together, chattering in Mandarin. Korbin longed to interact with his American classmates, but every time he tried, the conversations fizzled when he couldn\u2019t understand their cultural references or slang. Still, Korbin made no secret of his mission. \u201cI\u2019m a Chinese boy,\u201d he told his classes, \u201cbut I really, really want to make American friends. It\u2019s the most important thing to me.\u201dPerhaps his best chance came at the homecoming dance that fall. As he walked across the floor under the spinning lights of a disco ball, Korbin worked up his nerve and asked an American girl to dance. She just laughed. Another girl, another rejection. Finally, the third entreaty succeeded \u2014 just as a slow song started up and the dancers turned into a tangle of embracing couples. Korbin\u2019s feet stopped, and his arms locked at his sides. \u201cI totally froze,\u201d he says. The girl drifted off to rejoin her friends, leaving Korbin alone, wondering if a Chinese boy could ever find his footing in America.For Skilling, a former high-school government and economics teacher, the dorm project was the culmination of years of networking with Chinese officials, educators and businessmen. His first foray into the China market came in 2008, when with the Chinese government\u2019s help he started what would become one of the largest Mandarin-language programs in American schools. Today more than 2,300 students in Oxford schools, K through 12, take daily classes in Chinese. \u201cThe greatest challenge we face in American education,\u201d Skilling said, \u201cis preparing students to work and live in a global world that is changing 24-7.\u201d The Mandarin classes were also part of a local government plan to lure Chinese investment to southeastern Michigan. \u201cThere was a reason that we, as a state, weren\u2019t making inroads into China,\u201d Skilling told me. \u201cThe Chinese knew Michigan was negative, blaming China for its woes. The way to turn this around was to pay China the highest compliment: by building a world-class Mandarin-language program.\u201dBeijing returned the favor. In 2013, Hanban \u2014 the state agency that runs China\u2019s network of controversial Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese culture, language and propaganda worldwide \u2014 recognized Oxford Community Schools as the \u201cConfucius Classroom of the Year.\u201d Skilling parlayed such recognition into sister-school agreements with 20 Chinese schools. Over the past seven years, at least 40 different Oxford teachers and administrators have visited China. One major deal was struck with Korbin\u2019s public school in Shenyang, which opened an international school for Chinese students, like Korbin, aiming to go to an American high school with a famous name.With that deal, Skilling had lined up his first supply of Chinese students for Oxford. He also devised a way around the United States regulations that restricted international students to just one year in public high schools. By inviting a local college to sponsor the F-1 student visas for Chinese students in their second year, Skilling maintained that they could remain at the high school \u2014 and keep paying tuition \u2014 so long as they were also enrolled in and paying tuition for full-time college-level courses. The second year was important: Chinese families want their children to have enough time to prepare for the American college process. The Department of Homeland Security raised no immediate objections, Skilling told me. \u201cThis had never been done before, so there were no regulations or road maps to follow,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was literally a blank slate.\u201dSoon, Oxford was attracting Chinese companies with even bigger ambitions. In a trip to Michigan in late 2012, Weiming\u2019s president, Lin Hao, laid out a vision in which 10,000 Chinese students would enroll in high schools in the United States, starting with experimental districts in the American heartland. Weiming, which bills itself as one of China\u2019s largest private education companies, has followed a similar strategy at home, building 15 campuses with more than 30,000 students in nine provincial cities. As Lin told a visiting superintendent from rural southern Ohio: \u201cIn China, we have an old saying: \u2018Revolution begins in the countryside.\u2019\u2009\u201dWithin a year, Oxford signed a memorandum of understanding with Weiming that ensured an even greater supply of Chinese students \u2014 up to 200 of them annually for the next 20 years. For each student, Weiming would pay Oxford Community Schools $10,000 a year. It was a boon for a district facing budgetary pressures, but it was significantly less than the $40,000 that Chinese families paid Weiming for the full package of tuition, room and board, insurance and English-support classes. (The company says its fees have since gone down to about $30,500, as it competes for China\u2019s middle-class market.)Weiming also offered American public schools a bigger prize. If the number of Chinese students reached a certain threshold \u2014 from 80 to 100 students \u2014 the company promised to build a multimillion-dollar student center and dormitory, at no cost to the school. As the Weiming contingent at Oxford grew, architects in Beijing and Michigan began drawing up blueprints for the dorm. Shortly after I met Skilling at the airport in the spring of 2014, he returned to Beijing to pore over blueprints of the proposed dorm with Lin. They met in Lin\u2019s office, which was designed to replicate the room where Chairman Mao met President Nixon in 1972 to re-establish relations between their two countries. The wall behind Lin\u2019s desk is covered with antique maps, one for each Chinese province where Weiming has built a school. It wouldn\u2019t be long, perhaps, before a map of Michigan adorned the wall. \u201cLin Hao and I understand each other,\u201d Skilling told me, \u201cbecause we\u2019re both visionaries.\u201dKorbin didn\u2019t understand the commotion. His English had improved, but his vocabulary was limited \u2014 and the loudspeakers were always a challenge. He had gotten used to the rock music that played between classes, creating the kind of happy chaos that would never be allowed in a regimented Chinese school. But this time the tone was grave: \u201cTeachers, secure your classrooms!\u201d Korbin\u2019s confusion only deepened when the music instructor hustled everyone into the girls\u2019 bathroom next door. \u201cHurry up!\u201d she yelled. When Korbin made it to the bathroom stalls, the teacher locked the door behind him \u2014 and they waited, in hushed excitement, until the drill was over.Later, Korbin laughed about the experience. He had nearly forgotten that his mother\u2019s fears about American life \u2014 the guns, riots, school shootings \u2014 had almost scuttled his chances of studying in the United States. His father had made a reconnaissance visit to the country before he started, largely to reassure his wife that it was safe enough for their son. The only dangers Korbin faced in Oxford came from his innocent campaign for American friends.One day, a group of jocks and slackers invited Korbin into the boys\u2019 bathroom for a few puffs from an electronic cigarette. The initiation was unusual for a strait-laced Chinese kid, but he was thrilled to be part of an American posse. \u201cCool kids never study,\u201d he was told, so Korbin, until then a conscientious A student, eased off his schoolwork. He started lifting weights, thinking he might attract a girlfriend \u201cafter I build some muscle.\u201dBut when his new friends began pressing Korbin to join in hazing other kids, he pulled away. He wanted nothing to do with shouting racial epithets at the school\u2019s few African-American students or taunting other Chinese kids with curse words in Mandarin. \u201cI tried so hard to make American friends, but I lost all of my own Chinese style and character,\u201d Korbin told me last year. \u201cI am not that eager to be part of American culture anymore. I would like to be myself, Chinese.\u201dWith this part of his American dream tarnished, Korbin buried himself in his studies \u2014 and emerged as a patriot. In September 2015, after Beijing held a missile-studded military parade to celebrate Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II, he posted a picture on social media of the Chinese flag with the words \u201cGreat China!\u201d At school, he nearly came to blows with a student who was badmouthing the Chinese \u201cdictatorship.\u201d The object of his anger was not an American but a fellow Chinese student.Korbin and Oscar left their host family and moved in with four other Chinese students under the care of a local grandmother. Korbin stopped lifting weights. He no longer wanted an American girlfriend. He barely interacted with American students anyway, because everyone in his college-level classes \u2014 the requirement to maintain his visa during his second year \u2014 was Chinese.Still, Korbin remembers his senior year fondly. After he regained his academic focus, his grade-point average rose to near the top of his class \u2014 a 3.96 \u2014 and his standardized-test scores climbed just in time for his college applications. It felt good to be a nerd again. \u201cI realized that I\u2019m an only son, the last of my family,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy parents pay a lot for me to come here, so why shouldn\u2019t I study hard?\u201dI had just pulled into the Oxford school parking lot when a bearded man in a baseball cap, an auto engineer, appeared at my car window and grumbled about the subject of that night\u2019s public forum: Weiming\u2019s plan to build its Oxford High School dorm. \u201cIs it really our job to be educating Chinese kids?\u201d he asked.Until October 2014, Oxford\u2019s move into China\u2019s orbit \u2014 the Mandarin-language program, the influx of Chinese students \u2014 had met little resistance. But the proposed dorm for Chinese students hit a nerve. A board meeting erupted in chaos. The local newspaper, The Oxford Leader, ran an editorial titled \u201cMaking a Deal With the Devil.\u201d And now, as the engineer and 60 other residents gathered in the school atrium, Skilling found himself on the defensive. \u201cI\u2019m here to defuse the situation,\u201d he said.After touting the benefits of cultural exchange, Skilling outlined the finances. When the school reached its goal of 200 tuition-paying Chinese students, he said, an estimated $1.3 million in annual net revenue would flow into school coffers. The bigger incentive, he argued, was the multimillion-dollar dorm, which would include eight classrooms for use by all students. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay a penny,\u201d Skilling said. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win.\u201dNear the end of a contentious question-and-answer session, Skilling talked about how this project would bring money from China back into Michigan. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard Donald Trump say that China is trying to take advantage of us,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree. We\u2019re willing to sell our souls to get a foot in China, and it\u2019s a mistake.\u201d A woman behind me whispered to her companion: \u201cBut isn\u2019t that just what he\u2019s done?\u201dBehind the scenes, a group of Oxford citizens began looking into the international program. \u201cI don\u2019t think the community objects to having foreign students here,\u201d says Kallie Roesner-Meyers, a horse-stable owner who started the group, known as Team 20. \u201cBut there was so much secrecy and misinformation around the whole China setup that we needed to find out more.\u201d In the spring of 2015, Team 20, which sent the district a flurry of Freedom of Information Act requests, discovered, among other things, that the school board had agreed to a 20-year deal based on Skilling\u2019s recommendation.In response to communication from Roesner-Meyers, federal agents questioned Skilling about his consulting work for Weiming. (Skilling says he ceased consulting before the Oxford deal went through.) One of them also wanted to know more about the visa maneuver by which Chinese students were staying for two years instead of one. According to Skilling, the agents said they \u201cdidn\u2019t see any issue,\u201d and he told a reporter that Roesner-Meyers \u201cneeds to settle down.\u201d But the pressure only persisted. Skilling retired later that year, and Weiming, without giving any explanation, put the dorm project on hold.Weiming still has roughly 100 of its students at Oxford. And with thousands more students in its Chinese schools expecting to come to the United States, the search for a flagship location continues. In 2015, the company bid $12.6 million for a 58-acre property in West Hartford, Conn. It proposed to turn the former University of Connecticut site into an international school for 500 students, some of whom would feed into the city\u2019s public high schools. Local officials supported the plan, but last May the City Council, responding to vocal opposition to a little-known Chinese company taking control of land in the city center, voted against it.Hovering in the background of the West Hartford debate was the suspension of the Weiming dorm in Oxford \u2014 and the government\u2019s unresolved investigation into its international program. By November, the Department of Homeland Security offered a verdict. The visa maneuver would not be permitted in the future, a blow to the model Oxford pioneered.When I visited Korbin last summer in Shenyang, he took me to an American-style craft-beer pub his father partly owns. Over a game of pool, he spoke positively about his experience at Oxford. Still, he admitted, he left Michigan after two years without a single American friend. That surprised him. \u201cWeirdly, I think the experience made me appreciate Chinese culture even more,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a common sentiment among Chinese students abroad, who find that their foreign experiences sharpen their sense of national pride. Over the summer, Korbin started delving into Chinese history books and training in kung fu. In America, he found his Chinese core.Now halfway through his first year at Penn State, Korbin can spend entire days without speaking a word of English. \u201cI\u2019m around my Chinese friends all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t get a chance to know American friends.\u201d The current political climate may only isolate him further. Korbin is in America legally, studying hard and leaning toward a major in electrical engineering. But how welcoming is a country that increasingly regards his homeland as an economic and security threat? If Trump is serious about being tough on trade, Chinese students, while not in the foreground of such a fight, could be an easy lever for either side to pull. The collateral damage of restricting visas would be devastating, not only for the students themselves but also for high schools and universities, especially across the Midwest, that have become dependent on the billions of dollars the Chinese contribute economically every year.An even bigger threat may lie within China. Late last year, President Xi\u2019s ideological campaign against foreign influences targeted the kind of schools that prepared Korbin for America. How this crackdown will affect the flow of Chinese students overseas is unclear. Parents may be compelled to send their children abroad at even younger ages to escape the closing cage.For Korbin, the lack of American buddies and reawakened sense of national identity notwithstanding, high school in America still left a deep impression on him. Last Christmas, after exams, he went back not to Shenyang, but to Oxford. His second host mother gave him two hoodies and some of his favorite chocolate, and cooked a Christmas meal. Korbin presented her with a mug and played with the dogs he had helped care for as puppies. \u201cI definitely wish I was still there,\u201d he told me, and he sounded like just another first-year college kid, missing home.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Novak, Catholic Scholar Who Championed Capitalism, Dies at 83", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cause was colon cancer, said Elise Italiano, a spokeswoman for the Catholic University of America, where he was a professor.Mr. Novak, a former seminarian, emerged in the early 1960s as one of Catholicism\u2019s brightest liberal lights. His journalistic essays, collected in \u201cA New Generation: American and Catholic\u201d (1964), and his reporting from the Second Vatican Council, in \u201cThe Open Church: Vatican II, Act II\u201d (1964), reflected his reform-minded view of the church and his eagerness to see it address young Catholics like himself with a faith that was, as he put it, \u201cempirical, pragmatic, realistic and Christian.\u201dWhile teaching at Stanford University, he became a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and argued for \u201ca revolution in the quality of life.\u201dIn \u201cA Theology for Radical Politics\u201d (1969), he set forth a series of propositions designed to \u201crearrange the power bases of American democracy, both democratically and politically, so that changes can come rapidly and effectively.\u201dMr. Novak elaborated and extended this argument in several books, notably \u201cThe Catholic Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\u201d (1993). It argued that capitalism\u2019s most powerful underlying forces were not self-denial and discipline, as Max Weber had maintained in his classic 1905 work \u201cThe Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,\u201d but the \u201csocial dimensions of the free economy\u201d and the free play of creativity \u2014 both rooted, as Mr. Novak saw it, in Catholic ethics.Among his most fervent admirers was Margaret Thatcher, former British prime minister. Mr. Novak, she wrote in \u201cThe Downing Street Years,\u201d \u201cput into new and striking language what I had always believed about individuals and communities.\u201d His description of capitalism as a moral and social system as well as an economic one, she wrote, \u201cprovided the intellectual basis for my approach to those great questions brought together in political parlance as \u2018the quality of life.\u2019\u201dMichael John Novak Jr. was born on Sept. 9, 1933, in Johnstown, Pa., the grandson of Slovak immigrants and the oldest of five children. His father was an insurance salesman. His mother, the former Irene Sakmar, was a stenographer before becoming a homemaker after marriage.It was not long before he entertained doubts about entering the priesthood. His superiors urged him to return to the United States before making any decision, and he studied for a time at Catholic University in Washington. \u201cAfter 18 months of great darkness but also inner peace, I became certain that I should not be a priest,\u201d he told the audience at Notre Dame in 1998.He moved to Manhattan and wrote a novel, \u201cThe Tiber Was Silver\u201d (1961), about a seminarian in Rome afflicted by religious doubts, and he then accepted a graduate fellowship at Harvard, earning a master\u2019s degree in philosophy in 1966.While there he married Karen Laub, a painter and printmaker, who died in 2009. Survivors include their children, Richard, Tanya and Jana; and four grandchildren.In 1965 he accepted an assistant professorship in the humanities at Stanford. In \u201cBelief and Unbelief: A Philosophy of Self-Knowledge\u201d (1965), the essay collection \u201cA Time to Build\u201d (1967) and \u201cA Theology for Radical Politics,\u201d he tried to make a place for Catholicism in a post-religious age.\u201cI was convinced that a good Christian, even a good humanist, had to be on the left and probably couldn\u2019t be a friend of business,\u201d he told Crisis in 2010. \u201cBusiness was merely buying and selling, mere hucksterism, after all.\u201dAfter becoming an associate professor of philosophy and religious studies at the State University of New York at Old Westbury, an experimental school, he began writing on broader social and political issues. He plunged into electoral politics, writing speeches and position papers for Eugene McCarthy, Robert F. Kennedy and George McGovern.While traveling across the country in 1970 with Sargent Shriver, who was trying to drum up support for Democratic candidates, Mr. Novak tuned into the concerns of traditionally Democratic working-class voters who were becoming alienated from elites. His observations led to \u201cThe Rise of the Unmeltable Ethnics: Politics and Culture in the Seventies\u201d (1972), an attack on the assimilationist model of American society, which he saw as hostile to working-class Catholics like himself.He examined American politics as a civic religion in \u201cChoosing Our King: Powerful Symbols in Presidential Politics\u201d (1974) and found a spiritual dimension in athletic competition in \u201cThe Joy of Sports: End Zones, Bases, Baskets, Balls, and the Consecration of the American Spirit\u201d (1976).As the Conference of Catholic Bishops prepared an episcopal letter on nuclear policy in the early 1980s, he argued for the importance of maintaining a credible deterrent threat in \u201cMoral Clarity in the Nuclear Age.\u201d\u201cWill It Liberate?: Questions About Liberation Theology\u201d (1986) countered a leftist interpretation of Catholicism popular in Latin America, and \u201cNo One Sees God: The Dark Night of Atheists and Believers\u201d (2008) took aim at outspoken atheists like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens.Advertisement"}

It soon spread to other parts of the island and was crushed in the massacre of up to 28,000 Taiwanese by the troops of Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader of China. The revolt was followed by four decades of martial law and divisions between Taiwanese whose roots on the island predated the Nationalists\u2019 arrival in 1945 and the Chinese mainlanders who came after.Yet it was the eventual willingness to confront these events that enabled Taiwan\u2019s people to begin to heal those divisions and achieve the voice in their government that the protesters demanded seven decades ago.The Feb. 28 episode actually began the day before, outside the Pegasus Teahouse in Dadaocheng, old Taipei\u2019s commercial district. A widow selling cigarettes illegally was confronted by inspectors and the police. After an inspector struck her head with his pistol, enraged passers-by surrounded the officers, one of whom shot and killed a bystander before the officers escaped into police protection.Unable to pressure the authorities into giving up the officer that night, hundreds of protesters gathered the next morning to march from Dadaocheng to the office of Taiwan\u2019s governor, Chen Yi, to demand justice.Taiwanese anger at the Nationalists had been building for months. Nationalist soldiers were originally greeted as liberators by Taiwanese, who had lived under Japanese colonial rule for 50 years. For a fleeting moment, there was optimism that Taiwan would enjoy greater self-determination.It wouldn\u2019t.\u201cWhen the Chinese arrived, people thought their situation would improve, because many Taiwanese were of Chinese descent, but things became even worse,\u201d said Hsieh Tsai-Ming, who has been leading tours at Taipei 228 Memorial Hall since it opened on Feb. 28, 1997.Governor Chen had taken a ham-handed approach to ruling the Taiwanese, Mr. Hsieh said. By mid-1946, he had shut down all Japanese-language publications and had made Mandarin the official language of the local government, essentially shutting out many Taipei residents. Locals were aghast at the unruly behavior of Nationalist troops, while Nationalist officials seized public and private property.Besides that, residents simmered under corruption, mismanagement and the shifting of resources to the Chinese mainland, where the Nationalists were fighting Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists.The marchers of Feb. 28 headed south from Dadaocheng toward the north gate of the old city wall, their numbers steadily multiplying.Chou Ching, a local journalist, recorded the moment he arrived at the north gate.\u201cWritten on it were eight big characters reading, \u2018Severely punish the killer \u2014 a life for a life.\u2019 A leather drum 2.5 chi (about three feet) across, following behind the banner, rattled eardrums \u2026 behind the drum followed a trail of innumerable people joining the petition procession. There were men and women, elderly and children, but it was primarily youth.\u201d\u201cRegardless of what it was, the crowd grabbed and carried everything they could from the Monopoly Bureau and burned it, even cars, bicycles and rickshaws,\u201d Mr. Chung wrote.Shortly after the unarmed crowd reached the governor\u2019s office, soldiers opened fire, killing several protesters and wounding dozens. A group fled and took over the provincial radio station, calling for an uprising against the Nationalists, an end to corruption, and a greater say in the island\u2019s economy.Streets were cleared by soldiers in jeeps with machine guns, who then rounded up those suspected of being Communists and anyone else considered a possible threat. Most were tortured and killed.Although most victims were not Communists, a Communist presence in Taiwan was setting up an underground resistance. One party member, Xie Xuehong, had an important role in the uprising, an angle that China\u2019s Communist government has used over the years to lay a claim of solidarity with the people of Taiwan, which it considers the last Chinese province yet to be reclaimed from the vanquished Nationalists.During the martial law years, discussion of the Feb. 28 uprising was banned. After martial law was lifted in 1987, some people found the confidence to speak up, with the tacit encouragement of President Lee Teng-hui, the first leader of modern Taiwan who was born there. In 1995, Mr. Lee became the first senior official to mention Feb. 28 publicly, opening the floodgates for discussion.Today a small plaque where the Pegasus Teahouse once stood marks the location, most recently occupied by a tailor\u2019s shop. The Monopoly Bureau office is today a bank. And the former radio station houses the memorial hall.In 2009, Ma Ying-jeou became the first president of Taiwan to visit the memorial to commemorate Feb. 28, which he did in each of his eight years in office. On Tuesday, Tsai Ing-wen will make her first visit as president.Hsiao Ming-Chih, a curator at the memorial hall, said Mr. Ma\u2019s visits were an acknowledgment of the Nationalists\u2019 \u201coriginal sin.\u201dSeventy years on, as one of Asia\u2019s freest democracies, Taiwan has made significant progress in eliminating the old Chinese-Taiwanese divisions. Most young people claim a \u201cTaiwanese\u201d identity, regardless of when their ancestors arrived. But for some, closure may never come.Mr. Ma\u2019s commemoration of the event, overseeing reparations to victims\u2019 families and other displays of concern \u201cdefinitely had an impact,\u201d Mr. Hsiao said. \u201cBut whether relatives, or people of different political stripes, find that acceptable, that\u2019s another matter.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Feb. 27 about Taiwan\u2019s commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the uprising known as the \u201c2/28 Incident,\u201d which led to the massacre of 28,000 Taiwanese by Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s troops, misidentified the authors of a book in which Chou Ching, a journalist, describes the 1947 protests. It was written by Tai Kuo-hui and Yeh I-i, not by Mr. Chou.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eduardo Garc\u00eda\u2019s Path: Migrant Worker, Convict, Deportee, Star Chef", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 As bad hombre tales go, Eduardo Garc\u00eda\u2019s is classic. A border-crossing Mexican immigrant, he moved around the United States through the better part a decade, harvesting the produce that most of us take for granted throughout what might be thought of as a stolen childhood. Starting at age 5, the unschooled Mr. Garc\u00eda embarked on a journey that drew on native intelligence, natural gift and a willingness to take on backbreaking work to make something of himself \u2014 in his case, a chef.Like many of the immigrants keeping American farming alive and restaurant kitchens humming, his true citizenship was in a shadow economy. And like so many young men with more ambition than sense, he made mistakes that would send him first to jail and eventually home as a deportee to a country he knew less well than the one in which he was raised.As fate would have it, it was at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Mexico and later at an establishment of his own that Mr. Garc\u00eda transformed himself into a superstar of a thriving food scene. In less than a decade at the celebrated Pujol and later at M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, the restaurant he operates with his wife, Gabriela, in a corner of the Colonia Roma section of this thronging capital, Mr. Garc\u00eda has garnered awards and plaudits for the bright clarity of the flavors his kitchen conjures and the subtly layered elegance of his efforts fusing classic French technique with traditional Mexican preparations and ingredients.On a recent springlike morning before M\u00e1ximo Bistrot opened for lunch, Mr. Garc\u00eda, known as Lalo, sat with a reporter to talk about his complicated journey from there to here:\u201cWe started M\u00e1ximo Bistrot in 2011 with four employees. The idea was to keep things small. But then I noticed, after a while, that employees were building homes. A lot of them were Mexicans who had migrated to the United States and then sent money back home to construct houses. With the wages we paid, they could stay in Mexico and earn enough to have a good life. So we decided finally it was a good idea to grow the business and employ as many people as possible, because in Mexico a lot of people\u2019s pockets get bigger and bigger, but never the little guy.\u201cWe now have three restaurants in the city, M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, Lalo! and Havre 77. Over all, the cuisine is French-Mexican. We also have 130 employees with six partnerships in Mexico, two in London and one in Dubai.\u201cThe thing is, I\u2019m not ashamed to say it, but I\u2019m a convicted felon in the United States: deported two times, in 2000 and 2007. My entire family still lives there and I love the country \u2014 it gave me everything I have \u2014 but I\u2019m banned from going there now.\u201cMy family was all migrant workers, and I grew up in the fields. I started at the age of 5. I never went to school. My parents were illiterate and I\u2019m illiterate, too. I can read and write a little, but my grammar is horrible.\u201cIn the beginning of the season, in the fall, we used to pick oranges, lemons, limes and grapefruit in Florida. Then we would go to Georgia to plant Vidalia onions. From there we moved on to Michigan to pick apples, blueberries and plums. After that, it was Pennsylvania to pick mushrooms at night: Mushrooms only come out at night. Then we\u2019d go to Ohio to pick cucumbers for pickling and back to Georgia to harvest the onions we\u2019d planted. I still have scars from picking on all the fingers of both hands.\u201cI stopped that work when I turned 14. We\u2019d been going up and going down the country and always through Atlanta until one year, in 1991, we stopped to visit an aunt there and my father found a job at a country club cutting grass. So we decided to stay for a while. I got a job washing dishes at the Georgia Grille on Peachtree Road. Hard physical work has always been my life. My cooks in the kitchen here at M\u00e1ximo Bistrot are a little afraid of me, I think. When I arrive in the early morning, they panic. They always think they haven\u2019t done enough because I\u2019m here 18 hours a day every day.\u201cWithin six months of getting that dishwasher job, I was promoted to the salad station. I worked in those days with illegal documents. I had a Social Security number, but it was a fake because I was actually too young to work legally.\u201cA guy above me at the Georgia Grille was from Puerto Rico. He watched how I learned and he said, \u2018You\u2019re very talented.\u2019 Whatever task anybody gave me, I picked it up right away. My father had always taught me to be better than anyone else, so already, by the age of 10, I was making the same money as an adult.\u201cWhen you pick tomatoes, you pick from 7 to 11 in the morning and that\u2019s it. After that, the sun is too hot and you don\u2019t mess with the plants. For every bucket you turn in, you get a chip to redeem for cash. It could be 50 cents and it could be $1, depending on how good the crop was. Even as a kid, I was really into getting more chips than anyone. It was my version of a video game.\u201cThe Puerto Rican guy went on to work as a butcher in Brasserie Le Coze, a restaurant Eric Ripert [the chef and an owner of Le Bernardin] was opening. He said I should try for a job there. After months of yes, no, yes, I got hired and it was the best job I ever had. They promoted me pretty quickly to garde-manger and suddenly I was making, like, 200 to 300 salads or terrines or duck confit, and it was like, \u2018Wow, this is stuff I didn\u2019t even know existed.\u2019\u201cMy vocation and my work really began in the United States, which is why I love it just as much as I love Mexico. I even loved working in the fields, though my father died of gastrointestinal cancer that most likely came from being around so many pesticides. In the Mexican generation my father was from, he didn\u2019t want us to follow his path. When I was little, he looked at us and said, \u2018This is not good, little kids working like adults.\u2019 But, unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have a way to educate us, so I don\u2019t hold him to blame.\u201cPretty soon I was promoted again to chef de partie. I was making more than my father, whose life had been so hard, working so many years in the sun that he looked like 60 at 45. Even so, for me it was never about, \u2018I\u2019m going to become a chef.\u2019 It was none of that. I was just working at something I loved.\u201cI always say the best and worst thing for us Mexicans was Nafta. We became literally accustomed to American ways. We forgot how to be Mexican. Now that is changing. Ten or 15 years ago, a Mexican would never tell you he had his ancestors\u2019 indigenous blood in his body. Now, because of regionalism in food and music and art, everybody suddenly has a grandmother in Oaxaca. Sometimes, still, we\u2019re ashamed we\u2019re from Mexico.\u201cI wanted eventually to become a sous chef, so I took another kitchen job, which paid $29,000 a year, as a cook at a restaurant in Alpharetta, Ga. My father was very ill and I needed the money. It was there that I began to wonder, \u2018How else do I learn to be a real chef?\u2019 And that was when I really began to think about cooking seriously, constantly studying Charlie Palmer or Charlie Trotter and what they were doing. I studied and I mimicked what they had done and realized that most cookbooks are not ever accurate. So then I started to experiment. My training for this life is different from chefs who went to culinary schools. My entire education took place in kitchens.\u201cAfter six months, the owners of that restaurant said, \u2018Now we can make you a sous chef.\u2019 Unfortunately for me, as well as I was doing, I met some bad hombres along the way. My life started to go sideways. I began to sell drugs for the dishwashers. I never want to run from this, but it is true that all through my working life I had always given my father any money I made; he was my bank. Suddenly I realized then that I didn\u2019t need to ask him for money. I could just make money on the side.\u201cI never got caught selling drugs, and to this day I can say I never tasted what I was selling. But what got me in trouble was when a cousin of mine asked me to drive him and a friend to a liquor store they were going to rob. I knew this. It was a moment in life. We got away, but I told myself I needed to face the consequences, so I turned myself in. I was charged with aggravated assault, convicted and spent one year in county jail and three years in maximum security prison in South Georgia. Immigration put a hold on me and transferred me to one of the hardest jails in the system, where I spent three years making auto tags. Then, at the end of 2000, I came to Mexico, deported for the first time.\u201cI was only back in Mexico for two weeks when my mother called and gave me the news that my father was dying of cancer. It was a big risk, but I had to take a chance to try to see him in the United States before he died. So I bought fake Social Security documents and crossed a bridge at Nuevo Laredo like everybody else. I had a feeling in me that it would be all right. My father didn\u2019t want to have an operation or chemo, so they told him he would live two weeks. In fact, he lived another six years and every one of those years that I stayed I felt I didn\u2019t belong in the States. I had spent a lot of time in kitchens by then and applied for a job as a chef. I kind of told a lie in telling people I already was one.\u201cOne day in 2007, immigration went to the restaurant and talked to the manager, who came to me crying and said, \u2018They\u2019re here for you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I knew this day was going to come.\u2019 I was arrested again and spent four months in federal prison in South Georgia. I swore then I would never ever see the inside of a jail cell again. I was deported again and I really didn\u2019t know what was next for me.\u201cI don\u2019t hide from any of this, because I want people around me to know who I am. A lot of people have been through what I\u2019ve been through. Yes, it is shameful to say, you\u2019re a fraud, you\u2019ve been deported, you\u2019ve been in prison. But these are mistakes any human being can make. Reading about the deportations \u2014 the poor guy in Tijuana who just jumped off a bridge \u2014 I want to encourage Mexicans who are in the same situation to know they\u2019ll be welcome to come back and be in their own country.\u201cFrom 2007 to 2011, I worked as chef de cuisine at Pujol, and then at the end of 2010, the beginning of 2011, with a loan from an uncle of mine, I opened M\u00e1ximo Bistrot. The dream by then was not to become a well-known chef. It was to become a good chef. And, well, here we are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Trump Ally in Congress Warns His State, California, to Make Nice", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, keeps a souvenir from a dinner the night before this year\u2019s inauguration behind his desk: an embossed menu autographed by Donald J. Trump. The president-elect was at his table. Mr. McCarthy is not only the second-most powerful Republican in the House \u2014 he is also one of the earliest and most earnest supporters of the new president.But this weekend, Mr. McCarthy \u2014 one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill \u2014 returns home to his district in Bakersfield, Calif., a state that embodies the organized Democratic resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.By now, Mr. McCarthy said, he is getting used to the protesters who have turned up outside his home and district office since Election Day, the newspaper editorials demanding that he protect his state from Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and the state legislative hearings with testimony about the number of his constituents in danger of losing health coverage.\u201cI get demonstrations all the time,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said Thursday, as he prepared to fly home for a week of events in his district. \u201cI assume there will be some form of them again.\u201dOne month into the Trump presidency, Mr. McCarthy is a man with a foot in two warring camps. He represents a 10,000-square-mile red rural stronghold in the farmland of central California, a state that Mr. Trump lost by four million votes. His seniority in the House leadership, and his ties to Mr. Trump, mean that he is indisputably the most powerful Californian in the nation\u2019s capital.And in an interview here, Mr. McCarthy left no doubt that his loyalties in this fight were east of the Mississippi River. He assailed California\u2019s Democratic leaders for provoking the president, and warned that it could prove damaging to the state, particularly as the Trump administration created an infrastructure program to pay for public works projects across the nation.\u201cLook, I will represent my district, and I will represent my state,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in his first-floor suite of offices, between votes. \u201cBut what they are doing, they are playing with fire. Donald Trump is not going out in any way or form to attack California. They are the ones who are attacking California right now. They are the ones who are putting Californians at risk in every shape and form. And they are doing it to make a political point, which is wrong.\u201dIt has been only 10 years since Mr. McCarthy, 52, arrived here as a freshman member of Congress, the latest stop in a career that began in the California Assembly, where he rose to become the minority leader. His family has lived in Bakersfield for generations, and he attended Bakersfield College and business school at California State University and owned a delicatessen in his hometown before he turned to politics full time.Mr. McCarthy got his start in politics in college, where he was the head of the California Young Republicans. Soon after graduating, he sold his delicatessen and began working as the district director for Representative Bill Thomas, before leaving to run for the Assembly. He represents Mr. Thomas\u2019s former district today.Mr. McCarthy, who is married and has two children, still sleeps weeknights on a couch in his office, awakening every morning for a 6 o\u2019clock workout, and flying home most weekends.His quick ascension to power is partly a result of circumstance. The job opened after the previous majority leader, Eric Cantor, was upset in a primary by a Tea Party candidate in 2014. And Mr. McCarthy was an early supporter of Mr. Trump when many other Republican leaders, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, held back.But another part of his success is what seems, in this contentious time, the almost throwback style of glad-hand politicking that Mr. McCarthy embraces as he moves across the Capitol. A portrait of Ronald Reagan, a wide grin on his face, fills most of the west wall of his office.\u201cEverybody today wants to be a Reagan Republican, but how many walk around with that smile?\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Mr. McCarthy acknowledges that his friend the president may not exactly be a graduate of the smiling Reagan school of politics. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterize them the same way,\u201d he said.Nevertheless, with a handful of exceptions \u2014 including the president\u2019s call for a 35 percent border tariff \u2014 Mr. McCarthy has enthusiastically embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s early agenda, including tax reform, the immigration crackdown and paring government regulations.Mr. McCarthy is known more as a political strategist than an ideologue. Among his memorabilia is a framed picture of Mr. Cantor, Mr. Ryan and himself, taken when they released their book, \u201cYoung Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders.\u201d\u201cEric was the leader; Paul was the thinker. I was the strategist,\u201d he said. \u201cI analyzed people\u2019s districts. I know them backwards and forwards.\u201dMr. McCarthy inevitably will bear much of the brunt of trying to mediate between the president and California. Mr. Trump has threatened to defund California, calling it \u201cout of control,\u201d and the Democrat-controlled Legislature has hired Eric H. Holder Jr., a former United States attorney general, to lead the state\u2019s legal challenge.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to solve the immigration issue,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cYou have to have some form of guest workers program.\u201dAnd Mr. McCarthy has been a strong advocate of replacing the Affordable Care Act. There are 70,000 federal health insurance recipients in his district, the highest concentration in the state. California receives over $16 billion a year through the Affordable Care Act, equal to one-tenth of the annual state budget.\u201cHe\u2019s in a conundrum,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Democratic leader of the State Senate and a leading critic of Mr. Trump. \u201cDoes he toe the Republican line? It\u2019s my hope that Kevin will do the right thing and stand by the values and the people of California, irrespective of partisanship.\u201dGov. Jerry Brown, who has mixed his attacks on Mr. Trump with efforts to find common ground on some issues, including a $100 billion high-speed rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles, declined to comment on Mr. McCarthy.\u201cThat happens over Kevin McCarthy\u2019s dead body,\u201d Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former senior adviser to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor, said in an email.Mr. McCarthy\u2019s own political position seems safe. He was elected to a sixth term in November with 70 percent of the vote, one of 14 Republicans in the state\u2019s 55-seat congressional delegation.Mr. de Le\u00f3n and other Democrats said that given how integral California was to the nation\u2019s economy, Mr. Trump, with Mr. McCarthy at his ear, would be reluctant to impose damage on the state.\u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing how formidable a line of defense McCarthy will be,\u201d said Dan Schnur, who teaches political communications at the University of Southern California and also worked as an adviser to Mr. Wilson. \u201cBut he\u2019s the best shot they\u2019ve got.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Wouldn\u2019t Work Without Immigrants", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The workers of Silicon Valley make unlikely revolutionaries. As a group, they are relatively wealthy, well educated and well connected.While most here supported Hillary Clinton, tech workers are not the most obvious targets of President Trump\u2019s policy ideas. Many who populate the world\u2019s richest tech companies will be just fine if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. Most will not be personally inconvenienced by the proposed Mexican border wall.Under Mr. Trump, tech workers could enjoy a windfall. They may get tax credits for child care costs, their companies may be allowed to repatriate foreign profits, and their coming income tax cuts might fund a luxury vacation or two.\u201cSilicon Valley is unlikely, as a phenomenon \u2014 it is not the default state of the world,\u201d said John Collison, an immigrant from Ireland who is a co-founder of Stripe, a six-year-old payments start-up based in San Francisco.One important reason Silicon Valley can exist at all, he said, is that it is welcoming to people from far outside its borders. \u201cI go all across the world, and every other place is asking, \u2018How do we replicate Silicon Valley where we are \u2014 in London, in Paris, in Singapore, in Australia?\u2019\u201dThe reason those places have so far failed to create their own indomitable tech hubs is that everyone there wants to come here.\u201cThe U.S. is sucking up all the talent from all across the world,\u201d Mr. Collison said. \u201cLook at all the leading technology companies globally, and look at how overrepresented the United States is. That\u2019s not a normal state of affairs. That\u2019s because we have managed to create this engine where the best and the brightest from around the world are coming to Silicon Valley.\u201dBut, Mr. Collison added, \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of fragile.\u201d Under Mr. Trump, the immigrant-friendly dynamic could change \u2014 and it could bring about the ruin of American tech.And yet even a casual trip through most histories of the technology industry reveals an outsize role played by immigrants.Collectively, these companies, which include householdish names like Uber, Tesla and Palantir, had created thousands of jobs and added billions of dollars to the American economy. Their founders came from all over the world \u2014 India, Britain, Canada, Israel and China, among lots and lots of other points around the globe.That should come as no surprise if you are familiar with the origins of the most iconic companies of the last few decades. One of Google\u2019s founders is an immigrant from Russia, and its current chief executive is an immigrant from India. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive is also from India. EBay and Yahoo were started by immigrants. Facebook\u2019s largest subsidiaries, Instagram and WhatsApp, were both co-founded by immigrants. Apple was started by a child of immigrants.But if that criticism rings true in some parts of the tech industry, it misses the picture among Silicon Valley\u2019s top companies. One common misperception of Silicon Valley is that it operates like a factory; in that view, tech companies can hire just about anyone from anywhere in the world to fill a particular role.But today\u2019s most ambitious tech companies are not like factories. They\u2019re more like athletic teams. They\u2019re looking for the LeBrons and Bradys \u2014 the best people in the world to come up with some brand-new, never-before-seen widget, to completely reimagine what widgets should do in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s not about adding tens or hundreds of thousands of people into manufacturing plants,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the co-founder and chief executive of the cloud-storage company Box. \u201cIt\u2019s about the couple ideas that are going to be invented that are going to change everything.\u201dIf you look at some of the most consequential ideas in tech, you find an unusual number that were developed by immigrants. For instance, Google\u2019s entire advertising business \u2014 that is, the basis for the vast majority of its revenues and profits, the engine that allows it to hire thousands of people in the United States \u2014 was created by three immigrants: Salar Kamangar and Omid Kordestani, who came to the United States from Iran, and Eric Veach, from Canada.But it\u2019s not just a numbers thing. Another reason immigrants do so well in tech is that people from outside bring new perspectives that lead to new ideas.Mike Krieger, an immigrant from Brazil who is a co-founder of Instagram, the photo-based social network app, said one reason it found instant, international success was that he purposely eliminated most text from the app. He knew from growing up in Brazil that English would hinder adoption in most parts of the world.\u201cEvery step of the way while we were creating it,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were thinking, can you create something with international appeal?\u201dMr. Collison, of Stripe, said he could not imagine creating a company without immigrants. \u201cIn the early stages of a start-up you usually have a very specific set of things you need to do, and there\u2019s a very short list of people who are able to do them,\u201d he said.In its early years, Stripe needed engineers and executives to build its system for moving money around the world; it needed to create a novel machine-learning system to detect fraud; and it had to convince regulators and other businesses that it was safe and legal to process payments through Stripe. The people it found for all these roles happened to be immigrants.\u201cThe fact that we can do that in Silicon Valley \u2014 the fact that the talent is here or that we can bring the talent here, that\u2019s what makes the whole thing work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Immigration Hurt the Economy? An Old Prejudice Returns", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneFor a nation of immigrants, the United States has worked hard to keep foreigners out.The quota system was overhauled in 1965, and immigration law today is more evenhanded. Still, the suspicion of immigrants as threats to society remains close to the surface. By claiming that people from Muslim nations threaten national security, that Mexicans are drug dealers and rapists, that immigrants take the jobs of Americans or burden taxpayers by reliance on welfare, President Trump has drawn it back to the center of political debate.This time, suspicion is being buttressed by some economists with a proposition not too dissimilar to Laughlin\u2019s: that immigrants could sap America\u2019s vitality by bringing inferior cultural traits from their dysfunctional home countries to erode American social norms.It\u2019s an unsettling assertion. It is laid out with striking candor by Paul Collier, the noted British development economist from Oxford, in his 2013 book \u201cExodus: How Migration Is Changing Our World\u201d (Oxford University Press). \u201cMigrants bring their culture with them,\u201d he wrote. Countries that receive them run the risk \u201cthat the social model will become blended in such a way that damagingly dilutes its functionality.\u201dThis idea has gained more currency in Europe \u2014 which until the recent influx from North Africa and the Middle East had experienced comparatively little immigration from poorer nations. But it is getting a hearing in the United States, too, giving shape to an argument that immigration, by bringing inferior norms and culture from abroad, may be eroding American productivity.Not unlike Laughlin in his time, George J. Borjas, a prominent Harvard economist who has written innumerable publications making a case for stricter immigration policies, argues that the quality of immigrants has deteriorated since the old days. To him, however, the dividing line is set in 1965. In his recent book \u201cWe Wanted Workers: Unraveling the Immigration Narrative\u201d (Norton), he argues that \u201cthe new and the old arrivals are different kinds of workers, with the new arrivals being less productive.\u201dContagion by immigrants from the global South is top of mind: \u201cImagine that immigrants do carry some baggage with them, and that baggage, when unloaded in the new environment, dilutes some of the North\u2019s productive edge.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, architect of the administration\u2019s turn against immigration, might be drawn to some of this scholarship. The proposition that immigrants hamper productivity in their newfound homes could make a case for far more restrictive immigration controls than the United States has in place today. \u201cAnalogous to climate change, we do not know how large an unabsorbed diaspora would need to be before it significantly weakened the mutual regard on which the high-income societies depend,\u201d Professor Collier wrote.And as Mr. Borjas points out, it is true that the gap between wages of immigrants and natives is larger than it was a few decades ago, and that immigrants take longer to catch up. This may suggest that their productivity may not match that of previous waves of immigrants.Critically, those asserting that immigrants bring a contagious decline in productivity have yet to provide any evidence that this has happened, only conjecture. Is there a threshold where further immigration starts doing real damage? How close is the United States to it? What is the mechanism whereby productivity in the United States might be reduced by immigrants\u2019 weaker attributes?If productivity growth comes from better technology or production capabilities, how could immigrants sap it? If immigrants\u2019 culture affects American productivity \u2014 say, by reducing investment or undermining belief in private property \u2014 how big would immigration have to be to yield that effect?Even if unfettered immigration from, say, Mexico, were at some point to transmit low productivity to the United States, today the evidence suggests that restrictions on immigration are too tight, not too weak.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Venture Capitalist\u2019s Misguided Critique of a Trump Adviser", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorChief among Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s errors, according to Mr. Moritz, was the use of the carried-interest tax. Under this tax treatment, top executives in both private equity and venture capital pay lower capital gains taxes, instead of higher income taxes \u2014 \u201can indefensible quirk in the United States tax code,\u201d Mr. Moritz wrote.Private equity firms also regularly borrow money to buy companies, and deduct the interest paid on that debt. For good measure, Mr. Moritz cast aspersions on that business model, portraying private equity as wreckers of companies and job destroyers as well as a \u201csymbol\u201d for \u201ceconomic inequality.\u201dAnd then he tied it all to Mr. Trump, throwing in a line that the relationship between Mr. Schwarzman and the president resembled a scene from \u201cGoodfellas.\u201dThe Op-Ed article was so over the top in its attacks on Mr. Schwarzman and private equity that it obscured some very valid points.Carried interest was in the cross hairs for elimination under the Obama administration and has drawn complaints from many, including Mr. Trump, as giving an undue tax break to wealthy private equity and venture capital fund managers.Still, all of these issues are up for debate, and one has to wonder why Mr. Moritz appeared to get so personal in his opinion article.A spokesman for Sequoia said, \u201cMichael\u2019s views are strictly personal and not those of Sequoia Capital.\u201d Mr. Moritz declined to comment for this column.But perhaps it\u2019s a sign that increasingly, all is not completely rosy in the world of alternative investment funds, private equity and venture capital among them.The worst off are the funds not mentioned by Mr. Moritz: hedge funds. Buffeted by years of declining returns and poor performance, the $3 trillion hedge fund industry may be peaking.The Trump administration, with its vow to crank up infrastructure spending and reinflate the economy, could improve the picture on returns. Tax and regulatory changes could also help. Still, a number of large investors, including public pension funds, are growing skeptical about the hedge fund model.If hedge funds are in the most precarious position, private equity funds are also facing doubts. The funds continue to raise billions of dollars, but their share of public buyouts has fallen. Private equity constituted less than 3 percent of public buyouts in 2016, according to Dealogic.While private equity returns have been great in the past, it is unclear if they can be sustained, with some market analysts seeing stock prices as too high. And a majority of sales of companies owned by private equity funds are simply to other private equity firms, according to Pitchbook.With the industry facing challenges in the market, the loss of carried-interest tax and the debt tax deduction would be huge blows, lowering returns.All is not so great in venture capital either. Bill Gates has called the returns of venture capital funds \u201cpathetic.\u201dSure, some of the biggest funds have enjoyed very healthy returns, but those have been juiced by the $1 billion club of hot start-ups known as \u201cunicorns.\u201d And their valuations are big questions.The coming initial public offering of the messaging service Snap could well revive investor demand for unicorns. Or it may not. In any case, the competition in technology investing is intensifying.There are other challenges facing venture capital: Near-zero interest rates are like gasoline on venture capital investments. If interest rates go up, valuations may fall rapidly. Venture capital partners will also lose if the carried-interest deduction is eliminated.Mr. Moritz\u2019s criticism of private equity can be seen as an effort to make venture capital look better \u2014 better for investors and the country. It\u2019s easy to see why. Private equity will increasingly become a competitor \u2014 for tech investors and investors\u2019 dollars.In other words, there will be shakeout among all funds, a disruption that will hit private equity, venture capital and all other funds.How else to explain such a diatribe?Here is a man who points the finger at private equity for fostering income inequality, while ignoring venture capital\u2019s own role in perpetuating it. Sequoia Capital, for example, is a big investor in Airbnb, an alternative to hotels and their employees, who are often in union jobs. Sequoia is also an investor in self-driving technology that is sure to wreak havoc with taxi jobs and the one million truck drivers across the country.In these politically divided times, heated statements seem to be everywhere, drowning out more rational arguments. That Mr. Moritz would feel the need to join this crowd is disappointing. Perhaps he should instead focus on his own business, as changes may be coming to venture capital, as well as to his private equity brethren.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "How Washington State Upended Trump\u2019s Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile President Trump\u2019s travel ban threw American airports into chaos last weekend, Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington State, was biding his time on an airplane.On his way home from a conference of Democratic attorneys general in Florida, Mr. Ferguson landed a week ago in the center of a political and legal firestorm. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was in disarray, with protests massing. Gov. Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat, had sent word to the attorney general\u2019s staff that he wanted to mount a battering-ram attack on the president\u2019s decree.A genial 51-year-old with an earnest demeanor, Mr. Ferguson cuts an unlikely figure as an antagonist for the most pugilistic president in modern times. He is seen in the state less as a chest-thumping showman than as a former member of the King County Council with a wonky sensibility and an eager manner.But Mr. Ferguson, by his own account and the description of his associates, was incensed and offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration restrictions. And having landed in Seattle on the first full day the ban was in effect \u2014 while demonstrations grew across the country \u2014 he went home to greet his family and then went to work devising a plan to cripple Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy.In an interview, Mr. Ferguson said he had concluded from the start that Mr. Trump\u2019s order was \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional,\u201d and that any appropriate response would have to aim at neutering it entirely. Eschewing the approach of other Democratic-leaning states, which have challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s order by highlighting the claims of individual plaintiffs, Mr. Ferguson and his office opted to draft a complaint arguing that the ban would cause drastic damage to Washington State as a whole.Mr. Ferguson said he had recognized at the time that this was a potentially risky approach, seeking a more sweeping victory with a comparatively untested legal strategy.But Mr. Ferguson, a former state chess champion, explained in precise language that he had decided it was a gamble worth taking.\u201cFrom my standpoint there is risk in everything, but I am someone who believes in calculated risk,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said in the interview. \u201cOne just needs to be comfortable with that. And when it comes to the constitutional rights of my people, the people I represent, I\u2019m prepared to take a calculated risk on their behalf.\u201dMr. Inslee, also in an interview, said he strongly backed Mr. Ferguson\u2019s approach, viewing Mr. Trump\u2019s order as a unique threat to their state\u2019s economy, which depends heavily on international trade, and to the state\u2019s diverse population. In his view, the governor said, the state was right to make \u201cany plausible claim\u201d to take down the order.Few other states adopted such a daring strategy. Mr. Ferguson said he had invited other Democratic attorneys general to join in his lawsuit, finding only one taker so far: Lori Swanson of Minnesota. Mr. Ferguson said there were other states still weighing whether to join him.Mr. Inslee described the Friday ruling as a special kind of victory for Washington State, which draws relatively little attention in national politics but tends to race ahead of national trends on social issues.\u201cIt\u2019s part of our nature and history,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. \u201cThis is the first time this administration has been reined in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Future of Not Working", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "The Future of WorkAs automation reduces the need for human labor, some Silicon Valley executives think a universal income will be the answer \u2014 and the beta test is happening in Kenya.Supported byIn October, I visited Kennedy Aswan Abagi, the village chief, at his small red-earth home, decorated with posters celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden and the lives of African heroes, including JaKogelo, or \u201cthe man from Kogelo,\u201d as locals refer to former President Barack Obama. Kogelo, where Obama\u2019s father was born, is just 20 miles from the village, which lies close to the banks of Lake Victoria. Abagi told me about the day his town\u2019s fate changed. It happened during the summer, when field officers from an American nonprofit called GiveDirectly paid a visit, making an unbelievable promise: They wanted to give everyone money, no strings attached. \u201cI asked, \u2018Why this village?\u2019\u2009\u201d Abagi recalled, but he never got a clear answer, or one that made much sense to him.The villagers had seen Western aid groups come through before, sure, but nearly all of them brought stuff, not money. And because many of these organizations were religious, their gifts came with moral impositions; I was told that one declined to help a young mother whose child was born out of wedlock, for example. With little sense of who would get what and how and from whom and why, rumors blossomed. One villager heard that GiveDirectly would kidnap children. Some thought that the organization was aligned with the Illuminati, or that it would blight the village with giant snakes, or that it performed blood magic. Others heard that the money was coming from Obama himself.But the confusion faded that unseasonably cool morning in October, when a GiveDirectly team returned to explain themselves during a town meeting. Nearly all of the village\u2019s 220 people crowded into a blue-and-white tent placed near the school building, watching nervously as 13 strangers, a few of them white, sat on plastic chairs opposite them. Lydia Tala, a Kenyan GiveDirectly staff member, got up to address the group in Dholuo. She spoke at a deliberate pace, awaiting a hum and a nod from the crowd before she moved on: These visitors are from GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a nongovernmental organization that is not affiliated with any political party. GiveDirectly is based in the United States. GiveDirectly works with mobile phones. Each person must have his or her own mobile phone, and they must keep their PIN secret. Nobody must involve themselves in criminal activity or terrorism. This went on for nearly two hours. The children were growing restless.Finally, Tala passed the microphone to her colleague, Brian Ouma. \u201cPeople of the village,\u201d he said, \u201care you happy?\u201d\u201cWe are!\u201d they cried in unison.Then he laid out the particulars. \u201cEvery registered person will receive 2,280 shillings\u201d \u2014 about $22 \u2014 \u201ceach and every month. You hear me?\u201d The audience gasped and burst into wild applause. \u201cEvery person we register here will receive the money, I said \u2014 2,280 shillings! Every month. This money, you will get for the next 12 years. How many years?\u201d\u201cTwelve years!\u201dJust like that, with peals of ululation and children breaking into dance in front of the strangers, the whole village was lifted out of extreme poverty. (I have agreed to withhold its name out of concern for the villagers\u2019 safety.) The nonprofit is in the process of registering roughly 40 more villages with a total of 6,000 adult residents, giving those people a guaranteed, 12-year-long, poverty-ending income. An additional 80 villages, with 11,500 residents all together, will receive a two-year basic income. With this initiative, GiveDirectly \u2014 with an office in New York and funded in no small part by Silicon Valley \u2014 is starting the world\u2019s first true test of a universal basic income. The idea is perhaps most in vogue in chilly, left-leaning places, among them Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. But many economists think it might have the most promise in places with poorer populations, like India and sub-Saharan Africa.GiveDirectly wants to show the world that a basic income is a cheap, scalable way to aid the poorest people on the planet. \u201cWe have the resources to eliminate extreme poverty this year,\u201d Michael Faye, a founder of GiveDirectly, told me. But these resources are often misallocated or wasted. His nonprofit wants to upend incumbent charities, offering major donors a platform to push money to the world\u2019s neediest immediately and practically without cost.What happens in this village has the potential to transform foreign-aid institutions, but its effects might also be felt closer to home. A growing crowd, including many of GiveDirectly\u2019s backers in Silicon Valley, are looking at this pilot project not just as a means of charity but also as the groundwork for an argument that a universal basic income might be right for you, me and everyone else around the world too.Silicon Valley has recently become obsessed with basic income for reasons simultaneously generous and self-interested, as a palliative for the societal turbulence its inventions might unleash. Many technologists believe we are living at the precipice of an artificial-intelligence revolution that could vault humanity into a postwork future. In the past few years, artificially intelligent systems have become proficient at a startling number of tasks, from reading cancer scans to piloting a car to summarizing a sports game to translating prose. Any job that can be broken down into discrete, repeatable tasks \u2014 financial analytics, marketing, legal work \u2014 could be automated out of existence.In this vision of the future, our economy could turn into a funhouse-mirror version of itself: extreme income and wealth inequality, rising poverty, mass unemployment, a shrinking prime-age labor force. It would be more George Saunders than George Jetson. But what does this all have to do with a small village in Kenya?A universal basic income has thus far lacked what tech folks might call a proof of concept. There have been a handful of experiments, including ones in Canada, India and Namibia. Finland is sending money to unemployed people, and the Dutch city Utrecht is doing a trial run, too. But no experiment has been truly complete, studying what happens when you give a whole community money for an extended period of time \u2014 when nobody has to worry where his or her next meal is coming from or fear the loss of a job or the birth of a child.And so, the tech industry is getting behind GiveDirectly and other organizations testing the idea out. Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder and briefly the owner of The New Republic, has started a $10 million, two-year initiative to explore the viability of a basic income. (He has also been a major donor to GiveDirectly.) The research wing of Sam Altman\u2019s start-up incubator, Y Combinator, is planning to pass out money to 1,000 families in California and another yet-to-be-determined state. Then there is GiveDirectly itself, which has attracted $24 million in donations for its basic-income effort, including money from founders of Facebook, Instagram, eBay and a number of other Silicon Valley companies. Many donors I spoke with cited their interest in the project as purely philanthropic. But others saw it as a chance to learn more about a universal basic income, a way to prove that it could work and a chance to show people the human face of a hypothetical policy fix.In December, Altman, the 31-year-old president of Y Combinator, spoke at an anti-poverty event hosted by Stanford, the White House and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable institution the Facebook billionaire founded with his wife, Priscilla. Altman discussed the potential for basic income to alleviate poverty, but his speech veered back to the dark questions that hang over all this philanthropy: Is Silicon Valley about to put the world out of work? And if so, do technologists owe the world a solution?\u201cThere have been these moments where we have had these major technology revolutions \u2014 the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, for example \u2014 that have really changed the world in a big way,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the middle or at least on the cusp of another one.\u201dThe idea for the nonprofit came to Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus, who is now a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, when they were graduate students at Harvard. Both were studying development and doing fieldwork overseas, an experience that underlined an Economics 101 lesson: Cash was more valuable to its recipients than the in-kind gifts commonly distributed by aid groups, like food or bed nets or sports equipment. If you\u2019re hungry, you cannot eat a bed net. If your village is suffering from endemic diarrhea, soccer balls won\u2019t be worth much to you. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve been there, it\u2019s hard to imagine doing anything but cash,\u201d Faye told me. \u201cIt\u2019s so deeply uncomfortable to ask someone if they want cash or something else. They look at you like it\u2019s a trick question.\u201dBut at the time, distributing cash aid in a country with little to no banking infrastructure outside major cities would have required an extraordinary amount of manpower, not to mention introducing the risk of robbery and graft. But dirt-cheap mobile phones with pay-as-you-go minutes began flooding into sub-Saharan African markets in the 2000s. Enterprising Ghanaians, Kenyans and Nigerians started to use their minutes as a kind of currency. In 2007, Vodafone and the British Department for International Development together built a system, called M-Pesa, for Kenyans to transfer actual shillings from cellphone to cellphone. An estimated 96 percent of Kenyan households use the system today.Faye and Niehaus \u2014 along with their friends Rohit Wanchoo and Jeremy Shapiro, also graduate students \u2014 thought about setting up a website to raise cash in the United States and send it directly to poor Kenyans. But they never found a nonprofit that would distribute that cash abroad. They decided to do it themselves in 2008. \u201cBecause it was a start-up, and we started in grad school,\u201d Faye said, \u201cwe were open to the idea of it being wrong or failing.\u201dThe following year, Faye traveled to small Kenyan villages during the summer break, offering cash to whoever seemed poor and would take it. (The money, about $5,000, came out of the foursome\u2019s own pockets.) That, surprisingly, worked well enough to give them the confidence to start a threadbare randomized control trial the year they graduated. It found that the recipients, who received an average of $500, saw excellent outcomes: Their children were 42 percent less likely to go a whole day without eating. Domestic-violence rates dropped, and mental health improved.In time, the nonprofit attracted the attention of Silicon Valley and its deep-pocketed young philanthropists. Two Facebook founders gave six-figure donations. Then, in the spring of 2012, Faye went to a friend\u2019s brunch in Brooklyn and met someone working for Google.org, the tech giant\u2019s giving arm. She liked the sound of GiveDirectly and arranged for Faye and Niehaus to give a presentation at Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company ended up contributing $2.4 million.At first, GiveDirectly handed out large lump sums, generally $1,000 spread into three payments over the course of the year. The nonprofit\u2019s field officers would locate low-income villages in Kenya, then find the poorest families in each individual village using a simple asset test (whether a family had a thatched roof or not). The field officers would introduce themselves to the town elders, explain their purpose and return to provide mobile phones and training to recipient families. Then GiveDirectly would push a button and send the money out.The residents of this village had received money in 2013, and it was visibly better off than the basic-income pilot village. Its clearings were filled with mango plantings, its cows sturdy. A small lake on the outskirts had been lined with nets for catching fish. \u201cCould you imagine sitting in an office in London or New York trying to figure out what this village needs?\u201d Bassin said as he admired a well-fed cow tied up by the lakeside. \u201cIt would just be impossible.\u201dPerhaps, but delivering money by M-Pesa has some downsides, too. We visited an older woman named Anjelina Akoth Ngalo, her joints painful and swollen with advanced malaria. Sitting in her thatched-roof hut, she told us that she had received only one payment, not the three that she was promised. She had given her phone to a woman in a nearby village who transferred the money out of it. Ngalo visited the village elder to try to get her money back, but nothing had come of it. She was now destitute, living on about $5 a week. She had not eaten since the day before, and she had run out of malaria medication. (Bassin said that less than 1 percent of recipients experience theft, crime or conflict.)By giving money to some but not all, the organization had unwittingly strained the social fabric of some of these tight-knit tribal communities. One man we visited in a separate village nearby, Nicolus Owuor Otin, had acted as a liaison between the community and the GiveDirectly staff, showing them where different families\u2019 houses were, for instance. For that reason, he said, the other villagers thought he was determining who would get what and threatened to burn his house down.Still, nearly all the recipients described the money as transformative. Fredrick Omondi Auma \u2014 a Burning Spear devotee wearing a Rasta-style hat and bell bottoms when we visited \u2014 had been impoverished, drinking too much, abandoned by his wife and living in a mud hut when GiveDirectly knocked on his door. He used his money to buy a motorbike to give taxi rides. He also started a small business, selling soap, salt and paraffin in a local town center; he bought two cows, one of which had given birth; and he opened a barbershop in the coastal city Mombasa. His income had gone from 600 shillings a week to 2,500 shillings \u2014 roughly $25, a princely sum for the area. His wife had returned. He had even stopped drinking as much. \u201cI used to go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I\u2019d wake up in the bar with 100 shillings,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I wake up at home with 900.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I would be living in an iron-sheet house,\u201d he said, referring to his roof. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d be wearing nice shoes. I didn\u2019t imagine I would have a business, and earnings from it. I didn\u2019t imagine I would be a man who owns cattle.\u201dAll across the villages of western Kenya, it was clear to me just how much aid money was wasted on unnecessary stuff. The villagers had too many jerrycans and water tanks, because a nongovernmental organization kept bringing them. There was a thriving trade in Toms canvas slip-ons: People received them free from NGO workers and then turned around and sold them in the market centers. And none of the aid groups that had visited the villages managed to help the very poorest families.In the pilot-project village, for example, Faye and I paid a visit to a woman named Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo, who lives in a mud hut on the edge of town with her husband, Jack, a laborer, and her two small children. The most expensive thing she ever bought, she told me, was a chicken for 500 shillings, or about $5. Her family was persistently hungry. She knew of three nonprofit groups that had helped the village before GiveDirectly. One aided families with school fees, but it chose not to help her children. \u201cI do not want to talk about it,\u201d she said.What is worse, Faye told me, walking away from Odhiambo\u2019s hut, was that most nonprofit projects in the region were never subject to anything like an impact assessment, either. There is no way to know how well they are working, or whether that money would be better spent on something else. \u201cThe question should always be: Would we be better off just giving this money away as cash?\u201d Faye said. \u201cThere usually is not a way to answer that question.\u201dA vast majority of aid \u2014 94 percent \u2014 is noncash. Donor resistance is one reason for this; it is not easy to persuade American oligarchs, British inheritors and Japanese industrialists to fork over their money to the extremely poor to use as they see fit. \u201cThere\u2019s the usual worries about welfare dependency, the whole \u2018Give a man a fish\u2019 thing,\u201d said Amanda Glassman, a public health and development expert at the Center for Global Development. \u201cIt\u2019s so powerful. It\u2019s really a basic psychological feature of the landscape. You\u2019ll start drinking. You\u2019ll start lying around at home because you\u2019re getting paid.\u201dCash also seems harder to market. American taxpayers might be perfectly happy to fund education for young women in poor countries or vaccinations for schoolchildren. But they might balk at the idea of showering money on poor, unstable countries. \u201cThe visual of putting a pill in a kid\u2019s mouth is so much more attractive to people,\u201d Glassman said.Institutional inertia is another factor. \u201cThere are a lot of good people working in the system,\u201d Niehaus said. \u201cAnd there are a lot of organizations pushing to do cash transfers. But the way they are structured and incentivized from the top down \u2014 they aren\u2019t structured to do it. They have a specific mandate, like health. Cash transfers give choice of what goal to pursue to the recipients.\u201dMoreover, cash might force aid workers and nongovernmental organizations to confront the fact that they could be doing better by doing things differently \u2014 often by doing less. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to muster evidence that you should be giving cash instead of fertilizer,\u201d said Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development. \u201cThe harder argument is: You should shut down your U.S.A.I.D. program, which is bigger than the education budget of Liberia, and give the money to Liberians. That\u2019s the radical critique.\u201d Faye put it more bluntly, if half-jokingly: If cash transfers flourished, \u201cthe whole aid industry would have to fire itself.\u201dThere is something to that. One estimate, generated by Laurence Chandy and Brina Seidel of the Brookings Institution, recently calculated that the global poverty gap \u2014 meaning how much it would take to get everyone above the poverty line \u2014 was just $66 billion. That is roughly what Americans spend on lottery tickets every year, and it is about half of what the world spends on foreign aid.But here, many villagers were concerned primarily with procuring the sustenance and basic comforts that their penury had denied them. Odhiambo, the woman who had not been offered aid by the school group, planned to buy corrugated iron sheets for her roof; she considered possibly paying off her dowry. Another villager, Pamela Aooko Odero, ran a household that had been suffering from hunger, with all eight of them living on just 500 to 1,000 shillings a week. She took her money as soon as she got it and went to buy food.Many more made plans that were entrepreneurial. Two widowed sister-wives, Margaret Aloma Abagi and Mary Abonyo Abagi, told me they planned to pool their funds together to start a small bank with some friends. Charles Omari Ager, a houseboy for the sister-wives, had his phone turned off and wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket when the first text came in. He was driving the widows\u2019 goats and cattle from one dried-out, bramble-filled meadow to another when he happened upon an aid worker, who prompted him to pull out his phone, turn it on and wait. The text was there. The money was there. \u201cI\u2019m happy! I\u2019m happy! I\u2019m happy!\u201d he said. He bought himself a goat that day.When the nets were done, he told me, he would rent a boat and hire a day laborer to work with him. He anticipated that his income, after costs, might reach as much as 2,000 shillings on a good day. I asked him why he hadn\u2019t saved money for nets beforehand.He shrugged, smiled and said, \u201cI could not.\u201dAnnie Lowrey is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a former economic-policy reporter for The Times.

{"Headline": "Why the Iran Nuclear Deal Must Stand", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Standing next to Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at a news conference Wednesday, President Trump inveighed against the nuclear agreement with Iran, declaring it \u201cone of the worst deals ever made.\u201d On this matter, Mr. Trump has been consistent \u2014 he has called the deal \u201cterrible,\u201d \u201ca disgrace,\u201d \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d and said his No. 1 priority as president would be to dismantle it.So it was striking last week when senior administration officials told the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, that President Trump was committed to fully carrying out the accord. The administration officials told the press the same thing in tamping down a fiery statement about Iran from Michael T. Flynn, when he was still Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser.Maybe President Trump\u2019s bluster masks a growing recognition within the administration that the deal is a good one for America\u2019s security and that of our allies. It reaffirms and strengthens Iran\u2019s commitment, under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to never acquire a nuclear weapon. It imposes powerful constraints on Iran\u2019s ability to quickly amass a stockpile of fissile material for a bomb. It includes an inspections regime perhaps more rigorous than any other. And it pays for all of that with Iran\u2019s own money.According to Adam Szubin, who until recently was the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions supervisor, Iran has regained access to about $50 billion in frozen funds (not $150 billion, as critics allege), far less than Iran requires for more than $500 billion in unmet economic needs \u2014 like government salaries, pensions, debts and infrastructure investment \u2014 and to support its currency.But any apparent retreat by the administration may be temporary and tactical \u2014 not a strategic rethink. While Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson are said to counsel sticking with the deal, senior White House advisers continue to talk it down around Washington. These advisers do recognize that a frontal assault \u2014 through unilateral American withdrawal \u2014 would divide us from our European, Russian and Chinese negotiating partners, isolating the United States rather than Iran. Instead, they envisage the deal\u2019s demise by other means.One approach is to demand a \u201cbetter deal.\u201d President Trump\u2019s broadsides help lay the predicate for a renegotiation. This might be focused on greater access to military sites or on the agreement\u2019s \u201csunset provisions,\u201d through which some constraints on Iran\u2019s nuclear program will be phased out over time. Or it could center on Iran\u2019s testing of ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, which is not covered by the agreement and remains subject to sanction under a United Nations Security Council resolution \u2014 and for which Mr. Flynn put Iran \u201con notice.\u201dGiven the effort that went into reaching the agreement and its complexity, it is highly unlikely the other signatories would support a renegotiation. Unless, that is, the administration offered \u201cmore for more\u201d \u2014 for example, greater economic benefits to Iran in return for additional constraints on its nuclear program. It is equally implausible that the Trump administration would be willing to \u201cgive\u201d Iran anything. The main purpose of demanding a renegotiation would be to generate a slow-motion breakdown while muddying the waters so that Washington could avoid blame.Another approach is to increase pressure on Iran in non-nuclear areas, resulting in a crisis that would give hard-line opponents of the deal in Tehran cause to pull the plug \u2014 and let Washington off the hook. There is no shortage of objectionable Iranian behavior. In addition to the ballistic missile tests, the government provides lethal aid to Houthi rebels in Yemen, harasses shipping in the Persian Gulf, sustains the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, backs Hezbollah and Hamas, supports violent Shiite militias in Iraq and represses its own people.The Obama administration was clear that the nuclear deal did not give Iran a pass for its nefarious activities. It maintained a long litany of non-nuclear domestic and international sanctions, continued to enforce them and beefed up military and intelligence cooperation with our Gulf allies. But President Obama also concluded that these same nefarious activities would be far more dangerous and difficult to confront if they were carried out under an Iranian nuclear umbrella. He was careful to calibrate additional pressure, in order to keep our international partners with us and prevent the nuclear deal from derailing.The Trump administration could crank the pressure beyond the breaking point. For example, it could reimpose sanctions lifted by the nuclear deal under a non-nuclear rationale, which Tehran would interpret as a violation of the accord. Or it could designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization \u2014 a move reported to be under active consideration.The Revolutionary Guard Corps is the official protector of Iran\u2019s revolution, with 100,000 troops divided into air, naval and ground divisions. It plays a large role in Iran\u2019s economy. Its international paramilitary arm, the Quds Force, is Tehran\u2019s main vehicle for supporting Shiite proxy forces. The Bush and Obama administrations named Iran a state sponsor of terrorism and put sanctions on individual Revolutionary Guard commanders and two dozen Iranian firms to which the guard corps is connected. But they stopped short of designating the guards corps itself a terrorist organization because the potential blowback outweighed the benefits.A direct challenge to the Revolutionary Guards Corps would likely cause its commanders to press for Iran\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal. It would undermine the re-election prospects of the accord\u2019s main advocate, President Hassan Rouhani, who seeks to moderate Iran\u2019s international behavior. It could also prompt the guards corps to unleash Shiite militias against United States forces in Iraq \u2014 just when our shared, if uncoordinated, objective of defeating the Islamic State there is within reach \u2014 or to go after American ships in the Gulf or shut down the Straits of Hormuz, through which 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil flows.Any of these actions could escalate into a full conflict, especially in the absence of the effective crisis management channel established by John Kerry when he was secretary of state and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. In that event, losing the nuclear deal might be the least of our concerns.Antony J. Blinken, a deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Are the Richest of the Rich?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isn\u2019t a lot of money in 1997.Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, \u201cO.K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion.\u201dTwenty years after the movie \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d was released, billions of dollars aren\u2019t what they used to be, either.Bill Gates alone is just $10 billion shy of Dr. Evil\u2019s ransom demand, according to a list of the world\u2019s top 10 billionaires compiled by Wealth-X, a financial research firm. Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, tops the list at $89.3 billion, followed by his friend Warren Buffett at $73.5 billion.The top 10 \u2014 nine from the United States, one from Spain \u2014 have a combined net worth of $582 billion. While their wealth would certainly be enough to save the world from Dr. Evil, what they do with it in real life is the subject of great interest and debate.That is true now more than ever. Issues around money \u2014 like wealth inequality and talk of tax cuts for the rich \u2014 are among the hottest topics of the day. And the richest president in history is sitting in the Oval Office, with billionaires sprinkled throughout his cabinet.To some, today\u2019s billionaires are like Dr. Evil: selfish, rapacious and bent on world domination. To others, billionaires are worthy of respect for having put their names and fortunes behind an array of philanthropic endeavors, many aimed at improving the lives of people at the very base of the wealth pyramid.There were 2,473 billionaires in the world, as of Wealth-X\u2019s last count through 2015. That was a 6.4 percent increase in billionaires from the year before.But who these billionaires are and what they\u2019re like is more difficult to discern. Many may seem as ordinary as the guy sitting next to you on the train \u2014 or in Michael Bloomberg\u2019s case, standing beside you on the subway, when he was mayor of New York. (Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on Wealth-X\u2019s list.)There are certainly billionaires who want to save the world, like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bloomberg, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. Others in the top 10 are also philanthropic, but they are still focusing on their day jobs, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Alphabet (the parent of Google) \u2014 Nos. 4, 5 and 10.Yet many of the billionaires beyond the top 10 or 20 have a much lower profile. Who outside of finance or hockey knew of Vincent Viola, a former oil trader and current owner of the Florida Panthers, before President Trump nominated him to be secretary of the Army? Now that he has withdrawn, he can return to relative anonymity.For that matter, Wilbur L. Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, is the wealthiest of the president\u2019s billionaire cabinet picks. He would pop up in the headlines every few years for a deal he was making but then return to what could be called the quiet opulence of the billionaire class.\u201cThey\u2019re different in how they can invest their assets and what their portfolio may look like,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said. \u201cIn many ways, they face different risks, both personal risks and cyber risks, than the average individual does. They often think about structuring decisions differently from a succession-planning standpoint as well as the structure they create around themselves and their family.\u201dYet for most people, billionaires are just wealthy beyond belief. And these days, they are also much wealthier (and getting even more so) than the broader ultra-high-net-worth population.That group is defined as anyone with more than $30 million. In 2015, there were 212,615 of them. On the lower end, the 155,050 people worth between $30 million and $99 million had a combined $8.4 trillion. At the top, the world\u2019s 2,473 billionaires were worth $7.68 trillion.\u201cThere is growing inequality around the world, but there is also inequality among the ultrawealthy,\u201d said Maya Imberg, director of custom research at Wealth-X.Billionaires also matter because of the outsize influence they have, or believe they can have, on policy and public life. They can give millions to a political campaign, as Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, did with Mr. Trump, or as George Soros, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has done with liberal causes.But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group. How they amassed their billions, and how that pile is growing, tells a lot about the economy today.Just as the best teacher in the country is going to earn less money than a mediocre investment banker, the industries in which future billionaires begin their careers determine the magnitude of their wealth and how quickly it is going to grow.Six of the top 10 billionaires made their money in technology. But in Wealth-X\u2019s research, technology ranks sixth overall for the number of billionaires on the list, with 114 around the world.Finance has created the most billionaires, with 377, or 15 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires. It is followed by industrial conglomerates, with 317, or 13 percent.After that, the concentration in particular industries drops. Real estate is third with 141. The group of people who identify their industry as nonprofits (meaning they made their money some other way or inherited it) is fourth, with 122. Manufacturing, in fifth place, has 120.\u201cGlobalization has been a big trend,\u201d said Benjamin Kinnard, a research analyst at Wealth-X. \u201cThe market is now seven billion people, not just the size of your domestic country.\u201dHe added that finance had a bigger lead in first place several years ago, but it has been losing ground as industries like technology boom.A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other people\u2019s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified.The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance.And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts).While the number of billionaires in China is rising at a fast clip, the pace of growth in billionaires worldwide is slowing. Wealth-X said the number will be 3,250 by 2020, down 16 percent from an earlier prediction of 3,873. This is because economic growth is expected to slow around the world.Across the billionaire spectrum, the biggest proportion of billionaires\u2019 wealth \u2014 about half \u2014 is in the business that created the wealth in the first place, according to Wealth-X\u2019s research. After that, they have about a quarter of their money in public securities and a little less than a quarter in cash. Just 4 percent is in real estate and luxury assets, the research found.There are common strains to how they cross the billionaire line, regardless of industry: 57 percent are self-made, according to Wealth-X, and another 31 percent received an inheritance and grew it into billions.\u201cTiming has a lot to do with it,\u201d said John Mathews, head of private wealth management and the ultra-high-net-worth group at UBS. \u201cIf we looked back 100 years, it would have been a really great time to be in steel, railroad or infrastructure businesses. Today, it\u2019s a good time to be in technology and finance.\u201dBut there is a difference from the bottom of the billionaire ladder to the top: Most are on that first rung.Over half of all billionaires are worth between $1 billion and $2 billion. Go up to $5 billion and there are 2,101.And not all billionaires are household names.Ma Jianrong, executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group Holdings, which is the leading textile company in China and manufactures clothing for Nike, Adidas, Puma and Uniqlo, is worth $4.3 billion.Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, built his wealth through mining in South Africa after starting his career as a lawyer in the United States. He is now worth $2.1 billion.Kevin Systrom, chief executive of Instagram, is surely well known in Silicon Valley \u2014 and among students at Stanford University (his alma mater) who want to emulate his route to a net worth of $1.2 billion by age 33. But he is not as recognizable as Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook.But being a billionaire, as opposed to a very wealthy millionaire, can make a huge difference in the loss of privacy for a family. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to be anonymous,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said.And being known as billionaires opens them up to risks, she said, like cybersecurity breaches and attacks on their families.How single-digit billionaires add additional billions isn\u2019t always up to them.One way to become even wealthier is to have picked the right global industry in which to make your billions and hang on to your stake in your company as it booms \u2014 and avoids busts. Right now, the technology and finance industries are leading the growth. Another way is to make your money in the right region, which is Asia.Then, of course, there are the investment opportunities that only get presented to the wealthiest people, and that only they have the resources to take a chance on. \u201cThey can diversify their holdings to protect themselves,\u201d Mr. Kinnard said.And the big investments that are needed in private equity deals, for example, are a smaller portion of overall wealth for billionaires than for someone with, say, $100 million.\u201cThe common thread with billionaires is the incredibly focused drive these people have in whatever business they go into,\u201d Mr. Mathews said. \u201cIt\u2019s dogged determination. You can say everyone is like that, but with billionaires everything else gets blocked out. You see it today with tech the way you saw it with steel barons 100 years ago.\u201dYet getting across the billionaire line does not mean a person will always be there.\u201cOnce a billionaire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stay a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Mathews of UBS said. \u201cLast year alone there were 41 new billionaires created in the United States, but 36 also dropped out of billionaire status in the U.S. Our billionaire population is growing but only by a net of five.\u201dIn the United States, Mr. Mathews said, most people fall off the billionaire list because they sell the company that created their wealth. \u201cWhen you sell it, there are tax issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are estate-planning issues.\u201dThe latter results in chunks of money being given to heirs to get it out of the wealth creator\u2019s estate.Selling family firms happens less often in Europe and Asia. People end up holding on to them and creating family holding companies to continue to operate that original business and expand into others.Of course, people who sell their $1 billion company and end up with $500 million after taxes \u2014 or whose wealth tops out at $800 million \u2014 aren\u2019t scraping by. But being a billionaire gives you entry into an exclusive club that being a millionaire does not. After all, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s wealth from his career at Exxon Mobil looks positively modest. He\u2019s worth just a few hundred million.What is expected of people who have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes? It depends on whom you ask.\u201cIt is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when one in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day,\u201d Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam, said in a statement. \u201cInequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty. It is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.\u201dYet the anger against the superrich has abated since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Protesters seem to be more concerned with the actions of Mr. Trump (who is likely a billionaire, although he has provided little proof of his real wealth) than with his cabinet of plutocrats.Philanthropy has become important to many billionaires, and not just through the Giving Pledge, Mr. Buffett\u2019s compact to get the wealthiest to give away at least half of their fortunes. Nor is it confined to the United States, with its tradition of charitable giving.\u201cWhen I explained to him that New York City\u2019s annual school budget was $22 billion a year,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, \u201cthat was the last time we ever heard from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Is Right on Russia", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDOHA, Qatar \u2014 Few of the Trump administration\u2019s priorities have received as much criticism from the American foreign policy establishment as the president\u2019s desire to improve relations with Russia. President Trump\u2019s allegedly pro-Russian policies have been the subject of conspiracy theories and scandal.This makes little sense. There are many good reasons for the United States to reach conciliation with Moscow on issues from Eastern Europe to the Middle East. The real question will be if Washington can control its own desire for global hegemony enough to make that possible.Unlike China, Russia is not an emerging peer competitor to the United States. Russia is a regional power struggling to retain a fragment of its former sphere of influence. Moreover, it should be a natural ally of the United States in the fight against Islamist extremism. A reduction of tension with Russia would allow the United States to concentrate on more important geopolitical issues.Ultimately, the United States may have no choice but to work with Russia. The West\u2019s previous strategy has run its course, as recent policy failures make clear. Plans to expand American support for the former Soviet countries ring hollow. The United States and NATO did not fight for Georgia in 2008 or Ukraine in 2014. They will not do so in the future. In these circumstances, holding open the possibility of NATO membership for these countries, as the West has done for years, is pointless. By the same token, the populations of the European Union \u2014 an organization wrestling with existential problems of its own \u2014 have no will to help Ukraine join their club in the foreseeable future. In Syria, the United States and its allies seem to be torn between wanting to unseat President Bashar al-Assad and wanting to contain the jihadists who oppose him. Russia, on the other hand, has made its position clear.American and NATO officials like to claim that such a compromise would encourage Russian aggression elsewhere. This view is based on self-deception on the part of Western elites who are interested in maintaining confrontation with Russia as a distraction from more important, painful problems at home, like migration, industrial decline and anger over globalization.A child with a map can look at where the strategic frontier between the West and Russia was in 1988 and where it is today, and work out which side has advanced in which direction. So it is necessary to recognize that over the past generation, Russia\u2019s actions \u2014 though sometimes wrong and even criminal \u2014 have been overwhelmingly reactive to what the West has done. Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine is about Ukraine, a country of supreme historical, ethnic, cultural, strategic and economic importance to Russia. It implies nothing for the rest of Eastern Europe.If, as many of the hawks in Brussels and Washington claim, Russia wanted to undermine and then invade Latvia, it would have done so after 2008, when the Latvian economy was in collapse and it would have been easy to create a crisis there. Instead, Moscow did nothing \u2014 the Russian government is well aware that any such move would bring Western Europe and the United States back together in hostility toward Russia.If Russia does invade Latvia or one of the other Baltic States, of course, the United States and its allies would have to fight \u2014 and fight hard \u2014 to defend them. These countries are members of NATO and the European Union. To surrender them to Russian aggression would make the West look both morally bankrupt and geopolitical impotent. But it is hard to imagine any realistic situation in which this need will arise.Eastern Europe is not the only arena where the American agenda has proved inept. In Syria, the United States and Western Europe have bungled the war. Here, too, Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to cooperate with Russia would be a welcome change. Because of Russian, Iranian and now Turkish support, Mr. Assad\u2019s Syrian state is not going to fall. If it is to be transformed in the future, negotiation with Russia and Iran will be necessary.Iran is an essential ally against the jihadists in Iraq and Syria. And that means that the White House will soon discover the dangerous inconsistencies in its policies. Both Mr. Trump and his recently resigned national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, have spoken of prioritizing the fight against the Islamic State. But by simultaneously expressing desire for a new confrontation with Iran, they have demonstrated that they do not actually understand the word \u201cpriority.\u201dFurthermore, barring an open Iranian violation of the nuclear agreement, no imaginable American concession to Russia would persuade Moscow to agree to new international sanctions against Iran. One reason is that Russia sees good relations with Iran as permanently in its interest, whereas the policy makers in Moscow know that American concessions may be withdrawn by the next administration.China may be the other major sticking point. While he has moderated his stand somewhat in recent weeks, Mr. Trump has suggested he is prepared for a confrontation with China. But Russia will not play along. With a 2,600-mile-long border with China and a hopelessly outnumbered army, there is no way that Russia can be persuaded to adopt an outright hostile stance toward its neighbor. The furthest that Russia might go as a result of a better relationship with the United States would be to limit sales of its most sophisticated weapons to China, and perhaps to help seek a United Nations-brokered international compromise over the islands disputed by China and its neighbors.Since the end of the Cold War, Russia has not opposed the United States out of blind anti-Americanism. In the former Soviet countries, Russia has defended what the Russian establishment sees \u2014 rightly or wrongly \u2014 as vital Russian national interests.Elsewhere in the world, Russia has clashed with the United States for reasons that have often been shared by many Americans, and have often later been proved correct: opposition to the invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s regime in Libya being the most notable examples. While Russia wants good relations with the United States, it will not lend blanket support to American global primacy. If that is what the Trump administration is hoping for, it will be sorely disappointed, and the latest attempt at reconciliation with Russia will fail.Anatol Lieven is a professor at Georgetown University in Qatar and a co-author of \u201cAmerica Right or Wrong: An Anatomy of American Nationalism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its rulers, particularly Lenin and Stalin, regarded themselves as manifestations of the \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat,\u201d which gave them the authority to adjudicate on everything in society, including the arts and sciences. Lenin was an intellectual, at home as much in the British Museum Library as in the Kremlin. Stalin was a published romantic poet and enthusiastic autodidact with a library of thousands of books, not only read but annotated. They had the confidence to interfere in every genre of art and every discipline of science. Stalin would soon be hailed as the all-knowing coryphaeus (leader of the chorus in Greek drama) of science.Their drive to modernize Russia and restore it to great-power status, while struggling to feed millions in a country ruined by World War I and civil conflict, meant science was also a practical necessity. The fact that most scientists (and artists) were middle and upper class added the tension of class struggle. Lenin, as always, put it most succinctly: \u201cCommunism cannot be built without a fund of knowledge, technology, culture, but they are in the possession of bourgeois specialists. Among them the majority do not approve of the Soviet regime, but without them we cannot build Communism.\u201dIngs, the author of \u201cA Natural History of Seeing,\u201d skillfully relates the life stories of these \u201cbourgeois\u201d scientists. There was Ivan Pavlov, who observed, among many other things, that dogs secreted saliva when they expected food. There were the psychologists Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria, who conducted research on cognitive development. (Luria could be said to be the inventor of the lie detector.) At first, the scientists were surprised to find themselves endowed with new equipment and honor. But the picture darkened once Stalin began demanding astonishing jumps in creativity and production, which in turn made the scientists more important but more dangerous and therefore more policed and persecuted.The heart of the book is the story of the Great Terror that struck the scientific establishment in the 1930s. Ings shows that scientists now depended for resources and promotion (but also for physical survival) on the power of patrons such as top leaders like Andrei Zhdanov, or the greatest patron of all, Stalin. He describes the rise of the maliciously cunning but childlike Trofim Lysenko, who notoriously became Stalin\u2019s favorite scientist (though they met only once or twice). As starvation spread in the wake of Stalin\u2019s collectivization, particularly in 1932-33, Lysenko, a semi-educated charlatan, attacked well-known geneticists who were trying to develop new hybrid crops that could solve the problem of low productivity, much of it caused by Stalin\u2019s brutal policies. Fueled by what Ings calls \u201ca huckster\u2019s monomania,\u201d Lysenko claimed he could raise crop yields by his own process, called vernalization, in which artificially induced coldness could fool winter wheat to develop earlier in the spring. Later he applied his theories to cattle breeding. Many of Lysenko\u2019s views were either preposterous or simply irrelevant, and Ings includes a great scene when Western delegates to a conference in the Soviet Union burst into hysterics after hearing Lysenko\u2019s sophomoric theories on how sexual reproduction was a mixture of cells eating one another and belching. One of his colleagues, Nikolai Koltsov, joked: \u201cHe says that by feeding one can turn a cockroach into a horse.\u201dYet Lysenko\u2019s simple solutions and eager promises appealed to Stalin, who loved gardening and was obsessed with growing lemons in his greenhouses at his dacha near Moscow. When challenged by the esteemed geneticist Nikolai Vavilov, Lysenko responded viciously, denying the existence of genes. Vavilov rushed to appeal to Stalin, who received him but sneered, \u201cYou are the Vavilov who fiddles with flowers, leaves, grafts and other botanical nonsense instead of helping agriculture, as is done by Academician Lysenko.\u201d Vavilov was arrested in 1940. The world-famous scientist died in prison in 1943.But Lysenko\u2019s charlatanism was well known even among Stalin\u2019s courtiers. After the war, Stalin\u2019s heir apparent, Zhdanov, challenged Lysenko, who continued to be backed by a furious Stalin. He had a variety of reasons: asserting his total supremacy in his years of decline; reinforcing absolute party control over society; promoting what he saw as the practical over the theoretical; supporting a scientific proletarian against bourgeois experts. There was also the fact of his demented arteriosclerotic megalomania.The end of the war saw the challenge of the American nuclear bomb, which shocked Stalin. He ordered his diabolical henchman Lavrenti Beria to develop a Soviet bomb \u2014 fast. Beria had already created special laboratory prisons \u2014 sharashki \u2014 where jailed scientists worked in menacing comfort (brilliantly portrayed by Solzhenitsyn in \u201cThe First Circle,\u201d his best novel by far) and often produced stellar results. The physicist Leon Theremin, rescued from the gold mines of Kolyma to work in one of Beria\u2019s sharashki, invented listening devices soon used to spy on the British and Americans in Moscow, for which he was awarded the Stalin Prize: Such were the twists of fortune for Stalin\u2019s scientists. Acclaimed physicists like Peter Kapitsa, Yulii Khariton and Igor Kurchatov were alternately bullied and spoiled by Stalin and Beria. Ings quotes Kapitsa\u2019s magnificently aristocratic letters to Stalin complaining \u201cit is time for comrades like Comrade Beria to begin to learn respect for scientists.\u201d Beria later tried to take revenge. \u201cI will remove him for you,\u201d Stalin replied, \u201cbut don\u2019t you touch him.\u201d There in a nutshell was the delicate relationship between the cruelest of tyrants and his scientists \u2014 and in 1949, Stalin got his nuclear weapons.Ings capably recounts how Soviet science became a laughingstock and often a human tragedy, but he doesn\u2019t explain how Stalinist technology produced colossal successes, too, from the creation of Tupolev and MiG planes to the best designed tank in the world, the T-34. And while Ings\u2019s research is impressive and his exposition of the science is lucid, the key stories of Lysenko and the nuclear project are well known and better covered elsewhere, as in David Holloway\u2019s \u201cStalin and the Bomb.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, Ings\u2019s history contains many mistakes starting with the birthday of Stalin himself: There is a choice of two. Officially it was Dec. 21, 1879 (New Style). In reality, Stalin was born on Dec. 6, 1878 (Old Style), or Dec. 18, 1878 (New Style). This book muddles both and gives the birthday as Dec. 18, 1879. In 1881, Alexander II was assassinated, but it is wrong to say his route \u201cnever varied.\u201d He alternated routes, and that was why the terrorists had two plans. The Bolsheviks and Mensheviks didn\u2019t miss the 1905 revolution; they launched an armed uprising that had to be crushed by the army. Dzerzhinsky remained head of the secret police until his death in 1926, not giving it up when he became head of the Supreme Council of the National Economy. In 1940, Finland was not \u201cin Russian hands,\u201d but it did sue for peace. And so on.Over all, however, Ings is an entertaining storyteller who often captures the essence of things \u2014 Stalin was indeed \u201cthe last in a long line of European philosopher kings.\u201d Filled with priceless nuggets and a cast of frauds, crackpots and tyrants, this is a lively and interesting book, and utterly relevant today when the Trump administration is challenging the scientific establishment on climate change.

{"Headline": "The Economic Growth That Experts Can\u2019t Count", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut what if the economy has already been growing at that rate \u2014 but no one realized it?This isn\u2019t a matter of rigged statistics, political spinning or fanciful alternate realities, but one of measurement.As the economy has shifted from one that primarily produced things \u2014 refrigerators and cars, guns and shoes \u2014 to one that now deals largely in services and information, economists have grown more and more skeptical that the traditional measure of gross domestic product \u2014 the nation\u2019s total output \u2014 is accurately capturing much of the economy\u2019s innovation and improvements.\u201cI think the official data on real growth substantially underestimates the rate of growth,\u201d said Martin Feldstein, an economist at Harvard.These calculations may seem to be the esoteric domain of number crunchers, but the yearly growth figures \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 end up being used to answer several essential questions. Is the country getting richer? Are standards of living rising? Are businesses and workers more productive? Is the economy improving?Indeed, the measure was initially created to back up President Herbert Hoover\u2019s overly buoyant claim in 1930, based solely on sprinkled anecdotes of improvements, that \u201cthe Depression is over.\u201dGross domestic product has always been an imperfect answer to such questions. It is designed to measure production and just production \u2014 not welfare or happiness.Such ho-hum performance has become both an emblem of and explanation for the anxiety that smears the economic outlook like a bathtub ring. And every day, decisions about government policy, investment, regulations, taxes, trade and more are based on such measurements.At its most basic, G.D.P. is calculated by looking at prices \u2014 the price of materials, workers, overhead and so on that it costs to make a product and the price that consumers in turn pay for that product.And while prices can be measured, they don\u2019t necessarily reflect the value of quality and experience. As far as G.D.P. is concerned, a delectable $20 meal that would wow Julia Child is equal to a rubbery, tasteless one that costs the same amount.The growing suspicion, however, is that in a digital world overflowing with free services like Facebook, Google and YouTube, price is an increasingly ill-suited proxy for value.What is the worth of a free software update that protects against a nasty virus? Of the streaming service that enables you to watch shows on your computer instead of on a television? Of the hours and hours saved by looking up a fact on Wikipedia rather than having to go to a library? All have productive value but no price.Kuznets lost that battle, but economists and statisticians have continually struggled to compensate for the measure\u2019s shortcomings \u2014 like qualities not reflected in price and the constant cavalcade of new goods and services.Economists seek to attach values to specific improvements, whether faster internet speed, less pollution or a medical treatment that leaves you healthy enough to water ski instead of stuck in a hospital bed. And they look at ad revenue that free services like Google and Facebook rack up and jobs they create.Still, given how much of people\u2019s time and activity has migrated online, there remains a sizable chunk of \u201cdigital dark matter\u201d that is not counted. At the same time, measuring the increased value to consumers can be even more difficult when it comes to services and experience than it is with goods.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to evaluate consumer preferences,\u201d said Richard Freeman, an economist at Harvard, and it may be even harder to figure for \u201cthings where knowledge is involved and for some kind of qualitative changes.\u201dThe best biology textbook in the 1950s, for example, would still not have the accuracy, depth and complexity of one published in 2017. \u201cA doctor who graduates today knows and learns many more techniques and medicines than someone who graduated years ago,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t really build that in.\u201dMr. Feldstein likes to illustrate his argument about G.D.P. by referring to the widespread use of statins, the cholesterol drugs that have reduced deaths from heart attacks. Between 2000 and 2007, he noted, the death rate from heart disease among those over 65 fell by one-third.\u201cThis was a remarkable contribution to the public\u2019s well-being over a relatively short number of years, and yet this part of the contribution of the new product is not reflected in real output or real growth of G.D.P.,\u201d he said. He estimates \u2014 without hard evidence, he is careful to point out \u2014 that growth is understated by 2 percent or more a year.The critical question, though, is whether growth and productivity figures are being underestimated more than ever before.Mr. Furman said that Americans were feeling a genuine slowdown in growth, but aggravating the impact was that the growth that had occurred \u201cis less equally shared than before.\u201dFor Mr. Feldstein, it is misleading measurements that are contributing to a public perception that real incomes \u2014 particularly for the middle class \u2014 aren\u2019t rising very much. That, he said, \u201creduces people\u2019s faith in the political and economic system.\u201d\u201cI think it creates pessimism and a distrust of government,\u201d leading Americans to worry that \u201ctheir children are going to be stuck and won\u2019t be able to enjoy upward mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand this.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Retraining Paradox", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "The Future of WorkMany Americans need jobs, or want better jobs, while employers have good jobs they can\u2019t fill. Matching them up is the tricky part.Supported byNow 32, Kecy is a few months away from finishing a six-month certificate program in advanced composites manufacturing at Great Bay Community College in Rochester, N.H. The program operates out of a satellite campus that opened in 2013, with aid from a Labor Department grant meant to help community colleges reach \u201ctrade displaced\u201d workers who need help training for new careers. The unemployment rate in southern New Hampshire is low, less than 3 percent. At one state job fair last summer, just 350 people showed up for 1,200 available jobs. In Strafford County, where Rochester is located, the largest employers include the University of New Hampshire and Liberty Mutual, but also manufacturers like Turbocam and Contitech. Kecy\u2019s classmates include veterans, recent high-school graduates and older workers whose careers had reached dead ends. All of them are looking for hope and a decent paycheck by acquiring a new set of skills. \u201cWithin six months, I\u2019m going to go from regular guy to working in the aerospace community,\u201d says Tommy Florentino, a disabled veteran with a background in construction and automotive manufacturing. He has friends who went to Boston College or Suffolk University, \u201cand they\u2019re waiters and waitresses.\u201dThe college\u2019s 27,000-square-foot Advanced Technology and Academic Center is at the edge of a nondescript shopping center. The complex also houses a Dollar Tree, a J.C. Penney and a Kmart, where a banner out front reads, \u201cNow hiring.\u201d Cashiers there earn close to minimum wage. But Kecy expects to earn at least $16 an hour when he graduates and to move up quickly from there. Composites is a broad field in manufacturing, with applications including automotive parts, sporting goods and prosthetics, as well as in the locally prominent aerospace industry. The state\u2019s department of economic development bills its seacoast region as \u201cthe emerging composites region,\u201d and it points to Great Bay\u2019s program as a reason for more aerospace and defense businesses in particular to relocate there. \u201cI\u2019ve got some options, which is something I\u2019ve never really experienced before,\u201d Kecy says.The tantalizing promise of government-funded job training is that it can bridge the gap between those narratives in a way that benefits individual workers, employers and the country as a whole. Hard-working Americans get good jobs, employers get skilled labor and the economy benefits from their mutual good fortune. The image of that virtuous cycle has made the promotion of training programs appealing for politicians on the left and the right. Hillary Clinton proposed retraining former coal-industry workers in new careers as part of a $30 billion package meant \u201cto ensure that coal miners and their families get the benefits they\u2019ve earned and respect they deserve.\u201d Even as Republicans have voted to cut funding for training in recent years, they have paid it lip service as a way to put Americans back to work.It\u2019s perhaps not surprising, though, that so much of the working class gravitated in the last election to Donald Trump, whose rhetoric about displaced workers was very different: blunt (if unrealistic) promises to stop old careers from disappearing, to \u201cbring back our jobs.\u201d In its zeal for retraining, the federal government\u2019s approach to the problem has become increasingly byzantine, a dizzying constellation of programs to help struggling workers prepare for new careers. Some of them are intended for employees laid off en masse when their jobs went overseas, and others are for those who are simply unemployed and underqualified for well-paying work. In the 2009 fiscal year, the Government Accountability Office counted 47 different federal training-related programs administered by nine agencies, numbers Republicans have since used to argue that many of the programs were redundant. In his 2012 State of the Union address, even President Obama criticized the \u201cmaze of confusing training programs\u201d unemployed workers had to navigate to get help. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, signed into law in 2014 with bipartisan support, was designed in part to streamline the government\u2019s approach.Critics also say that job training is costly and too often ineffective. Take the primary federal effort specifically aimed at workers affected by global trade, the Labor Department\u2019s Trade Adjustment Assistance program. Through T.A.A., qualified workers can receive free retraining, typically through a community-college program like Great Bay\u2019s. The program is generous, spending more than $11,500 on each person who participated in retraining in the 2015 fiscal year. But it serves relatively few people, and recent analysis has shown iffy results: A 2012 evaluation prepared for the Labor Department found that while 85 percent of those who went through T.A.A.-funded training eventually received a certificate or degree, only 37 percent of them were working in that field four years later. (The program was later amended to include more individualized support.)All too often, skeptics say, publicly funded training programs are a sop to well-connected companies who want taxpayers to foot the bill to train their workers. Critics also point at research suggesting that on-the-job training by employers themselves has been declining in recent years. But it simply doesn\u2019t make economic sense for most employers to do all of their own training anymore. In part, this is because of technology: Jobs in advanced manufacturing and health care require intense technological instruction, usually accompanied by classroom time. At the same time, standardization means employers often poach skilled workers from one another, which discourages them from investing a lot of time and money in training their own workers. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic today to think of traditional, very idiosyncratic manufacturing jobs where you\u2019re going to walk in, get a job, get trained in a bunch of very specific skills, and they\u2019ll hold onto you for decades,\u201d says Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University. \u201cThat\u2019s just not the trajectory of employment anymore.\u201dWith his certificate, Kecy is confident that he will find a job locally, and he\u2019s probably right. Great Bay\u2019s composites program was developed in a close relationship with Safran Aerospace Composites and Albany Engineered Composites, two companies that opened a shared plant in Rochester in 2014. Safran helped develop the program\u2019s curriculum and stays in touch about which specializations the company will be needing in the coming months. It guarantees interviews to all graduates of the program and has hired about 30 of the more than 170 participants so far. Over all, more than half the program\u2019s graduates have been hired by five large local manufacturers, according to its director, Debra Mattson.That level of coordination with local industry, ideally touching on everything from curriculum to recruitment, is now seen by policy experts as a crucial dividing line between programs that work and those that don\u2019t. The federal government now emphasizes this kind of \u201cdemand driven\u201d training in part to ensure that workers aren\u2019t being retrained with new skills as obsolete as their old ones. \u201cA good sign is if the program was co-developed with the firm,\u201d says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program. \u201cOne of the fundamental problems is training divorced from labor-market dynamics \u2014 people being trained without the presence of jobs they could actually arrive in.\u201d (The Nordic countries, which spend more on job training in general, have a strong record in developing training with input from both industry and labor.) The evidence in the United States for demand-driven training is promising so far. A 2010 study of three such programs found that enrollees were earning almost 30 percent more than a control group two years after they began the program and were significantly more likely to be employed.The Great Bay program has relationships with Safran, A.E.C. and other area employers, including BAE Systems, Turbocam International and the gun manufacturer Sig Sauer, which recently landed a $580 million contract with the Army. The program is short by design, and new cohorts start three times a year to ensure a steady stream of graduates for local employers. \u201cIndustry is dying for bodies, just dying for skilled workers,\u201d says Will Arvelo, Great Bay\u2019s president. \u201cThey can\u2019t wait two years.\u201dOn a snowy afternoon a few weeks ago, Kecy and his classmates in his Fundamentals of Composites Manufacturing class were at work in the \u201cclean room.\u201d The setting looked more like a science lab than a factory. A large cooler stacked with vacuum-sealed bags of thick fabric pieces stood in the corner, and work tables held clusters of metal tubes. The class instructor, Peter Dow, watched as two teams of students worked on a project they had been planning for several weeks: constructing a three-inch carbon-fiber tube with a finished exterior. Later they would have a chance to tweak their plans and try it all over again, a lesson in the manufacturing principle of \u201ccontinuous improvement.\u201dFor all the ways in which technology has changed the manufacturing industry, one of the most striking to an outsider is the appearance of the work space itself. The students in the clean room wore white coats and safety glasses as they used hair dryers and refrigerant spray to fiddle with the sticky material. Outside their small work area, the facility\u2019s spotless manufacturing lab offered the capacity to build a product from start to finish: a huge, three-dimensional loom for weaving carbon fiber, a five-axis machining center, an automatic autoclave. Practically every piece of equipment seemed to feature a keyboard or touch screen.But manufacturing\u2019s new high-tech, high-skill profile is also what makes it daunting for many older workers looking for new careers. The dilemma illustrates some of the broader challenges of retraining later in life. Kerri Uyeno, a 43-year-old single mother of three who graduated in the Great Bay program\u2019s first cohort in 2014, began working at Safran as a bonding operator three weeks after earning her certificate. It was such a happy ending that she featured prominently in early publicity materials for the program. But she had conflicts with her supervisors and lasted just over a year in the job before quitting. She didn\u2019t work again for six months; her house went into foreclosure. An administrator at Great Bay tried to persuade her to come back and work toward her associate degree, but the prospect was exhausting. \u201cIt was so hard to get through that six months to my certificate,\u201d she said, \u201cI just didn\u2019t have it in me to get more schooling.\u201d Today she is an office manager at a flooring showroom nearby.

{"Headline": "Labour Loses Seat to Tories but Defeats UKIP Leader in British Voting", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 For decades, voters in Copeland, in the northwest of England, have elected parliamentary candidates from Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party so regularly that their support was almost taken for granted.That came to an abrupt end early on Friday, when a candidate from the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May took the seat in a by-election, prompting new speculation about the leadership of a Labour Party that is trailing in the polls and has been split by voters\u2019 decision in a referendum last year to leave the European Union.On a morning of mixed fortunes for Labour, there was a more encouraging result in a second contest, in Stoke-on-Trent Central, where it emerged victorious over the right-wing populist U.K. Independence Party, known as UKIP. In the process, it comfortably defeated the party\u2019s new leader, Paul Nuttall, who had gambled by running there personally.The loss was a big reversal for Mr. Nuttall, who is trying to establish a new identity for UKIP after the party achieved its objective last year by persuading Britons to vote to quit the European Union. It has sought to appeal to voters in working-class communities who normally vote Labour.Mr. Nuttall\u2019s failure to do so in Stoke, after a mistake-prone campaign, was a huge relief for Labour, but the loss of Copeland underscores the problems facing a party that is struggling to present itself as a credible alternative government in waiting.In a general election in 2015, voters deserted Labour en masse in Scotland, once a Labour stronghold. In last year\u2019s referendum, many of its traditional supporters rejected Labour\u2019s advice to remain in the European Union.Labour\u2019s left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has also been at war with many of his own lawmakers, some of whom tried unsuccessfully to force him out last year.On Friday, John Woodcock, a Labour lawmaker, told the BBC that the Copeland result was a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and there was new speculation about Mr. Corbyn\u2019s future.But Mr. Corbyn, asked if he would step down, replied, \u201cNo. I was elected leader of this party. I\u2019m proud to lead this party.\u201dWith no obvious successor in sight, Mr. Corbyn is likely to survive for now. But Copeland had been a Labour monopoly since the creation of the parliamentary constituency in 1983, and the Conservatives had not represented the region for around 80 years. Moreover, governing parties rarely win by-elections over opposition parties; before Copeland, the last time this happened was in 1982. The Conservative candidate in Copeland, Trudy Harrison, described her win as a \u201ctruly historic event.\u201dMr. Corbyn\u2019s history of skepticism about nuclear power may have hampered his party in a region where the industry is economically crucial. The Sellafield nuclear facility is a major employer, and there are hopes of a new nuclear site at Moorside.But the result has increased anxiety within the Labour Party about whether it can rely on traditional supporters in the north of England to support Labour as they once did. \u201cLabour is too weak to win power but too strong to die,\u201d wrote Andrew Grice, a political commentator for The Independent, a daily.By-elections take place when a parliamentary seat is vacated, typically because a lawmaker dies or leaves the House of Commons \u2014 as occurred in Copeland and Stoke-on-Trent Central. Voting in both areas took place on Thursday, with the results announced early Friday morning.In Copeland, Ms. Harrison won with 13,748 votes to 11,601 for Gillian Troughton of Labour.In Stoke-on-Trent Central, Gareth Snell was elected for Labour with 7,853 votes, compared with 5,233 votes for Mr. Nuttall of UKIP. Mr. Snell described his win as a victory for the \u201cpolitics of hope over the politics of fear.\u201dFor UKIP, the failure even to finish a close second in Stoke-on-Trent Central was a big setback, because it was just the sort of seat where the party had hoped to make a breakthrough.With just one lawmaker in Parliament, UKIP faces an uphill battle to persuade voters that it remains relevant, particularly now that Mrs. May has embraced its two best-known policies: withdrawal from the European Union and curbs on immigration.Mr. Nuttall\u2019s leadership is being questioned, too, though early Friday he insisted that he is \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d and that UKIP\u2019s \u201ctime will come.\u201dNicknamed Britain\u2019s Brexit capital because about 70 percent of voters there wanted to leave the European Union, the area was once an industrial center, but has long since lost many of the factories that fueled its economy.Yet from the start, Mr. Nuttall\u2019s campaign looked accident prone. He faced criticism after listing his address on his by-election nomination papers as a newly rented house in the constituency, making him appear more local than he is.Then he was forced to apologize for incorrect claims on his website that he lost close friends in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, when 96 people were crushed to death at a soccer stadium.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chance for Trump to Save Our Streams", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE eastern brook trout, whose native haunts in the Appalachians are a short drive from my home in Washington, is a fragile species. It requires the coldest and cleanest water to survive, and over the past two centuries, its ranks have been decimated by all that modern society could throw at it. Today it lives in a fraction of its historic range.One reason? Thousands of miles of prime brook trout streams have been polluted by poorly regulated historic coal mining, and what has been lost is difficult to bring back. Groups like Trout Unlimited have worked with partners to restore more than 60 miles of wild trout streams damaged by acid mine drainage in Appalachia. But it is hard, painstaking work \u2014 it has taken the better part of two decades and millions of dollars, and the fact is that it would take many lifetimes to revive all the streams in need of resuscitation.Over the past 20 years, these mining operations have buried or degraded nearly 2,000 miles of streams in Appalachia. It goes without saying that cutting the tops off mountains and dumping them in streams is bad for fishing. It is also bad for anyone who cares about clean water.Our argument is simple. If we at Trout Unlimited have learned anything from our years of on-the-water restoration experience, it is this: Smartly regulating mountaintop removal mining at the outset is a lot more cost-effective than trying to repair streams from the ravages of acid mine drainage caused by mining.But if protecting clean water is the goal in the new administration, a veto of Congress\u2019s attempt to reverse the Stream Protection Rule can be only a first step.If the Clean Water rule is abandoned, nearly 60 percent of the stream miles in the United States could lose crucial protections afforded by the Clean Water Act, which eliminates direct discharges into rivers and requires permits for construction activities that affect the health of our waters.It is vital that Congress and the president allow this common-sense rule to stand. Clean water is not a political issue. Our elected leaders should not treat it like one.At the same time, some places are so special that they deserve even greater protection, and Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay is one of them. Nearly half of the world\u2019s wild sockeye salmon come from the Bristol Bay watershed, and one of the rivers that drain into the bay, the Nushagak, is among the largest producers of wild chinook salmon.To build such an immense mine in such a remote part of Alaska would lead to the industrialization of a spectacular landscape and threaten a commercial fishing industry that supports 14,000 jobs and adds an estimated $1.5 billion to the economy. This issue is hugely important to sport fishers, and President Trump should make it immediately clear that he wants Bristol Bay protected from industrial-scale mining.I sincerely hope that President Trump will demonstrate his concern for clean water and that the members of Congress will prove that they were not simply pandering to America\u2019s 45 million sportsmen and sportswomen during the election, only to ignore our concerns in the new term.Something else I\u2019ve learned from experience: We don\u2019t just spend money in big numbers. We also vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Traffic Deaths Rise for a Second Straight Year", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the last decade, new cars have gotten electronic stability control systems to prevent skids, rearview cameras to prevent fender benders and more airbags to protect occupants in collisions. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on campaigns to remind the public of the dangers of drunken driving, failing to buckle up and texting while on the go.Despite all that, more Americans are dying on roads and highways than in years, and the sudden and sharp increase has alarmed safety advocates.If the estimates are confirmed, it will be the first time since 2007 that more than 40,000 people have died in motor vehicle accidents in a single year. The 2016 total comes after a 7 percent rise in 2015 and means the two-year increase \u2014 14 percent \u2014 is the largest in more than a half a century.\u201cWhy are we O.K. with this?\u201d Deborah Hersman, the National Safety Council president and chief executive, said at a news conference. \u201cComplacency is killing us.\u201dPart of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing.They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers\u2019 eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist.\u201cIt\u2019s not just talking on the phone that\u2019s a problem today,\u201d said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. \u201cYou now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones.\u201dGovernment officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures.A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped. Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense \u2014 meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense \u2014 drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations.\u201cIt\u2019s still the same things that are killing drivers \u2014 belts, booze and speed,\u201d Mr. Adkins said.About half of all traffic fatalities involve unbelted occupants, and almost a third involve drivers who were impaired by drugs or alcohol, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal government\u2019s main auto-safety agency.In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the state\u2019s 103,000 miles of highways. David Brown, a research associate at the University of Alabama\u2019s Center for Advanced Public Safety, studied the state\u2019s 2016 traffic fatality reports and found an increase in fatalities involving high-speed crashes.\u201cTotal crashes were up less than 5 percent, but fatalities were up 25 percent,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and there\u2019s no one there to deter it.\u201dIn some states, highway speed limits are rising. In recent years, Texas has increased speed limits to 85 miles per hour in some rural areas. About 1,500 miles of roads have a limit of 75 miles per hour or higher.But others say that more needs to be done now on basic road safety issues. \u201cThe way to bring down the rise in deaths is with a wide range of the nuts-and-bolts measures, not self-driving cars,\u201d the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in an interview in October.Mr. Nader said states could reduce traffic deaths simply by requiring rear-seat occupants to wear seatbelts, installing more cameras to catch speeding drivers without a police presence and tightening regulations on heavy trucking.The council is also advocating mandatory motorcycle helmet laws and ignition locks that prevent repeat drunken drivers from operating their vehicles while impaired.The safety council\u2019s figures typically correspond closely to the fatality totals that the N.H.T.S.A. compiles, but they include accidents off public roads and deaths occurring over a longer period after a crash.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Living Lab: Reimagining Retail on Seattle Streets", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 On a busy stretch of road in this city\u2019s Ballard neighborhood, a curious new grocery store is taking shape \u2014 and so begins another effort by Amazon to use the residents of its hometown as guinea pigs.Amazon\u2019s success in online commerce has transformed Seattle by bringing jobs, wealth and an almost insatiable appetite for office space \u2014 along with grumbling about how expensive the city is getting. At the same time, the company is putting its stamp on the city by using it as a lab for its expanding array of unconventional experiments in bricks-and-mortar retailing.While Amazon has never articulated the grand strategy behind its expansion into physical stores, analysts and tech executives believe its goal is to capture a bigger share of some forms of shopping \u2014 food being the biggest \u2014 that may never move entirely online.Amazon isn\u2019t alone in using Seattle, home to Starbucks and other major retail brands, as a proving ground for new ideas in stores. But it is the main attraction among people focused on innovation in the category.Amazon declines to talk about the drive-up grocery stores it is building here. The most obvious reason the company tries out new ideas in its own backyard is that it makes life easier for corporate leadership to see them in action without having to get on planes. Executives closely scrutinize how customers use new stores and tweak them as they gather data.Amazon\u2019s own technologically demanding employees are an important part of the feedback process. More than 25,000 of them work for the company in Seattle, and many serve as the first test cases for new concepts.The company opened its first Amazon Go store on the ground floor of one of its office buildings, where employees can buy prepared meals, drinks and snacks. Customers enter the store through a gate with a smartphone app and simply walk out with their goods when they\u2019re done.Almost a decade ago, the company conducted one of its biggest local experiments when it started a grocery home delivery service, tinkering for almost five years before expanding the concept to a new city. Early on, Amazon allowed employees and their friends to use the service, which helped provide unvarnished feedback, said Ian Clarkson, then the general manager of the service, AmazonFresh.Mr. Clarkson recalls a friend telling him that AmazonFresh didn\u2019t stock a brand of orange juice her daughter liked. As a result, she said, she wouldn\u2019t shop through AmazonFresh since she would still need to go to a supermarket for the juice.Seattle has long been receptive to new ideas in retail. REI, Costco Wholesale and Nordstrom are among the store chains that got their start here. Starbucks opened its first coffee house in the Pike Place Market in 1971.Several years ago, it came up with a new idea for building drive-through Starbucks stores out of recycled shipping containers to promote sustainability, trying out the design just south of Seattle before opening others across the country.One of Amazon\u2019s more puzzling retail experiments in Seattle is the Treasure Truck, a roaming delivery truck retrofitted with carnival-style lights and signs, from which customers can pick up items offered during flash sales through the Amazon mobile app. The truck, which seems like the offspring of a billboard and an ice cream truck, has sold wild mahi-mahi steaks, paddle boards and Nintendo game consoles.\u201cSeattleites will say they hate Amazon taking over downtown, but at the same time when Amazon rolls out something special, after everyone complains about it, the first thing people want to do is go check it out,\u201d said Mr. Croft, who says his employment with another technology company doesn\u2019t color his views of Amazon.Not everyone agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t use any Amazon services,\u201d Sherman Alexie, the novelist and poet, who lives in Seattle, wrote in an email.The company\u2019s growth has contributed to a booming economy in its hometown, where the median single-family home price jumped to $548,000 last year from $340,000 five years ago, according to the Northwest Multiple Listing Service.As much as Seattle residents like technology, some say the population is more representative of the rest of the country than shoppers in other cities.\u201cSan Francisco is ludicrously tech-forward,\u201d said Dan Shapiro, the chief executive of a start-up, called Glowforge, that makes a laser cutting device. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me about Seattle is it\u2019s about as tech-friendly and prosperous as you can go without being completely off the rails.\u201dBut Elliott Bay had record sales last year, and he can\u2019t figure out why Amazon, with its size, would bother with the relatively low sales volumes of physical bookstores. Amazon\u2019s global book sales are estimated to be in the billions of dollars, which would dwarf the proceeds from an independent shop.\u201cI know these are very smart people,\u201d Mr. Aaron said. \u201cI assume there\u2019s some kind of design or plan that makes sense. I can\u2019t figure out why they\u2019re doing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump.Sober analysts agree that Mrs. May\u2019s plans are deeply foolish. Her intention is to sacrifice Britain\u2019s membership in the European single market, something necessary for the economy to function as it is now configured, to gain full control over immigration policy, which is not. In short, she is planning to profoundly alienate key industries and trading partners to score populist popularity points.All this domestic turmoil is indicative of the way in which Brexit goes to the heart of Britain\u2019s national identity. For this reason, it is hard to believe that the jingoistic associations of The Daily Mail\u2019s cartoon were a coincidence. Brexit is rooted in imperial nostalgia and myths of British exceptionalism, coming up as they have \u2014 especially since 2008 \u2014 against the reality that Britain is no longer a major world power.Still, Mrs. May will probably be able to carry the public with her. Her Brexit plans have generally polled well, and since taking office she has remained by far the most popular of all the major party leaders. Even if there is an economic collapse when Britain leaves the European Union \u2014 as most analysts think is likely \u2014 her mandate probably won\u2019t be hurt: Already the right-wing press is lining up to lay the blame for the coming crisis on the bad attitude of \u201cRemoaners,\u201d as it has labeled the \u201cliberal elitists\u201d who remain pro-Europe even after the referendum result.So what\u2019s going to happen? These days, it feels like the worst-case scenario always prevails. If that happens this time, too, Brexit will mean that England, shorn of Scotland, Northern Ireland and maybe even Wales, contracts into a small, isolated, one-party state governed by schoolteacherly Conservatives who persist in wild-eyed delusions about their country\u2019s special grandeur. In this desperate fantasy Britain, there are no jobs, and any dissent \u2014 from disseminating pro-foreigner propaganda to having a nonregulation haircut \u2014 will be punished by forced participation in the government\u2019s \u201cClean for the Queen\u201d program (which incidentally is a real initiative that was pioneered last year to encourage Her Majesty\u2019s subjects to de-litter their neighborhoods in preparation for her birthday).All of this might sound bizarre, over-the-top, even actively demented. But if what the Brexiteers want is to return Britain to a utopia they have devised by splicing a few rose-tinted memories of the 1950s together with an understanding of imperial history derived largely from images on vintage biscuit tins, then all of this seems chillingly plausible, insofar as it would, in many ways, constitute the realization of that dream.

Ottie Lee is a white woman on her way to a lynching in Marvel, Ind., in 1930. She\u2019s seen racial violence before \u2014 a black man who was \u201cselling bad tonic,\u201d she says, got \u201cbeaten around the block\u201d \u2014 but a lynching is \u201csomething else entirely.\u201d Yet rather than reflecting on the horror, Ottie Lee considers how the lynching might affect her own life. A friend has told her there is \u201csomething special on its way for you, something you can\u2019t miss, something that will make it all come clear,\u201d and Ottie Lee wonders if the lynching is that \u201cspecial thing.\u201d In anticipation of great violence, Ottie Lee\u2019s mind skips over atrocities and comes back to herself, to what\u2019s in it for her, and also to a cool assessment of her own worth: the \u201csoft backs\u201d of her hands and her \u201clong red locks\u201d as well as her poverty, her \u201clegs in their not-so-nice stockings.\u201dReading this, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of the James Baldwin quote: \u201cIf Americans were not so terrified of their private selves, they would never have needed to invent .\u2008.\u2008. \u2018the Negro problem.\u2019\u200a\u201d In Ottie Lee, Hunt has created a sly comment on the narrative of lynching in American history. As the historian Dora Apel has detailed, such attacks were closely tied to the myth of white women\u2019s (and only white women\u2019s) sexual purity. The \u201ccult of true womanhood,\u201d begun in the 19th century and continually evoked in the 20th as justification for lynching, insisted on the moral superiority and sexual purity of white women, which were allegedly under constant threat by black men who needed to be tortured as punishment and revenge.Yet far from morally pure, Ottie Lee is compromised from the start \u2014 the very first scene finds her sharpening pencils and threatening to kill her boss, Bud, with them, a threat we soon learn is part of a lazy sexual game between the two, which Ottie Lee\u2019s husband is beginning to discern. Ottie Lee is poor. Her husband, Dale, has spent most of their money on a pig for their homestead, and she works at Bud\u2019s insurance office and tolerates his passes for a few extra dollars in their account. Ottie Lee carries the childhood shame and anger of being abandoned to a care home by her alcoholic salesman of a father and her incarcerated mother. And she is keenly aware of the sexual economy she inhabits; she is valuable to Bud and to other men only as a sexual object. (Hunt is unflinching in outlining how the anticipation of racial violence carries a sexual charge for white men in the novel: \u201cBud was excited, what with the lynching to get to and all, so he went straight from putting his hand on my leg to making his try on me.\u201d)Ottie Lee, then, is not the pure white maiden central to the narratives of lynching in American culture \u2014 she is seedier, sweatier. She\u2019s also, initially, a rebuke of the innocent white female savior at the center of so many present-day dramas and melodramas about race (think of Skeeter, the white heroine of \u201cThe Help,\u201d or Lily Owens, the white protagonist in \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees\u201d). In these moments, I appreciated the thorny work on the page. Ottie Lee is an uncomfortable exploration of the bystander: the kind of young woman so often seen in those horrific lynching postcards, turning to the camera and grinning. Through her we see the interior life of a person who could pose like that and the type of environment that could produce that picture.With such a promising start, then, it\u2019s disappointing when the novel begins to falter. Ottie Lee, Bud and the others don\u2019t use the words \u201cblack,\u201d \u201ccolored,\u201d \u201cNegro\u201d or the usual racial slurs to describe the men who are to be lynched. Instead, they use the word \u201ccornflowers.\u201d Hunt has said he chose the term from a paint catalog to evoke Indiana while replacing the \u201cugliest epithets\u201d he found \u201calmost unbearable.\u201d But the effect reads only as coy, an attempt to prettify the violence. At one point, Ottie Lee, Bud and Dale are led to a prayer vigil for the victims of the lynching, and Ottie Lee, looking across the church, notes it is \u201cfilled to its fat gizzards with cornsilk and cornflower folks both. Maybe even some cornroots .\u2008.\u2008. and corntassels too. All of them sitting next to each other like they was one great big shook salad in one great big salad bowl.\u201d As powerful as the vigil \u201cagainst the hangings\u201d should be, its impact is lost because of the euphemism.Even stranger than the language, and harder to swallow, is the presence of the white characters at this church in the first place. They have been led there by a childhood friend of Ottie Lee\u2019s named Sally (who is \u201cpart cornroot through her father\u201d), but none of the black parishioners seem to notice the intrusion or to fear the outsiders. Indeed, Sally mentions offhand that she\u2019s going to lend her truck to some boys who want to drive others to the vigil. The novel would have us believe that a woman joined by unsympathetic whites at an anti-lynching vigil in 1930s Indiana would offer her truck to young black men \u2014 and that the men would still trust her and accept the offer, under the threat of a lynching happening nearby. This seems unbelievable even as Hunt gives Sally the knowing line that the vigil is \u201ca wonderful surprise, for it was the future sitting there bowing its head.\u201dIn such moments, it seems possible that Hunt intended to write a sort of reconciliation fantasy. But fantasy not grounded in actual social dynamics and the facts of life is merely escape. In another early scene, a young \u201ccornflower\u201d on a bicycle goes out of his way to challenge Bud, and looks Ottie Lee in the eye without repercussions. Rather than subverting standard racial narratives, scenes like this lead to incredulity and the sense that the characters are little more than game pieces.Halfway through the book, Hunt introduces a second narrator: a black woman named Calla, also caught up in the lynching at Marvel. Calla sometimes has beautiful language to describe the same world that Ottie Lee is moving through. Here are her opening lines: \u201cI stepped up slow from the river, like it was me not the good green water that had decided to follow its lazy ways.\u201d But, again, Calla\u2019s take on her world can assume a decidedly modern cast. She dismisses her aunt and uncle\u2019s concerns about safety: \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to lynch us all.\u201d That claim simply wasn\u2019t a sure bet in 1930, when for years before and after, whole towns of black people were razed by white mobs and multiple lynchings continued.These missteps are regrettable. In exploring the mind-set and complicity of the bystander and the connection between white women and black women in a racist, patriarchal culture, Hunt has addressed some especially timely issues. But as I delved deeper into the psyches of Ottie Lee and Calla, I thought of Audre Lorde\u2019s assessment of the limits of solidarity between white women and women of color: \u201cSome problems we share as women, some we do not. You fear your children will grow up to join the patriarchy and testify against you; we fear our children will be dragged from a car and shot down in the street, and you will turn your backs upon the reasons they are dying.\u201d This fundamental, painful divide is edged toward, hinted at, but never fully allowed to break open in this novel.Kaitlyn Greenidge is the author of a novel, \u201cWe Love You, Charlie Freeman.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Profitable Pickups May Be in Cross Hairs of Trump Border Tax", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 There are many reasons for the steady success of the three major American automakers in recent years, but none are bigger than the surging sales of full-size pickup trucks.General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler dominate the segment in the United States market, and they rely on pickups for a sizable portion of their earnings in North America as a whole.But President Trump\u2019s proposed border tax on imported vehicles could throw a wrench in the profit machine, particularly for G.M. and Fiat Chrysler, which build a large percentage of their pickups in Mexico.At the same time, Ford \u2014 which makes all of its pickups in American factories \u2014 would most likely benefit at the expense of its rivals.The Trump administration has pledged to levy tariffs of up to 35 percent on vehicles imported from Mexico and possibly elsewhere, primarily to prod automakers to increase production and jobs in the United States.In response, all three of the Detroit companies have announced plans for new investments in their American operations. Ford went a step further by canceling plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico that had been criticized repeatedly by Mr. Trump.Yet the possibility of tariffs on trucks overshadows the give-and-take so far between a new president determined to expand the American economy and automakers that count on pickups as a huge source of income.\u201cThere is an awful lot at stake with a border tax on trucks,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Autotrader.com, a car-buying site. \u201cThese are the cash cows for Detroit.\u201dPickup sales have been an important component of the consistent growth of the American auto market, which last year set a record with nearly 17.5 million vehicles sold.The combination of low gas prices and a need by businesses to replace older trucks has stimulated demand, especially for full-size pickups, more than 90 percent of which are made by the three Detroit companies.In January, the three top-selling vehicles in the nation were pickups: the Ford F-150, G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado, and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram model. The companies earn an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 in profit on each truck sold \u2014 compared with $3,000 on a passenger car \u2014 so Detroit\u2019s financial fortunes inevitably rise and fall on the success of their truck products.Yet for G.M. and Fiat Chrysler, much of that success is dependent on truck production in Mexico, where labor costs are significantly lower than in unionized factories in the United States.Industry analysts estimate that one-third of G.M.\u2019s annual pickup production comes from its sprawling assembly plant in Silao, Mexico. And while Fiat Chrysler is expanding its American output of trucks, it still relies on its factory in Saltillo, Mexico, for 30 to 40 percent of its pickups, the analysts say.Ford, by contrast, makes its pickups at three plants in the United States.Automakers do not reveal profit margins on particular vehicles. But companies pay workers less than $10 an hour in Mexico, versus the top union wage of $29 in American plants. That differential makes Mexican trucks more profitable for G.M. and Fiat Chrysler than those produced in the United States.There are other costs associated with Mexican production, including shipping vehicles by rail or tractor-trailers to American dealerships. But lower labor rates still make Mexico an attractive production option for automakers.A border tax would wipe out that cost advantage, and could prompt manufacturers to raise prices on Mexican-made vehicles.\u201cAutomakers could possibly eat the cost of a 5 to 10 percent tariff, but not a tax of 20 or 30 percent,\u201d said Ron Harbour, an automotive analyst with the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. \u201cThey would probably have to pass some of that on to consumers.\u201dHigher prices could cool demand for pickups made by G.M. and Fiat Chrysler. The companies could also try to make up the cost of a border tax by spreading price increases across the breadth of their product lineups.While it is not uncommon to reallocate production among factories \u2014 for example, to make more high-margin trucks in American plants and shift less profitable small cars to Mexico \u2014 it is expensive and time-consuming to do so.G.M. is also vulnerable to potential tariffs on imported parts for pickups made in its factories in Flint, Mich., and Fort Wayne, Ind.About 38 percent of the parts for all G.M. pickups are made in the United States and Canada, and 55 percent are produced in Mexico, according to statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.About 56 percent of the parts in Fiat Chrysler\u2019s pickups are made in the United States and Canada, and 29 percent are produced in Mexico. At Ford, about 70 percent of its pickup components are made in the United States and Canada, and 15 percent come from Mexico.For all three automakers, that mix of parts applies whether the truck is made in the United States or Mexico. It is not clear whether Mr. Trump\u2019s vision of a border tax would apply to parts or only finished products.One industry analyst, Colin Langan of UBS Securities, singled out G.M. in a recent research report for its vulnerability to a tariff on pickups.\u201cThe border tax is a clear risk to G.M.\u2019s full-size pickup trucks,\u201d Mr. Langan wrote. \u201cThe timing is also challenging as G.M. plans to retool its pickup facilities ahead of the 2018 pickup launch.\u201dG.M. executives declined to talk about the impact of a tariff on the company\u2019s pickups during a conference call with analysts last week on its 2016 earnings.The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, said it was premature to discuss the implications of a border tax. \u201cThere are a lot of moving parts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to work with the administration to make sure what is best for the U.S. economy.\u201dG.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary Barra, stressed that about 80 percent of the products that the company sells in the United States are American-made.As a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory council, Ms. Barra said, she has outlined how difficult it is for an automaker to adjust production strategy on the fly. \u201cI think that understanding has been well received,\u201d she said of meeting with the president and his advisers.Other vehicles made in Mexico, such as Ford\u2019s Fusion sedan and G.M.\u2019s Cadillac SRX sport utility vehicle, could also be affected by a border tax. But because of their popularity and profits, pickups are the most vulnerable products.\u201cA tariff on pickups would be a real challenge, especially for G.M.,\u201d said Ms. Krebs of Autotrader. \u201cTrucks are so important to their bottom line, and this is uncharted territory.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Germany, Trump Poses a Problem With No Clear Solution", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterBERLIN \u2014 As allies across Europe and Asia adjust to changes brought by President Trump, Germany is in a uniquely difficult position.Its economy and national security are particularly reliant on American support, which now seems in doubt, and on European unity, which is under attack and increasingly up to Germany to maintain.Yet Germany is constrained by the growing shakiness of allies like Britain and perhaps even France, by the rise of its own far-right populist movement and by lingering cultural sensitivities about any policy that feels militaristic or hegemonic. These dynamics are not new, but there is a growing tension between the role Germany feels comfortable with, and the one it feels it needs to play on the world stage.A growing number of officials in Germany are asking whether they need a Plan B for a post-American Europe. But they are finding that any such plan would require costs and sacrifices almost as great as the consequences of inaction.\u201cWe said farewell to your ambassador the other day,\u201d said Niels Annen, a lawmaker with the center-left Social Democrats, who are part of the governing coalition. \u201cHe tried to reassure everybody but I think nobody believed him.\u201dOver breakfast in the restored Reichstag, a soaring imperial-era construction, Mr. Annen worried about \u201ca return to geopolitics in the way that we saw in the 20th and maybe 19th centuries.\u201dThe concern vexing Mr. Annen, and much of official Berlin, was that Mr. Trump might not only withdraw American protection but also actively aid Europe\u2019s growing internal and external threats.\u201cSomeone like Mr. Bannon sitting in the White House who has contacts with right-wing, up to fascist, groups here in Europe,\u201d Mr. Annen said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, \u201cis really concerning.\u201dHe also said he feared that Mr. Trump could seek to improve ties with Moscow \u201con Russian terms,\u201d cutting out Europe, and potentially emboldening Russia\u2019s growing challenge to the continent\u2019s unity.Other lawmakers worried that Mr. Trump was already undermining European unity, for example by rewarding Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union with promises of a speedy trade deal.Most nations, facing such threats, would most likely be moving to respond.Germany is unusual. It has secured its place in the world by upholding the liberal order through consensus-building and peacemaking.\u201cThat\u2019s a nice idea,\u201d Ulrich K\u00fchn, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said of that model. But Germany \u201cis being confronted with a reality where we cannot continue that way anymore.\u201dMost middle powers rely at least partly on traditional forms of power; Britain has its military might, India its regional dominance, Israel its nuclear program. Germany has explicitly avoided such assets, leaving it to rely on soft power tools, particularly its economic strength, that only work in the framework of a liberal European order that now looks uncertain.Now, policy elites and the public in Germany are struggling with whether and how their nation should develop more traditional forms of power.Germany has, in the past decade, grown beyond many of the taboos that stem from the Nazi era and World War II. It leads on eurozone matters, sends small numbers of troops on overseas NATO missions and has organized recent sanctions against Russia. National pride remains a touchy topic but one that can at least be discussed.Still, the idea of Germany as a military power or even European hegemon \u2014 likely requirements for taking up the burdens and responsibilities of a leading European power in the Trump era \u2014 remains difficult.But Germany may not have the luxury of time to reconcile its contradictory feelings about its place in the world, especially with an intransigent America and resurgent Russia, and a Europe rived by populism.\u201cWe still don\u2019t really have a clue who we are in the world and who we want to be,\u201d said Jana Puglierin of the German Council on Foreign Relations. That makes it difficult to face increasingly urgent questions, she said, over \u201cwhat role we should play, who Germany is, how dominant do we want to be.\u201dAs the United States openly questions the European Union\u2019s value, its member states are plagued by populist backlashes that have made its leaders less willing to address the eurozone and refugee crises at a moment when they are most urgent.Germany, as a result, is left carrying a greater share of the burden just as it is becoming heaviest.\u201cWe\u2019re running out of partners,\u201d Mr. Annen said.But while the United States could tell Europe hard truths and pressure its leaders to make difficult decisions, continental politics and memory mean Germany cannot take over this role. Its regional stature allows it enough power to push some policies on smaller states, but not enough to force unity on all issues. And past exercises of power, like pushing austerity plans that benefited Germany\u2019s own economy at the expense of its poorer neighbors, have not enhanced its regional leadership.\u201cIt will never be a with-us-or-against-us policy, because then these countries will be against us,\u201d Mr. Annen said.An even starker challenge is posed by Russia, which is staging cyberattacks and aligning with populist movements across Europe. The fear is that softening American and Western European defense commitments would compel some Eastern European states to hedge against the alliance and submit to a degree of Russian influence.Should Europe\u2019s defense unity break under Russian pressure, analysts worry, its economic and political unity would follow, leaving Germany isolated at a time when it is unequipped to go it alone.Eastern European states may look to Germany, whose economy is almost triple the size of Russia\u2019s, to replace American security guarantees. But the German military lacks many basics such as sufficient ammunition, for which it relies on American forces. Even with rapid spending increases, it would take years for the country to be able to play a major European defense role, Mr. K\u00fchn said.\u201cThere is no substitute for the United States with regard to European security,\u201d said Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, a lawmaker with the Christian Democratic Union, which is also the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel.Should Germany seek to uphold European collective defense, the greatest hurdle may be the German people.Officials say that while their first priority is to establish friendly relations with the Trump administration, they are not averse to hitting back if the United States undermines the European Union.\u201cWe cannot allow even our most important ally to dismantle the single most historic achievement that we have,\u201d Mr. Annen said. \u201cThat is something that no government could accept without giving an answer.\u201dBehind closed doors, according to a senior German government official, officials are preparing for the day that Berlin could be forced to treat its longtime ally as a threat, necessitating radical changes in German foreign policy.The official asked to remain anonymous because of another predicament Berlin faces with Mr. Trump: Its leaders must prepare Germany by enunciating the stakes, but they fear that overtly stepping away from Mr. Trump would anger him, risking the very breakup they wish to avoid.Others are beginning to think about the day after.Roderich Kiesewetter, a former military officer who is now a lawmaker with the Christian Democratic Union, is among a small but growing group pushing these questions into the public debate.Germany should focus on persuading Mr. Trump to drop his hostility toward Europe, Mr. Kiesewetter said, but \u201cwe should not wait\u201d to consider acting.Mr. Kiesewetter hopes to hasten military integration across the European Union. He acknowledged that a European-only defense against Russia would be far weaker than the status quo. Still, he argued it could be a sufficient deterrent \u2014 if Germany takes enough of a role to bring along the rest of Europe.Though few lawmakers have joined Mr. Kiesewetter\u2019s public calls for considering a post-American Europe, policy analysts say that such discussions are becoming widespread in official Berlin.Still, Mr. Kiesewetter is hardly optimistic. Should Mr. Trump strike a rapprochement with Moscow that did not include European leaders, leaving the continent on its own, he warned this would divide Eastern Europe between \u201czones of influence.\u201dThis possibility seems to torment German officials, who sometimes label it with the word \u201cZwischen-Europa.\u201d The phrase, which means \u201cintermediary Europe\u201d or \u201cin-between Europe,\u201d comes from the interwar era, when Germans used it to describe the borderlands between it and the Soviet Union. It is remembered here as a partial cause of World War II.The phrase is used today not to specifically warn of war but to remind Germans of the importance of the postwar order that many believe is in growing peril. It is also a warning: that the liberal system could slip away and that Germans must remember the dangers of the old order, even if the rest of the world forgets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen Bannon Reassures Conservatives Uneasy About Trump", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOXON HILL, Md. \u2014 In an administration hardly five weeks old, Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s reputation has taken on almost mythic proportion as a fire-breathing populist, emerging power center, man of mystery.When Mr. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s chief strategist, appeared in public on Thursday for the first time since the president was sworn in, it was to deliver, in his own combative way, a message of soothing reassurance to the conservative activists gathered here for their annual assessment known as the Conservative Political Action Conference.Do not believe the \u201ccorporatist globalist media\u201d that was \u201ccrying and weeping\u201d on election night and is still \u201cdead wrong\u201d about what the Trump administration is doing. Inside the White House, Mr. Bannon said, everything is going according to plan. The \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d has just begun.Appearing with Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s chief of staff, he joked about how well the two get along despite the friction that had always existed between them. \u201cI can run a little hot on occasion,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, complimenting Mr. Priebus\u2019s equanimity.And he urged a ballroom full of activists to stick together against the forces that were trying to tear them apart. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a populist, whether you\u2019re a limited-government conservative, whether you\u2019re a libertarian, whether you\u2019re an economic nationalist,\u201d he said, \u201cwe want you to have our back.\u201dDespite Mr. Bannon\u2019s assurances, a simmering unease remains among conservatives over whether Mr. Trump will honor his promises to them, given that he was not part of their movement \u2014 or any political movement, for that matter \u2014 until very recently.Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, acknowledged the discomfort that comes with any hostile party takeover when she addressed the meeting. Mr. Trump, she said, had to uproot the political system.\u201cEvery great movement ends up being a little bit sclerotic and dusty after a time,\u201d she said. She predicted that CPAC would wholly embrace the new president.\u201cWell, I think by tomorrow this will be TPAC,\u201d she said.Part of what has been so problematic in Mr. Trump\u2019s first month is that the disruption he promised to unleash on the federal bureaucracy so far seems to be occurring in the wrong place: his administration, which has been rife with infighting and rattled by early missteps. The destructive forces that Mr. Bannon and other conservatives complain about can sometimes come from within.\u201cDisruption is a good thing,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts CPAC. Still, he acknowledged, \u201con some days they do it better than others.\u201dThere is another lens through which to see the disorder that has characterized this White House, Mr. Trump and his supporters say. And that is to understand that the president\u2019s enemies \u2014 especially in the news media \u2014 want to distort his actions, exaggerate his mistakes and not discuss issues like safety and unemployment that are on the minds of his supporters.Gov. Matt Bevin, Republican of Kentucky, said he was appalled by the \u201cunbelievable incessant focus on the most mindless things,\u201d with regard to how the president is portrayed in the news media. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about crime rates. Let\u2019s talk about economic viability. Let\u2019s talk about joblessness,\u201d Mr. Bevin added. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on things that matter and stop being so tabloid-like and titillated by idiocy.\u201d\u201cTo try to remove me from the equation would remove one of his voices and one of his trusted aides. And that would be hurtful to him,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see this coming. They weren\u2019t prepared for this result \u2014 even though they all ran around and said: \u2018We\u2019re a divided country! We\u2019re a divided country!\u2019\u201dIt was not as if the support for Mr. Trump, who will speak to the conference Friday morning, is not enthusiastic.\u201cI always said he\u2019s not a stupid man. And if he has the right people around him he\u2019s going to do the right thing,\u201d said Daniel Cirucci of Cherry Hill, N.J., who was standing in line on Thursday evening to listen to Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative he said he deeply admired. \u201cI think he realizes the enormity of the job,\u201d Mr. Cirucci added. \u201cNow does that mean Trump is going to stop being Trump? No.\u201dThese should be good times for conservatives \u2014 and much of the time they are. They control not just the White House but both houses of Congress and appear on the verge of regaining a majority on the Supreme Court. They have not dominated so many state governments in close to a century.But part of the subtext of CPAC this year has been how conservative leaders are trying to smooth out the rougher edges of their movement, not all of which involve Mr. Trump.Because of the association that a fringe element of Trump supporters has with white nationalists, the CPAC organizers held a panel discussion on Thursday to signal their strong disapproval. Its title: The Alt-Right Ain\u2019t Right at All.Yet after the panel was over, the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer stood in the hall just off the main stage and declared himself a conservative. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative in a deep sense, in a sense that I care about people and defending a culture.\u201dThe projections of placidity inside CPAC tried to mask how fractious the movement remains. Yet optimists were not hard to find.Mr. Pence said the Trump victory has given conservatives \u201cthe most important time in the history of our movement.\u201d\u201cMy friends, this is our time,\u201d he told the conference Thursday night. \u201cThis is the time to prove again that our answers are the right answers for America.\u201dIn his brief remarks, Mr. Bannon ended on a conciliatory note. He insisted that conservatives all had more in common than most people realized.\u201cWe have wide and sometimes divergent opinions,\u201d he said. But the core of what conservatives believe is \u201cthat we\u2019re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders \u2014 that we\u2019re a nation with a culture and a reason for being.\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what unites us,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to unite this movement going forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The new Treasury secretary says the postelection rally in the equities market reflects faith in President Trump and his promises for tax changes and fiscal stimulus. Both plans need approval from Congress, and may be accompanied by higher inflation. Anti-immigrant and trade policies could also mute market gains.Secretary Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday that he hoped to have a tax-overhaul bill passed by Congress by August. That is an ambitious timetable, even with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House. There are major differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate, which will most likely come up with a separate proposal. One senator said current House tax proposals would be lucky to draw 10 votes out of 100. The administration will use its own rosy growth forecasts rather than the Congressional Budget Office estimates on which lawmakers rely.Congress already has a full agenda. Its first priority is repealing and replacing Obamacare, but lawmakers have yet to present a plan as disagreements continue. The Senate is also considering Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, who needs 60 votes to beat a filibuster. Republicans are eight votes shy of that number. Lawmakers are already considering pushing President Trump\u2019s plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure to next year, and Secretary Mnuchin did not highlight it on Thursday.Yet investors betting on a fiscal stimulus and tax overhaul have pushed the S.&P. 500-stock index up by more than 10 percent since the November election. Secretary Mnuchin said the performance reflected confidence in President Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cThis is a mark-to-market business, and you see what the market thinks,\u201d he said.Carrying out President Trump\u2019s campaign pledges could spur inflation, which is already creeping up. Consumer spending has been healthy, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported last week that inflation expectations hit 1.92 percent. That is still shy of the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target but higher than the 1.6 percent reported at the end of December. Rising inflation could put the Fed on a quicker path for raising interest rates.While action on taxes and infrastructure remains iffy, President Trump\u2019s concrete moves to crack down on immigration and pull out of trade deals will hit the economy. When stock prices fall, as stock prices do, Secretary Mnuchin may find claiming credit for the market\u2019s rise was a risk not worth taking.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Look Past Headlines as Bull Market Roars Ahead", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkets hate uncertainty. It is one of the oldest saws in finance.Yet even as a series of political scandals flare up in President Trump\u2019s nascent administration, raising questions about his ability to pursue an investor-friendly agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal spending, the stock market just roars ahead.For the most part, the stumbles by the administration have not been related to promises that Mr. Trump made \u2014 and that investors embraced \u2014 to recharge an economy that most economists believe is growing at subpar levels.Still, that investors have chosen to ignore the chaos in Washington highlights just how deep is the belief (others might consider it wishful thinking) that Mr. Trump, at his root, is a president who will deliver market-friendly policies.\u201cI fully get the euphoria \u2014 there has probably never been a more business-friendly president,\u201d said Adrian Helfert, the head of global fixed income at Amundi Smith Breeden. \u201cLower taxes and less regulations are good for corporations and equity holders.\u201dSince Election Day, the S.&P. 500 index is up over 9 percent, and with money continuing to pour into stocks from bond and money market funds, the bull market is showing few signs of letting up.On Wednesday, stocks continued their run for a seventh consecutive session \u2014 the longest winning streak since September 2013, according to Bloomberg data. The S.&P. 500 gained 0.5 percent, led by health care and financial stocks.But as the markets climb and corporate borrowing rates remain historically low, Mr. Helfert worries that investors are taking too lightly the possible pitfalls of this high-risk, high-return Trump presidency.\u201cHe is pulling out all the stops,\u201d he said, \u201cand I just don\u2019t think that investors are being compensated for the downside risks.\u201dMr. Helfert points to the VIX index, or Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d which measures the expectations investors have that markets will convulse sharply in the future. Since Mr. Trump became president, the index has been trading at very low levels, unperturbed by political histrionics.Of course, it is also true that a market that goes up for a sustained period, without the wild swings that have characterized past run-ups, will not set off volatility alarm bells.And in that regard, Mr. Trump\u2019s political supporters on Wall Street say they are not surprised by the market\u2019s willingness to charge ahead.What is driving enthusiasm, some investors say, is not so much that Mr. Trump is pressing down on the gas pedal with promises to increase spending and cut taxes, but rather his desire to take his foot off the brake and remove investor and business restrictions. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said his top priorities include rolling back regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama to keep large banks and funds in check.That Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president, has emerged as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and most influential advisers in this regard, is also seen as a sign that deregulation will remain at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda.And risk takers have not just taken heart in the administration\u2019s pledge to dismantle the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Some smaller loosening of financial regulations has also provided encouragement.This week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main derivatives regulator, said it would not penalize institutions for violating new derivatives standards.And a Dodd-Frank rule that required energy companies to disclose whether they made payments to foreign governments was recently voided by Congress.These are by no means giant moves, but they send a powerful signal all the same to investors frustrated by Obama-era restraints.One money manager and active fund-raiser for Mr. Trump during the election said that while many have seen disorder and disarray in the White House, he has seen a man of action doing whatever is needed to get the economy to grow faster.But here is another thought.Perhaps investors, after 10 years of living in constant fear over a succession of financial and political cataclysms, have finally decided to tune out the headlines and focus instead on an economy that, while not great, is not doing so bad, either.Ed Yardeni, a stock market strategist, calculates that savings deposits and money market funds, the two safest and lowest return options for the risk-wary, doubled to nearly $9 trillion at the end of last month from $4.5 trillion in early 2009.A lot of this caution was driven by the trauma of the financial crisis, of course, but it has been sustained in the years since by persistent worries (political and otherwise) that the markets will collapse again or the economy will tank. These anxieties have been reflected in persistent swings in the VIX index in recent years.Now, a lot of this pent-up cash earning close to zero in terms of interest rates is looking for higher returns in the stock market \u2014 with pension funds in particular leading the way.\u201cThe reality is that the real G.D.P. of the economy has never been higher and that consumer spending per household is at an all-time high,\u201d said Mr. Yardeni, who has been arguing for some time that markets have been obsessing needlessly over worrying headlines.\u201cThroughout all these corrections, people have been talking about an endgame,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe people have figured out that you can watch the news all you want and get upset, but that has nothing to do with earnings and the valuation of earnings in the stock market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Would You Say on the Oscar Stage?", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CarpetbaggerThe arrival of documentary stars on the red carpet often brings a stiff blast of reality to the fairy-tale concoction that is the Academy Awards.One minute reporters are clamoring to chat up Bradley Cooper or ask J. Law about her dress, the next they are presented with a genocide survivor, a soldier ravaged by war, or a Congolese park ranger who risks life and limb to protect the last of an endangered species. If the red carpet doubles as a popularity contest \u2014 and it does \u2014 celebrities win, hands down.But this year\u2019s batch of documentary makers and their subjects might find themselves in a brighter spotlight because of the increasingly heated political climate.Five of the 10 feature-length and short documentaries nominated for Oscars are directly or indirectly about refugees. Three of them trace the perilous paths of desperate migrants; a fourth is about Syrian rescuers who search for people buried alive in bombed buildings; and a fifth is about a Holocaust survivor who arrived on America\u2019s shores seven decades ago.Several of the documentarians wanted to bring their subjects to the Oscar ceremony, but plans were upended by President Trump\u2019s order banning travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. With the ban\u2019s fate tied up in the courts, their attendance remains uncertain. So, the Bagger asked the filmmakers and a few subjects, too: Given the uproar over refugee issues fueled by the controversial ban, what would your message be if you found yourself on the Oscar stage?\u201cThey said, \u2018Gianfranco, the word \u2018might\u2019 is what\u2019s important,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rosi continued. \u201c\u2018We know crossing the sea we might die. In Libya, we will die. For us, the word \u2018might\u2019 is everything. It\u2019s hope. Don\u2019t betray our hope.\u2019\u201dIn the film, Mr. Rosi also chronicles the everyday lives of islanders largely unaffected by the crisis, a discomfiting microcosm of the epic indifference exhibited by the world at large.\u201cI encountered death on the border of Europe \u2014 is this acceptable?\u201d Mr. Rosi asked. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest crises and tragedies in Europe since World War II. At that time, we could say we didn\u2019t know. We can\u2019t say that now.\u201d\u201cHe embodies the responsibility that I feel we all have as citizens of the Western world,\u201d Ms. Matziaraki said. \u201cHe\u2019s been carrying the weight of this for a year and a half. Him and his fellow crew members are seeing this firsthand. And he feels extremely lonely in that the world has turned its back. He wants the world to share their responsibility, and the burden.\u201dMs. Matziaraki said she hoped that audience members who see her film recognize themselves in those who are fleeing atrocities, many of them educated, middle-class people with young families. \u201cThese are humans exactly like us; they hurt in the same way that we do,\u201d Ms. Matziaraki said. \u201cEveryone I spoke to said, \u2018It\u2019s not a choice to leave our home.\u2019\u201dOne White Helmet, a young man who would easily blend into hipster Brooklyn, plays with his toddler daughter before rushing to a building leveled by an airstrike and frantically searching for survivors.

Regardless of its fate in the courts, the ban has delivered a harsh message nonetheless.Joanna Natasegara, a producer of \u201cThe White Helmets,\u201d said that rather than being turned away, the Syrian rescuers ought to be praised as humanitarians who were fighting to keep a society together and to stop the spread of the Islamic State and jihadism. \u201cThey should be welcomed and rewarded,\u201d Ms. Natasegara said.15 PhotosThe Bagger also chatted with Khaled Khatib, a White Helmets\u2019 member and the film\u2019s cameraman, who spoke via Skype and a translator from Turkey.Mr. Khatib said that whether he traveled to the Oscars or not, the nomination would forward the film\u2019s message. He also noted that the country\u2019s outpouring of refugees could not be blamed on any travel ban.\u201cThe betrayal to the Syrian people wasn\u2019t this specific executive order,\u201d Mr. Khatib said. \u201cThe betrayal of the Syrian people was by the international community who failed to stop the war and especially the airstrikes from the Syrian government and the Russian government on the Syrian people.\u201dStill, Marcel Mettelsiefen, who directed \u201cWatani: My Homeland,\u201d said the executive order was part of a troubling, larger right-wing drive to divide and conquer, in part by demonizing Muslims.\u201cWe need to a have a counternarrative; we need to tell the story of the majority of the members of this religion,\u201d Mr. Mettelsiefen said. \u201cFor Hala, the travel ban is proof that unfortunately people like her, families of women and children, are paying a price for the international political failures regarding what\u2019s been going on in her own country.\u201dAn immigrant ban, Mr. Feingold said, would not just hurt the people who found themselves shut out.\u201cI know how immigrants contributed to the well-being of the United States \u2014 to the economy, to the science, to the culture,\u201d Mr. Feingold said. \u201cNaturally to restrict it hit me in a very direct way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tells Xi Jinping U.S. Will Honor \u2018One China\u2019 Policy", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump told President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday evening that the United States would honor the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, reversing his earlier expressions of doubt about the longtime diplomatic understanding and removing a major source of tension between the United States and China since shortly after he was elected.In a statement, the White House said Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi \u201cdiscussed numerous topics, and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our One China policy.\u201d It described the call as \u201cextremely cordial\u201d and said the leaders had invited each other to visit.Administration officials concluded that Mr. Xi would take a call only if Mr. Trump publicly committed to upholding the 44-year-old policy, under which the United States recognized a single Chinese government in Beijing and severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan.Given the domestic political stakes of this issue for Mr. Xi, the fact that both sides went ahead with a call \u2013 and that the White House statement afterward acknowledged Mr. Trump\u2019s acquiescence \u2013 suggested that the agreement on \u201cone China\u201d had been worked out beforehand.The Chinese state news media, in its readout of the call, said Mr. Trump had \u201cstressed that he fully understood the great importance for the U.S. government to respect the One China policy,\u201d and that \u201cthe U.S. government adheres to the One China policy.\u201dIt also said the two leaders had agreed on the \u201cnecessity and urgency of strengthening cooperation between China and the United States\u201d and noted that Beijing wants to work with Washington on a range of issues, including the economy and trade, science, energy, communications and global stability.The timing of the conversation was significant, as Mr. Trump is about to welcome Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, for an extravagant three-day visit that will include a weekend of golf in Florida \u2014 a visit that will be closely monitored in China.Among the issues Mr. Trump is expected to discuss with Mr. Abe, is the president\u2019s commitment to a mutual defense treaty with Japan, which surfaced during the campaign. At the time, Mr. Trump said he was prepared to pull back from the pact unless Tokyo did more to reimburse the United States for defending Japanese territory.On Thursday, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson met with officials at the White House to discuss issuing a statement about relations with China. His involvement was noteworthy because he had pledged, in written answers to questions after his Senate confirmation hearing, to uphold the One China policy.On Wednesday, the White House sent a letter from Mr. Trump to Mr. Xi wishing him a happy Chinese New Year, which administration officials described as an effort to keep the relationship from unraveling further while they sought to resolve the tensions.Relations between Washington and Beijing had been frozen since December, when Mr. Trump took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen. The United States has not had diplomatic relations with Taiwan since 1979, and Mr. Trump defended the call by saying he did not know why the United States should be bound by the One China policy.To lay the groundwork for a better relationship, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, spoke last Friday with China\u2019s top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi. That call produced only a vague commitment to \u201creinforce high-level exchanges,\u201d suggesting that Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on China sill precluded a direct leader-to-leader exchange.As a gesture of conciliation, Mr. Flynn and his deputy, K. T. McFarland, hand-delivered Mr. Trump\u2019s letter to China\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai. Mr. Trump wrote that he wished \u201cthe Chinese people a happy Lantern Festival and prosperous Year of the Rooster.\u201d He also said he \u201clooks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China.\u201d\u201cThis letter means they\u2019re looking for creative ways to stabilize this relationship when Trump and Xi can\u2019t talk due to differences over Taiwan policy,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, who was senior director for Asia on the National Security Council under President Barack Obama.But there were indications that the administration recognized it needed to do more. Mr. Tillerson, officials said, suggested that Mr. Trump publicly reaffirm his commitment to the One China policy as a way of breaking the deadlock and getting the two presidents back on the phone.For Mr. Trump, it was a significant reversal. In an interview with Fox News in December, he said the policy should be contingent on extracting concessions from Beijing.\u201cWe\u2019re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation; with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\u2019t tax them; with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing; and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea,\u201d he said.But arguably, no bilateral relationship is more important than the one between Beijing and Washington, and the fact that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi had not talked since Mr. Trump took office in January has drawn increasing scrutiny.\u201cThe U.S.-China relationship only works if the two leaders have a serious relationship and use their contact to do real business,\u201d Mr. Medeiros said. \u201cGiven the rigidity of the Chinese system, leader-level contact provides essential stability, direction and momentum to U.S.-China ties.\u201dAdministration officials are also keenly aware that the Chinese will be closely watching the visit of Mr. Abe, which begins here Friday with an Oval Office meeting, a White House lunch and a joint news conference. Then Mr. Trump will take Mr. Abe to Palm Beach, Fla., on Air Force One. The leaders plan to play golf at the Trump International Golf Club and then they and their wives will have dinner at Mar-a-Lago, another Trump club.To the status-conscious Chinese, this red-carpet treatment will not go unnoticed. Analysts say it may reinforce their suspicion that the Trump administration is making Japan the centerpiece of its Asia strategy.In Beijing, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, expressed thanks for Mr. Trump\u2019s letter. He dismissed as \u201csenseless\u201d speculation the idea that Mr. Trump had been snubbing Mr. Xi by not scheduling a phone call earlier. \u201cThe two countries share wide common interests, and cooperation is the only correct path for both,\u201d Mr. Lu told reporters on Thursday.Even before the phone call, Mr. Trump and his advisers had markedly shifted their tone toward China since the inauguration.During the campaign, Mr. Trump advocated a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States, complaining that China manipulated the value of its currency. This month, however, Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, attended a Lunar New Year celebration at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. Her daughter, Arabella, sang a New Year\u2019s greeting in Mandarin that was widely viewed in China.Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, met with Mr. Cui before the embassy event, part of a blossoming dialogue between the two men.\u201cIt\u2019s an expression of good will,\u201d Jia Qingguo, dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University, said of Mr. Trump\u2019s letter. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to handle this relationship with practical cooperation.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled, at one point, the surname of a former senior director for Asia in the National Security Council during the Obama administration. As noted correctly elsewhere in the article, he is Evan S. Medeiros, not Madeiros.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the Trump club where Shinzo Abe and Donald J. Trump planned to play golf.

{"Headline": "What Facebook Owes to Journalism", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorUnfortunately, his memo ignored two major points \u2014 the role that Facebook and other technology platforms are playing in inadvertently damaging local news media, and the one way they could actually save journalism: with a massive philanthropic commitment.Local news is weak in large part because the business models have collapsed. The main reason: As advertising spending shifted from print, TV and radio to the internet, the money didn\u2019t mostly go to digital news organizations. Increasingly, it goes to Facebook and Google.To be clear, Facebook and Google are not being malicious. This isn\u2019t like the tobacco industry knowingly trying to addict people to a product that kills them. Quite the contrary; these companies are sucking in the lion\u2019s share of digital advertising because the ad products they offer are so damn good. They are saving local businesses massive amounts of money.But just because the result is unintentional doesn\u2019t mean it is fantasy: Newsrooms have been decimated, with basic accountability reporting slashed as a result.A quick word about two other big players, Verizon and Apple. If Verizon, which owns AOL, succeeds in buying Yahoo, the combined company would become the third biggest recipient of digital advertising dollars, earning about 10 percent.I\u2019m not saying that the good stuff \u2014 the mobile revolution, blocking intrusive ads, better marketing options for small businesses \u2014 doesn\u2019t outweigh the bad. And local news organizations absolutely contributed to the problem with their sluggish and often uncreative reaction to the digital revolution. But we still need to accept that \u201cdisruption\u201d does disrupt, and occasionally some of what gets overturned is extremely important. When that happens \u2014 and if adequate market-based solutions haven\u2019t materialized \u2014 philanthropy must step in, too.In the last ten years or so, there has been a bit of an increase in philanthropic support for journalism. But if you look closely, a few things stand out.The next thing you notice is the four names that are missing from the list of 89 foundations that contributed during those two years: the foundations connected to Facebook, Google, Verizon and Apple. The Tulsa Community Foundation donated more to help investigative journalism than those four combined.If we go back further in time, the pattern persists: $145 million was donated for investigative journalism by 374 foundations from 2009 to 2016. There was one from the big four \u2014 $10,000 in 2011 to the Bronx News Network.As a reminder, these companies have not exactly been financially struggling. In 2016, the four posted a combined net income of $88 billion ($19.4 for Google, $10.2 for Facebook, $13 billion for Verizon and $45 billion for Apple). By contrast, the combined net income for The New York Times, Gannett and McClatchy was $41 million.But while training, technology and innovation are critical, what journalism needs most now is money, and lots of it \u2014 to fund full-time local journalists. What these companies have donated so far is too little given how wealthy they are, how much harm they\u2019re (inadvertently) doing \u2014 and how much good they could do.If the leaders of these companies put the equivalent of just 1 percent of their profits, for five years, to the cause, local American journalism would be transformed for the next century.There\u2019s no doubt that the digital revolution \u2014 built in no small part by these four companies \u2014 has made reporting much easier for the journalists still remaining in local newsrooms. But we urgently need far more of those journalists.These companies are among the biggest beneficiaries of the digital disruption that has, among other things, caused the crisis in American journalism. It\u2019s time for the disrupters to solve these problems. They have the money, the know-how and the obligation.An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a Google co-founder.

{"Headline": "The Secret Art History on Your Money", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoney talks. And these days, it also walks.American currency is set for its biggest image overhaul in decades as an old face is demoted \u2014 that means you, Andrew Jackson! \u2014 and some new ones, less uniformly white and male, arrive.The images on legal tender are perhaps the most widely circulated art in the world, but where do they come from? That\u2019s the question explored by \u201cImages of Value,\u201d an exhibition at the Grolier Club in Manhattan devoted to the underpondered truism that financial art, like the bills it is printed on, doesn\u2019t grow on trees.The more than 250 items on view come from the collection of Mark D. Tomasko, a retired lawyer who became fascinated by the beauty of financial art at age 10, when his grandmother gave him an obsolete stock certificate from the old Marmon Motor Car Company. Today he is the rare collector who focuses on tracking down the original artwork behind the engravings on bank notes, stock certificates and other financial documents.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an Easter egg hunt,\u201d Mr. Tomasko said during a recent interview in the gallery, taking out his smartphone to show a visitor the hundreds of engraved \u201cfancy heads,\u201d or decorative female heads, he keeps on hand for reference. \u201cI enjoy putting together the puzzle.\u201dThe show, on view through April 29, presents a kind of shadow art history, driven not by bohemians in their studios or working en plein-air but by a rarefied if staid-looking crew of artists and engravers who suited up every day to work at outfits like the American Bank Note Company. The company was the king of an industry that \u2014 like the dollar itself \u2014 ruled the world well into the 20th century, when financial \u201cdematerialization\u201d and other forces took their toll.Today, going cashless is easy, but when paper is required Mr. Tomasko likes his lucre very clean.\u201cI only use new money,\u201d he said, pulling a hyper-crisp Benjamin out of his wallet to point out its high-tech anti-counterfeiting features.And what happens when he gets change?He paused, then said, deadpan: \u201cI try not to get change.\u201dHere is a sampling of items Mr. Tomasko has retrieved from the vast, gorgeous and sometimes bewildering dustbin of American financial art history.Before the Civil War, American currency was a confusing welter of notes issued by state banks. The notes often bore pastoral vignettes heavy on cows, wagons, haystacks and other features of rural life, sometimes subtly adjusted. (In one bill from a South Carolina bank, a white fieldworker seen in the background of the source image was transformed into an African-American, presumably a slave.)That dizzying demand helped create the American security engraving industry, while also leaving people uncertain whether the bills they held were any good. \u201cIt was a beautiful, difficult currency,\u201d Mr. Tomasko said.The \u201cfancy heads\u201d both prettied things up and made the documents harder to counterfeit. A $1 bill issued by the Corn Exchange Bank of Wisconsin in the 1850s or \u201960s, shown at top, includes a head derived from a painting by the French artist Constant Joseph Brochart. Mr. Tomasko bought the lithograph shown above, which is based on Brochart, just because he liked it. Later he realized it had been engraved and used on a bank note. \u201cIt was entirely accidental,\u201d he said.The first general-circulation United States currency appeared in 1861, when the government, to finance the Civil War, issued non-interest-bearing $10 demand notes, with Abraham Lincoln on the front. The United Stated Bureau of Engraving and Printing was created in 1874 and took over production of all American currency in 1877.The faces on the front weren\u2019t always the all-dude lineup we know today. Before there was Harriet Tubman (coming soon to the $20), there was Martha Washington, who appeared solo on the front of a $1 silver certificate in 1886 (shown above), and then alongside her husband on the back of another one issued in 1896. (Today, George has the $1 all to himself.)The bureau has no record of the source image, but Mr. Tomasko said it was a portrait by Charles Fran\u00e7ois Jalabert, which he also circulated via 19th-century cards, magazine illustrations and lithographs. Like all United States currency issued since 1861, these bills remain valid at their full face value, but if you want to buy an 1886 Martha, you\u2019ll need to fork over as many as 1,500 Georges.After the federal government took over production of currency, American Bank Note focused on the foreign market. In the first half of the 20th century, its biggest customer was China.Chinese bank notes, Mr. Tomasko said, generally did not feature faces. Instead, they showed buildings and landscapes, often drawn from photographs, which were becoming an increasingly important source of imagery for securities.The image on the 1918 bill for the Asia Banking Corporation shown above depicted the old walls around Beijing, now gone; the image comes from a picture postcard, with a sky drawn in before engraving, to create a richer scene. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to engrave good skies,\u201d Mr. Tomasko said.The Chinese Revolution of 1949 put an end to that market. Two other major American Bank Note customers, Mexico and Brazil, also created their own industries in the 1960s, dealing another blow.By the 20th century, American Bank Note and other companies commonly commissioned original art rather than taking images from the broader culture, partly because the salon art of the 19th century had given way to new movements whose images were \u201cnot suitable\u201d for currency vignettes, as Mr. Tomasko\u2019s catalog puts it.If there\u2019s a true maestro of this art in the show, it\u2019s A. E. Foringer. Foringer, who trained with the muralist Edwin Blashfield, had his 15 minutes of fame with \u201cThe Greatest Mother in the World,\u201d a Madonna-like Red Cross poster from 1918 \u2014 the only work mentioned in his 1948 obituary in The New York Times, Mr. Tomasko noted a bit forlornly.But Foringer also had a long career as a vignette artist for American Bank Note, creating images that appeared on more than 50 international bills and many stock certificates, including a series for the Canadian Bank of Commerce in the 1910s and 1920s that Mr. Tomasko calls \u201cthe most beautiful bank notes of the 20th century.\u201dMr. Tomasko acquired some of the large oil paintings Foringer made after American Bank Note sold the bulk of its archives at auction in 1990. Most of the original artwork Foringer did for the company is lost, but the engravings made from them have not entirely disappeared. The seated woman with grapes shown on a different Canadian Bank of Commerce note, a five-pound bill issued by its branch in Kingston, Jamaica, shown above, appears today on the label of the Maiden, a cabernet produced by Harlan Estate, a Napa Valley winery that has resurrected two Foringer engravings.In 1874, the New York Stock Exchange began requiring that all listed companies have their securities engraved by a reputable banknote company. The exhibition includes many examples, which themselves provide a kind of pictorial view of changes in the nature of American capitalism.The trains and steam engines of the 19th century gave way to sometimes amusingly anachronistic allegorical figures (like a 1936 Foringer vignette showing a woman in neo-Classical drapery holding a telephone); in turn those gave way to a style Mr. Tomasko calls \u201ccapitalist realism.\u201d The 1986 certificate for the Great American Savings Bank shown here features a quartet of ordinary workers by the artist Robert Lavin, including what Mr. Tomasko said was probably the first image of an African-American professional used on a financial instrument.The stock market boom of the 1980s and \u201990s was good for the picture engraving business. But other shifts in the economy \u2014 including the rise of the tech-company-heavy Nasdaq exchange, which did not require engravings \u2014 finally caught up. In 2001, the New York Stock Exchange dropped its engraving requirements, dealing what Mr. Tomasko called \u201ca final blow\u201d to nongovernmental security engraving in the United States.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a company that issued a stock certificate given to Mr. Tomasko by his grandmother. It is the Marmon Motor Car Company, not Merman.Advertisement"}

Rockefeller.The resulting book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d was published in 1937 and became a self-help guide for everyday Americans seeking great wealth.Mr. Hill tried to convince his readers \u2014 many of them emotionally and financially battered by the Great Depression \u2014 that with the right attitude they, too, could amass a fortune.\u201cOne must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes first did a certain amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, desiring and planning before they acquired money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Eighty years later, Mr. Hill\u2019s egalitarian notions seem to ring hollow on many levels. There is a troublingly wide gap between the economic fortunes of the rich and the poor \u2014 an inequality that has helped unleash political populism in Europe and the United States. (Ironically, President Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire, rode that resentment to the White House.)The idea that the secret to great wealth comes from a combination of discipline, perseverance and belief in yourself sounds Pollyannaish in an era of widespread disillusionment with how the economy and society actually works.Indeed, the chance of becoming a billionaire remains incredibly slim. Wealth-X, a research firm that tracks global wealth, said there were 2,473 billionaires in 2015, an increase of 148 from the year before and about 0.00003 percent of the world\u2019s 7.3 billion people.Still, an optimist like Mr. Hill, who died in 1970, might take heart in one data point from Wealth-X: More than half of the world\u2019s billionaires are self-made.And that number is increasing. Self-made billionaires represent 57 percent of total billionaire wealth, or more than $4.3 trillion, a figure that was up 7 percent from 2014. Meanwhile, the number of billionaires with inherited wealth \u2014 323, according to Wealth-X \u2014 fell by 29 percent from 2014.The booming technology sector has minted many of the recent self-made titans \u2014 entrepreneurs like Travis Kalanick, a co-founder and the chief executive of Uber, and the co-founders of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk.\u201cMany people have great ideas. But to grow an idea into a huge business is a different matter,\u201d said Maya Imberg, custom research director at Wealth-X. \u201cBillionaires tend to be incredibly focused.\u201dIn his book, Mr. Hill tried to show that qualities like focus and perseverance were within everyone.He told the story of how Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he perfected the incandescent electric light bulb and how Henry Ford pushed his engineers to develop the V-8 motor despite the technical challenges.\u201cA thousand people could be pointed out who have a better education than Ford\u2019s, yet they live in poverty because they do not possess the right plan for the accumulation of money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Wealth-X is the big data equivalent to Mr. Hill\u2019s one-man reporting project. The firm employs about 150 researchers across the world who collect and analyze data about the richest people.Based on that data, you may have a slightly better chance of becoming a billionaire if you went to Harvard, which was the most popular school among billionaires by a wide margin. (Stanford came in second.)Engineering degrees were the most popular among billionaires, followed by business, according to Approved Index, another firm that researches the wealthy. There are some notable billionaires with humanities degrees, like the financier Carl Icahn, who majored in philosophy at Princeton. Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has a teaching degree.It is well known that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft dropped out of Harvard to start their businesses. But they are not alone. About 30 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires never obtain a college degree.\u201cIt is counterintuitive to what you are told growing up,\u201d said Grace Garland, head of research at Approved Index.If the sheer numbers are any guide, your chances of becoming a billionaire as a woman are especially remote. In 2015, 140 of the 148 people who broke into the billionaire ranks were men. All of the top 10 billionaires are men, according to Wealth-X.And yet for all the male-dominated, Ivy League exclusivity of the billionaire\u2019s club, self-help gurus and ordinary people continue to pore over the biographies and public statements of the ultrawealthy, looking for the secret sauce.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, and the investor Warren E. Buffett are said to be avid readers. Mr. Gates once said that \u201creading is still the main way that I both learn new things and test my understanding.\u201dMr. Collins said many of these wealthy men had parents who helped them to succeed.Mr. Gates\u2019 parents arranged for him to take time off from classes during his senior year in high school to work on code for the electrical grid management system at a local power plant.Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of Virgin Group, said his father, a lawyer, taught him the importance of dreaming big and instilled in him a desire for excellence.Mr. Collins said that while he was growing up in Australia, his father made him read \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d and taught him how to think about making money in different ways to accumulate wealth.\u201cThe people who say that entrepreneurs are born, that is ridiculous. They are made,\u201d he said.\u201cYou need grit and unwavering personal confidence. Those are nonnegotiable in a billionaire,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Fed Officials Support Moving Faster to Raise Interest Rate", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The American economy appears to be avoiding the kind of winter swoon that has become an annual event in recent years, a turn for the better that could encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising its benchmark interest rate sooner.But the minutes stopped short of suggesting a rate increase was likely at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in mid-March. They said that a core group of Fed officials remained cautious about the economic outlook, seeing balanced risks of faster and slower economic growth.The minutes of the Fed meeting, published after a standard three-week delay, portrayed an economy that appears to be gaining strength, although it is still far from booming. The unemployment rate was little changed in the last year, standing at 4.8 percent in January, even as the economy added an average of 190,000 jobs a month in the second half of 2016, indicating that more people were returning to work.The minutes also cited \u201ca high level of optimism\u201d among business executives, which was attributed to \u201cthe expectation that firms would benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policy.\u201d For the most part, however, companies were still waiting for Washington. Although a few companies had reported increased capital spending, the minutes said that most, \u201cwhile optimistic, intended to wait for more clarity about federal policy initiatives before adjusting their capital spending and hiring.\u201dFinancial markets also remained calm. Things were so quiet that some Fed officials had turned to fretting about the lack of excitement. By some measures, financial conditions are easier now than before the Fed raised its benchmark rate in December.Some officials worried, the minutes said, that \u201cthe low level of implied volatility in equity markets appeared inconsistent with the considerable uncertainty attending the outlook.\u201dIn recent weeks, investors have assessed the Fed as more likely to raise rates in the first half of the year, although the chances that it will do so at its next meeting, in March, remain low.\u201cIt\u2019s not obvious that \u2018fairly soon\u2019 means March,\u201d said Samuel D. Coffin, an economist at UBS. He said that the Fed was \u201cgrowing gradually more confident in its economic expectations\u201d but that there was little sign of urgency in the account of the meeting.The minutes portrayed some of the 12 presidents of regional reserve banks as increasingly ready to move faster on rates. But the minutes also indicated that the voting members \u2014 five governors and five of the presidents \u2014 felt less urgency. That core group appeared to remain committed to \u201cgradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.\u201dPatrick T. Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and one of the voters this year, said in a speech Tuesday that his outlook had not changed.\u201cGiven the state of the economy \u2014 more or less back to normal \u2014 I continue to see three modest rate hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track,\u201d Mr. Harker said. He added, however, that a March increase remained possible.One major question is whether the labor force will continue to grow. Some officials see room for stronger economic growth to continue pulling people into the work force: The share of American adults between 25 and 54 who are working or seeking work remains low by historical standards. But other Fed officials contend that the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign has reached its limit. They worry that maintaining low interest rates could drive unemployment down to an unsustainable level and lead to more inflation.The minutes said the Trump administration\u2019s economic plans had injected \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d into the business of forecasting economic growth. But Fed officials have emphasized that they will wait to see what happens before adjusting their plans.The Fed also announced a few housekeeping changes, primarily of interest to its close watchers. Fed officials are now prohibited from speaking about monetary policy for 10 days before a policy-making meeting, rather than one week. The Fed also said it would expand the information provided with its quarterly economic forecasts to include an illustration of the uncertainty surrounding the projections.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justin Trudeau, Facing Pressure to Oppose Donald Trump, Opts to Get Along", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Just over a year after he became prime minister with promises of inclusion, optimism and internationalism, Justin Trudeau unexpectedly finds himself dealing with a mercurial American president who largely rejects those values.President Donald J. Trump\u2019s personal style and policies are widely disliked by Canadians, including, according to Mr. Trudeau\u2019s inner circle, Mr. Trudeau himself. But sometimes gall must be swallowed. Mr. Trudeau swiftly turned the machinery of Canada\u2019s government toward finding a way to get along with Mr. Trump.Mr. Trudeau dispatched top advisers, including his principal secretary and onetime college roommate Gerald Butts, to meet with officials in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle, among them Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist.And for further help, he pulled in Andrew Leslie, a Liberal member of Parliament and a retired lieutenant general who received the United States\u2019 Legion of Merit for his work with the American military.All the while, Mr. Trudeau has been under pressure at home to be the world\u2019s voice against a president who has already insulted or belittled an array of nations. Those Canadians are likely to be disappointed.Mr. Trudeau may feel he has little choice. Canada is too closely entwined with its immense neighbor \u2014 economically, militarily, diplomatically and in countless other ways \u2014 to risk the development of serious friction.So while Mr. Trudeau continues to promote his political values to Canadians, he and his cabinet ministers have been careful not to criticize Mr. Trump directly. It is a situation that faces the leaders of other American allies, but none have nearly as much to lose as Canada does \u2014 and none may have a leader as completely opposite to Mr. Trump in manner and belief.\u201cI am really proud that today Canada is standing for the open society and that we\u2019re open to immigration, we\u2019re open to refugees, whatever their faith; those are not necessarily popular national values in the world,\u201d Ms. Freeland said in her corner office in Canada\u2019s neo-Gothic Parliament buildings. She added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we would ever want to be sanctimonious, or behave as if we have everything figured out and we\u2019re in a position to lecture other people on how to behave.\u201dA case study on how Mr. Trudeau is tiptoeing on the balance beam came after President Trump\u2019s orders temporarily barring people from seven Muslim countries and all refugees. It did not play well in Canada, where its open doors to refugees and immigrants are a point of national pride.At news conferences, Mr. Trudeau, who describes himself as a feminist, is often asked if Mr. Trump is a misogynist. His response is always similar. \u201cIt is not the job of a Canadian prime minister to opine on the American electoral process,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said last month in Calgary, Alberta. \u201cIt is the job of the Canadian prime minister to have a constructive working relationship with the president of the United States.\u201dWhile other prime ministers grappled with American presidents who were unpopular among Canadians, the current situation has few direct parallels. Especially jarring to Canada is the new administration\u2019s promise to revamp key components of Canada\u2019s economy, like the North American Free Trade Agreement; threats to tighten the border; and demand for drastic increases in military spending by allies.\u201cWe\u2019re not very well organized for a knife fight in Canada,\u201d said John Higginbotham, a senior fellow at Carleton University in Ottawa who served as the second-highest-ranking Canadian diplomat in Washington for six years. \u201cIt\u2019s the most worrying thing seen in Canada-U.S. relations during my 35-year career.\u201dIt is difficult to overstate the importance of Canada\u2019s relationship with the United States. About 2.5 million Canadian jobs are tied directly to trade with the United States, which accounts for about one quarter of Canada\u2019s gross domestic product.Unlike many other countries, Canada has received some positive signals from the Trump administration. On Thursday, Ms. Freeland received a call from Rex W. Tillerson during his first day on the job as secretary of state.\u201cHe told me that the conversation he had with me was the first conversation he had with any foreign official,\u201d Ms. Freeland said. \u201cAnd he said that was very intentional.\u201dLast month Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet met with Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, who heads a group of business leaders advising Mr. Trump on economic issues.After the meeting, Mr. Schwarzman offered soothing words. \u201cCanada is held in very high regard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have balanced trade between the U.S. and Canada, and that\u2019s not the kind of situation where you should be worrying.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump promised to reopen Nafta, which opened up commerce between the United States, Mexico and Canada, Mr. Trudeau said he welcomed any negotiations. Canada, too, has concerns about the trade deal, and Ms. Freeland said that by her count, 11 substantial changes had already been made to Nafta.But if Mr. Trump reopens Nafta to limit the flow of Mexican goods to the United States, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government may have to weigh protecting its trade relationship with the United States against standing up for Mexico\u2019s free-trade status \u2014 and implicitly its support of the principle of open commerce.If it comes down to that, Mr. Higginbotham predicts that Canada will abandon Mexico \u201cin a minute.\u201dThe Trudeau government contends its approach is working. Ms. Freeland noted that the government\u2019s early efforts to make contact with the Trump administration allowed it to swiftly confirm that dual citizens of Canada and countries blocked by the executive order on immigration would still be able to cross the border.\u201cBecause we had been talking to the administration for some time, there were people who we could call,\u201d she said.When it comes to dealing with Washington, Canadian prime ministers have a potentially powerful tool unavailable to other leaders, said Michael Bliss, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Toronto. In addition to the Canadian Embassy in Washington, Ms. Freeland also commands 14 other diplomatic posts and trade missions throughout the United States. They regularly remind governors, mayors and members of Congress that Canada is the largest export market for 38 American states, making free trade in America\u2019s best interest as well.\u201cWe carry on relations with Americans in every room in the house,\u201d Professor Bliss said.When asked if those allies would make a difference when dealing with a novice president whose advisers for the most part reject America\u2019s political establishment, Ms. Freeland paused.\u201cI come from outside traditional politics, too,\u201d said Ms. Freeland, who has been a journalist and executive at several news organizations in Canada, Europe and the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this new administration is going to operate yet.\u201d (Ms. Freeland is married to Graham Bowley, a reporter for The New York Times.)What seems more certain is that Mr. Trudeau and his government will be fighting a steady march of cross-border fires. Already it is working to quash proposals to require Canadians to give fingerprints or undergo facial recognition scans every time they enter or leave the United States. With more than 400,000 people crossing that border daily, Canada fears that could cause cross-border travel gridlock and hamper trade.But Professor Bliss said the current situation between the two countries is probably without a direct parallel.\u201cThe Canadian political class is well aware that we\u2019re in very serious times,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to get it wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Set Sights on Blocking Trump\u2019s Labor Secretary Pick", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Thursday, Democrats will have their best chance to topple one of President Trump\u2019s cabinet choices when Andrew F. Puzder testifies before the Senate to become the country\u2019s next labor secretary.\u201cThey ought to withdraw the nomination of Puzder before he further embarrasses this administration and further exposes the hypocrisy of President Trump,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.Signs of the fast-food restaurant executive\u2019s vulnerability have been swirling in recent weeks as his hearing was delayed several times because of the complexity of his vast financial portfolio, including millions of dollars in preferred stock in the parent company of Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr., CKE. Protesters have swarmed those fast-food restaurants across the country to express outrage that the person chosen to look out for America\u2019s wage workers has a record of fighting for owners\u2019 interests. On Thursday, more than a thousand federal contractors are planning to converge on the Capitol to demonstrate in opposition to Mr. Puzder.Mr. Jealous said Republicans should remember that Mr. Trump promised to protect working-class Americans, adding, \u201cIf the G.O.P. in the Senate want to guarantee that he keeps his promise, then Puzder should not be confirmed.\u201dThe proceedings are also likely to get personal. Opponents of Mr. Puzder have made his contentious divorce from nearly three decades ago an issue, surfacing since-recanted allegations from his former wife that he abused her in the 1980s.According to the records, the encounter caused \u201cbruises and contusions to the chest, back, shoulders and neck,\u201d two ruptured disks, two bulging disks and \u201csevere and permanent damage.\u201dGeorge Thompson, a spokesman for Mr. Puzder, said on Tuesday evening that the contents of the filing were not new and that Mr. Puzder and his former wife are now friends. He called the release a smear campaign.\u201cPerpetuating these retracted 30-year-old allegations and an impulsive decision to appear on a talk show is nothing more than a desperate attempt to tarnish Andy Puzder at the expense of Lisa and their family,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.The allegations that Mr. Puzder had assaulted his former wife have been circulating around in Congress, where lawmakers of both parties gathered in the past week for screenings of a 1990 episode of the \u201cOprah Winfrey Show\u201d in which Mr. Puzder\u2019s former spouse appeared in disguise to discuss her story of abuse. The Oprah Winfrey Network has not made the video publicly available \u2014 it provided a special copy for senators \u2014 but discussion of the old footage has been buzzing among senators and congressional staff members ahead of the hearing.\u201cIt really raised some very troubling issues and I think has to be the equation of how we view this candidate,\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in an interview Tuesday.The effect of the tape remains unclear. Four Republican senators on the committee \u2014 Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 have not committed to backing Mr. Puzder.Ms. Collins said on Monday that she was \u201creviewing the other information that has come to light\u201d and that she looked forward to exploring it at the hearing. Mr. Scott said that he wanted to see how Mr. Puzder performed in person before making a decision. However, he acknowledged that he had concerns about Mr. Puzder\u2019s failure to pay taxes on an undocumented housekeeper.Although Mr. Puzder is not the first of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to fail to pay taxes or employ an undocumented immigrant, critics say that the oversights are particularly egregious for a businessman who would lead the Labor Department. Ms. Murray said that the revelation about Mr. Puzder\u2019s housekeeper, which emerged only last week, was ironic considering Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to crack down on illegal immigration.Despite all of the criticism of Mr. Puzder, whose brash personality is sometimes compared to Mr. Trump\u2019s, most Republicans and members of the business world have rallied around him.State restaurant groups in Maine and Alaska have sent letters to Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski to express support for Mr. Puzder, hailing him as an experienced job creator. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to lawmakers arguing that Mr. Puzder\u2019s executive experience would make him less likely to impose onerous regulations.\u201cHe will know better than any other secretary the impact that the department\u2019s actions have on companies and the economy,\u201d wrote Neil Bradley, the group\u2019s chief policy officer.Even Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, emerged from the sidelines this week to urge Republicans to stick with Mr. Puzder. Pointing to the nominee\u2019s humble beginnings, Mr. Romney said he was certain that Mr. Puzder could relate to the plight of regular workers.If Democrats are unsuccessful at blocking Mr. Puzder at the committee on Thursday, it will not be their final opportunity to pick off one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top nominees. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, who has been tapped to be the White House\u2019s budget director, is expected to get a vote on Thursday from the full Senate.Mr. McCain described Mr. Mulvaney as \u201canti-defense\u201d on Tuesday while he lamented his vote to remove troops from Afghanistan. The margin of error for Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s confirmation appeared to have narrowed.\u201cI\u2019m voting against him \u2014 most likely,\u201d Mr. McCain said.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fewer Niceties, Similar Price: Airlines Turn to \u2018Basic Economy\u2019 Fares", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen is a new, budget offering actually a hidden increase in overall cost? When the airline industry introduces new economy fares.Over the last week, United Airlines and American Airlines joined Delta Air Lines in starting or announcing plans for a \u201cbasic economy\u201d fare option geared toward bargain travelers.For these major airlines, a \u201cbasic economy\u201d ticket means the airline will transport travelers where they want to go. Most everything else, though, costs extra, ending many of the remaining niceties provided by large commercial carriers.Gone is the ability to choose a seat free. (Hello, middle seat!) Upgrade or refund under the new fare? Forget it. And, under some airline rules, do not even think about putting a suitcase into an overhead bin without paying.Something else travelers do not always get with the basic economy fare: an actual price discount.While airlines are loath to discuss pricing, the new basic economy class seats are expected to be in many cases the same price as the standard economy fare, meaning travelers will get less for the same price.Instead, the old-fashioned economy ticket \u2014 the one with the niceties \u2014 is expected to cost more.\u201cYeah, the same product is going to be more expensive,\u201d said George Hobica, the president of Airfarewatchdog.com. \u201cIt\u2019s like they were saying you were getting an introductory offer and that they were giving it away, but no longer.\u201dThe one upside? Basic economy travelers will still get soda and mini pretzels \u2014 for now.For United, which began offering basic economy fares this week from the Minneapolis-St. Paul region to its seven hubs, a round-trip flight on May 9 from Minneapolis to Denver under the standard economy fare will cost $176. The new basic economy fare for the same flight will be $136.Basic economy travelers will not be allowed to choose their seats or carry on a bag, so they would have to pay $25 each way to check their bags, raising the price of the basic economy fare round trip to $186. And basic economy fare passengers who try to sneak bags on board will be charged the $25 bag check-in fee plus a $25 gate-handling charge.In other words, the standard economy ticket, the one expected to rise in price, may end up being a better deal in some cases than the new basic economy ticket.A United spokesman said that customers willing to accept the basic economy restrictions should have lower overall travel costs. A spokeswoman for Delta, which introduced basic economy fares in 2013, said in a statement that basic economy travelers were not permitted to choose their seats and that families may not be able to sit together, but that the fare \u201chas never included a fee for carry-on baggage and that remains true today.\u201dOver all, the airlines have argued they are merely giving customers what they want as demonstrated by the robust growth of low-cost, no-frills airlines like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant. These airlines typically charge lower fares but often charge many additional fees. For instance, the same Minneapolis-to-Denver flight on May 9 on Frontier is a bargain at $88 round trip.Frontier, though, charges travelers $6 on each flight to choose their seats, and $30 to $35 each way for larger carry-on bags. The fees are higher if the upgrades are made at the airport.The low-cost airlines \u2014 which have lower legacy and labor costs than large airlines and have historically flown into smaller airports with smaller landing fees, are increasingly taking on the big airlines on their own home-turf hubs.In 2011, Spirit flew to three cities from the American Airlines hub in Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Today, Spirit flies to 25 cities, Robert Isom, the president of American, said in a letter to employees last month announcing the basic economy options that would be available for travel starting March 1 for 10 routes, including Fort Lauderdale to Philadelphia and Miami to New Orleans.Pointing to aircraft orders from Spirit and other airlines as signs of continued growth, Mr. Isom concluded that, for American, \u201ccompeting aggressively against these airlines is not optional.\u201dAn article on Friday about more airlines\u2019 using basic economy class seats misstated, in some copies, when Robert Isom, the president of American Airlines, sent a letter to employees announcing new such fare options. The letter was sent last month, not last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Wants More American Cars in Japan. Japan\u2019s Drivers Don\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Yoshihiro Masui\u2019s growling Ford hot-rod, its sides adorned with the Stars and Stripes, attests to his love of American cars \u2014 an unusual passion in Japan, where Toyota, Honda and other domestic brands rule the roads.\u201cJapanese cars don\u2019t break down, but they\u2019re boring,\u201d said Mr. Masui, 67, a semiretired music producer. Besides the hot-rod \u2014 a replica Model T with a racecar\u2019s engine \u2014 he owns a gleaming white Ford Thunderbird, the latest of nearly 70 Detroit-made vehicles he figures he has bought and sold over the years.\u201cYou definitely stand out,\u201d he said.Detroit pines for a day when the sight of an American car on a Japanese street is not so notable.Even as Japanese cars have taken a wide portion of the United States market, American brands are barely visible in Japan, a situation that has long frustrated American auto executives and trade negotiators and has become a renewed source of political friction under President Trump.Mr. Trump accuses Japan of shutting American producers out, by throwing up regulatory barriers and rigging the currency market in favor of Japanese brands. \u201cThey do things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan,\u201d he said in a meeting with American executives last month.To the Japanese, Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations about trade barriers can seem bizarre.\u201cOf course American cars don\u2019t sell in Japan,\u201d said Mr. Masui, whose admiration for American vehicles does not extend to their manufacturers\u2019 marketing strategies.\u201cAmerican cars have a bad image \u2014 they aren\u2019t fuel-efficient, they break down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really true anymore, but dealers don\u2019t make an effort to convince people. I\u2019ve never seen a TV commercial. You go to a car show, they\u2019re not there.\u201dThe cars are certainly not on the streets. Of the nearly five million cars and light trucks sold in Japan last year, just 15,000 were American, or 0.3 percent. Toyota sells more vehicles at a single mega-dealership in California.Masato Suzuki manages a car dealership in Machida, a suburb west of Tokyo, that specializes in American imports. His lot is lined with hulking Lincoln Navigator S.U.V.s, full-size commercial vans and muscle cars like Dodge Chargers and Ford Mustangs. These are the sort of American vehicles that people buy in Japan, when they buy them at all. He says his customers are overwhelmingly men.\u201cI mean this affectionately, but they\u2019re a bit unusual,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose we\u2019re a bit unusual to sell these cars, too.\u201dMr. Suzuki\u2019s dealership, Glide, opened 24 years ago, when Detroit\u2019s reputation for quality was at a low. \u201cThe cars broke down all the time. Customers were always angry at us,\u201d he said. Glide has since opened two branches, but they deal only in European cars, which are more popular in Japan.Mr. Suzuki said he would like to expand his offerings to smaller, more budget-friendly American vehicles \u2014 the kind that are the staple of Japan\u2019s own auto industry, and which most Japanese drive. But he doesn\u2019t think they would sell.Ingrained skepticism about American cars\u2019 reliability and fuel efficiency is one problem. Another is price. Mr. Suzuki said he did not know whether Japan was deliberately weakening the yen, as Mr. Trump claims, but he agrees with the American president that a stronger Japanese currency is better for American car sales.When the yen soared after the 2008 global financial crisis, making imports cheaper for Japanese buyers, Glide was importing about 100 vehicles a month. Now, with the yen weaker again, it brings in only one-tenth as many.\u201cMost of the time, for the same money, a Japanese car is a better deal,\u201d he said.Defenders of Japan\u2019s trade practices note that Japan imposes no border taxes on cars, whereas the United States adds a 2.5 percent tariff to Japanese imports. And they point to the relative success of European brands. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and others have captured about 6 percent of the Japanese market, mostly at the luxury end.\u201cGerman cars are popular in Japan, but American cars hardly sell at all,\u201d Akio Mimura, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said at a news conference this month. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to sell cars in Japan, it\u2019s obvious that they need to make an effort to appeal to Japanese customers.\u201dYet, even European carmakers complain that the Japanese market can be tough going, with taxes, safety standards and other rules that they think favor domestic producers. Negotiators for the European Union are pressing Japan on such structural issues in talks over a proposed trade accord.An example is headlights. In many countries, it is standard practice for drivers to keep their headlights on during the day, for safety reasons. Many cars\u2019 daytime running lights switch on automatically as soon as the engine is started.Japan, though, took the opposite approach for years: Keeping headlights on during the day was illegal. That meant foreign carmakers had to disable the automatic feature on cars they exported to Japan, an extra production stop that added to costs.Kenji Kobayashi, executive director of the Japan Automobile Importers Association, which represents foreign car companies in Japan, says structural barriers are lower than they used to be. Japan scrapped the prohibition on daytime running lights last year, after negotiations with the association.It is also reducing the tax advantages it gives to a category of microcars known as kei cars, which account for about a third of domestic sales and are made only by Japanese automakers. The change is making a difference: Kei sales dropped 9 percent last year.Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to trade is arguably slowing progress.Mr. Kobayashi sees a difference between European and American efforts to woo Japanese car buyers. European brands advertise aggressively and have done more to customize their products for Japan, for instance by producing right-hand-drive versions of their vehicles \u2014 a seemingly obvious selling point, in a country where the driving lane is on the left, that American producers have long been criticized for ignoring.The best-selling American brand in Japan is Jeep, which last year accounted for close to half of all American auto sales there. It offers right-hand-drive vehicles \u2014 a legacy of the customized delivery vehicles it once made for the United States Postal Service, which let drivers step out onto American curbs instead of the road.Catching up to the Europeans would require investments that American carmakers are increasingly reluctant to make, Mr. Kobayashi said. Ford scrapped its small dealer network last year, and is focusing in China.\u201cChina is big and growing, and foreign brands are putting their efforts there,\u201d Mr. Kobayashi said.Mr. Masui, the car collector with the souped-up Model T, says he loves \u201ceverything about America before the 1960s \u2014 cars, furniture, music, everything.\u201d He might well get along with President Trump. But he says American automakers should stop complaining about trade barriers and focus on more basic tasks: making attractive cars and persuading people to buy them.\u201cMr. Trump is interesting,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what he says about cars is just weird.\u201dA picture caption with an article on Friday about the difficulties of selling American cars in Japan referred incorrectly to a quotation. As the article correctly noted, the source of the quotation was President Trump, not Yoshihiro Masui, a Japanese enthusiast of American cars, and Mr. Trump said that Japan, not Detroit, does things that \u201cmake it impossible\u201d for United States automakers to sell cars in Japan.Advertisement"}

Her work as a school admissions director wasn\u2019t fulfilling. And she lived in Rochester, where companies like Eastman Kodak and Xerox have shed thousands of well-paying jobs.But after quitting her job and spending time in Mexico, Ms. Callens had a career epiphany.\u201cMy college degree was also in hospitality,\u201d said Ms. Callens, 52. \u201cAnd nursing is hospitality with sharp objects.\u201dMs. Callens happily graduated last December and will soon be a neurological nurse. She will work in the Rochester hospital unit where her husband was treated.Reinventing a career is always a nerve-racking journey. But for people who, like Ms. Callens, are in their 40s and 50s, making a change, especially in the Rust Belt, can be daunting. Assessing job opportunities, doing some smart skill-matching and getting technical training can help speed the process, experts said.It is also worth noting that Rust Belt cities like Rochester and Cleveland are rapidly reinventing themselves as health care hubs, creating new kinds of work.So sizing up the current job market is essential, said Jean Setzfand, senior vice president for programs at AARP. \u201cThen look at the skill sets you\u2019ve gained and do a matching game.\u201dAfter helping pilot a crumbling business in the Cleveland area for years, Toby Coss, 45, needed a change. He had spent 16 years working at a manufacturing company. Though he liked being a manager, declining profits meant that he was continually laying off workers, a process that was taking a psychological toll.The low point came when he had to close a plant in Mississippi, discharging 170 employees.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do that ever again,\u201d said Mr. Coss, a trained quality engineer. \u201cIt was disheartening.\u201dHe knew that he didn\u2019t want to move or return to being a quality engineer. But Mr. Coss did like running plants. Then he saw a Fastsigns franchise, which makes signs and graphics, for sale in 2014. That was a fit. \u201cI had some familiarity with graphics,\u201d he said, and his management experience would prove especially useful.That is another key to successful reinvention, Ms. Setzfand said: leaning on hard-won skills.\u201cStart with a cleareyed analysis,\u201d said Dorie Clark, author of \u201cReinventing You.\u201d \u201cInclude what you\u2019re good at, care about and can make money in.\u201dTrends can change fast and unpredictably when chasing hot careers, she added, so it is important to show that \u201cyou\u2019re adaptable to the times.\u201d Use every available resource \u2014 including social media like Twitter and LinkedIn \u2014 to signal your technology expertise to hiring managers.This is not to underplay how valuable in-person connections are.\u201cOne guy built a brand by starting a local meet-up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re that person in Gary, Ind., creating your own meet-up groups, you\u2019ll get credit and respect.\u201dBut digital skill gaps are creating lots of work opportunities, Ms. Setzfand said. According to IDC, a market research analyst, digital inefficiencies in the American workplace cause a 20 percent loss in worker productivity and cost the economy $1.3 trillion a year.\u201cEven if you\u2019re not in a smart hub,\u201d Ms. Setzfand said, \u201cevery company has a need for technology employees.\u201d One example, she said, is Quicken Loans in Detroit, which has a great appetite for coders and others with tech skills.\u201cIt was a great opportunity to make a career switch,\u201d said Mr. Blume, who lives in Champaign, Ill., with his wife and son. \u201cAnd music and algorithms aren\u2019t that far apart.\u201dSwitching to technology, he said, also gave him greater financial stability, higher pay and more job opportunities.\u201cWhen I was in music, a day\u2019s work was never enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to do more to stay ahead.\u201d Now, he works 40 hours a week. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done with my workday, I can think about music again.\u201dGoing back to school, Mr. Blume said, was the hardest part. He was older than the instructor and most students, which required some adjusting. Ms. Callens, who also took classes with younger students, had the same experience. \u201cThey all called me Mom,\u201d she said.Ms. Callens was challenged by learning to use technology like PowerPoint, rather than a paper notebook, and spending every spare moment on schoolwork. \u201cThere was no social life,\u201d she said.But she believes that she has a gift for comforting people at the end of their lives, a desired quality in her profession.\u201cI\u2019m aligned now with my career,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel complete.

Evercore, Greenhill and Lazard, which reported estimates-beating earnings on Thursday, proved their resilience last year by weathering a choppy environment better than most big bank rivals. Continued success, though, requires confident clients. And they are looking for President Trump and Congress to ensure that happens.The next few months should be relatively strong as financial advisers work through deals already announced in recent months and chief executives consider acting after the bounce in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index since the election. That should help fees stay around the decent levels of the second half of 2016 rather than dipping back to the more disappointing first half of the year.The poor start last year contributed to annual mergers and acquisitions revenue dropping at all the American mega-banks except Morgan Stanley. Lazard\u2019s advisory top line picked up almost 2 percent, while Evercore\u2019s and Greenhill\u2019s both jumped by more than 25 percent.Three issues make chief executives bullish at present: the prospect of the corporate tax rate being cut to as low as 15 percent from 35 percent; the boost to the American economy from Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure; and the belief that deregulation is in the cards. These ought to bolster output, spending, earnings and, as a result, the desire to strike deals.The chaos of the first two weeks of the Trump administration is starting to cast some doubts, however. For example, the president and Congress don\u2019t see eye to eye on some of the more complex parts of tax reform. That could delay any proposal, perhaps into 2018, an election year. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban, his calls for border tariffs and his aggressive, off-the-cuff approach to international diplomacy also risk undermining the ebullience in corporate boardrooms.If Washington can\u2019t get its better deals done, mergers and acquisitions bankers could very well miss out on theirs.Advertisement"}

But it\u2019s worse than that: The Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) has systematically infiltrated China\u2019s expanding private sector and now operates inside more than half of all nonstate firms; it can manipulate or even control these companies, especially bigger ones, and some foreign ones, too. The modern Chinese economy is a party-corporate conglomerate.It all began in 1927. After the communists\u2019 fledging armed forces suffered serious losses against the Kuomintang government, Mao Zedong and his associates decided to create a hierarchy within the military that would mirror the structure of the party. The idea was to instill a fighting spirit throughout the ranks by ensuring the party\u2019s top commands would be relayed all the way down. Party branches (\u9ee8\u59d4) were set up at the company level, party cells (\u9ee8\u5c0f\u7d44) at the platoon and squad levels, and together they recruited foot soldiers who were solid party material. In just a few years, an unruly peasant army was whipped into a formidable fighting force. The rest is history.Consider the implications. For example: A foreign firm employs a Chinese senior manager, giving him access to its proprietary technology; he is also a member of the C.C.P. and the firm\u2019s party unit. One day his party superior orders him to transfer a trade secret from the firm to a local rival. In the name of party and country, he can only comply.In other words, the problem isn\u2019t just that the Chinese economy isn\u2019t a market economy in that the government won\u2019t let it operate freely enough. Its very structure, including in the private sector, has been designed \u2014 and is redesigned, again and again \u2014 to serve the C.C.P.\u2019s will and its interests, economic and political. This party-corporate complex is only going to expand as most state-owned enterprises, inefficient holdovers from the old economy, are being supplanted by the fast-growing private sector.Yi-Zheng Lian is a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Conservative Climate Solution\u2019: Republican Group Calls for Carbon Tax", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group of Republican elder statesmen is calling for a tax on carbon emissions to fight climate change.The group, led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, with former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former secretary of the Treasury, says that taxing carbon pollution produced by burning fossil fuels is \u201ca conservative climate solution\u201d based on free-market principles.Mr. Baker is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, Jared Kushner, the senior adviser to the president, and Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, as well as Ivanka Trump.In an interview, Mr. Baker said that the plan followed classic conservative principles of free-market solutions and small government. He suggested that even former President Ronald Reagan would have blessed the plan: \u201cI\u2019m not at all sure the Gipper wouldn\u2019t have been very happy with this.\u201d He said he had no idea how the proposal would be received by the current White House or Congress.The Baker proposal would substitute the carbon tax for the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, a complex set of rules to regulate emissions which President Trump has pledged to repeal and which is tied up in court challenges, as well as other climate regulations. At an initial price of $40 per ton of carbon dioxide produced, the tax would raise an estimated $200 billion to $300 billion a year, with the rate scheduled to rise over time.The tax would be collected where the fossil fuels enter the economy, such as the mine, well or port; the money raised would be returned to consumers in what the group calls a \u201ccarbon dividend\u201d amounting to an estimated $2,000 a year for the average family of four.The plan would also incorporate what are known as \u201cborder adjustments\u201d to increase the costs for products from other countries that do not have a similar system in place, an idea intended to address the problem of other \u201cfree-rider\u201d nations gaining a price advantage over carbon-taxed domestic goods. The proposal would also insulate fossil fuel companies against possible lawsuits over the damage their products have caused to the environment.Attacks on the plan can be expected from many quarters, even among supporters of a carbon tax in theory. Supporters of the Clean Power Plan are likely to oppose its repeal. Democrats also tend to oppose limitations on the right to sue like those envisioned in the Baker proposal. And the idea of a dividend will no doubt anger those in the environmental movement who would prefer to see the money raised by the tax used to promote renewable energy and other new technologies to reduce emissions.Whatever the fate of the plan, it is a notable moment because it puts influential members of the Republican establishment on the record as favoring action on climate change \u2014 a position that is publicly held by few Republicans at the national level, though many quietly say they would like to throw off the orthodoxy in the party that opposes action.Some popular environmentalists take stands that those on the right can never embrace, Mr. Halstead said, citing the works of Naomi Klein, who attacks capitalism itself as the root of climate change. \u201cThat is so at odds with the conservative worldview, of course they\u2019re going to walk away,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way for this solution to come about is if it gets a start on the right.\u201dThe other co-authors of the memo include N. Gregory Mankiw and Martin Feldstein, former chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Rob Walton, the former chairman of Wal-Mart.Mr. Baker said it was time for the Republican Party to engage in the discussion of global warming beyond simple denial.\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we Republicans have a seat at the table when people start talking about climate change,\u201d Mr. Baker said. He said that, like many Republicans, he was skeptical that human activity was the main cause of warming, but that the stakes were too high for inaction. \u201cI don\u2019t accept the idea that it\u2019s all man made,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I do accept that the risks are sufficiently great that we need to have an insurance policy.\u201dAs for the likelihood of success of his plan, \u201cI have no idea what the prospects are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nice, but for These Investors, Conscience Matters More", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSeth Holehouse, who owns an auction house in New York City, has focused his investments on renewable energy and recycled products. He has done so for the last five years \u2014 despite steadily losing money on the strategy.It is passion, not profit, that guides him. And he is not about to let up. Instead, he is prepared to keep losing money in the near term with the expectation of gains down the road.\u201cWe\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d he said. \u201cThis philosophy is how we\u2019d like to invest in 20 years.\u201dInvesting with a guiding passion isn\u2019t the same as being an impact investor, who aims to effect social change while earning a solid return. Passion investing is purer \u2014 if not puritanical. And seeing how people who embrace it deploy their strategies shows just how hard it is to follow a passion in investing without some level of compromise.Its better-known cousin, impact investing, tends to attract people who are pragmatic. They are looking for the best possible investment in a sector, based on established criteria.In terms of its volume of greenhouse emissions, for example, a consumer packaging company will most likely score much higher among environmentalists than every company in the oil and gas sector. But a certain type of impact investor might look for the oil and gas company that has improved its business practices the most or is as environmentally responsible and progressive as such a company can be.Instead of swearing off whole sectors, this type of impact investor is looking to make a practical accommodation between today\u2019s reality and tomorrow\u2019s aspiration.Passion investors spurn such accommodations. They are driven by a belief in the primacy of a cause \u2014 animal rights, climate change, reducing waste \u2014 and try to apply that desire to all investment types. It\u2019s not easy.\u201cI have a conversation about this quite often,\u201d said Mark Doman, chief executive of the Doman Group, an investment adviser. \u201cClients talk about how their ethics and morality guide their portfolio. I tell them it\u2019s a very slippery slope to find companies that meet their ethical bar while keeping in mind their goal is to grow their assets.\u201dMr. Doman added, \u201cIf you can find me a morally and ethically pure blue-chip company, that\u2019s more the exception than the rule.\u201dRoyce Pinkwater, a real estate broker in Manhattan, is trying to find such companies that align with her passion \u2014 reducing pollution \u2014 but are also profitable. She has taken to analyzing individual securities through the lens of pollution. This has led to tough choices.She had been earning solid returns investing in Amazon when she began to be concerned about the company\u2019s relationship with its vendors and how those vendors sold and packaged products. Was Amazon monitoring how they did business? How concerned were Amazon and its vendors with reducing the waste caused by their packaging?When people make private investments guided by passion, the risk can seem higher. Losing all of your money in any private investment is always a possibility, particularly in early-stage ventures.But when people assess a private investment primarily on their perception of its underlying merit, it also narrows their options. Their passion, in effect, has limited what may already be a small field of suitable investments.\u201cI have to be willing for the money to go down the drain completely,\u201d he said.It has happened once, with an investment in a food technology company. \u201cIt was a good idea, basically trying to create a more automated supply chain for small farms and organic farms,\u201d Mr. Baltzell said. \u201cThat did not work out.\u201dHowever difficult investing with a pure vision may be, it also comes at the risk of hypocrisy. Mr. Doman has clients passionate about avoiding investments in fossil fuels who have duly refused to put money into oil and gas companies. But one of those clients was comfortable owning stocks in airlines, which, of course, need fossil fuels to fly.\u201cWe talked it through and they said: \u2018Aviation and air travel are an essential part of the economy, and it\u2019s something I use \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity. I guess I can\u2019t go that far,\u2019\u201d Mr. Doman said of the client. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to own BP, Royal Dutch Shell or Mobil, but they\u2019d own American Airlines or Delta. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s a very subjective assessment.\u201dSome investors have put parameters in place to stay focused on their passions but not to go broke.A strategy that loses money for years, like Mr. Holehouse\u2019s focus on renewables, is not one any professional investor could sustain and still be in business. But he said he and his wife did not need their investments to live. And being tied to the jewelry business, he said, has allowed them to invest in gems and rare metals that regular investors cannot access.\u201cKashmir sapphires have gone up 500 percent in the last decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, it gives us more room to let our conscience drive things.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Baltzell\u2019s approach in choosing his angel investments is, by his own admission, one of convenience: He looks at deals that come to him and meet his criteria of reducing waste. (Professional angel investors most likely look at 10 or 20 deals before investing in one or none.)But he limits his angel investments to 20 percent of his net worth. Even if they\u2019re successful, he reasons, they could take years to pay him back.\u201cIf I went totally with my heart, I\u2019d be doing this all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have trouble paying the school bills.\u201dAffluent investors can take a chance others wouldn\u2019t. The question is, Should they?Preston McSwain, managing partner of Fiduciary Wealth Partners in Boston, said being deeply interested in your investment decisions was generally a good thing but focusing almost myopically on a passion could have its downside.\u201cIf you have a very long time horizon it\u2019s certainly something you should spend time on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you need to be broadly diversified based on your goals and objectives.\u201dHe said a simple weighing of pros and cons could help even the most passionate investor gain perspective. The pros with a passion are clear \u2014 this is something the investor believes in.\u201cThe cons could be extreme concentration \u2014 that can help you reach your goals really fast or it gets blown up,\u201d Mr. McSwain said. \u201cAdvisers should try to get people to think why is this important and make sure they don\u2019t get overconcentrated in too much of a good thing.\u201dMs. Pinkwater is one who stepped back. She wanted to invest in Chinese internet companies, thinking this would be a market that would grow steadily. She bought stock in Tencent, the Chinese internet company that owns popular messaging apps like WeChat.But she ended up selling the stock because of Tencent\u2019s growing carbon footprint. She replaced it with Alphabet, the holding company for Google, YouTube and other technology companies. Google is well known for working to lower its carbon emissions, but is also known for getting out of China in 2010 and only now trying to return.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me the same exposure to China,\u201d Ms. Pinkwater said. \u201cI tried. I just wasn\u2019t comfortable with Tencent.\u201dThat is a perfectly dispassionate way to think of a passion investment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economists Have Been Demoted in Washington. That\u2019s a Bad Idea.", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe council has long been the home of the economics profession in Washington, and this move softens the loudest policy voice that academics have.As an academic economist, it is hardly surprising that I say this is a bad idea. But I don\u2019t think my concerns are self-serving: They do not stem from a belief in the superiority of economists, from some sense that we understand the economy better than anyone else.Instead, they arise from a belief that this move will rob the policy-making process of a particular kind of expertise and, worse, contribute to insularity and bias.From the outside, it may be hard to imagine why removing one economist from the cabinet should have much of an effect. After all, the corporate world is well represented in the administration: At least five cabinet nominees or appointees and several more cabinet-level appointees have been chief executives or corporate leaders. If anything, some would argue that this cabinet has too many businesspeople.But don\u2019t confuse business acumen with economic analytics. You surely wouldn\u2019t conflate the two in one direction: Would you ask an academic economist without business experience to run a company? It would be an equivalent error going in the other direction: The Council of Economic Advisers performs a function, and provides a perspective, that businesspeople do not.By way of background, it is useful to understand how the council, which does not, at the moment, have a chairman, actually operates. In effect, it is an in-house economic consultancy for the White House. The staff produces economic analysis on nearly every issue the president faces.This is a much broader responsibility than you might imagine. For example, suppose a reduction in the size of the Army was being considered. The effect on national security would be a major concern, but even this policy has economic consequences. What would the reduced job opportunities do to people who have made the military their profession? What would happen to the economies of the towns that surround Army bases? What would the fiscal consequences be, such as the cost of early retirement or severance packages that might need to be paid as part of a downsizing? It is the council\u2019s job to marshal the best analysis and evidence to answer these questions.Even when the economic consequences are not the primary consideration, they can influence the final decision. Few choices are cut and dried, and economic considerations can swing many of the close calls the White House must routinely make.Business acumen, by itself, produces little insight into these questions. Take the example of military downsizing. Surely corporate executives have some insight into the process; they may even have managed a downsizing or two. For example, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary nominee, specialized in buying distressed assets such as firms in bankruptcy. He would provide a valuable perspective, correct?Yet at the same time, this kind of experience does not speak to broader, systemwide consequences. What is known about how to minimize the effects on the towns surrounding military bases? For example, should new companies be recruited to these towns? Should people be encouraged to look for work elsewhere? If there are \u201cshort run\u201d costs, will they last a year or a decade?Or take tax policy. Companies spend vast amounts of resources navigating the tax system. Businesspeople know the loopholes and the kind of incentives and tax breaks that might be attractive for their own operations. After all, this was implicit in Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that, \u201cI know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them.\u201dEven if Mr. Trump were to follow through on this promise, there is more to tax policy than fixing loopholes. Any discussion must recognize how taxes distort behaviors and choices: For example, even a high income tax without loopholes might cause some people who would like employment to decide to stay out of the work force. The discussion must also examine who actually will bear the brunt of the tax. These are the questions the council focuses on.But the council brings more than just a different kind of expertise.While cabinet members serve the country, they also have their private interests and ambitions. For some, these are primarily political. For others, they may be mainly business interests.It is hard not to let these ambitions color policy making. Even when intentions are admirable, the mind is effective at warping perspectives to line up with self-interest.The academics serving on the council have their own biases. They, too, have political preferences and party affiliations. In recent years, there has even been concern that academics\u2019 research and policy advice are polluted by their business ties or speaking fees. But by and large the largest bias of academics lies elsewhere.In 1983, Martin S. Feldstein, an economist now at Harvard, where I work, was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. This was when the Reagan administration was cutting taxes broadly.The problem was that without accompanying cuts in spending, deficits would rise. Mr. Feldstein was particularly concerned about this and expressed his worries loudly. His voice was important: It raised a concern that wasn\u2019t politically popular.Yes, academics fret about what their peers think, just as other people do. In this case, it\u2019s a good thing. It is important to have someone in the cabinet who is more interested in protecting academic integrity than in protecting business interests or the president\u2019s image.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Obamacare Really Go Under the Knife?", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureThe legislators responded with a curious silence \u2014 perhaps awed by the thought, perhaps also a bit unnerved. After years mired in do-nothingness, the Republican-controlled Congress had both the means and, Trump believed, the mandate to roll back Barack Obama\u2019s liberal legacy.At the top of their hit list was Obama\u2019s monumental health care legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. During the six and a half years since its passage, Republicans maintained a striking unanimity in their hatred of what they derisively called Obamacare. And over that same period, they became thoroughly united in the conviction that Trump expressed from the outset of his candidacy \u2014 namely, that he \u201cwould repeal and replace\u201d the health care law \u201cwith something far better.\u201dBut in the months since Trump\u2019s victory, many of the lawmakers in attendance that day had become increasingly worried about how they would go about undoing the legislation. That same weekend in Philadelphia, Republican members of Congress were caught on tape fretting aloud about what the \u201csomething far better\u201d to replace the law should be. Should they allow states to accept expanded Medicaid benefits, as Obamacare had done? Should they enter what Representative John Faso, a New York Republican, called the \u201cpolitical minefield\u201d of defunding Planned Parenthood as part of the package? For that matter, should they really be rushing to repeal the A.C.A. before they had any idea of what would replace it? Looming over the gathering was a question that it was perhaps now too late to ask: Had Republicans become trapped by their pledge to do away with Obamacare?A few days before the retreat, I met up with the man who, perhaps more than any other figure in the conservative movement, had maneuvered the party toward complete and unbending opposition to Obamacare: Michael Needham of the Heritage Foundation. Needham, 35, is the chief executive of Heritage Action for America, a feral cur of a lobbying organization established by the venerable conservative think tank in 2010 to (as its website puts it) \u201chold Congress accountable to conservative principles.\u201d Though other organizations \u2014 among them the Club for Growth and Americans for Tax Reform \u2014 have vigorously opposed Obamacare from its inception, Heritage Action has spent the last six years almost monomaniacally focused on demanding that legislators abolish the hated law. It scores them on what it deems critical votes and loudly condemns any and all apostasies. It names names and, when necessary to its ends, is happy to defy the Republican leadership. In violating Reagan\u2019s \u201c11th Commandment\u201d not to speak ill of others in his party, Needham has come to rival Ted Cruz as one of the least popular Republicans in Washington.Needham would not seem an obvious choice for this distinction. Smooth-skinned and passively handsome in the manner of Mitt Romney, he grew up on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. His youthful acquaintance with struggle was limited to being a Mets fan. After graduating from Williams College in 2004, Needham went straight to work for Heritage, where he was made its director of Asian studies, despite having never visited Asia. In 2007 he briefly left the think tank to become a policy aide for the presidential campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the most liberal of the dozen or so Republican candidates in that cycle. By the time Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010, Needham had again temporarily left Heritage, attending Stanford Business School and dating a Democrat whom he would later marry. There was little in the cards to prefigure his imminent future as the self-designated \u2014 and at times deeply reviled \u2014 lead driver in the Obamacare demolition derby.Like virtually every Republican in Washington, Needham was not especially enamored of Trump during the primaries. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s a clown,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d just a month after Trump announced his candidacy \u2014 adding, with evident distaste, \u201cThis is a guy who believes in socialized medicine.\u201d Needham\u2019s preferences ran more to Bobby Jindal, and of course to Cruz, whom Needham reflexively referred to by his first name. Still, Needham and his adopted cause had emerged as unambiguous winners of the 2016 election. On the first day of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order to \u201cseek the prompt repeal\u201d of Obamacare.Thus had Trump and Needham \u2014 two men who had never met \u2014 become allies. \u201cI think one of the big disagreements we\u2019ve had with the party for a long time is that we think when you\u2019re trying to win an argument, it can only happen when you start them,\u201d the young C.E.O. said as he sat in his Capitol Hill office, looking somewhat fatigued from having spent the previous weekend toilet-training his child. \u201cAnd this kind of maniacal focus on \u2018governing\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 his voice taking on a mocking tone \u2014 \u201cwhen all governing means is a bill-signing to get good press, instead of laying out a vision of where you want to take the country, was one of the big divides we had.\u201dBut the long, and at times quixotic, struggle to repeal Obamacare in which Needham has been a lead combatant has more closely resembled a street fight than anything that could reasonably be termed an \u201cargument.\u201d And though it may appear otherwise in a dawning age of Republican near-monopoly on government, the argument is today far from over. According to a January Fox News poll, Obama\u2019s signature program now enjoys a 50 percent approval rating. There is no guarantee that Republicans in the Senate will sign onto legislation that risks leaving millions of their constituents suddenly without health care coverage while alienating key donors \u2014 drug makers, insurance companies and doctor associations \u2014 who helped shape and support the law Trump now seeks to replace. \u201cThe joke around Washington,\u201d the former Democratic congressman Jim McDermott told me, \u201cis that the Republicans are going to repeal Obamacare \u2014 and they\u2019ll replace it with the Affordable Care Act.\u201dThe basic architecture of the bill that would eventually become the A.C.A. was conceived in 1989 by the Heritage Foundation policy analyst Stuart Butler as a conservative alternative to government-managed health care. It was first put into practice in 2006 by Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who devised his state\u2019s health care policy with the help of two other Heritage health care specialists, Bob Moffit and Ed Haislmaier. But for many decades, conservatives had resisted increasing the federal government\u2019s role in health care. That remained true in 2009, when the newly elected President Barack Obama undertook to pass legislation that would extend health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans.What Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress ultimately settled on was a framework of health care exchanges \u2014 marketplaces where health insurance could be purchased, and had to be, if you weren\u2019t already covered. This was the so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d first advocated (albeit in the context of a private-sector health care system) by Butler and later embraced by Romney.Obama opposed the concept as a candidate, in favor of an unspecified plan that he claimed would lower costs. What many Democrats on the Hill \u2014 \u201cprobably more than half of our caucus,\u201d McDermott says \u2014 preferred was a single-payer system, in which health care costs are borne not by insurers but instead by a single fund, typically originating from taxpayers, as Medicare does. But half of the Democratic caucus wasn\u2019t enough for a bill to pass the House, much less the Senate. When a congressional majority failed to materialize for a hybrid measure, known as the \u201cpublic option,\u201d in which consumers would be allowed to choose among government-run insurance plans as well as private ones, Democrats were left with the individual mandate.The final 2,700-page legislative package would aim to \u201cincrease the quality, availability and affordability of private and public health insurance to over 44 million uninsured Americans,\u201d as the administration put it. Applicants whose income was between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line would be eligible for federally subsidized insurance. Those with incomes at or below 138 percent would now qualify for Medicaid in states that chose to participate in the program. Young people up to the age of 26 were permitted to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance. Americans with pre-existing medical conditions could not be denied coverage. And a variety of other regulations, taxes, penalties and incentives would be set up to maximize participation on the part of insurers, recipients, physicians and health care centers.Though the details of the Affordable Care Act, as the final bill came to be called, left plenty of room for disagreement, its fundamental reliance on taxpayer-subsidized health care overseen by the federal government was a concept anathema to most Republicans. In a 28-page memo written by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz in spring 2009, Republicans were urged to use the phrase \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d when referring to the Democrats\u2019 health care package. Less heeded was another admonition in Luntz\u2019s memo: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just say what you\u2019re against. You have to tell them what you\u2019re for.\u201dIn the end, Republicans lacked the numbers necessary to block the bill. On March 21, 2010, the House finally passed on a party-line vote a version of the bill that was sure to be agreed to by the Democratic-controlled Senate. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give in to mistrust or to cynicism or to fear,\u201d Obama, announcing the bill\u2019s passage that night in the East Room of the White House, said. \u201cInstead, we proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges.\u201dA couple of days after King made his move, in mid-June 2010, the two newly minted leaders of Heritage Action \u2014 Needham, then 28, and the 32-year old chief operating officer, Tim Chapman \u2014 met in the Capitol with Barry Jackson, chief of staff to John Boehner, the House minority leader at the time. Though Jackson today says that he has no recollection of their visit, Needham and Chapman both say they remember it clearly. After explaining the general mission of their new organization, the young conservatives brought up the recently passed Affordable Care Act. Heritage Action, they informed Jackson, intended to push House members to sign King\u2019s petition.Jackson\u2019s response surprised Chapman and Needham. \u201cHe was very clear,\u201d Chapman recalls, \u201cthat if we pushed forward on it, we would probably not get all the Republicans on it, and it would be politically detrimental to a lot of Republicans to be on it. He said, \u2018I\u2019ve seen all the ads the unions have prepared to run on this stuff.\u2019 I don\u2019t know where he\u2019d seen them. We let off on the gas. We said, \u2018We\u2019ll agree to disagree on this one.\u2019 It was the \u2018aha\u2019 moment for us: We just don\u2019t see the world the same way.\u201dAs both Chapman and Needham today concede, Jackson might also have had his own \u201caha\u201d moment, recognizing them as impudent young jerks. Still, their aggression had the full blessing of Ed Feulner, then Heritage\u2019s president, who says fondly of Needham, \u201cHe reminded me of myself 40 years earlier.\u201d As for Heritage Action, he said: \u201cWe knew we\u2019d be breaking some china.\u201dAmong Republican elected officials, the Heritage Foundation had long been regarded as a tweedy grandfather, revered but not feared. The think tank was proficient at spewing out white papers and keynote speeches. But because of its status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, it could not devote a substantial part of its activities to taking positions on congressional votes or campaigning against political foes. Heritage sat by helplessly in 2003 while President George W. Bush, dismaying conservative purists, promoted and then signed into law a new federal entitlement that used Medicare to extend prescription benefits to senior citizens. Two years later, Heritage could do nothing to rescue Bush\u2019s Social Security privatization measure from defeat. Now, with Heritage Action as a 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare organization,\u201d the foundation at last had its own squad in the fight. And in Needham, Feulner had a jut-jawed lieutenant whose job, as Feulner put it, would be \u201cto run the flag up the flagpole and see who salutes.\u201dSteve King\u2019s bill was Heritage Action\u2019s first flag. It had not occurred to Needham and Chapman to see things Barry Jackson\u2019s way \u2014 to consider that Republicans\u2019 taking an unambiguous stand to completely repeal Obamacare could cost them House seats five months later. Jackson\u2019s hesitancy to campaign on full repeal was in fact shared by many Republican leaders. One of them, Senator John Cornyn, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said of Obamacare in May: \u201cThere is noncontroversial stuff here, like the pre-existing conditions exclusion and those sorts of things. Now, we are not interested in repealing that. And that is frankly a distraction.\u201dTo Needham, there was only one way to look at the matter. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in having a conservative party if we\u2019re not going to fight a massive federal intervention in health care?\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s one-sixth of our economy!\u201dA month later, Heritage Action turned up the heat on the 34 Democrats \u2014 most of them so-called conservative Blue Dogs \u2014 who voted against Obamacare in March but had yet to sign King\u2019s discharge petition. In a press statement, Needham declared, \u201cI know their constituents, who will be attending town halls this August, are eager to hear why they do not support the repeal effort.\u201d In September, a single Democrat, Gene Taylor of Mississippi, added his signature. The tally reached 173, well short of what it would take for King\u2019s bill to make it to the House floor \u2014 much less to get it passed and then sent over to the Senate, where Republicans\u2019 appetite for abolishing Obamacare altogether was less acute than it was in the House.But though the discharge petition had stalled, King and Heritage Action could justifiably declare a victory of principle and, eventually, an I-told-you-so. Overall, those who pledged fealty to repealing Obamacare fared better that November than those who didn\u2019t. As King told me recently: \u201cThe Barry Jacksons and the John Cornyns were clearly wrong. Look at what happened to the Blue Dogs in 2010. There were 53 of them when Obamacare passed. Now I don\u2019t know if you can count three of them.\u201d King was exaggerating, but not by much \u2014 there are 18 members of Congress\u2019s Blue Dog Coalition today. \u201cPelosi made them walk the plank, and they fell like tenpins after that. Since then, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a freshman Republican who didn\u2019t run on the full repeal of Obamacare.\u201dAt times, however, what looked like the \u201cright thing\u201d was, from Needham\u2019s vantage, in fact the wrong thing. In April 2011, for example, a bill dismantling part of Obamacare did clear the House and then the Senate, and was signed into law by President Obama without hesitation. It was a measure to eliminate the requirement that small companies submit 1099 forms for all transactions exceeding $600, which essentially served as a tax to help pay for the program and which Heritage Action had condemned as \u201cburdensome\u201d and \u201conerous,\u201d guaranteed to generate paperwork and high accounting fees.But Heritage Action, because of its ironclad resistance to \u201cpartial repeal,\u201d actually opposed the measure to get rid of the 1099 provision. Yes, it would help small businesses \u2014 but then those same small businesses would no longer care to be part of Heritage Action\u2019s crusade. As Needham later told me, \u201cWe felt that when anything less than full repeal becomes acceptable, you open the door for every lobbyist in town to say: \u2018Hey, while we\u2019re working on full repeal, let\u2019s fix the 1099 issue. Or let\u2019s fix the franchise-restaurant issue\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 the popular shorthand for an A.C.A. provision requiring companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care to anyone working over 30 hours a week. \u201cYou eventually over time whittle off various constituencies that we want to keep as part of the full-repeal platform.\u201d Partial repeal would be well and good if it got rid of what Needham called a \u201cvital organ\u201d of the law: the individual mandate, say, or Medicaid expansion. But \u201cthose vital organs were never going to go down if repeal was defined by Washington\u2019s lobbying class. It would be 1099s and these heavily lobbied issues, and then we\u2019ll be stuck with Obamacare.\u201dIn mid-2011, Heritage Action declared that it would \u201ckey vote,\u201d or place greater emphasis on, bills it deemed especially relevant as litmus tests of members\u2019 conservative bona fides. Needham also began issuing scorecards on how frequently members of Congress were voting down spending bills. The notion of a 20-something former Giuliani aide grading veteran lawmakers on their principles did not go over well. Representative Rob Wittman of Virginia was taken to task in a Heritage Action analysis for casting only four of a potential 11 votes to cut spending during a series of roll calls; he had to inform Chapman that he had missed those votes because his father had died. (Chapman did not change Wittman\u2019s score but did explain the reason for Wittman\u2019s absence on the Heritage Action website.)Representative Geoff Davis of Kentucky, a onetime target of Heritage Action\u2019s grading system, fumed to me about the organization\u2019s absolutist browbeating, which came as Republican members were doing their best to thwart Obama\u2019s agenda. \u201cIf I\u2019m trying to stop someone\u2019s bleeding on the side of the road, I don\u2019t need to also give them a lecture about how they need to do aerobics and lift weights three times a week,\u201d he said. Echoing the opinion of many Republicans in Washington, Davis asserted that Needham\u2019s operation was less about legislative results than its own fund-raising: \u201cVery quickly, it became a conservative for-profit operation,\u201d he said.More than once, Chapman recalls, Republican leaders on the Hill called Feulner to say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to rein these guys in.\u201d But Heritage Action had other defenders besides Feulner. The new Republican Study Committee chairman, Jim Jordan of Ohio, felt that Needham\u2019s organization was instrumental in pushing the party rightward. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a rising star in the Tea Party class of 2010, characterized Heritage Action\u2019s messaging as \u201cinvaluable.\u201d Even the complaints were tacit acknowledgments of the organization\u2019s growing clout. As a 501(c)(4), Heritage Action was not obliged to disclose its finances, but it was known to have received millions, including $500,000 from the Koch brothers. Rank-and-file-conservative House members pointed with pride to their high Heritage Action scores. Leadership aides saw no choice but to include Needham and Chapman in strategy meetings.And Heritage Action\u2019s relentless focus on its message \u2014 Obamacare is a disaster that must be repealed in full \u2014 was already taking its toll. Before the law had even gone fully into effect, polls consistently showed that most Americans disapproved of it. The A.C.A.\u2019s unpopularity persisted despite a number of modifications meant to improve the program and thus quell discontent. As Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary at the time, told me: \u201cThe notion from Day 1 was to make this work and listen carefully to the feedback, and to help dampen anxiety without gutting key provisions in the law. What made things difficult was that most of the law wasn\u2019t going to be implemented right away. There was this huge gap in time between designing the bill and actually having the benefits fully in place, which gave a lot of opportunity for the opposition to say, \u2018This will kill jobs, pestilence will come, vermin will fall from the sky\u2019 \u2014 and very little opportunity for us to say anything other than, \u2018Wait and see.\u2019\u2009\u201dOn this point, if nothing else, Sebelius and Needham could agree: The war on Obamacare would become far more difficult for opponents to wage once the actual benefits became available. New enrollees would begin receiving health care coverage on Jan. 1, 2014. It was a glum axiom among conservatives that once Americans were handed a new entitlement \u2014 Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance \u2014 they were loath to part with it. Moreover, once a gigantic program fully insinuates itself into the federal governing apparatus, disentangling it is a formidable task. \u201cOne of my political heroes in town is Don Rumsfeld,\u201d Feulner told me. \u201cAnd one of Rumsfeld\u2019s rules is that you want to act as quickly and aggressively as you can, because every day someone in the bureaucracy is narrowing the options you\u2019ll have two days later. That\u2019s clearly what\u2019s happening with Obamacare. Every day the options for full repeal get fewer and fewer.\u201dThe shutdown was the crisis point Heritage Action had hoped for \u2014 that cherished moment when Republicans finally took a bold, principled stand. The public would express outrage that the president was willing to hold America\u2019s full faith and credit hostage over the much-disliked Obamacare. Democrats would go wobbly. Republicans in both the House and the Senate would stand firm. In the end, Obama would cave. Or so Needham and Chapman hoped. \u201cKudos to leadership for doing the right thing,\u201d Chapman told the group. \u201cNow let\u2019s prosecute this case!\u201dHis enthusiasm was met with a wall of silence. The others in the room stared at him with a welling resentment. Finally, a tax-policy analyst at Americans for Tax Reform said to Chapman: \u201cYou\u2019ve been saying the Republicans need to be brave. Well, we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019ve shut the government down. But what does Heritage Action intend to do to put pressure on the Democrats? So far, the only money you\u2019ve spent over the past few months has been a half-million dollars attacking Republicans.\u201dChapman went visibly red-faced. Only a couple of days into the shutdown, it was now occurring to the chief operating officer of Heritage Action that he and Needham had been abandoned by conservative leaders. Within days, the Republicans in the Senate buckled and, with the House Republican leaders in tow, signed a debt-ceiling deal with Obama that said almost nothing about health care. Congress was blamed by the public for causing the shutdown, and its approval ratings plummeted.Throughout the shutdown, Needham insisted that the public would eventually reward Republicans for standing up to Obamacare. \u201cLook,\u201d he told me at the time, \u201cthere\u2019s more Americans who are aware right now of the fact that we have one political party that owns Obamacare and was willing to go to the great lengths of shutting down the World War II Memorial in order to preserve it, and another party that tried to stop it. And Americans deserve that type of clarity.\u201dThis opinion was apparently not shared by Speaker Boehner. In December 2013, he told reporters that groups like Heritage Action had \u201clost all credibility.\u201d A month later, on the \u201cTonight\u201d show, he called the government shutdown a \u201cpredictable disaster.\u201dBut the continuing intransigence of the repeal advocates was beginning to wear down the White House. Initially, Sebelius says, \u201cwe were more focused on the Republican attorneys general across the country who challenged the constitutionality of the law. Until that was resolved by the Supreme Court in June 2012, that was our focus. The congressional action was viewed more as sour grapes and not altogether realistic. Clearly the president wasn\u2019t going to sign anything that would strike down his brand-new law.\u201d By the time of the shutdown, though, the repealers appeared to have succeeded in getting inside the Obama administration\u2019s collective head. As Oct. 1, 2013 \u2014 the date HealthCare.gov was to be open for enrollments \u2014 approached, little time was available to subject the website to tests that could expose its shortcomings. But \u201cthe one thing that wasn\u2019t feasible, knowing how vehemently the Republicans were determined to stop it at any cost, was moving the deadline,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would have mobilized the opposition to the point that we might never have been able to launch it at all.\u201dAnd so the White House rolled out a deeply flawed website. By this time, the Republican critique of Obamacare was already becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. The A.C.A. had been passed with only about one-tenth of the funding that it would need to be fully operational, with the expectation that the rest would be portioned out by Congress annually, through the appropriations process that funds discretionary government programs. From 2011 through 2014, as the House Republicans played round after round of fiscal brinkmanship, Obama reluctantly signed last-minute budget deals that continually shortchanged Obamacare.\u201cThey did a very effective job making sure there would never be enough to fund implementation,\u201d Sebelius told me. \u201cAnd they came after the budget over and over. Anything that looked like it could be used, they made sure was gone.\u201d That was especially the case, Sebelius said, when it came to educating the public about the program\u2019s benefits \u2014 funding that would have made a difference in the 19 states where governors and legislatures had refused to expand Medicaid and had no interest in promoting Obamacare. \u201cAny effort to put in dollars for outreach on the federal level,\u201d she said, \u201cwere immediately stripped out.\u201dA month after Boehner resigned, the House considered yet another bill targeting Obamacare. But this one was different from its predecessors. Sponsored by Representative Tom Price, who in just over a year would be Trump\u2019s pick as secretary of Health and Human Services, H.R. 3762 was a \u201creconciliation bill,\u201d a budgetary measure to defund the health care program that would, in accordance with Senate rules, require only 51 votes to pass in the upper chamber. That threshold was attainable, now that the Republicans had 54 Senate seats. The bigger hurdle was a more arcane one: To qualify for this lower passage threshold as a reconciliation bill, every item in the legislation had to be deemed a budgetary fix, rather than an extraneous provision, by the Senate parliamentarian. Accordingly, it did not include repealing the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. Better to let the Senate legislative aides confer on those matters with the parliamentarian, one staff member who helped write the bill told me.That approach was not good enough for Needham and Chapman. Heritage Action announced its strong disapproval of the reconciliation bill, instructed members to vote it down and warned that the measure would be key-voted. Insisting that it was \u201cuniversally acknowledged\u201d that the repeal of the exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion would qualify as reconcilable items, Heritage Action stated that it would be satisfied with nothing less.The new speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, ignored Heritage Action. On Oct. 23, the reconciliation bill went to the House floor, where all but seven Republicans voted for it. Apoplectic, Needham termed the act a \u201ccharade\u201d that \u201cundermines the party\u2019s longstanding position of full repeal.\u201d He added, \u201cWe expect the Senate to do better.\u201dThe Senate Republicans did. Their version of the bill included repeal of the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. The parliamentarian ruled that both provisions were extraneous and did not therefore qualify in their present form for a simple-majority vote.A watered-down version of the bill, which kept the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion but stripped away the ability to enforce either, then passed the Senate and was reapproved by the House. It was sent over to President Obama. On Jan. 8, 2016, he vetoed it. Obama\u2019s final defense of his namesake program would come almost exactly 10 months later, when he received President-elect Trump in the Oval Office and urged him not to eviscerate Obamacare.Obama\u2019s words, Trump said the following day to The Wall Street Journal, had made him reconsider abolishing the law in full. But 10 weeks later, as one of the very first acts of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order whose mission statement was the \u201cprompt repeal\u201d of Obamacare in its entirety.To make Obamacare economically feasible for insurers, the program needed to attract a large pool of young and healthy recipients to offset the costs of providing care for the older and less healthy. That ratio has yet to prove satisfactory for many insurance companies \u2014 one of which, Aetna, announced last year that it would be abandoning the program in several states. (Aetna publicly blamed Obamacare, saying that it was losing money participating in the exchanges, but a federal judge ruled that Aetna\u2019s real motive was to escape scrutiny for its possibly illegal merger with Humana, and court documents have shown that the company was making money in some states where it was claiming not to.)Then again, it was always the industry\u2019s expectation that the law would prove flawed in places, and that those shortcomings would be addressed legislatively. As Karen Ignagni, the lead lobbyist for the health-insurance industry during the formation and passage of Obamacare and now president and C.E.O. of EmblemHealth, tactfully puts it: \u201cOn the Affordable Care Act, there was a strong difference of opinion between Democrats and Republicans going back to the initial days of discussion. And so there was never a coming-together.\u201dIn spite of all this, Obamacare has done far more good than its critics predicted it would. As of 2014, insurers cannot deny coverage to anyone based on their current health status \u2014 a meaningful protection for the 133 million Americans with chronic illnesses. Over 15 million poor or near-poor citizens are now receiving Medicaid benefits in the 31 states (as well as the District of Columbia) that have opted for this expansion. Another 3 million Americans under the age of 26 have been allowed to stay on their parents\u2019 health care plans, thanks to the provision in the A.C.A. that Heritage Action warmly refers to as the \u201cslacker mandate.\u201d Meanwhile, during each month that Obamacare has been in existence, the private sector has grown. The bill has not proved to be the \u201cjob killer\u201d apocalyptically described by its Republican opponents.Now that the law is in place, trying to tinker with it in a measured fashion, deciding which parts to discard and which to keep, would be more complicated than simply determining what the public likes and what it doesn\u2019t. As Jim McDermott says: \u201cYou can\u2019t just reach in and pull out one thing. It\u2019d be like a doctor doing surgery and saying, \u2018Well, since you\u2019re not using your spleen today, let\u2019s take it out.\u2019 It\u2019s all wired together in a very complex way.\u201dThat wiring represents, among other things, the compromises worked out with the various players in the health care ecosystem \u2014 doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 associations, hospital groups, insurers, drug companies \u2014 that enabled the passage of Obamacare in the first place. As Ignagni points out: \u201cIt was very unique that all of the different industries were willing to sit at the table and engage in problem-solving together. I don\u2019t really recall any time when that has happened in our economy on any issue.\u201d Collectively, those groups spent close to $273 million on lobbying during the height of the Obamacare debate. They will surely spend a similar sum haranguing Congress to pass a replacement that favors them.Many conservative remedies have been floated over the years and have been consolidated into Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s 37-page \u201cA Better Way\u201d summation: expanded health savings accounts, assorted tax credits and refunds, medical-liability reform, portability of insurance from one job to the next and the ability to purchase insurance across state lines. But the problem for Republicans is that Obamacare\u2019s sweeping coverage has changed the paradigm. Of the 31 states that have opted for expanded Medicaid coverage, 16 have Republican governors. None of these governors have expressed a desire to throw their states\u2019 residents off the rolls. At the same time, the fitful and at times rhetorically muddled transition from the known (Obamacare) to the unknown (\u201csomething terrific\u201d) has risked throwing the health care industry into turmoil. The aftershocks are likely to be not only economic but also political.\u201cIf you take Obamacare as it looks right now,\u201d says the policy analyst Robert Laszewski, a longtime critic of the legislation, about half of enrollees \u201cdon\u2019t get a subsidy because their incomes are too high. They make $90,000 or $100,000 a year but are in the individual market. These tend to be Trump supporters. So if he further destabilizes this thing and there are 20-to-50-percent rate increases, he\u2019ll be screwing his own people.\u201dBut it took more than the conservative base to elect Donald Trump, and it will take more than them to re-elect many Republican senators and representatives in 2018 and 2020. The rest of the public has begun a decided turn against King\u2019s and Heritage Action\u2019s position. The same Fox News poll last month that found Obamacare\u2019s overall favorability to be 50 percent also found that only 23 percent of respondents favored fully repealing it \u2014 a new low since the law was signed nearly seven years ago.After Trump remarked to The Washington Post on Jan. 15 that he planned to provide \u201cinsurance for everybody,\u201d I thought I had better gauge Michael Needham\u2019s reaction. Taken at face value, Trump did not sound much like a man hellbent on tilting health care policy rightward. \u201cI\u2019m concerned when I hear that kind of talk,\u201d King had told me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how deeply he\u2019s gone into the details.\u201dBut Needham chuckled breezily when I brought up Trump\u2019s statement. \u201cI think right now there\u2019s a lot of people who want to jump on words,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody wants to ensure every American has access to high-quality health care. That is pretty clearly what Trump was saying. What\u2019s the overused phrase? Trump supporters take him seriously, not literally.\u201dNor did it seem to bother him that Republicans on the Hill were in a frenzy to develop a consensus for replacement legislation. Up to now, Needham reminded me, the goal had been to inculcate in the party a ceaseless lust for Obamacare repeal. \u201cFor the last eight years,\u201d he said, \u201cit hasn\u2019t made sense to litigate the nuance of, Do you use a tax credit or a tax deduction, or what are your views of block-granting?\u201d The Republicans might not end up with a single gargantuan replacement bill, and maybe that was as it should be. \u201cWe\u2019re probably in an age where smaller, humbler pieces of legislation are easier to get consensus around.\u201dThis struck me as sensible and, at the same time, somewhat na\u00efve. If, as in Heritage Action\u2019s dream scenario, Obamacare were to be immediately vaporized, it would leave a yawning vacuum \u2014 and the first thing to fill it would be anxiety. Every gruesome case of once-insured families now left to die would be duly chronicled by the media. Legislators would panic \u2014 but, if recent history is any judge, their reaction would be tame compared with that of the man who now thoroughly owned the post-Obamacare landscape. Was it really so hard, I asked Needham, to imagine Trump faltering under the specter of bad press and equally bad approval ratings and hastily offering up a Trumpcare that bore a suspicious resemblance to Obamacare?Needham paused for a moment before saying, in a vaguely amazed voice: \u201cI\u2019m a little surprised by the question. Right now, I don\u2019t see much evidence of that playing out.\u201d Trump\u2019s vice president was Mike Pence, \u201cmy first hero when I came to Washington.\u201d Tom Price, the nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, and Mick Mulvaney, whom Trump tapped to run the Office of Management and Budget, were longtime supporters of Heritage Action. The former senator Jim DeMint, Ed Feulner\u2019s replacement as president of the Heritage Foundation, was helping to shape the selection of Trump\u2019s prospective Supreme Court nominees. Trump\u2019s team was loaded with Heritage staff members. All this counted for as much as whatever the new president himself thought. \u201cRichard Viguerie, one of the icons of the conservative movement, said to me that what was great about Reagan was that when he walked into the room, you saw your friends and allies walking with him,\u201d Needham told me.It was a pleasing image, conveying undying fellowship. Yet even Reagan, fierce inveigher against socialized medicine that he was, did not make a dent in Medicare, the program he so loathed, during his two terms in office. Quite the contrary, in fact: He briefly expanded its benefits to include catastrophic care for the elderly before Congress struck down the measure less than a year after Reagan left office.Now came the president whom Needham once accused of embracing socialized medicine. Maybe he would somehow turn out to be a more reliable friend to the conservative movement than Reagan had been. Or maybe Washington would prove, hardly for the first time, that even the best of friends will let you down.An article on Sunday about efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act misidentified the company for which Karen Ignagni is the president and C.E.O.

{"Headline": "Beltway Panic, Wall Street Zen", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE most grounded fears about a Donald Trump presidency have always involved incompetence rather than malevolence, the perils of a catastrophically weak presidency rather than the prospect of a near-dictatorship.So far many of these fears are being vindicated. Trump\u2019s policy rollouts have been botched, his appointments mismanaged, his White House is a feuding mess, his legislative agenda is lost in the fog. He\u2019s in wars with the press, the intelligence community, the bureaucracy and the courts, and he isn\u2019t obviously winning any of them.There are hints of the first in North Korea\u2019s missile test and various Russian maneuvers, signs of the second in the spasms of anti-Trump protest since Election Day.But the third is nowhere to be seen. While political journalists and Washington hands freak out daily over the Trump presidency, the stock market keeps acting like everything is fine, or better than fine, or even (if you will) just great again.A growing economy is compatible with creeping authoritarianism, of course, as Trump\u2019s most alarmist critics are fond of pointing out. But is it compatible with outrageous presidential incompetence, with a White House that can\u2019t hit a target with a Super Soaker from six inches away?That\u2019s what we\u2019ll find out. In effect, the Trump era is pitting the wisdom of one elite crowd against the wisdom of another \u2014 the crowd of D.C. politicos against the herd of brokers and analysts and financiers just an Acela ride away. It\u2019s the crowd of experts that totally failed to predict the rise of Trump against the crowd of experts that managed to miss the biggest financial meltdown since the Great Depression.The best case for the Wall Street perspective runs as follows: Most presidents have less power over the economy than one might assume from presidential campaigns and voter expectations. If this is true of administrations whose carefully calibrated economic programs have all the weight of wonkery behind them, why shouldn\u2019t it be true of administrations that find themselves unable to accomplish much of anything? If what matters is the fundamentals, and his White House is more likely to be balked and baffled than frenetically transformative, why not just bet those fundamentals and assume you\u2019ll win?There is historical evidence for this proposition, in the sense that the link between political and economic crises is more uncertain than direct. The financial crisis struck at a low ebb in George W. Bush\u2019s effectiveness, but the Great Depression hit with a popular and (at that point) famously competent Herbert Hoover at the helm. The political turmoil of the late 1960s coincided with low unemployment rates and strong G.D.P. growth. Watergate was rough on the stock market, but the Clinton impeachment, not so much, and markets mostly weathered the gridlock and debt-ceiling brinksmanship of the Obama years. If Trump is impotent or if he\u2019s impeached, there is precedent for the markets simply shrugging, for the economy to keep chugging right along.If you\u2019re a Trump-panicked reader with a nest egg and you haven\u2019t, ask yourself why not. Because as long as you don\u2019t, your mind may be with the panicked political class, but your money is with the Zen of Wall Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Hurries to Slash Oil and Gas Rules, Ending Industries\u2019 8-Year Wait", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The document carried the title \u201cA Roadmap to Repeal,\u201d a concise list of Obama administration environmental regulations that a Koch brothers-backed group was pressing President Trump and Congress to quickly reverse after Inauguration Day.It was a tally of rules that energy industry executives and lobbyists had waged a futile fight against for eight years, donating millions of dollars to lawmakers who vowed to help block them, filing lawsuits to try to overturn them and hiring experts to generate reports that questioned the need for them.But in a flurry of activity this past week, Congress did what Charles G. and David H. Koch \u2014 who own a conglomerate that sells hundreds of products, including gasoline, jet fuel and coal \u2014 and other industry leaders had been asking for.Using a rarely invoked law, the Republican-controlled Congress nullified a measure intended to curb the venting of gas wells on federal lands, and began the process of rolling back other regulations, including one enacted to limit damage that coal mines cause to streams \u2014 each items on the \u201cRoadmap to Repeal.\u201dOn Friday, with his own executive orders, Mr. Trump took up two more items on the list, including a call to rewrite major provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, legislation crafted by the Obama administration and passed by Congress in response to the 2008 financial meltdown.Not since the Reagan administration has Washington moved so quickly to roll back or nullify so many federal regulations, one of the clearest signs of an abrupt shift of power in a government now under one-party control that has flipped the script of winners and losers.\u201cIt is a big, fat victory, after all this time,\u201d said Luke Popovich, a vice president at the National Mining Association, an industry trade group.Here is a document that Freedom Partners \u2014 a group organized and funded by the Koch brothers \u2014 released in early January, detailing what it hoped President Trump and Congress would do first, in terms of rolling back regulations, many of which impact the energy industry. Congress and Mr. Trump started to move through the list this past week.A three-way alliance has now been formed among Congress, the Trump administration and industries that struggled to reverse what they saw as an out-of-control rush to regulate by the Obama administration.This new alignment of power is causing alarm among not only environmental groups but also other \u2014 mostly liberal \u2014 advocates who have spent much of the past eight years pushing for new rules to cover Wall Street banks, broadband providers, teacher preparation requirements, prepaid credit cards and even companies that sell high-calorie foods in vending machines.All of these measures, and many others, now stand a chance of being reversed, watered down or blocked.\u201cFor the last several years, whenever Congress would concoct some way to roll back a rule protecting clean air or clean water or undermine the fight against climate change, we always felt confident as we had an adult in charge at the White House,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental group. \u201cNow, what used to be a wish list of the oil and coal and gas industry has become the to-do list for Congress and the White House.\u201dFor Republicans, these first moves are the easy part, made possible by a law that gives Congress the power to reverse regulations within 60 legislative days with a simple majority vote in the House and Senate. Other Republican efforts to exploit this 20-year-old law \u2014 which until this week had been used only once to nullify a new rule \u2014 were thwarted five times with vetoes by President Obama since 2015.Once the 60-day window expires, Republicans will have a harder time reversing Mr. Obama\u2019s regulations, but will still have tools at their disposal, including cutting financing for the enforcement of rules, issuing new rules that are weaker, or negotiating with Democrats to pass new legislation.They have bold ambitions, including rescinding a rule enacted by the Obama administration that could close dozens of coal burning power plants, and another that would extend overtime pay eligibility to an estimated four million Americans.At a private meeting on Thursday hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, a senior White House adviser provided a plan on how the administration would handle efforts to curtail environmental regulations beyond the initial rush now underway to nullify recently adopted rules, said an energy industry executive who participated in the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity because details were confidential.Industry advocates and their allies in Congress said the long-awaited moves toward deregulation was good for consumers and the economy, as they simply wanted to eliminate measures that they believed cost jobs and drove up prices. Among the regulations being targeted: the methane rule, an Interior Department measure meant to reduce so-called flaring, when gas leaking from wells is burned off like a giant blow torch.\u201cEven on the way out the door, the former administration\u2019s regulatory onslaught continued as they pushed through more midnight regulations,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said on Wednesday, as he urged his colleagues to reverse the coal mining regulation, known as the Stream Buffer Rule. \u201cFortunately, with a new president, we now have the opportunity to give the American people relief and our economy a boost.\u201dLobbyists for the so-called extraction industry \u2014 oil, gas, coal and other mining operations \u2014 said they were as surprised as anyone else by the outcome of the November election, which gave them new clout in Washington.\u201cA lot of us folks just did not anticipate we were going to be doing this,\u201d said Stephen Brown, a lobbyist at Tesoro, an oil refining and marketing company based in San Antonio. \u201cIt was like the dog that caught up with the UPS truck.\u201dWithin days of the election, conference calls and meetings between industry lobbyists, members of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition teams and key Republican staff members on Capitol Hill were taking place. Those who took part began to plot out which regulations they wanted to go after first, participants in the process said.Energy rules quickly ended up at the top of the list. Mr. Obama was unusually aggressive in using his regulatory powers to expand the reach of the federal government over the energy industry, after failing to win the support he needed in Congress to pass legislation to take similar steps.But the energy industry spends about $300 million a year lobbying Congress, deploying an army of three lobbyists for each member. It also contributed more than $160 million during the most recent election cycle to federal candidates, with 80 percent of that going to Republicans, according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group. And the industry now wanted congressional leaders like Mr. McConnell, who is from one of the country\u2019s top coal-producing states, to nullify the Obama administration\u2019s new rules.\u201cThis has been a full-court press to block these rules, from a legal standpoint, a policy standpoint and a political standpoint,\u201d said Bret Sumner, an oil and gas industry lawyer, who serves on the board of the Western Energy Alliance, a trade group that has aggressively lobbied Congress to block Obama administration regulations governing drilling on federal lands.Mr. Sumner\u2019s group, along with the American Petroleum Institute and other major industry trade associations and individual companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, all pressed congressional leaders to immediately repeal the methane rule, which the Interior Department finalized in November.The measure, according to the department, would force companies to prevent the release of gas via flaring or leaks, eliminating an estimated 180,000 tons a year of methane gas, a contributing factor in climate change, while also increasing federal revenue by as much as $10 million a year, as the energy companies pay royalties only on fuel they contain and then sell.For its part, the coal industry pushed Congress to reverse the Stream Buffer Rule, also drafted by the Interior Department, that prevented mining companies from cutting off mountaintops in search of coal and other commodities, then dumping the remaining debris into nearby valleys. The department predicted the rule would protect 6,000 miles of streams and an estimated 52,000 acres of forests over the coming two decades.\u201cIt did not take a big pitch,\u201d said Hal Quinn, president of the National Mining Association, of his group\u2019s lobbying effort targeting congressional leaders to get its measure on the repeal list. \u201cWe clearly reinforced the fact this is ripe and due for Congress to reassert its power.\u201dA third rule targeted for quick repeal was one adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that required oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments for development rights \u2014 a provision intended to prevent corruption in places like Africa and Latin America. Billions of dollars from such payments have disappeared over the past several decades, at times siphoned by government officials for their personal use, instead of being used to improve the standard of living in these often impoverished nations.Exxon Mobil, whose former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, just became secretary of state, was one of the provision\u2019s primary opponents. He argued that the rule would force the company to disclose \u201ccommercially sensitive information\u201d and make it harder to compete against certain foreign oil companies that do not need to comply.By Friday, both the House and Senate had approved the first two of these repeals \u2014 on the stream rule and the foreign government payments \u2014 and final action by the Senate approving the repeal of the methane gas rule is expected soon.Mr. Trump has already put out a memo welcoming the rule reversals by Congress. \u201cThe administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on America\u2019s businesses,\u201d said a statement issued by the White House on Wednesday.The push to repeal these rules has created moments of obvious frustration for Democrats on the floor of the House and Senate chambers. As the blitz began this past week, Democratic lawmakers used various props \u2014 like poster-size photographs of fish harmed by mining industry practices \u2014 to try to make their points.Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, arrived on the chamber floor with a mock \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d board, with slivers marked \u201ccoal,\u201d \u201cmining\u201d and \u201ceven more oil\u201d indicating the available prizes that Congress was offering.\u201cLet\u2019s consult our wheel to see who is the big winner of the G.O.P. giveaway this week,\u201d Mr. Markey said, essentially conceding that Senate Democrats were all but certain to lose many of these fights.But for Freedom Partners \u2014 the secretive club of hugely wealthy political donors led and organized by the Koch brothers \u2014 it was a week to celebrate, as there had been a great deal of progress on their \u201cRoadmap to Repeal\u201d list.James Davis, an executive vice president at the group, sent a message late on Friday declaring \u201cthese repeal bills will soon be on their way to President Trump for his signature.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s Vice President, Calling Him a Drug \u2018Kingpin\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuch actions against officials in the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela are nothing new in a long and fraught relationship between Washington and Caracas. But the accusation that Mr. El Aissami, the next in line for the presidency, is a drug trafficker is certain to set a new, more hostile tone in relations.\u201cThis can be seen as the opening salvo of the Trump administration in dealing with Latin America\u2019s deepest crisis,\u201d said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. \u201cIt is hard to imagine that, with this decision, Washington will now be inclined to offer many carrots to the increasingly authoritarian regime.\u201dIn a letter on Feb. 8, 34 members of the United States Congress urged the president to \u201ctake immediate action to sanction regime officials.\u201dThe Treasury Department document contained wide-ranging accusations against Mr. El Aissami, the result of years of investigation, officials said.\u201cPower and influence do not protect those who engage in these illicit activities,\u201d said John E. Smith, the acting director of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. \u201cDenying a safe haven for illicit assets in the United States and protecting the U.S. financial system from abuse remain top priorities of the Treasury Department.\u201dVenezuelan officials had no immediate public comment on Monday evening. Mr. Maduro did not mention it during a television address.In its announcement, the Treasury Department said Mr. El Aissami\u2019s history of drug trafficking went back years through his previous political positions, which included a state governorship and establishing a national police force at the Interior and Justice Ministry.Mr. El Aissami \u201cfacilitated shipments of narcotics from Venezuela, to include control over planes that leave from a Venezuelan air base, as well as control of drug routes through the ports in Venezuela,\u201d the department said.Additionally \u201che oversaw or partially owned narcotics shipments of over 1,000 kilograms from Venezuela on multiple occasions, including those with the final destinations of Mexico and the United States,\u201d according to the statement. It did not specify what kinds of drugs were involved.The department also said Mr. El Aissami had protected accused drug traffickers, including the Venezuelan drug lord Walid Makled Garc\u00eda and the Colombian kingpin Daniel Barrera Barrera. The accusations linked Mr. El Aissami to shipments destined for the Zetas drug cartel in Mexico.The department also said a Venezuelan businessman, Samark L\u00f3pez Bello, had assisted Mr. El Assami, and now faced similar sanctions.The sanctions come as Mr. El Aissami has been consolidating power in Venezuela. He was appointed as vice president by Mr. Maduro on Jan. 4 after rising from a job as a rural student leader. David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy group, said he was seen as the front-runner for the leftist candidacy in the 2018 elections.Since appointing Mr. El Aissami to the post, Mr. Maduro has granted him expanded powers, including over the economy and expropriating businesses.Mr. El Aissami also heads a newly formed \u201ccommando\u201d unit, meant to root out dissidents that the government accuses of plotting coups. The group has so far arrested at least five people.Mr. El Aissami does not have a good history on human rights, Mr. Smilde said, adding that while he was governor of the state of Aragua \u201che presided over a police force that came to be one of the most violent and abusive in the country.\u201dAn article in some editions on Feb. 14 about the imposition of sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s vice president, Tareck El Aissami, by the United States misstated part of the name of an advocacy group where an analyst commented on Mr. El Aissami\u2019s political future.

{"Headline": "In Shadow of California Dam, Water Turns From Wish to Woe", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOROVILLE, Calif. \u2014 It wasn\u2019t so long ago that residents here had to drag their houseboats into a dusty field from the barren banks of Lake Oroville, which had almost no water left to keep them afloat.Now after weeks of rain, that dusty field is swelling with water and nearly 200,000 people had to evacuate the area when the state\u2019s second-largest reservoir developed a hole in its auxiliary spillway and threatened to catastrophically flood nearby towns.\u201cIt was just pandemonium outside,\u201d said Kurt Richter, a rice farmer living in Yuba City, who headed toward nearby Colusa, a town about 50 miles southwest of the dam in a two-car caravan with his wife and child, as the sudden evacuation order prompted chaos in the area. Mr. Richter described people driving on the shoulders, medians and the wrong side of the road.The sudden chaos offers a dramatic reversal for this small town in the Sierra Nevada foothills, which had been deeply affected by more than five years of drought and is now overwhelmed by winter storms.A few years ago, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t even see the lake,\u201d said Jesse Hollis, a floor and tile contractor who grew up in Oroville. \u201cIt was empty.\u201d He added, \u201cNobody thought that this was going to happen.\u201dMr. Richter added, \u201cWe go from hard-core conservation mode \u2014 curtailments, restrictions, all these regulations that are imposed on us, justifiably so \u2014 and now we\u2019ve got more water than we can physically manage.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an element of human danger that\u2019s hanging over our head for who knows how long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another huge storm system that\u2019s coming this week.\u201dBut they have also wreaked havoc and raised questions about whether the state could have done more to prevent a break. Rivers unable to contain the runoff from the mountains have repeatedly burst their banks, flooding homes.The latest trouble started last week, after heavy rainfall rapidly lifted Lake Oroville, built into a canyon about 70 miles north of Sacramento.On Sunday, emergency officials issued urgent warnings: Evacuate now or risk everything. Thousands heeded the call, streaming away out of town in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Gov. Jerry Brown has requested that the White House make an emergency declaration for Yuba, Butte and Sutter counties.By Monday, the area remained precarious with more storms set to hit later in the week. Evacuation orders remained in place. \u201cThis is still a dynamic situation,\u201d said Kory Honea, the sheriff of Butte County, which contains Oroville.In Oroville, there were a few signs of life. There was light traffic. A handful of gas stations and restaurants were open. Charles Smith, an ironworker in town, said his neighborhood was high enough to avoid the danger. His neighbors, however, were not so sure.\u201cWhen I woke up this morning, we were the only people there,\u201d said Mr. Smith, 36.Water has since stopped flowing over the auxiliary spillway, allowing crews to assess the damage there. Water was flowing at the rate of 100,000 cubic feet per second over the main spillway, which has a hole of its own but is not worsening. There is no damage to the dam itself \u2014 which, at 770 feet, is the tallest in the country and a critical piece of the state\u2019s water system. Saturday was the first time the emergency spillway came into use since the dam was completed in 1968.On Monday, helicopters were bringing in large rocks and other building materials for engineers to use to shore up the damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it had activated coordination centers in response to the situation at the dam.Pentagon officials in Washington said they were closely watching the looming crisis. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Defense Department spokesman, said on Monday that all 23,000 California National Guard members had been put on alert. Those troops report to Governor Brown. Captain Davis also said the Pentagon was prepared to send emergency aircraft, reconnaissance equipment, water rescue units, medical supplies and tents, if needed.The emergency spillway, like many others, is made largely of earth, with only a concrete weir, or sill, at the top. Water spilling over it cascades down an earthen hillside that is easily eroded. Environmental groups, including Friends of the River, a California-wide organization, requested in 2005 that the state cover the hillside with concrete. The request was rejected.\u201cThey didn\u2019t think they would ever need it, and they were confident that erosion was not going to be a problem,\u201d said Ron Stork of Friends of the River. \u201cBoth of those have now been demonstrated to be inaccurate assessments.\u201dAt a news conference on Monday, Bill Croyle, the acting director of the California Department of Water Resources said that he was not familiar with that request and that the use of the emergency spillway \u2014 and the resulting erosion \u2014 was a \u201cnew, never-happened-before event.\u201dIn Colusa, evacuees found a place to rest at the fairgrounds. Roughly 200 people stayed in the parking lot or in exhibition halls opened up for the night.The crisis has highlighted social issues that plague this area, which has historically suffered from high rates of unemployment and poverty. The region also has a very visible homeless population.In Marysville and Yuba City, organizations rushed to evacuate the many homeless people. John Nicoletti, a former county supervisor and staff member with Habitat for Humanity, said local officials and nonprofit organizations pooled resources to bus those who did not have cars.Miguel Vazquez, 41, who works in an auto paint and body shop, was worried about the prospect of losing work for a few days in Yuba City. He said residents, especially farmworkers and others reliant on the agricultural economy, were concerned.\u201cA couple of years ago everybody needs water,\u201d Mr. Vazquez said. \u201cNow there\u2019s extra water.\u201dSome residents without transportation evacuated on foot. William Wright, 35, said it took him 12 hours to walk from Yuba City to the fairgrounds in Colusa.\u201cIt makes no sense to sit there below a dam when it\u2019s in question,\u201d Mr. Wright said.At one point the drought was so severe here that water levels in the lake dropped to just 33 percent of its capacity. The lake \u201clooked like the moon,\u201d Brad McKeehan, 42, a construction inspector in Oroville, said. \u201cThere was no vegetation. It was just rock. It looked like Mars or something.\u201dNow some of Mr. Richter\u2019s farmland is already under water.\u201cThe drought was basically limiting the water we would have access to,\u201d Mr. Richter said. \u201cNow there\u2019s going to be so much water out there we might not even be able to put the crops in.\u201dBut Mr. Richter said his major concern Monday was not his farm but his home and the safety of his family.\u201cIt\u2019s a flood plain \u2014 we know the history of the area and understand sort of the realities of it. I think if anything the drought maybe caused a lot of us to kind of ease into forgetting about that,\u201d Mr. Richter said.\u201cWe\u2019ve all just gotten slapped back into reality about what really can go down in this part of the valley.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the problems at the Oroville Dam in California misstated the amount of water flowing over the dam\u2019s main spillway. It is 100,000 cubic feet per second, not per minute.Mike McPhate reported from Oroville, and Jess Bidgood and Henry Fountain from New York.

{"Headline": "Samsung Heir Again Faces Arrest in South Korea Bribery Scandal", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Lee is the vice chairman of Samsung. He has been running the company since his father, Lee Kun-hee, the corporate chairman, was incapacitated in 2014.The decision blocking the arrest was a blow to the special prosecutor, Park Young-soo, who has tried to build a bribery case against the younger Mr. Lee and Ms. Park. His team has been trying since to strengthen its case, and Mr. Park\u2019s office said on Tuesday that it had again asked a court in Seoul to issue an arrest warrant for Mr. Lee.Unless significant new evidence has emerged, it is highly unusual for a prosecutor to apply for an arrest warrant for a criminal suspect for a second time. Any attempt to arrest a leader of the powerful family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol draws attention in South Korea, where people have grown weary of corrupt ties between the tycoons and government.Samsung is by far the largest company among the chaebol, and for decades it has symbolized both power and wealth in South Korea.The court said it would hold a hearing on Thursday to decide whether Mr. Lee should be arrested. There was no immediate reaction from Samsung on Tuesday.The investigation of Mr. Lee, a third-generation scion of Samsung, has repercussions beyond the conglomerate. Its main company, Samsung Electronics, accounts for 20 percent of the country\u2019s total exports. Many Koreans fear that Mr. Lee\u2019s arrest would hurt the national economy by depriving South Korea\u2019s largest conglomerate of a crucial decision maker.But anticorruption campaigners said Mr. Lee\u2019s case was a test of whether the country was ready to crack down on the white-collar crimes of the chaebol and their collusive ties with government.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, French Presidential Candidate, Faces Formal Investigation", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 French prosecutors said Friday that they had begun a full-scale investigation into whether a leading presidential candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, had embezzled public funds.The announcement advanced what had been a preliminary inquiry into reports that Mr. Fillon had misused public funds to a new stage in which charges could be brought against him. It also threw an already unsettled presidential race further into turmoil.Mr. Fillon\u2019s legal difficulties increase the possibility \u2014 unprecedented in modern French history \u2014 that the presidential election this spring could be fought between two candidates from outside the major political parties. One is the far-right leader of the National Front, Marine Le Pen; the other is Emmanuel Macron, a centrist and former economy minister who is not affiliated with a party.Until last month, Mr. Fillon, the candidate of the center-right Republicans party, seemed set to cruise to France\u2019s presidency with little difficulty. A conservative former prime minister, he has campaigned on promises of absolute probity and a program of austerity to curb France\u2019s soaring deficit.But those planks were overtaken last month when Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9, a leading investigative and satirical newspaper, published articles suggesting that Mr. Fillon\u2019s wife, Penelope, had for years been paid out of public funds as her husband\u2019s parliamentary assistant without having done any work. His children were also reported to have been on the payroll. Altogether, hundreds of thousands of dollars are suspected to have been embezzled \u2014 sums that staggered the French.Prosecutors said at the time that they would take a preliminary look at the allegations, and Mr. Fillon\u2019s standing in the polls immediately plunged. The prosecutor\u2019s office said on Friday that it would hand over the case to investigating magistrates, who would look into Mr. Fillon\u2019s suspected \u201cmisuse of public funds.\u201dThe investigative judges have the power to summon Mr. Fillon and others for questioning. His lawyers will now have access to the case files and will have more opportunities to file procedural appeals, which could likely delay the filing of formal charges until after the election.Still, the full investigation is expected to further damage Mr. Fillon\u2019s appeal among the conservative, often middle-class voters who had supported his victory in the primary. His decline in popularity in rural areas where his focus on integrity was his strongest appeal has been amply documented in the French news media.Mr. Fillon has angrily denied wrongdoing in speeches, news conferences and television appearances, and he has largely blamed the news media for his problems. His combative stance and his vow to stay in the race \u2014 and the lack of an alternative for center-right voters \u2014 have enabled him to rally his core supporters and to partly claw his way back in the polls.By Friday, he had regained second place in many surveys, behind Ms. Le Pen and ahead Mr. Macron.Under the French system, if no presidential candidate wins a majority of votes, the top two candidates move on to a second round. Ms. Le Pen is expected to win the first round, but the polling until now has suggested that either Mr. Fillon or Mr. Macron would defeat her in round two.Many conservative voters are thought to be skeptical of Mr. Macron\u2019s service in the Socialist government, his youth (he is 39) and his inexperience.A series of recent gaffes caused an uproar on the right. On a visit to Algeria, Mr. Macron declared France\u2019s colonization of the country a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d \u2014 a red flag in France, where memories of the bloody war over Algerian independence are not so distant.The comment cost Mr. Macron in the polls, helping both Mr. Fillon and Ms. Le Pen, who faces an inquiry of her own over the possible abuse of public funds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feeling \u2018Pressure All the Time\u2019 on Europe\u2019s Treadmill of Temporary Work", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter graduating with degrees in accounting and finance from a university in Finland, Ville Markus Kieloniemi thought he would at least find an entry-level job in his field. He studied potential employers, tailoring his applications accordingly.He wound up churning through eight temporary jobs over the next three years. He worked variously as a hotel receptionist and as a salesman in men\u2019s clothing stores, peddling tailored suits and sportswear.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to manage your finances or even get housing, let alone start a career,\u201d said Mr. Kieloniemi, 23, who added depth to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by accepting unpaid office jobs and internships in New York and Spain, mostly at his own expense. \u201cYou feel pressure all the time.\u201dMeet the new generation of permatemps in Europe.For those stuck in this employment netherworld, life is a cycle of constant job searches. Confidence can give way to doubt as career prospects seem to fade. Young people talk of delaying marriage and families indefinitely. And though many were grateful for any workplace experience, they were also cynical about companies that treated them like disposable labor.What follows is a selection of experiences from this growing group of permatemps: an Italian oncologist who spent almost as much time trying to find her next three-month contract as she did helping cancer patients; a French human-resources expert grappling with the psychological toll of temporary work; and, among others, a German tourism specialist who gave up his passion for a stable job in an unrelated field.The search for temporary employment can be a full-time job.Alessandra Sisco, Doctor\u2018I\u2019d fix up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 all the time, and that\u2019s your life.\u2019Alessandra Sisco, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer patients, never dreamed she would have to leave her home in Italy to find steady work. But in a stagnant economy, she was trapped in a web of short-term contracts.Since finishing her five-year oncology residency in 2012, she has only been able to get three- to five-month temporary contracts that Italy\u2019s public and private hospitals largely rely on to manage staffing. The full-time jobs often went to people from well-connected families, or those with ties to senior hospital officials.She became stuck in a loop, trying to divine whether her jobs might be extended, and struggling to land another position since they usually weren\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019d fix up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 all the time, and that\u2019s your life,\u201d Mrs. Sisco, 35, said.\u201cI was constantly looking for something else,\u201d she added. \u201cI was held back. There was no professional growth, and the earnings were low.\u201dTemporary employees are paid an average of 19 percent less than their permanent counterparts, according to Eurofound, the research arm of the European Union.In November, she interviewed for hospital internships in New York. \u2018\u2018At least there would be hope for the future,\u201d she said.Temporary work has become widespread in the United States, too, where the explosion of the so-called gig economy has made job-hopping the new norm for a growing pool of young workers. But the situation is verging on the extreme in Europe, giving the perniciousness of the problem the potential to play on an entire generation. Millions of people across Europe are searching for work amid jobless rates that are still nearly twice as high as in the United States.Relocating would mean having to do a new five-year residency on top of her extensive training and experience. But the prospect of spending her career as a doctor doing temporary work was more than she could bear.\u201cWhen I started thinking of moving, I stopped thinking about what I was not getting,\u201d said Mrs. Sisco, who hopes to be able to move her family and start a new life in the coming months.\u201cWhen you see that you\u2019re actually appreciated for your work, you\u2019re happy,\u201d she added excitedly. \u201cFinally, I will have peace of mind because I know everything I\u2019ve worked for is going to be earned and deserved.\u201dStarting a family or getting a mortgage can be a major challenge.Sam Mee, Social Analysis and Research \u2018I was forced to put off big life decisions.\u2019At 36, Sam Mee thought his life would have been settled by now. A career in research and social policy. A family. A home. At the very least a cellphone.But even the basics can be unachievable, as Mr. Mee finds himself on a treadmill of temporary contracts.\u201cI had this idea that I would study hard, work hard, get the job I studied for, then ask my girlfriend to marry me,\u201d Mr. Mee said.A British national, Mr. Mee thought his master\u2019s studies in social analysis would make him attractive to companies and nongovernmental organizations that research behaviors and trends. \u201cI\u2019d buy a house and have kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the dream.\u201dHe moved to Amsterdam before the financial crisis to be with his girlfriend and to start his career. Yet in a country where more than 20 percent of job contracts are temporary, he was never able to find permanent work in his area of expertise. He now has a temporary contract with a firm that does business-to-business collections, including calling airlines to settle outstanding invoices.The temporary-work trend is accelerating around Europe, as employers seek more flexibility to fire and hire workers, and shun permanent contracts with expensive costs and labor protections. In Spain alone, the government reported that 18 million temporary contracts were handed out last year, compared with 1.7 million long-term jobs.\u201cI want a career more than anything, but I feel like I\u2019m in a position where a 25-year-old would be,\u201d said Mr. Mee, who has hired a job coach and set up his own website to improve his prospects. \u201cI was forced to put off big life decisions.\u201d\u201cYou feel stuck,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re young, you have a lot to offer, but no one will give you a chance.\u201dTemporary contracts blocked more than just his career. Real estate agents were reluctant to deal with Mr. Mee, and it was impossible to get a mortgage at the bank. Nor could he obtain a credit card, lacking steady income. Even mobile-phone companies would not give him a contract; he had to get one through his girlfriend, who has a full-time job as a midwife.\u201cBut in the end,\u201d Mr. Mee said, \u201cI was like, to hell with it. I\u2019m not going to keep putting life on hold because the market won\u2019t let me.\u201dRecently, he asked his girlfriend to marry him. She accepted; the wedding is planned for this year.\u201cWe want to do everything 50-50,\u201d he said, before pausing. \u201cBut everything\u2019s just a little bit tight.\u201dA revolving door of work exerts a psychological toll.Charles Terraz, Human Resources\u2018It\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of burnout or depression.\u2019Charles Terraz never used to live with chronic stress, health scares or recurring anxiety. But these days, they have become close companions as he bounces through a series of temporary contracts as a recruiter at industrial and pharmaceutical companies, each of which leaves him a little more drained and racked by uncertainty about his career.Armed with a master\u2019s degree in human resources and economics and business degrees, Mr. Terraz, a native of Lyon, France, was confident of finding work at a large company. Yet in the country\u2019s struggling economy, where more than 80 percent of all new hires are temporary, that proved virtually impossible.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stress about the future and money,\u201d said Mr. Terraz, who is 29. \u201cThe fear of becoming unemployed weighs on you.\u201dThat precariousness fueled sleepless nights and nagging self-doubts. He sustained severe stress and recurring migraines, spending two weeks recovering in a hospital. \u201cIt was a horrible experience,\u201d he said.Today, Mr. Terraz is a recruiter at a French pharmaceutical company, but only for six months. The stress over money and finding the next job remains. \u201cYou have to keep a smile and be mentally strong,\u201d he said. In private, though, \u201cyou feel excluded from society.\u201d\u201cThree years ago, I had dreams, ambitions for a great career,\u201d he added. \u201cBut right now I have nothing. It\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of burnout or depression sometimes. If I was the only one this was happening to, O.K., but most of my friends are in the same position.\u201dTreating employees like disposable labor is bad for companies, too.Joost Minnaar, Scientist\u2018In one fell swoop, all our excitement and engagement vanished.\u2019Joost Minnaar, an industrious Dutchman, had a dream job in Barcelona, Spain, as a nanotechnologist at a German company with 30 other scientists, working on new developments for television, tablet and computer displays. Each held one-year renewable contracts, with the promise of potentially going full time after two years.It never happened.The company was hiring groups of 30 scientists at a time on temporary contracts, which management would let expire to avoid the cost of hiring people full time. Mr. Minnaar and his colleagues discovered that they were the third such group in four years.It is an increasing reality across Europe. Since 2012, just 20 percent of temporary workers have made the leap to full-time work, according to Eurofound.\u201cWe were trapped in the strategy of this multinational, which was just waiting to discard us after two years of hard work,\u201d Mr. Minnaar said. \u201cIn one fell swoop, all our excitement and engagement vanished.\u201dMorale slumped.\u201cProductivity became really bad, and people started to become really disengaged from work, which was strange because we were doing interesting stuff,\u201d he recalled.Employees dragged their feet on projects and openly looked for jobs. Others grew wary of colleagues, whom they viewed as competitors for any permanent jobs that might arise elsewhere at the firm.\u201cBy doing this, the company was destroying their own workers,\u201d said Mr. Minnaar, who is 30. \u201cThe lesson was, if you treat people like this, if you don\u2019t give them security or trust over the long term, they won\u2019t do a good job for you.\u201dTaking any job just to survive means dealing with trade-offs.Cristian Meiler, Tourism and Hospitality\u2018There\u2019s a sense that you\u2019ve given in, that you\u2019ve surrendered.\u2019Cristian Meiler had always worked in tourism and hospitality in Spain, following a passion that had grabbed him as a teenager. He served as a hotel bellhop in his hometown, Barcelona, manned reception desks, and waited tables at restaurants. He is fluent in five languages and has a degree in hotel management.Despite decades of experience, he never managed to land a prized full-time job. When a permanent offer did come, however, he hesitated.Mr. Meiler had been working a temporary job at a sports equipment company\u2019s call center in Barcelona to help supplement his income from short-term contracts at hotels and cruise ships, where he welcomed and checked in guests. Accepting a full-time gig as a service representative at the sports company in Munich would mean abandoning his career path.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that you\u2019ve given in, that you\u2019ve surrendered,\u201d said Mr. Meiler, 35, who remembers accompanying his mother, a tour guide, as a youth around Spain. \u201cYou want to stay on the path you\u2019ve been working on for so long.\u201cThen I thought, what if there is no better job waiting for me?\u201d he continued. \u201cI needed work. I needed stability. And you always have the sense that I can\u2019t complain, because there\u2019s millions of other people without a job.\u201dMr. Meiler has adapted quickly to his new role in Germany, and he feels lucky to be working in a collegial atmosphere.Still, sometimes a nagging voice whispers that he took the easy way out. If he could find a stable job in his field back in Spain, he said, \u201cI\u2019d be on a plane the next day.\u201dA sense of relief accompanies a permanent job.Laura Hickey, Arts\u2018It\u2019s definitely good to have security.\u2019In a typical week, Laura Hickey, 26, was spending three days working at a theater in Edinburgh under a contract with no guaranteed income. The rest of the week was devoted to sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and angling for interviews in a bid to nail an elusive permanent job. She worked at three companies, including a youth orchestra and an arts foundation, just in the past year.After struggling for nearly two years, Ms. Hickey, who studied art history, finally got lucky: Last month, she landed a full-time job at the Scottish Rugby Association as a ticket sales representative.\u201cIt was an immense relief,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was harder than I ever thought it would be to get permanent work, but now I can get settled and focus on the future, without worrying about having to find the next thing.\u201dShe now has steady hours at an office every day, a regular paycheck with overtime, and a sense that she can settle down and start forging some kind of a career path. Her passion is still the arts, but her new job may present opportunities that she had never dreamed of. And in a dicey job market, she figures it is better to start working her way up the ladder where she is rather than risk starting all over again.\u201cI\u2019m keeping an open mind,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely good to have security.\u201dPalko Karasz contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

Her most recent job was in the White House serving as senior deputy director of public engagement and special assistant to President Barack Obama.But she also brought a personal connection to politics \u2014 she is the granddaughter of Cesar Chavez, the great labor leader for farmworkers.Ever since, those battles have shaped her path, she said.We caught up with Ms. Rodriguez by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation:\u2022 Tell me about your gig. What have you been up to?Where do I begin? I think obviously building out our team here, making sure that we have a staff that really reflects the face of California.\u2026 More recently, we\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of constituents\u2019 requests and services that came as a result of the executive orders that we saw from the administration around immigrants and refugees and what we\u2019ve seen in the context of the travel ban. So we\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of casework in that area as well.\u2022 What are you hearing from unauthorized immigrants in the state? And what are you telling them?I think that there is a tremendous amount of growing concern and fear in particular among immigrant communities. I think what the senator has been able to do and what we\u2019ve been able to do here in the state in the short amount of time that we\u2019ve actually been in office is show that she will continue to be a voice for them and for the state of California.\u2022 What do you think your grandfather would make of all this?I try not to speak for him too often. But I think given the work that he did over the course of his lifetime and given the role that he played to shed light on the inhumane treatment of farmworkers that he himself experienced, I think that he would really call into question the lack of humanity in a lot of both the rhetoric as well as the policies that we\u2019re seeing coming out of this current administration.\u2022 You were in Washington for more than seven years. How is it coming back to California?I am so excited to be back in my home state. And in case you can\u2019t hear my smile through the phone, it is an ear-to-ear grin.

{"Headline": "No, Robots Aren\u2019t Killing the American Dream", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDefenders of globalization are on solid ground when they criticize President Trump\u2019s threats of punitive tariffs and border walls. The economy can\u2019t flourish without trade and immigrants.But many of those defenders have their own dubious explanation for the economic disruption that helped to fuel the rise of Mr. Trump.Blaming robots, though, while not as dangerous as protectionism and xenophobia, is also a distraction from real problems and real solutions.The rise of modern robots is the latest chapter in a centuries-old story of technology replacing people. Automation is the hero of the story in good times and the villain in bad. Since today\u2019s middle class is in the midst of a prolonged period of wage stagnation, it is especially vulnerable to blame-the-robot rhetoric.And yet, the data indicate that today\u2019s fear of robots is outpacing the actual advance of robots. If automation were rapidly accelerating, labor productivity and capital investment would also be surging as fewer workers and more technology did the work. But labor productivity and capital investment have actually decelerated in the 2000s.While breakthroughs could come at any time, the problem with automation isn\u2019t robots; it\u2019s politicians, who have failed for decades to support policies that let workers share the wealth from technology-led growth.The response in previous eras was quite different.When automation on the farm resulted in the mass migration of Americans from rural to urban areas in the early decades of the 20th century, agricultural states led the way in instituting universal public high school education to prepare for the future. At the dawn of the modern technological age at the end of World War II, the G.I. Bill turned a generation of veterans into college graduates.When productivity led to vast profits in America\u2019s auto industry, unions ensured that pay rose accordingly.Corporate efforts to keep profits high by keeping pay low were countered by a robust federal minimum wage and time-and-a-half for overtime.Fair taxation of corporations and the wealthy ensured the public a fair share of profits from companies enriched by government investments in science and technology.Productivity and pay rose in tandem for decades after World War II, until labor and wage protections began to be eroded. Public education has been given short shrift, unions have been weakened, tax overhauls have benefited the rich and basic labor standards have not been updated.As a result, gains from improving technology have been concentrated at the top, damaging the middle class, while politicians blame immigrants and robots for the misery that is due to their own failures. Eroded policies need to be revived, and new ones enacted.Tax reform that increases revenue from corporations and the wealthy could help pay for retraining and education to protect and prepare the work force for foreseeable technological advancements.Legislation to foster child care, elder care and fair scheduling would help employees keep up with changes in the economy, rather than losing ground.If reforms are not enacted \u2014 as is likely with President Trump and congressional Republicans in charge \u2014 Americans should blame policy makers, not robots.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law-Abiding but Illegal, and Fearing the New Trump Rules", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkDelfin Polanco waits on Thursday morning for a lawyer to help him stay in the country where he raised his son and has lived for 22 years.Like about 40 others, he arrived by 5 a.m. in Lower Manhattan for a legal clinic offered for immigrants by Catholic Charities. It will be hours before he is seen.To pass the time, Mr. Polanco thumbs through pictures on his phone and cards in his wallet.There he is outside the old Yankee Stadium in 2008, behind two men carrying championship trophies, part of the crew that was moving the team into its new home down the block.Here he is on the Teamsters union card that he got in 1999, which lets him work as a mover.And there is his medical card, listing him as a patient of a clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he goes for treatment of the breathing ailments that he got after working on the cleanup of the World Trade Center site. \u201cLook,\u201d Mr. Polanco says. \u201cI had hair.\u201dNow he is 47 and not much is left. Mr. Polanco moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1995 when he married an American citizen. Along the way, they divorced. \u201cThey stamped \u2018deport\u2019 on my work paper seven years ago and tell me to come back every year for the inspection,\u201d he said.Inevitably, some large, uncountable number are here without permission. The enforcement of immigration laws depends on a cat\u2019s cradle of rules and policies strung together by successive presidential administrations. Over time, the population of foreign-born people in the United States who do not have citizenship, working papers or other visas is thought to have grown to 11 million. Many national Republicans once advocated comprehensive immigration reform, but such views became heresy with the rise of the Tea Party after the 2008 financial crisis.The political stalemate meant the continued growth of a jury-rigged system that allowed tacit acceptance of people who were law-abiding, apart from their immigration status. Like, for instance, Mr. Polanco.The first people arrived at the clinic this week at 4:30 a.m. to make sure they could see one of the five lawyers and three counselors. Dionne Raymon, 42, a mother of three who was born in Jamaica and has been in the United States for 24 years, was there by 5.\u201cLast week, I couldn\u2019t see anyone because I didn\u2019t get here until 8:30,\u201d Ms. Raymon said. \u201cI had to get the kids out to school. They are off this week.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been to jail,\u201d Mr. Polanco said. \u201cTickets, nothing.\u201dHis son, born in the United States, is about to start college, but is still too young to \u201cclaim\u201d his father under kinship citizenship eligibility. Mr. Polanco frets that returning to the Dominican Republic will put medical care for his lung problems beyond his means. \u201cI came here, I was young,\u201d Mr. Polanco said. \u201cNow I am old.

{"Headline": "At Town Halls, Doses of Fury and a Bottle of Tums", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFAIRVIEW, Tenn. \u2014 Representative Marsha Blackburn may have expected to draw a friendly crowd by scheduling a town hall-style meeting in a Tennessee community that had voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, but she instead faced a hurricane-strength blast of disapproval on Tuesday.Ms. Blackburn, an eight-term Republican, was sharply questioned about a wide range of issues that have unsettled Mr. Trump\u2019s first month in office, including health care, the environment, education and the president\u2019s links to Russia.At many moments, her replies elicited boos or shouts to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not stupid; you have to do better,\u201d Renee Armand said at one point, interrupting Ms. Blackburn as she was defending the new education secretary, Betsy DeVos, for bringing \u201ca true love of education reform.\u201dMs. Blackburn, who represents a safe Republican seat west of Nashville, was among the latest wave of Washington lawmakers to face angry constituents in what, inevitably but perhaps prematurely, has been called a progressive echo of the Tea Party anger that boiled over in town halls eight years ago.During the first weeklong recess of the new Congress, many Republicans have chosen not to hold events at all, wary of protests that might greet them.Others gamely faced the music, including Representative Dennis A. Ross of Florida and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who faced largely hostile audiences on Tuesday in districts that, like Ms. Blackburn\u2019s, had strongly endorsed Mr. Trump at the polls.At one point, Mr. Grassley, a long-serving senator, was offered a gift from a 62-year-old Democratic pig farmer named Chris Petersen: a bottle of Tums.\u201cYou\u2019re going to need them in the next few years,\u201d Mr. Petersen told the senator, drawing laughter from a crowd packed into a room at a firehouse in Iowa Falls, north of Des Moines.Mr. Grassley later quipped that \u201cthe only time I need Tums is when I have chocolate ice cream before I go to bed.\u201dAnxious and agitated constituents of Mr. Grassley\u2019s clapped and yelled out in frustration in a rural county that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump.Mr. Petersen, the vice chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Rural Caucus, gave a stern warning about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWith all due respect, sir, you\u2019re the man that talked about the death panels,\u201d Mr. Petersen said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to create one great big death panel in this country.\u201dRepublicans have accused the protesters who have roiled town hall-style meetings of not representing a true grass-roots outpouring but instead being an AstroTurf movement paid by shadowy groups.Mr. Trump added his own voice to the criticism on Tuesday.The forums have faced threats of violence, prompting some lawmakers, citing security concerns, to cancel events after being briefed by law enforcement.But Mr. Grassley suggested the crowds were no less bona fide than the more friendly ones he usually gets when he makes his annual tour of all 99 Iowa counties.\u201cI want to make clear it\u2019s all legitimate,\u201d he told reporters after his second meeting of the day, in Garner, Iowa. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had been elected president, there\u2019d be people from the conservative end of the spectrum to probably be doing the same thing.\u201dMr. Ross, one of the most conservative members of Congress and an enthusiastic defender of Mr. Trump\u2019s, was called a liar by participants in his town hall in Clermont, Fla., about 20 miles west of Orlando. They held signs reading \u201cDisagree,\u201d \u201cNyet My President\u201d and \u201cNo Pipeline.\u201dA few supporters of Mr. Ross\u2019s walked out of his meeting, saying they were upset that the congressman was unable to talk without catcalls.One protester tried to reason with the passionate crowd, urging people to let Mr. Ross speak and adding that if they were angry, the correct response was to vote.\u201cBut in the meantime, let him talk so we can hold him accountable,\u201d she added.\u201cThis is democracy in action,\u201d Mr. Ross said at one point. \u201cThere are a lot of people who want to participate in the dialogue. I only ask that you give them that respect and civility.\u201dBut most of the people in the crowd wanted to be heard, loud and clear, on a litany of issues. One woman said she could not understand how Mr. Ross could oppose the presence of undocumented immigrants, given that the district was dependent on agriculture. \u201cIt\u2019s so detrimental to our identity as a state and to the economy,\u201d she said before disappearing into the crowd.Back in Tennessee, a number of those facing Ms. Blackburn were rallied by the local branch of Indivisible, a national movement started by Democratic activists. The group had held two meetings to discuss which issues to raise.One of the organizers, Elizabeth TeSelle, a university administrator, disavowed the Tea Party comparison. She said Indivisible supporters were not seeking to push moderate Democrats further to the left, or to oust them by running more extreme candidates against them in primaries. \u201cMy concern is what the Tea Party ended up spawning was Trump,\u201d Ms. TeSelle said.Ms. Blackburn, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s high-profile supporters in the House of Representatives during last year\u2019s campaign, defended him on nearly every issue raised by critics.One man called Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, \u201ca notorious white nationalist.\u201d Ms. Blackburn replied, \u201cMy interactions with him have all been fine.\u201dA high school senior, Taylor Ayres, asked how she could support Ms. DeVos, \u201csomeone who doesn\u2019t have real knowledge in the education field.\u201d Ms. Blackburn said coolly, \u201cShe is going to do a fine job.\u201dBruce Sullivan asked why Republicans had no real replacement for the Affordable Care Act after seven years. Ms. Blackburn referred him to a C-Span video from 2010 in which she and other Republicans had met with President Barack Obama to seek a bipartisan program.\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said, a hint of sarcasm in his voice. \u201cYou are showing us you have been in Washington too long.\u201dAt least one lawmaker, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, had a quieter day. Appearing before a few hundred residents in a high school cafeteria in Denham Springs, La., after the students had spilled out into a warm afternoon, Mr. Cassidy, a Republican, spoke to anxious residents mostly about their more pressing concern: flood relief.Their parish, Livingston, had received more than 25 inches of rain in three days during a catastrophic flood in August, overwhelming the rivers and devastating the city. Protesters said they had steered clear of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s forum out of respect for the flood victims.As Mr. Cassidy answered queries submitted on slips of paper, a woman asked if he would take questions from the floor, saying she worried they had been screened.As if to prove that they were not, Mr. Cassidy read aloud a question about Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, eliciting applause and cheers from many of those assembled.\u201cLooks like we have some folks who don\u2019t like Donald Trump,\u201d he said to more cheers. \u201cA lot of us do.\u201dTrip Gabriel reported from Fairview, Tenn.; Thomas Kaplan from Iowa Falls and Garner, Iowa; Lizette Alvarez from Clermont, Fla.; and Emmarie Huetteman from Denham Springs, La.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tony Blair Wants \u2018Brexit\u2019 Opponents to \u2018Rise Up.\u2019 But Will Anyone Listen?", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With his reputation tarnished by his support for the Iraq war, former Prime Minister Tony Blair is a diminished figure these days in Britain, the country he led for a decade.In a speech in London, Mr. Blair castigated the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, which he said was \u201cobsessed\u201d with a withdrawal from the 28-nation bloc, a process known as Brexit. He said ideologues were driving the process, and he warned of the \u201cpossibility of the breakup\u201d of Britain amid strong support in Scotland for independence. A majority of Scottish voters supported remaining in the European Union.Before the referendum, a majority of lawmakers from both major parties had opposed a departure, as had Mrs. May and Mr. Blair.But after British voters decided in a June referendum to leave the bloc, leading Prime Minister David Cameron to step down, going against the outcome of the referendum seemed politically toxic. Mrs. May committed to honoring the result and to making the departure happen.Though the unelected House of Lords has yet to vote on the matter, Britain now seems set on a path to a \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2014 a clean, if turbulent, break \u2014 with Mrs. May arguing that Britain should leave the European single market, a free-trade zone in goods and some services, as well as the customs union, which eliminates tariffs and customs checks.Mr. Blair\u2019s many critics on the left and right were swift to respond to his plea on Friday. They accused him of ignoring the outcome of a democratic referendum, in which 52 percent of those who voted opted to leave and 48 percent to remain.The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused Mr. Blair of \u201carrogance,\u201d while Kate Hoey, a Labour lawmaker who had argued for withdrawal, described Mr. Blair\u2019s speech as \u201cpatronizing.\u201dThe foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, one of the leading proponents of a British exit, mocked Mr. Blair. \u201cRise up and turn off the TV the next time Tony Blair is on,\u201d he said.Almost two decades after Mr. Blair swept to power in a landslide electoral victory, his delivery on Friday was fluent and familiar, calling on pro-Europeans to try to change the terms of the debate by creating an understanding of the costs, \u201cas the facts of Brexit become clear.\u201dThe government\u2019s objective is to pursue \u201cBrexit at any cost,\u201d he said. \u201cOur challenge is to expose relentlessly what that cost is,\u201d he continued, and to find \u201ca way out from the present rush over the cliff\u2019s edge.\u201dMr. Blair argued that Britons had voted to leave the bloc without knowing what would replace membership, and, taking questions after his speech, he likened the decision to agreeing to swap homes without seeing the other house.\u201cNow they are going to see it,\u201d he said, adding that he suspected people might \u201cscratch their heads and start changing their minds.\u201dOpponents will, he suggested, discover that there will be \u201cmisery,\u201d yet no effect on the type of immigration about which they were most concerned \u2014 from outside the European Union, which he said the government already controls but has failed to curb.Mr. Blair said he intended to set up an institute to make the case against a \u201cBrexit at any cost,\u201d but he denied planning to establish a centrist political party, as some have speculated.Nevertheless, while fiercely critical of the government, Mr. Blair was equally hard on the Labour Party, which, under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, is badly trailing Mrs. May\u2019s Conservatives in opinion polls. \u201cThe debilitation of the Labour Party is the facilitator of Brexit,\u201d he asserted.Many voters who normally support Labour ignored their advice on the referendum and supported a British departure from the bloc, provoking a deep crisis of confidence in the party. So far, there is little sign that these voters, or the population in general, have changed their minds in significant numbers.Like Mrs. May, almost all of the Conservative Party has embraced a British exit from the European Union since the referendum.Mrs. May has leaned toward a clean break, reflecting her desire to prioritize the right to control immigration from Continental Europe and to remove Britain from the orbit of the European Court of Justice, two points that make membership in the single market impossible. Her hope that Britain can strike trade deals with non-European countries suggests that she is also likely to remove Britain from the customs union.Mr. Blair is disliked by many activists in the Labour Party because of the Iraq war and because of his financial dealings since leaving power. But his allies estimate that he has more support among the general population, and they point out that he won three elections, the last of which was in 2005, after the United States-led invasion of Iraq.His speech was welcomed by the Liberal Democrats, a centrist and pro-European party that has called for the specific terms of Brexit negotiations to be put to voters in another referendum.Yet even some pro-Europeans say it was too soon for Mr. Blair to make this type of argument. So far, Britain\u2019s economy has not suffered the downturn the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign had predicted. While there are signs that inflation is rising, because of the fall in the value of the pound, there are few indications that voters have begun to feel the effects.Britain has not even started negotiations, let alone left the bloc, and Mrs. May\u2019s critics say that as the reality of a British exit nears, the economy will suffer \u2014 particularly if negotiations with the European Union go badly, as appears likely.Mr. Blair\u2019s argument was, in effect, a call to prepare for that possibility, though he conceded that his own intervention was likely to prompt \u201ca volley of abuse.\u201dAsked if he was the best person to advance the pro-European argument, he said that voters could \u201clike the messenger or not like the messenger.\u201d\u201cI have the right to speak,\u201d he said, \u201cand you have the right to listen \u2014 or not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Trump\u2019s Bad Two-for-One Deal", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere are sound ways to streamline regulations, but boxing in regulators this way is neither advisable nor necessary. Since 2011, federal agencies have been systematically reviewing rules on the books, under a governmentwide effort begun by President Barack Obama to revise and eliminate duplicative or outdated rules and to identify regulatory gaps where new rules are needed. The \u201clook-back\u201d program \u2014 which brought net savings of some $37 billion over five years \u2014 makes Mr. Trump\u2019s order all the more worrisome, because many unneeded rules have already been purged. Regulations that are necessary to protect the public, including environmental rules that safeguard health, are now at risk.For example, the Environmental Protection Agency would have to repeal limitations on some pollutants \u2014 mercury, perhaps \u2014 in order to impose new regulations, like the updated limits on lead in drinking water that are on the agency\u2019s agenda this year. The nation\u2019s environmental laws do not instruct the E.P.A. to make such trade-offs, but, in effect, the executive order does. Similarly, Congress never told the Food and Drug Administration to choose among food-label accuracy, drug safety and the purity of cosmetics in carrying out the nation\u2019s product safety laws. Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order would force the agency to make such choices.The order\u2019s heavy-handedness puts environmentalists and consumer advocates on solid ground to argue in court that the two-for-one repeal formula is arbitrary and capricious, and thus illegal. But as long as the order is in force, rulemaking \u2014 a basic function of governance \u2014 will be greatly impaired.Mr. Trump has said that the order will reduce out-of-control regulatory burdens. But as part of the look-back program, the Obama administration successfully prodded some federal agencies to make automatic review of regulations a standard practice. For instance, the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department have committed to review recent rules on fuel economy and emissions standards for light trucks in the coming years. Similarly, speed limits on large ships, renewed in 2013 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to reduce collisions with endangered whales, will be re-evaluated within five years and modified or repealed as needed.Ensuring that systematic reviews continue would help keep regulations up-to-date. And unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s two-for-one deal, it wouldn\u2019t impose an arbitrary formula.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Stealth, and Drones, to Document a Fading Hong Kong", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong JournalHONG KONG \u2014 Three masked explorers appeared atop an apartment tower in Hong Kong\u2019s North Point district and sent a black drone flying, over a clothesline, until it was buzzing more than 10 stories above the cars, trams and pedestrians on the street below.The authorities are \u201crenewing the city on behalf of the developers, not the people,\u201d said one of the explorers, who goes by the alias Ghost in videos and whose pollution mask and fingerless gloves gave him the air of a bank robber or graffiti artist.The explorers belong to HK Urbex, a so-called urban exploration collective whose expeditions often require trespassing or walks through dark, abandoned or dangerous sites. But unlike some urban explorers, they do not court danger purely for its own sake. Their primary goal is to peel back layers of history \u2014 sometimes literally, by digging through dust and trash \u2014 and forge a video archive of Hong Kong\u2019s colonial-era environment.\u201cUntil you peel them back, you don\u2019t know what existed before,\u201d said Ghost, 33. \u201cOthers are interested in the adrenaline rush, but we\u2019re interested in the story. What can it tell us about the past?\u201dMany buildings that went up here before Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 return to China from British colonial rule have already been replaced by taller ones, as exceptionally high property values create economic incentives to cram more towers into an already crowded skyline.But some buildings lie fallow for years between tenant evictions and demolition, and others, like the 1952 State Theater that the explorers filmed recently, are partly open to the public. The State Theater\u2019s main space, for example, is now a snooker hall. HK Urbex sees these structures as prime targets for urban expeditions.The group\u2019s eight members, all longtime Hong Kong residents, use aliases in their work to keep public attention focused on their mission instead of their personalities but also because anonymity helps shield them from potential legal trouble. They agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they be identified only by their aliases.The HK Urbex members often spend weeks researching obscure and abandoned sites before visiting them. Once inside, they document everyday items that they stumble upon \u2014 family portraits, X-rays, ancestral shrines, a broken piggy bank \u2014 and that will probably never be recorded in history books.But Professor Lee of the University of Hong Kong said that the second classification did not legally protect buildings from demolition, and that Hong Kong officials \u2014 unlike their counterparts in Singapore, another wealthy Asian city and former British colony \u2014 rarely bestowed conservation status on modernist landmarks like the State Theater.\u201cUnfortunately, the economy of Hong Kong is still very much pegged to property development,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, reached by telephone, declined to comment on HK Urbex or its activities.The group was formed in 2013 by Ghost and a friend, who goes by the alias Echo Delta. They both are part-time filmmakers, and they discovered their initial HK Urbex sites while scouting locations for film shoots, Echo Delta said.HK Urbex members say their videos are visual expressions of the \u201clocalist\u201d political movement that has recently gained support in Hong Kong and reflects a conviction among many younger people that their city\u2019s identity is distinct from that of the Chinese mainland.\u201cI guess we\u2019re indirectly political,\u201d Ghost said, as Echo Delta\u2019s drone buzzed above North Point.After filming the State Theater, whose structural supports soar above its roof in concrete parabolas like those of a suspension bridge, Echo Delta and Ghost took a taxi to the city\u2019s Central district. The idea was to check on some abandoned buildings that they have been monitoring over the years.One stop was Central Market, a 1930s landmark that Ghost had previously explored twice \u2014 first by sneaking past a security guard who was urinating and later by climbing in through a window.This time, a side door was unlocked.Echo Delta slipped inside, but a security guard quickly shooed him away.\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.On nearby Bridges Street, a white residential building that the pair had once sneaked into was now ringed by a fence, with \u201cX\u201d marks in its windows. \u201cThey\u2019ve cleared it out,\u201d said Echo Delta, whose alias is a play on his real-life nickname.Later, they saw that while several abandoned buildings near the Graham Street Market had been razed for new construction, others were still standing, right beside the market\u2019s open-air vegetable hawkers.One squat apartment building in particular, which had plants growing in its crevices, caught their eye. They lingered for a few minutes under its shadow, apparently transfixed by its architectural features.\u201cLook at those long windows,\u201d Echo Delta said quietly. \u201cVictorian \u2014 no, Georgian?\u201d\u201cThat would be one to look into,\u201d said Ghost, the only white member of HK Urbex. His alias plays on a Cantonese slang term for foreigners.His partner nodded.\u201cI bet it\u2019s going to be turned into a Starbucks,\u201d Echo Delta said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Proponent for Regulation to Depart, Leaving 3 Vacancies", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve official who led its efforts to strengthen financial regulation over the last eight years, announced on Friday that he planned to leave the central bank in early April.With Mr. Tarullo\u2019s resignation, there will be three vacancies on the Fed\u2019s seven-seat board, providing an opportunity for President Trump to start reshaping the Fed\u2019s approach to monetary policy and to the regulation of the financial industry.After Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, some Democrats privately urged Mr. Tarullo to remain in place for at least another year, but they did not convince him.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Tarullo said that he was proud of the progress made over the last eight years in strengthening financial regulation, particularly of the largest financial institutions.\u201cI think everybody that has been working on this can take some satisfaction in how much has changed,\u201d he said.Mr. Tarullo also said he was optimistic that what he regarded as the most important changes were likely to endure.\u201cI do think that the core changes, with respect to the biggest institutions in particular, which is increased capital, stress testing, liquidity requirements, increased risk-management expectations and a feasible resolution regime \u2014 I think that those are both very important, and I believe durable,\u201d he said.The \u201cresolution regime\u201d refers to rules for unwinding a large financial institution that fails.Mr. Tarullo acknowledged that congressional Republicans want to rewrite portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and he said that he favored some changes, particularly easing the burden of regulation for smaller institutions.Democrats publicly saluted Mr. Tarullo. Michael S. Barr, a top Treasury official in the Obama administration, described him as \u201ca hero of financial reform.\u201dDennis M. Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a group that sometimes clashed with Mr. Tarullo because it wanted stricter regulations, said that he worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for a replacement.\u201cI\u2019ve got a black armband on,\u201d Mr. Kelleher said. \u201cAnybody who cares about protecting the American people from another financial crash should be very worried merely from the statements President Trump has made and the people he has surrounded himself with.\u201dRepublicans, by contrast, were eager to wrest regulatory control from Mr. Tarullo.\u201cIt is incumbent upon all regulators to support the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. McHenry wrote in the letter, dated Jan. 31. \u201cAccordingly, the Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has had an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America\u2019s best interests.\u201dMr. Trump has no direct control over the Fed. Immediately upon taking office, he issued an executive order freezing regulatory work in the executive branch, but the order does not apply to independent agencies like the Fed.Senate Republicans preserved two board vacancies by refusing to vote on nominees recommended by President Obama, the same strategy they employed to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. Now Mr. Trump will be able to fill the third of seven seats almost as quickly.That could give Republicans four of the seven seats on the Fed\u2019s board. In 2012, in an effort to conciliate Senate Republicans, Mr. Obama appointed a Republican governor, Jerome H. Powell.Regulations mandated by law cannot be erased by the Fed, but the central bank has amply demonstrated in recent decades that indifferent enforcement serves the same purpose. Mr. Tarullo was a proponent of vigorous enforcement; under his leadership, the Fed asserted greater control over the regulators who worked at the Fed\u2019s 12 regional reserve banks. The Trump administration, by contrast, has expressed sympathy with industry complaints over that approach.Mr. Tarullo, an early supporter of Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, joined the Fed in January 2009, when he assumed responsibility for overhauling the Fed\u2019s approach to regulation. He was particularly influential in pushing for higher capital standards that require banks to obtain a larger share of their funding from investors, reducing reliance on borrowed money.In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new position at the Fed, a vice chairman for regulation. The Obama administration, judging that the Senate would not confirm Mr. Tarullo, chose to leave the position unfilled, allowing Mr. Tarullo to perform the work without the title.The Trump administration has begun a search for candidates for that position. Among those under consideration is David Nason, a former Treasury Department official who is now an executive at General Electric, according to a person familiar with the search.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

Mr. Bannon portrays the problem as flowing from something deeper: a shadowy \u201cadministrative state\u201d engineered by the left to advance its agenda.The state, in this view, is not an instrument of the American electorate, nor even a hurdle to be overcome as mainline conservatives often see it, but rather an adversary innately hostile to the people.This is a core argument of populist leaders, who typically rise by promising to oppose institutions, which are blamed for society\u2019s problems. But in practice, they often consolidate power away from those institutions for themselves.Mr. Bannon often cites sovereignty to argue that trade deals or other forms of cooperation will necessarily suborn American interests.This is different from isolationism, which argues that the United States should withdraw from the world. Rather, it is nationalism, which demands engagement but on ruthlessly competitive terms.This flows from an idea that the world\u2019s natural state is of clashing civilizations, an idea popularized by the scholar Samuel P. Huntington.When Mr. Bannon cites sovereignty \u2014 in this case, to increase deportations \u2014 he conveys a need to assert control against a vaguely defined enemy.Breitbart and like-minded websites often describe sovereignty as rooted in the nationalist premise that any nation-state is built around a core cultural identity that it must protect.The word \u201csovereignty,\u201d Mr. Kreiss said, asserts \u201ca defense of protecting an idea of what America is and should be.\u201d He said the \u201csymbolic core of the nation\u201d is being defined as white and Christian and seen itself as \u201cunder threat by cosmopolitanism and globalism.\u201dIn Mr. Bannon\u2019s populist worldview, the United States\u2019 traditional embrace of globalism is so clearly against American interests that it could only have been orchestrated by powerful elites.Those elites include, in his telling, the news media \u2014 \u201cglobalist\u201d for their embrace of trade and immigration, and \u201ccorporatist\u201d for serving the business interests that are presumed to benefit at Americans\u2019 expense.Here, Mr. Bannon also portrays it as representing elites, and therefore in natural opposition to populist sites like Breitbart, which he has characterized as representing the people. This is reflected in President Trump\u2019s assertions that the news media is the \u201cenemy of the American people.\u201dMr. Bannon is articulating a central idea of nationalists the world over: that the nation-state is the fundamental building block of humanity, with each nation defined by a fixed cultural identity.In this view, countries are in a natural state of permanent competition. Any international integration suborns the identity that is a nation\u2019s most important asset.Immigration is also seen as threatening that identity. This helps explain why Mr. Bannon portrays \u201copen borders\u201d as a danger to America\u2019s \u201cculture\u201d and \u201creason for being.\u201dOf course, every nation\u2019s identity and demographics change over time. But opposing those changes, Mr. Kreiss said, has proved powerful at mobilizing a community.\u201cIt\u2019s a very defined cultural and ideological movement that\u2019s giving voice to this and creating a framework for this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s powerful for a lot of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Everyone in Tech Cheers Visa Program for Foreign Workers", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The \u201cknowledge transfer sessions\u201d started a few months after Jeff Tan received notice last summer that he and about 80 co-workers would be laid off by the University of California, San Francisco, at the end of February.At daily two-hour meetings with employees from HCL Technologies, an Indian tech services company that had landed the outsourcing contract from U.C.S.F., Mr. Tan trained HCL staff members in India by videoconference and employees brought to the United States on H-1B visas how to do his job.But for tech workers like Mr. Tan, the program has had very negative consequences.\u201cI thought the purpose of H-1B visas was to give America a competitive edge, not help companies ship American jobs abroad,\u201d said Mr. Tan, who had worked for the university as an information technology systems administrator for 20 years. \u201cThis is now standard practice in the technology industry.\u201dA research report by Goldman Sachs estimates that 900,000 to a million H-1B visa holders now reside in the United States, and that they account for up to 13 percent of American technology jobs.In 2014, 13 outsourcing firms accounted for one-third of all H-1B visas. They use a loophole in the current first-come, first-served lottery system to flood the applicant pool with their candidates. In many cases, those candidates are paid slightly more than the $60,000-a-year minimum salary required by the program for dependent companies seeking a waiver from having to recruit Americans first \u2014 but less than what American technology workers make.Audrey Hatten-Milholin, 54, was notified in July that she would be laid off from the University of California, San Francisco, at the end of February after 17 years in its technology department. Along with eight others, she filed a complaint in November with California\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, charging that replacing her and others with \u201csignificantly younger, male\u201d workers \u201cwho will then perform the work overseas\u201d was discriminatory.\u201cWe are at a disadvantage as Americans,\u201d Ms. Hatten-Milholin said. \u201cThey look at it like, where can we get it cheaper? And for U.C., it\u2019s not here.\u201dProponents of the H-1B system argue that it is an important vehicle to attract top talent to America. After coming to the United States, these visa holders may apply their skills to start new companies or create new, innovative products \u2014 leading to more jobs in America.The debate over who wins and who loses as a result of the H-1B visa program echoes similar discussions of how free trade helps or hurts the economy. While the benefits are spread broadly throughout the economy, the costs are much more concentrated and easy to identify.After 11 years working in the I.T. department of Northeast Utilities, a Connecticut-based company now named Eversource Energy, Craig Diangelo was among 220 employees laid off in 2014. Before leaving the company, he was told he needed to train his replacement if he wanted to receive his severance.Mr. Diangelo, who is now 64 and was receiving $130,000 a year in salary and bonus, said he trained an employee from the Indian outsourcing firm Infosys who was an H-1B visa holder making $60,000 a year. There was also a team of workers in India making $6,000 a year that shadowed him on the computer.\u201cThe problem,\u201d he said, \u201cis that my job is still there. I went away. The American worker went away.\u201dA representative of Infosys declined to comment. Al Lara, a spokesman for Eversource Energy, said in a statement: \u201cWe made changes to our I.T. department three years ago during a period of transition and change to support the merger of our two companies while under much regulatory scrutiny. We are proud of the new I.T. organization.\u201d Mr. Lara was referring to a merger with NStar in 2012.In other instances, the jobs are filled only temporarily by H-1B workers \u2014 before the outsourcing firm moves the job permanently to a lower-cost country.\u201cThat\u2019s the endgame,\u201d said Sara Blackwell, a lawyer representing former employees of Walt Disney Company, Abbott Laboratories and other companies in discrimination claims pertaining to tech-job outsourcing.\u201cI\u2019m sure employers might not have as much choice as they would like, but if the shortage story were true, we\u2019d see wages rising more rapidly than they are,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. There is substantial unemployment, Mr. Baker said, even among workers in so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.Lawrence F. Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard, said companies like the H-1B visa program because it expands the pool of applicants. That means having to pay less in salary and retaining more control over employees.\u201cFrom the point of view of an economist, there are two big winners,\u201d he added. \u201cThe workers who come here with H-1B visas and the companies that employ them.\u201dWhile it remains to be seen what Mr. Trump will do, various members of Congress have proposed measures to change the H-1B system. One idea is to raise the $60,000-salary threshold for some H-1B workers to $100,000 or more. The hope is that this will narrow the gap between the standard pay for an American tech worker and that of a foreign worker.Another proposed measure is to change the current first-come, first-served lottery system that is benefiting outsourcing firms. Yet another idea is for a salary bidding system, in which companies bid on what they would be willing to pay an applicant, potentially making it more difficult to flood the applicant pool with lower-cost workers.According to the University of California, San Francisco, technology costs to run U.C.S.F. Health, which encompasses the university\u2019s hospital, medical center and patient care facilities, have tripled from 2011 to 2016. Outsourcing technology jobs will save the university more than $30 million over the next five years.But this argument has not spared the university from criticism for outsourcing the jobs because \u2014 as a public institution \u2014 it receives taxpayer funds and is a nonprofit organization.The university said neither it nor HCL would replace the laid-off employees with H-1B workers, although it acknowledges that HCL brought in some H-1B workers initially to understand the institution\u2019s technology needs. Those workers, U.C.S.F. said, are no longer working on the account.Mr. Tan, 55, said he was not worried about returning to the job market in a few weeks and understood why the university took such measures. However, he is concerned about what his children will do when they start looking for work.\u201cToday it\u2019s me, but tomorrow it\u2019s going to be a doctor or an engineer,\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do you draw the line?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the H-1B program\u2019s minimum salary requirement. The minimum salary is for dependent companies that seek a waiver from having to recruit Americans first, not for all companies hiring H-1B candidates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Munich, Pence Says U.S. Commitment to NATO Is \u2018Unwavering\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUNICH \u2014 Bearing what he said was a message from President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence told anxious European political and security leaders on Saturday that \u201cthe United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in our commitment to this trans-Atlantic alliance.\u201dBut while offering that assurance to European partners alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, along with some tough words on Russia and Ukraine, Mr. Pence also warned that Europe must increase its military spending in a dangerous world, saying, \u201cAs you keep faith with us, under President Trump, we will always keep faith with you.\u201dThe NATO treaty demands not only collective defense but a vow to \u201ccontribute our fair share to our common defense,\u201d Mr. Pence, making his first overseas trip as vice president, said at an annual security conference here.\u201cThat pledge has gone unfulfilled for too many for too long and erodes the very foundation of our alliance,\u201d he said. He echoed an early theme of Mr. Trump, who has said he believes that the United States\u2019 allies have taken advantage of American largess and not paid their fair share.\u201cEurope\u2019s defense requires your commitment as much as ours,\u201d Mr. Pence said.NATO allies have promised to reach the goal of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024, but only five countries now meet that figure. Germany, for instance, which has Europe\u2019s largest economy, now spends only 1.2 percent of G.D.P. on its military, though it increased spending 8 percent last year.Mr. Pence said that while some NATO members met the spending goal, \u201cmany others, including some of our largest allies, still lack a credible path.\u201d Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cexpects allies to meet that goal. For most, that means the time has come to do more.\u201dIt is a time of great anxiety in Europe, in no small part because of the rise of Mr. Trump, who has brushed aside long-held tenets of American foreign policy.Applause for Mr. Pence\u2019s speech was thin. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who spoke before the vice president, argued that increases in military spending must be gradual to be efficient and effective.Ms. Merkel said that spending on other matters \u2014 like development aid, education for girls and women, and caring for refugees \u2014 also contributes to mutual security, as do stronger multilateral institutions like the European Union and the United Nations, which Mr. Trump has criticized.Europe needs the support of the United States in the face of Islamist terrorism and Russian ambition, Ms. Merkel said, promising to continue to spend more to meet NATO goals. \u201cWe need the military strength of the United States,\u201d she said.But she warned against nationalism, without specifically naming Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy. \u201cWill we be able to continue working well together, or will we all fall back into our individual roles?\u201d she asked. \u201cLet\u2019s make the world better together, and then it will be better for each of us.\u201dMs. Merkel is facing a re-election campaign in September in which the extent of increased military spending is already a hot political issue, as is her handling of the influx of refugees into Europe.\u201cAmerican government officials need to go back to Washington recognizing that there are serious concerns in Europe, especially in Germany, about a host of issues from trade to foreign policy and NATO,\u201d said Steven E. Sokol, the president of the American Council on Germany.\u201cEven though they gave reassurance, people here will hold them to it, and it will make matters worse if these reassurances just pay lip service to those concerns and make it that much harder to rebuild trust in what is an indispensable partnership,\u201d he said.Strobe Talbott, the president of the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Mr. Pence had accomplished his main task by conveying the administration\u2019s commitment to NATO. \u201cIt had the big reassurance,\u201d Mr. Talbott said. \u201cHe made clear he was speaking for the president.\u201dLater in the day, John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, told the conference that Mr. Trump, as the White House has indicated, was \u201ccontemplating issuing a tighter, more streamlined version\u201d of his controversial executive order barring citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.Mr. Kelly added, \u201cI will have, this time, the opportunity to work on a rollout plan.\u201d The arrival of the earlier order was marked by confusion and distress, leaving many travelers stranded overseas. This time, he said, he would try to ensure that no one was caught in transit.\u201cIf they are in motion from some distant land, when they arrive they will be allowed in,\u201d he said. He said that would apply to green card and visa holders.But most of the emphasis on Saturday was on Mr. Pence\u2019s speech.Thierry de Montbrial, executive chairman of the French Institute of International Relations, said Mr. Pence had done a good job of \u201cdelivering the gospel that people needed of the importance of the trans-Atlantic alliance.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. de Montbrial said, \u201che said clearly that he wants Europe to be stronger, which in a way is a good change from the past, when Washington was skeptical about a stronger European defense.\u201dA senior White House foreign policy adviser, who was not authorized to discuss the trip and requested anonymity, said that Mr. Pence wanted to send a message of reassurance as well as obligation, both here and in Brussels, where he will meet with European Union and NATO officials on Monday.Part of that message was strong words on Russia, even as Europeans wonder about Mr. Trump\u2019s admiration for Mr. Putin.Mr. Pence vowed that the United States would \u201chold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which, as you know, President Trump believes can be found.\u201d He said the United States would hold Russia to its commitments to reach a permanent cease-fire in Ukraine.In his speech, Mr. Pence spoke of his first trip to Europe, in 1977 at age 18, and the impact a divided Berlin made on him when he crossed from West to East.\u201cThe vibrant color of the free world fell away,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that moment I came face to face with the choice facing the Western world between freedom and tyranny.\u201dCrediting past leaders in the East and West, he added: \u201cBy the grace of God, and through the leadership of Reagan, Thatcher, Kohl, Mitterrand, Havel, Walesa \u2014 the wall fell, Communism collapsed, and freedom prevailed.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the executive chairman of the French Institute of International Relations.

{"Headline": "A Malaysian Trilogy", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPENANG, Malaysia \u2014 How does he do it? How does Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia stay in power despite allegations that he embezzled $1 billion from a sovereign wealth fund?But both explanations place too much emphasis on agency among the elites and too little on structural causes.Mr. Najib remains in power because Malaysia has become an electoral one-party state and because UMNO has captured the Muslim-Malay majority by peddling communalism under the guise of promoting equality. The opposition has yet to find an alternative model on which to build a sustainable coalition for change.In 1969, after UMNO suffered an unprecedented electoral setback, Muslim Malays\u2019 longstanding grievances about their economic marginalization, a byproduct of British colonialism, devolved into widespread riots between the Malay majority and the Chinese minority. Two years of emergency rule followed.Abdul Razak Hussein, the first prime minister after the riots (and Mr. Najib\u2019s father), approached multiparty democracy with great cynicism. He co-opted opposition groups into the governing coalition. He permanently abolished local elections, which had previously put opposition parties in charge of municipalities and given them standing to challenge the federal government\u2019s authority. And his government tightened the sedition law to ban discussion of sensitive communal issues.The policy was a masterful move by UMNO to lock in support from Muslim-Malay voters, as well as fend off competition from the Islamist party Pas.The combination of communalism and authoritarianism that both Mr. Razak and Mr. Mahathir embedded into the system over the years helps explain Mr. Najib\u2019s resilience today.What glues many Malays to UMNO isn\u2019t just personal patronage, as Mr. Mahathir claims, but also, and much more so, communal patronage, reinforced by the system\u2019s authoritarian features. UMNO\u2019s affirmative action policies may have reached a dead-end, but even if the opposition hopes to transcend Malaysia\u2019s ethnic politics, it simply cannot do so right now. It has few options ahead of the next general election, which is expected to take place by August 2018.Malaysia needs a wholesale political transformation, but it isn\u2019t ready for one. Six decades after independence, true multiparty democracy is still a long way away.Chin-Huat Wong is a political scientist with the Penang Institute, a state government think tank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Failing Quebec\u2019s Muslims", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMONTREAL \u2014 \u201cWhere is it written in the criminal code that I don\u2019t have the right to leave someone a pig\u2019s head? Is it Islamophobic? Well, no, it\u2019s just an anodyne gesture.\u201dSo said the Quebec City radio host \u00c9ric Duhaime last summer, two days after a pig\u2019s head was left on the doorstep of the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec, the city\u2019s largest mosque. The severed bloodied head was wrapped in cellophane and festooned with ribbons.The blame for the shooting should not be laid on Mr. Duhaime and other radio hosts like him who gush with anti-Muslim sentiment. Quebec\u2019s 243,000 Muslims face far greater problems than a few radio personalities.But the trivialization of anti-Muslim crime and the outright demonization of Muslims, so common on Quebec City\u2019s airwaves, contribute to a poisonous political climate for Muslims across the province.Quebec\u2019s political class has been embroiled in a decade-long obsession over the place for the province\u2019s religious minorities in society. Because the discussion has focused largely on the Muslim veil, the effect has been further social and economic shunning of Muslims.Quebec\u2019s National Assembly is debating a bill that would compel much of the public service work force to keep their faces uncovered. The bill, which will probably be approved, comes just over three years after the previous Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government tried to pass the Quebec Charter of Values, a more restrictive law that would have banned the wearing of all religious symbols by anyone drawing a provincial government paycheck.This debate has only grown more intense. Seemingly inconsequential requests \u2014 as when, in 2007, a Muslim group asked for pork-free baked beans and a prayer room for a private retreat at one of Quebec\u2019s many \u201csugar shacks,\u201d where maple syrup is made and feasted upon \u2014 have been taken as assaults on Quebec\u2019s vaunted secularism. More recently, the right-of-center Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec party said it would seek to ban the \u201cburkini,\u201d the body covering swimsuit worn by some Muslim women, from Quebec beaches. (The party eventually backed down, admitting that such a ban would be difficult to enforce.)Though the values charter didn\u2019t pass, it left scars on the province\u2019s social landscape. The Quebec philosopher Charles Taylor, in a letter to La Presse, recently blamed the bill and the ensuing public debate for \u201cthe proliferation of assaults, particularly against Muslims wearing the veil, assaults that went from hate speech to acts of violence in some cases.\u201dYet integrating into society has remained a stubborn problem. Quebec has the highest unemployment rate among recent immigrants to the country, just over 15 percent, nearly four percentage points higher than the national average, according to census data.There are several reasons behind this high unemployment rate. Roughly 75 percent of Quebec\u2019s immigrant population settles in Montreal, an already competitive job market. The province\u2019s unions and professional organizations have been particularly reluctant to credit job experience at foreign companies, or even to recognize degrees earned at foreign universities. One of the mosque shooting victims, Aboubaker Thabti, was trained as a pharmacist in his native Tunisia. A married father of two, he was working at a chicken slaughterhouse at the time of his death.The province\u2019s government has promised that remedies are on the way. Last year, the governing Liberals introduced a bill that would streamline the recognition of foreign university degrees and compel professional organizations to more readily accept applicants from non-Canadian institutions. Other provinces have instituted such measures, with varying degrees of success. In Ontario, where most of the country\u2019s immigrants settle, there are still far too many professionals driving cabs and delivering food.Then there is the thorny issue of who, exactly, is a Quebecer. In the job market, there remains a preference for what is known as \u201cpure laine\u201d Quebecers. The expression \u2014 literally \u201cpure wool\u201d \u2014 denotes anyone with a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois last name and the appropriate skin tone.\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re more likely to get a good job if your name is Lachance than if it\u2019s Hamad,\u201d said Tania Longpr\u00e9, a researcher and French teacher in Montreal. \u201cThe key to integration is the ability to contribute to the economy. Quebec only loses when its professionals are forced to cut chickens.\u201dMr. Duhaime, the radio host, has remained largely unrepentant in the wake of the mosque shooting, at one point blaming envious rivals for taking his words out of context. Others have been more contrite.Sylvain Bouchard, a popular morning radio man, said that he\u2019d failed in his duty to invite members of the city\u2019s Muslim community to his show. \u201cMuslims here are pacifist,\u201d he said.It was an unexpected show of regret in a medium known for its hot takes and big egos. If only words were the cause, and not just a symptom, of the problem.Martin Patriquin is a freelance writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Olympian Winter Moment", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "South Korea is a skiing afterthought no more. The 2018 Winter Olympics is a coming-out party for the country as a winter sports destination.Supported byEmerging from the warmth of her car, Jung Sang-mi watched her husband trudge up a snowy hill, red sled in hand, as their 5-year-old son bounded excitedly ahead, ready for another run. Like many young South Koreans in the congested capital of Seoul, she and her husband escape to the nearby Taebaek Mountains to hit the slopes several times each winter, though she admitted they are still trying to find their legs as skiers.\u201cWe are not really good at it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we do enjoy the sledding.\u201dIndeed, compared with neighboring Japan and its ingrained ski culture, deep-powder skiing and well-established resorts, South Korea is in many ways still coming into its own as a skiing and snowboarding destination. But this could soon change when Pyeongchang hosts the Winter Olympics from Feb. 9 to 25, 2018, only the third time the Winter Games will be held in Asia, and the first time outside Japan.It\u2019s a big moment for the country, which views the Winter Games as a huge source of national pride and is eager to put on a memorable spectacle on par with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 2002 World Cup that South Korea co-hosted with Japan.With tens of thousands of athletes, journalists and spectators expected to descend on Pyeongchang for the Games, it\u2019s also a coming-out party of sorts for South Korea as a winter sports hub, a chance to show the world that it, too, has sparkling-white slopes and a top-notch skiing infrastructure that can continue to attract powder hounds long after the Olympics are over.This quiet region of pine-covered mountains and potato fields not far from the North Korean border, long one of the country\u2019s least-developed areas, has overcome a number of obstacles just to get to this point. Pyeongchang, largely unfamiliar even to many Koreans before the Olympic bid, was once seen as a sizable underdog to win the Olympics. It finally succeeded in its third bid after razor-thin defeats to Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014.The preparations have also been rocky. There were struggles initially to find domestic sponsors and disputes over funding for venues and the plan to build a downhill course in a virgin forest on a protected mountainside. (The organizing committee has done damage control by promising to replant trees and return the mountain to its natural state after the Games.)With one year to go before the opening ceremony, organizers are fervently trying to shift attention back to South Korea\u2019s moment in the sporting spotlight. Most of the venues are nearing completion, including a brand-new Alpine ski center, speedskating oval, figure skating arena and sliding track for the bobsled, luge and skeleton events. The two villages for athletes are about half-finished \u2014 one in the Pyeongchang mountain cluster, the other in the coastal city of Gangneung, where the ice events will be held. A new high-speed rail line is expected to be completed by mid-2017, too, whisking visitors from Seoul to Pyeongchang in just 69 minutes, compared with the current two-and-a-half-hour drive.And the Olympic spirit is finally starting to seep into Pyeongchang, a sprawling county made up of ski resorts and sleepy towns like Hoenggye, where the athletes\u2019 village and Olympic Stadium are being built.Hoenggye is as far from a typical ski town as it gets. The streets are lined with homey dumpling and Korean fried chicken restaurants, as well as nondescript clothing stores with names like Barbie Fashion Shop that stock off-brand sweaters and windbreakers, but nary a ski jacket in sight. A small truck with a squawking loudspeaker makes the rounds in the afternoons selling fresh crab and squid from the coast, and on the outskirts of town, locals hang pollock on wooden racks for days in the winter sun until they become tough as leather, a popular Korean delicacy called hwangtae.A short drive away, the new Alpensia Ski Jumping Center has also become a draw for families, with young children bundled in heavy jackets warily eyeing the top of the steep, icy slope before heading to the observatory for popcorn and photos in front of a less frightening picture of the real thing.The hope is that the Olympics can have a lasting impact on the tourism industry here and help South Korea rival Japan \u2014 and upstart China \u2014 as a winter sports destination.It may take some time to catch up to its neighbors. According to the Ski Business Association of Korea, the number of ski visits in South Korea grew slowly from 5.4 million in 2004-5 to a peak of 6.8 million in 2011-12, but then fell to just 4.9 million in 2015-16, in part because of a slowing economy and an aging population.Japan\u2019s ski industry has also seen a sharp decline since the boom years of the 1980s, but still averages more than 30 million ski visits per year. Though the downturn has hit some resorts hard, the attractions in Japan are still legion: well-equipped resorts with dozens of trails and steep verticals; a lengthy ski season that sometimes stretches into early May; a raucous apr\u00e8s-ski scene (particularly popular among hard-partying Australians), and above all, the endlessly falling snow.Yongpyong has 28 slopes, served by 13 lifts and a gondola, but many of the trails are geared toward beginners and intermediates; an experienced skier can pretty much cover all the \u201csuper-advanced\u201d diamond trails by lunchtime. Safety and proper decorum, not speed, also seem to be paramount concerns \u2014 fences prevent skiers from going off-piste, helmets are ubiquitous, and signs constantly remind visitors to select the appropriate slope for their skill level and slow down.Sharing a Korean Hite beer with friends after a morning on the slopes, Ulrike Pertoll, an Italian who lives in Seoul, said she prefers the pure powder in Japan and the longer runs in the Dolomites back in Italy. But, she added, skiing in South Korea has its benefits: Ski rentals and lodging are cheaper than in Japan, and the proximity of the slopes to Seoul means you can leave work at 5 p.m. on a Friday and be on the slopes several hours later. \u201cWhere else can you do that so easily in Asia?\u201d she said. Yongpyong\u2019s slopes stay open until 2:30 a.m. for night owls, too.The standard dress is a hooded sweatshirt down to the knees (and sometimes well beyond), along with hair dyed various shades of blond and cherry-red and an obligatory flat-brimmed baseball cap, usually covered by the hood for effect. Some boarders go for a head-to-toe ensemble in a glaring shade of pink or orange; the brighter the color, the bolder the fashion statement.It\u2019s not unusual to see GoPro cameras attached to helmets and, on occasion, a rebel snowboarder with a selfie stick fully outstretched, filming himself as he recklessly, yet oh-so-stylishly, carves his way down the mountain. (A clear violation of the rules, mind you.)It\u2019s part slope, part catwalk, with skiers trying as hard as they can to get noticed.Mr. Kim fancies himself a skiing purist \u2014 most of the time. \u201cI just like an outfit I feel comfortable in. If I go with a girlfriend, that\u2019s a different story \u2014 then I like to wear Gucci or Chanel.\u201dAs the industry matures, Mr. Kim hopes Koreans move beyond the image-conscious, fashion-oriented aspect of the sport and try something even more daring \u2014 backcountry skiing on untamed mountainsides far away from the safety of groomed trails. This is difficult to do at the rule-bound resorts around Pyeongchang, but his company organizes backcountry tours to snowy Ulleung island.\u201cWhen Koreans think about skiing, everyone thinks it\u2019s about skiing in a ski resort, surrounded by a fence,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple years ago, people didn\u2019t understand about backcountry skiing, but nowadays lots of people try to do this.\u201dThere\u2019s another change some hope could come with the Olympics: a livelier apr\u00e8s-ski scene.Korean resorts are decidedly family-oriented, with few entertainment options after sundown. At the Alpensia Resort, a small, six-slope facility that\u2019s within minutes of most Olympic venues and will serve as the focal point for the Games, the only apr\u00e8s-ski options are a karaoke parlor, a smoke-filled pool hall and a charmingly rustic bar with Hite beer on tap and a dozen varieties of chicken, from soy sauce chicken to a curiously named \u201ccheese chicken.\u201d\u201cPeople tend to go to a restaurant and base everything around food. Then they start drinking and have a good time, or entertain in their apartments,\u201d said Mr. Hughes, of Korea Snow. \u201cAs an Australian, I\u2019m used to a bar culture.\u201dThen again, there are some advantages to a quieter ski destination. In Japan, he noted, \u201cthere are so many Australians, I feel like I haven\u2019t left home. When I go to Korea, we\u2019re pretty much the only ones there.\u201dThe OlympicsGetting ThereWhere to Stay and SkiSki clothing rental is available at all resorts, too.Justin Bergman is the Shanghai correspondent for Monocle magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iranians Once Shrugged Off Trump\u2019s Bluster. Now They\u2019re Worried.", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 It was supposed to be a regular weekly debate night for a group that meets to discuss movies in a middle-class Tehran neighborhood. But on this particular evening, the 20 or so housewives, intellectuals and students in the group wanted to talk about only one thing: a possibly violent conflict between Iran and the United States.Months had passed since members of the group had been so worked up, recalled one of the participants, Fariba Sameni, a 57-year-old translator. No one wanted to discuss film. Younger members were convinced that President Trump would inevitably bomb Iran. \u201cThey shouted that their futures would be destroyed,\u201d Ms. Sameni said.The group\u2019s leader, a professor, argued that Mr. Trump, with his background as a businessman, would ultimately make a deal with Iran. The professor\u2019s argument was unconvincing, Ms. Sameni said.\u201cWhen I went home, I felt anxious and worried,\u201d she said, \u201cas if something really bad is about to happen.\u201dGloom and dread can be felt across the Iranian capital, and some people blame not only Mr. Trump, but also their own leaders.Amid all of this, Mr. Trump issued a barrage of Twitter posts accusing Iran of meddling in the region and being \u201c#1 in terror.\u201d He has also not missed an occasion to call the 2015 nuclear agreement \u2014 which many average Iranians see as their main lifeline to relatively normal lives \u2014 as a \u201creally, really bad deal.\u201d\u201cTrump is unpredictable; our leaders are unpredictable,\u201d Ms. Sameni said. \u201cIt suddenly feels as if we are on a sinking ship.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump was elected, many Iranian citizens did what they usually do: hope for the best. In recent years, they had become accustomed to feeling as if they were stuck riding a political roller coaster, at the mercy of others.In 2015, when their leaders, to widespread surprise, struck a compromise nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers, many Iranians celebrated, hoping things would improve. The agreement lifted many economically crippling sanctions in return for verifiable guarantees of peaceful Iranian nuclear work.And for most of the past year, life in Iran got a little better. While the economy continued to favor the wealthy, and corruption cases made many people cynical, one thing had changed: There was no more talk of military strikes or of conflict or war with the United States.For the first time since 2002, when president George W. Bush called Iran part of the \u201caxis of evil,\u201d a sense of relative normalcy had taken hold of the capital. European investors were flowing in, oil sales went up and Iran even signed contracts to buy Airbus and Boeing planes to renew its aging fleet.\u201cAfter the nuclear deal, everything looked up,\u201d said Ali Sabzevari Fasfangari, 33, a magazine publisher. \u201cIt was far from perfect, but at least improving.\u201dHe said the nuclear agreement had been regarded as a litmus test. The deal, he argued with friends, meant that reconciliation between Iran and the United States was possible, even after decades of estrangement. \u201cIt seemed it was a pivotal turning point: We were on our way back to becoming a part of the international community,\u201d he said.In the nearly three weeks since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, that feeling has completely dissipated.At a barbershop in west Tehran, the Trump name was the only thing that could get a group of young men to turn away from the soccer match between Tehran\u2019s popular Esteghlal team and a team from Qatar.\u201cWe thought he was a businessman who would offer transactions with Iran, perhaps some investments,\u201d said Ali Mohammadi, 26. Describing himself as a fun-loving young man seeking a decent job, Mr. Mohammadi said he was now thinking about what he would do if Iran came under bombardment someday. \u201cIt just feels as if we are powerless, at the mercy of international politics.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump started ridiculing the nuclear agreement during the presidential campaign, many in Iran thought he was merely trying to get votes.Some middle-class Iranians, who get their news from the approximately 150 illegal Persian-language satellite channels that broadcast from overseas into Iran, started contending that Mr. Trump could actually be a blessing. His perceived friendliness toward Russia has long been seen as a plus in Iran, with many people expecting Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, to rein in Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Iranian stances.\u201cBut we cannot trust the Russians to do so,\u201d said Housang Tale, a historian who is critical of Russia\u2019s relationship with Iran\u2019s leaders. \u201cThey have used us throughout history, taken our land and sold us out,\u201d he said of Russia. \u201cWho says they won\u2019t trade Iran with the U.S. for the Ukraine? More pressure is coming.\u201dOthers disagreed and insisted that Iran\u2019s cordial relations with Russia would save their country from new sanctions and military strikes. \u201cThey will not allow America to attack us,\u201d said Malek Elyasi, who owns a motorcycle repair shop. \u201cAny war with Iran would turn into a global conflict because the Russians will support us.\u201dIran\u2019s defiance of the United States has been a pillar of foreign policy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the ideology of independence from world powers is widely embraced even by Iranians who do not like their government\u2019s politically repressive behavior. But some question whether this ideology can sometimes undermine national interests.\u201cHow about not test-firing a missile,\u201d Ms. Sameni said. \u201cMaybe that would reduce tensions.\u201dThose close to Iran\u2019s foreign-policy makers say there is no other way but to resist what Iran calls hypocrisy and double standards practiced by the United States and other big powers.\u201cThey say we can\u2019t test-fire missiles, the U.S. says, but India, Russia and Britain can do so without problems,\u201d said Mohammad Marandi, a professor at Tehran University. \u201cWe cannot just allow them to dictate to us.\u201dMr. Trump may just be posturing \u201cto reinforce his negotiating position to get concessions,\u201d the professor said. \u201cWe are not really afraid of him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Automakers Call on E.P.A. Chief to Ease Fuel-Efficiency Standards", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has vowed to roll back regulations on business, and automakers are wasting no time in pushing his administration to make good on the promise.Automakers contend the gas-mileage targets will be difficult and expensive to hit and will force them to produce more high-mileage cars at a time when most Americans are buying sport utility vehicles, trucks and other roomy models that are less fuel-efficient and more profitable.Environmentalists said the lobbying groups overstated the difficulty and cost of reaching the 2025 targets, which require an average fuel-economy rating of 54.5 miles per gallon across a company\u2019s entire fleet sold in the United States. That number is based on a complicated formula, and automakers estimate it is the equivalent of about 40 miles per gallon in real-world driving.\u201cAn increasing number of cars achieve the goal now,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, an advocacy group.Vehicles already clearing that bar include hybrids like the Toyota Prius and electric cars \u2014 models that are drawing few buyers as gasoline sells for less than $3 a gallon. To comply with the 2025 targets, more popular models, like S.U.V.s, would need new technology, which could raise prices for consumers.Mr. Becker also said fuel-economy improvements in the last several years had not stopped automakers from earning record profits. \u201cThe industry is just trying to take advantage of Trump\u2019s anti-regulation policies and put the health of people and the environment at risk,\u201d he said.The Obama administration set the higher mileage standards in an effort to reduce tailpipe emissions and combat climate change, and as a means of reducing the country\u2019s dependence on foreign oil. Even if those targets are relaxed, the automakers will still need to comply with emissions rules set by California and several other states with tougher standards than the E.P.A.\u2019s.New fuel-economy targets were set in 2012 in an agreement reached by the Obama administration and automakers. The rule calls for steady increases in mileage, varying depending on the size of the vehicle and whether it is classified as a car or a light truck. The 2017 requirement for a large car is 33 miles per gallon, or about 25 miles per gallon in real-world driving. Most automakers meet or are close to this year\u2019s goals, but they say the additional gains required through 2025 will be harder to achieve.While the automakers would all prefer more lenient targets than the 2025 ones, they differ on the specifics. Some have invested heavily in new technologies and would prefer to have the standards continue to rise, albeit more modestly, to help ensure a market for their advanced vehicles. Honda, Hyundai and Toyota are planning a range of hybrids, electric vehicles and cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells to sell within a few years.Others, such as Fiat Chrysler, have a lineup heavy on trucks and S.U.V.s and would be better off with a significant rollback in fuel-economy requirements.The letters from the manufacturer lobbying groups represent the latest push by carmakers for a reprieve from the emissions and fuel-economy standards. This month, 18 auto-company chief executives wrote a letter to Mr. Trump on the same issue.During the presidential campaign, on Twitter and in campaign stops, Mr. Trump heavily criticized automakers, especially Ford, for investing in Mexico. He has also threatened to impose a border tax on imports from Mexico, where many cars sold in the American market are made, especially smaller, less profitable models.In January, Mr. Trump met with the chief executives of Ford, G.M. and Fiat Chrysler at the White House and encouraged them to add jobs in the United States in exchange for more favorable regulatory and tax policies.The auto lobbying groups asked Mr. Pruitt to reopen a review of the 2025 fuel-economy targets that had been expected to last until early 2018. That review was cut short on Jan. 13 \u2014 seven days before Mr. Trump was inaugurated \u2014 when the outgoing administrator, Gina McCarthy, issued a \u201cfinal determination\u201d that the targets should remain in place.Even if Mr. Pruitt reopens the review and ultimately sides with the industry, automakers will need to continue spending to develop fuel-saving technologies, given the mileage or emissions requirements in many states, as well as Europe and China, that manufacturers will have to meet. Those standards continue to get tougher.\u201cThe rest of the world is still pressing ahead with higher standards,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com. \u201cEven if they ease regulation in the U.S., companies will still have to do this to be compliant in other markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Starts Year With Job Surge, but Pay Gains Are Weak", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, the government\u2019s report on Friday showed that employers fattened their payrolls by 227,000 workers last month, an unexpectedly large increase. And yes, public optimism about economic prospects has persuaded a few hundred thousand Americans who had dropped out of the work force to return.But the very fact that so many sidelined workers could be lured back despite meager wage growth is evidence that the labor pool is not as shallow as some have argued.Instead, the Labor Department\u2019s latest figures showed baby steps \u2014 slower increases in earnings for December and January, bringing year-over-year average wage growth back down to its disappointing 2.5 percent trend.\u201cThe increase in participation and drop in wages suggest we\u2019re not at full employment,\u201d James Athey, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said.\u201cThis is just what the doves at the Fed wanted to see,\u201d Mr. Athey said, referring to those wary of raising rates and keen to keep the focus on fostering hiring rather than heading off inflation. \u201cAll of the numbers point toward it being more difficult to justify another hike in March,\u201d when Fed members next meet.But just because the job market is not yet drum tight does not mean it is not improving. \u201cThe labor market started 2017 on the front foot,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. \u201cThis is a good, good number.\u201dThe averages the government reported mask how fractured the labor market is regarding skills and pay. Employers in many sectors have complained about the difficulty of finding and keeping suitable workers, which has driven up pay in several sectors.\u201cI\u2019m definitely seeing a trend of employers targeting certain pools of workers like the disabled, retirees that may be looking to return to the work force, and stay-at-home moms,\u201d said Ms. Glaser, whose office is in Lexington, Ky. \u201cEmployers are getting very creative. Anything to get a competitive edge.\u201dStill, given the timing, the January job figures are one benchmark against which the new president\u2019s stewardship of the economy will be judged.There are others. Economists at Moody\u2019s Analytics said in a report this week that at least six other measures should be used to determine whether the economy has reached full employment. The list included the proportion of those not in the labor force who want a job, the size of the pool of long-term unemployed and the degree of wage growth.A broader measure of unemployment, which includes the millions who are working part time but would prefer full-time jobs and those so discouraged by rejections that they have given up searching, also rose, to 9.4 percent in January from 9.2 percent in December.Revised estimates from December and November cut 39,000 jobs from previous totals, although other routine adjustments by the Labor Department showed the overall job creation for 2016 was better than previously reported.Manufacturing jobs, which Mr. Trump has focused on, grew by 5,000 in January, increases that were countered by a revised estimate that reduced December\u2019s gains. The Department of Labor will issue one more revised estimate for December, and two more for January.The disappointing overall wage growth can be traced in part to the financial industry, which had a 0.1 percent drop in pay.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article attributed a quotation incorrectly. It was Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, not President Trump, who said, \u201cToday\u2019s jobs report is good news.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the share of working-age adults who are in the labor force. It is 62.9 percent, not 67.9 percent.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter:@PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel Drops Its Sponsorship of Science Fairs, Prompting an Identity Crisis", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is apparently the thinking at Intel, the giant computer chip maker, which is retreating from its longtime sponsorship of science fairs for high school students.Intel\u2019s move away from traditional science fairs leads to broader questions about how a top technology company should handle the corporate sponsorship of science, and what is the best way to promote the education of the tech work force of the future. Intel\u2019s move also raises the issue of the role of science fairs in education in the so-called STEM fields \u2014 science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Intel has not explained its decision, and only said it is \u201cextremely proud\u201d of its long association with the two fairs. The company began supporting the national fair in 1998, taking over from the original sponsor, Westinghouse, and the global competition in 1997, which had no main sponsor.Still, Intel\u2019s move does not suggest a pullback by tech companies in their support for sponsoring science and technology. Google, for example, hosts the Google Science Fair, a global online competition for 13-to-18-year-olds that began in 2011.But as technology \u2014 and the economy \u2014 becomes more based on software, the major companies have broadened support to events like coding workshops and contests.It is hard to imagine a time since the post-Sputnik years when science and technology education has been more valued, by universities and in the labor market. It is also hard to imagine that the leading international science fair, whose roster of participating countries and territories rose to 78 last year, up from 27 in 1997, will not find a deep-pocketed sponsor.The Intel decision provoked a sharp difference of opinion between Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s current chief executive, and Craig R. Barrett, a former Intel chairman and chief executive.Mr. Krzanich has told colleagues privately that the science fairs were the fairs of the past and had become tilted to life sciences and biotechnology, not primary fields for Intel, according to two people who are not authorized to speak publicly for the company.Mr. Barrett disagreed. In an email, he said, \u201cyou might instead conclude that Intel is a company of the past, just like Westinghouse when they dropped\u201d sponsorship of the national science fair in 1998.Mr. Barrett, who is on the board of the Society for Science, also said that all of science has become data-driven and computational, so Intel has a stake in nurturing youthful innovators in all scientific disciplines, including the life sciences.Intel, under Mr. Krzanich, who became chief executive in 2013, has become a major supporter of Maker Faire events, where inventors of all ages showcase their homemade engineering projects. The first Maker Faire was in Silicon Valley in 2006. Last year, more than one million people attended Maker Faire events worldwide.Intel does support other programs to promote STEM education. In 2015, the company pledged $300 million to be spent by 2020 for a fund to diversify its own work force by attracting more women and minorities into technology and paying for college scholarships. Since 2001, the company has contributed an average of $45 million a year to university programs, including research collaborations and scholarships. And Intel is committed to supporting the International Science and Engineering Fair until 2019.Maya Ajmera, president of the Society for Science, praised Intel as \u201can extraordinary partner for the last 20 years,\u201d though she said the company never gave the society a reason for dropping the sponsorship.The society is looking for a sponsor for the international competition who will commit at least $15 million annually for a minimum of five years. It is an opportunity, Ms. Ajmera said, to \u201cinvest in the most important science and technology pipeline in the world.\u201dThe international science contest has a rich legacy. About 60 percent of the participants are American high school students, and its alumni include Paul L. Modrich, a Nobel Prize winner and biochemist at Duke University; Brian Greene, a physicist at Columbia University and a best-selling author; winners of the MacArthur Fellowship, also known as the \u201cgenius\u201d grant; and computer scientists at companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft.Science educators say that science fairs can nurture vital learning and life skills. Students must use critical thinking, experimentation, presentation and speaking skills, and persistence.Struck by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, Mr. Jerath designed an underwater wellhead capping device for taming a gusher and separating oil, gas and water for recycling. His creation won one of the top prizes at the international fair in Pittsburgh in 2015. He has applied for a patent and he has presented his idea to groups as varied as oil companies, the United Nations and young entrepreneur programs.His science fair success, he said, has \u201creally opened up so many doors for me that I had never thought of.\u201dWinning science-fair projects, she said, typically involve consulting mentors and judges, and bouncing ideas off others. That is particularly true of the final event, where 1,800 high school students from more than 70 nations gather to compete for the top prizes. Total student participation in the global competition remains steady, according to the Society for Science.\u201cThe positioning of these research competitions as science fairs can be misleading,\u201d he said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eurozone Agrees to Greece Talks in Exchange for Bailout Payments", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Eurozone finance ministers agreed on Monday to begin negotiations in Athens as soon as next week over much-needed overhauls in exchange for bailout payments, with Greece appearing to win a reprieve from the crippling austerity that it has faced for years.Greece does not have to make another major debt repayment to its creditors until the summer. But with elections due in France, Germany and the Netherlands this year, the country\u2019s bailout is threatening to become a major political issue across the region. European officials are particularly eager to head off another full-blown crisis if only to avoid giving succor to far-right parties in those polls.Representatives of Greece\u2019s main creditors will \u201cgo back to Athens in the very short term,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, which brings together the finance ministers of the 19-nation eurozone, said on Monday.\u201cI\u2019m very happy with that outcome,\u201d he told a news conference in Brussels.The negotiations are the latest step in Greece\u2019s yearslong debt crisis.That issue of austerity has also formed a crucial divider between two of Greece\u2019s main creditors \u2014 Germany and the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F., which has not yet said whether it would join a third bailout for the country, has argued for some measure of debt relief for Athens. Berlin and many other eurozone members have chafed at cutting Greece any slack, reluctant to seek taxpayer support for more aid.Monday\u2019s meeting appeared, however, to raise the specter of easing off on those tough conditions, with Mr. Dijsselbloem suggesting there could be a \u201cshift from austerity to structural reforms\u201d as part of efforts to draw the I.M.F. into the bailout.Greece\u2019s government welcomed what it called a \u201cpolitical agreement\u201d and said that it had accepted creditors\u2019 demands that structural changes to the country\u2019s economy be enshrined in legislation. If agreed, those changes would come into force after the country\u2019s third international bailout expires at the end of next year.The I.M.F. also gave an upbeat assessment of the meeting. It said in a statement that it welcomed Greece\u2019s progress in meeting the fund\u2019s requirements and said that, on that basis, it had agreed to send officials to negotiate for reforms.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Inroads in Union Ranks Have Labor Leaders Scrambling", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump redrew the electoral map with his rousing economic nationalism and evocation of a lost industrial age. It was a message that drew many union members to his cause. And now it is upending the alliances and tactics of the labor movement itself.In early November, workers at the Momentive chemical plant in upstate New York went on strike to beat back pension and health care concessions. By January, the workers were invoking some of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist campaign themes \u2014 but with a twist. They planned to picket outside the Manhattan home of the billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman, whose private equity firm until recently owned a share of the company, and whom Mr. Trump has appointed as an outside adviser on jobs.\u201cWe used that angle \u2014 he\u2019s one of the richest men in the country, has been appointed by Mr. Trump as the so-called jobs czar,\u201d said Darryl Houshower, vice president of the local. \u201cWe were pressuring him, hoping he would put some pressure on the company.\u201dThe episode is just one sign of the sudden shifts buffeting the labor movement. Some unions, even if traditionally Democratic, have aims that align with Mr. Trump\u2019s stated priorities: building infrastructure, rewriting trade agreements, blocking an exodus of jobs. But union leaders are in many cases scrambling to get in step with members who responded to his pro-worker rhetoric \u2014 and to tap into that energy.At Momentive, Mr. Houshower\u2019s local is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, one of the unions most outspoken in calling Mr. Trump to account since the election. But while he voted for Hillary Clinton, he estimates that some 30 percent to 40 percent of his more than 600 members voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cI think some of the things the president was saying during his campaign, you know, looking to make better jobs in America, bring work back to America, kind of pulled on the strings of the average worker,\u201d Mr. Houshower said. \u201cA lot of guys felt that he was the man to do the job.\u201dSuch sentiments help explain why Mr. Trump came as close among voters from union households as any Republican presidential candidate since 1984. And they are the basis for an approach espoused by his top political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, who has mused about a tectonic political shift that would rearrange traditional partisan allegiances around economic interests.Surely no small benefit of that realignment would be to divide organized labor, a key Democratic constituency, and the White House has been shrewd about capitalizing on workers\u2019 pro-Trump sentiment.\u201cHe\u2019s the first president that has addressed this issue, and I\u2019m going to give him kudos for that,\u201d Mr. Williams said at a round-table discussion with reporters in Detroit on Thursday.All in all, it is precisely the backlash that must delight the current occupants of the West Wing. Still, some labor leaders insist that they will not be so easily divided.\u201cI would not be surprised if Steve Bannon and others would be overtly and covertly trying to divide the labor movement,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. But she predicted that the effort would ultimately collapse under its own contradictions.So would a bill recently introduced by Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, that would suspend the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires the government to pay construction contractors prevailing local wages, specifically on federal highway projects.For that matter, Mr. Trump\u2019s own coalition is hardly a model of cohesion.Unions in the public and service sectors, on the other hand, lack economic interests that would provide common ground with the new administration, and their membership is increasingly urban, African-American and Hispanic \u2014 easily alienated by Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on race and immigration. The Service Employees International Union, a leading service-sector force, has taken a largely oppositional stand.Many union leaders are at a loss to explain how Richard L. Trumka, the head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation\u2019s pre-eminent labor federation, will navigate these crosscurrents in the coming months.Mr. Trumka\u2019s answer for the moment is to proceed gingerly. In an interview, he said that he had a productive meeting with Mr. Trump during the transition, and that the president deserved praise for killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. But he has vigorously protested other policies, like Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration restrictions.\u201cWe\u2019re going to call balls and strikes,\u201d he said.Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Across the globe, automakers are preparing for rapid change. There will be new sources of fuel \u2014 electric cars are becoming more and more popular \u2014 as well as new ways to drive, including, of course, cars that drive themselves.Then there\u2019s the question of ownership. Today, most cars spend most of their day parked. Car-sharing services like Uber argue that thanks to technology, each car can become more productive \u2014 and if that happens, we\u2019d probably need far fewer cars.These changes could upend the German economy. But the Germans aren\u2019t sleepwalking into the future, write Jack Ewing and Mark Scott. Executives at some of the country\u2019s leading car companies are pushing a slate of initiatives that could change how we think of the German automotive sector. They are building or investing in car-sharing companies of their own, and they are expanding their electric options.But perhaps most interestingly, German car companies are starting to think of themselves as more than just manufacturers, and instead as incubators of new ideas.

{"Headline": "South Africa, a Nation With Sharp Inequality, Considers a Minimum Wage", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKHAYELITSHA, South Africa \u2014 He works in AIDS prevention and his wife gets the occasional gig at a local supermarket. But neither job is regular enough for a \u201cproper home,\u201d Zwai Lugogo says, so his family lives in a shack here in Cape Town\u2019s largest black township, making do with thin walls of painted metal.Many of his neighbors \u2014 housekeepers, factory workers, nurse\u2019s aides \u2014 are in the same predicament, working hard at jobs available to black South Africans, but barely scraping by.\u201cThat money that we\u2019re getting from work is just not enough to be able to take care of our families,\u201d said Mr. Lugogo, 34, as neighborhood children, including his 3-year-old son, ran around their narrow street recently. \u201cWe need an intervention.\u201dSouth Africa is now considering one. Faced with rising discontent over the economy among black voters, the government is weighing something more common in developed economies: a national minimum wage.Last week, the nation\u2019s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, endorsed the panel\u2019s recommendation, vowing that the minimum wage would be in effect by May 2018. But in such a sluggish economy, opponents contend that the effort would destroy jobs, especially for the least skilled.Supporters counter that a minimum wage is the only way to reduce poverty in one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies, helping to dismantle an apartheid-era system designed to provide cheap black labor for an economy dominated by the white minority.Some smaller African economies, like those of Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Coast, already have a national minimum wage. But only a small percentage of their workers are in the formal economy and therefore eligible for the minimum, experts say. And even for them, the rules tend not to be enforced.A national minimum wage would be more meaningful in a big economy like South Africa\u2019s, experts say, because the formal work force is much larger, around 80 percent of all workers. Millions of people would be eligible.Still, South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most advanced economy, is enduring the same forces as the rest of the continent. It is not growing fast enough to absorb its rapidly growing population, which is leaving rural areas to look for work in places like Khayelitsha, one of the country\u2019s biggest townships with about 400,000 people.The party could once bank on loyal support from the nation\u2019s black majority. But corruption and economic stagnation for millions of people have steadily eroded that support over the years, resulting in the party\u2019s worst showing in elections since the end of apartheid in 1994.On weekday mornings, soon after daybreak, the men and women of Khayelitsha leave their neighborhoods and walk to the nearest train or bus station. For many, the commute \u2014 a legacy of apartheid-era urban planning to separate white and black areas \u2014 takes up to a couple of hours each way.Along the way, in a scene repeated in many buses that morning, a woman, in this instance Julia Xakata, began preaching and leading the others in song. Some sang softly while checking their cellphones.Sitting near the front of the bus next to a window, Makatiso Sekhamane moved her lips while knitting a black cap.\u201cI knit whenever I have some free time,\u201d Ms. Sekhamane, 47, said, explaining that she usually completed a cap in two days and sold it for about $4. \u201cIt\u2019s something.\u201dThe caps supplemented the $400 a month she made working six days a week cleaning white people\u2019s homes. Her husband earned maybe $150 repairing refrigerators. Their combined income supports five children and two grandchildren at home.Much of the discussion surrounding a national minimum wage \u2014 led by government, business, labor and academics \u2014 is expected to focus on the amount. According to the panel\u2019s report, a monthly minimum wage of about $260 \u201cwould maximize benefits to the poor and minimize any possible\u201d disincentives to work.The amount proposed by the panel is below the working poverty line of $325 a month, but because the median income of South African workers is only $280 a month, the minimum would help reduce inequality, the panel said.On Twecu Crescent, many of the employed already earn the proposed minimum, or more. But their wages are far below the salaries earned by the few residents in the nicest homes \u2014 $600 a month for a government worker, $900 a month for a young police officer.The proposed minimum \u201cis not enough,\u201d said Nombeko Mndangaso, who earns about $165 a month working five hours a day as a cleaner in a nursing home. \u201cIt won\u2019t make a difference.\u201dWith her husband, who makes $245 a month as a full-time security guard, they earn more than $400 a month. But with rent, transportation, electricity and two daughters, there is little left at the end of the month. A minimum wage of \u201cat least\u201d $340 a month per person, she said, would improve her family\u2019s situation.Sparsely populated a generation ago, Twecu Crescent now has little or no space between homes. Many homeowners earn extra income by renting out shacks on their property to the endless stream of new arrivals to Khayelitsha.On Twecu Crescent, a short street divided into two blocks, the handful of sturdily built homes belonging to the upwardly mobile stand out. There is, in a two-story house, the woman who works at a bank; down the street, the man employed by the government power utility; and, on the corner, the police officer whose still unfinished house has a new red Peugeot in the driveway and a low wall with spikes to discourage people from sitting on it.The street is otherwise lined with more modest homes under corrugated roof sheets, inhabited by those making a third or half of what those in the nicer homes do, and shacks of varying quality occupied by those worse off. Discolored concrete blocks are neatly piled in many front yards, a sign of the slow and unsteady pace of progress for most on Twecu Crescent.Sinovuyo Gada\u2019s family moved here in 1998.\u201cThere was no road here, just gravel,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were no houses, just shacks.\u201dHer father, a welder, and her mother, who sells homemade food from a shack in their front yard, built the house in which she and her brother grew up. After finishing high school in 2012, she sent out her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to countless companies for three years before finally securing a part-time job through a friend.She now works four days a week at a supermarket at a mall in Cape Town, earning $60 a week. About 30 percent of that, or $18, goes to transportation. Ms. Gada, 22, is part of the \u201cborn-free\u201d generation of black South Africans who came of age after apartheid\u2019s fall. But like many in her cohort, she was deeply dissatisfied with the pace of change in her family\u2019s circumstances.\u201cThe apartheid, it\u2019s still there,\u201d she said.The wages she earned from the job that took so long in finding would do little to improve her situation, she said. She did not believe that a monthly minimum of $260 would help. Employers control the balance of power over people like her, she said.\u201cThey think sometimes we are desperate,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, we are desperate, because we have families and children to take care of.\u201dIt was early evening, and, all over Khayelitsha, men and women started coming home, most of them walking from bus stops to their streets, their gait slower than in the morning.On Twecu Crescent, girls sat on a corner playing a game of rocks. A boy pushing an old tire with a stick cast a long shadow up the street.The woman who was knitting on the bus, Ms. Sekhamane \u2014 better known on Twecu Crescent as Mama Kakiso, or the mother of Kakiso, her son \u2014 arrived home.She had had a busy day and, arriving late at the bus stop, had found no available seats on the Golden Arrow. She took a taxi instead, paying an amount equivalent to half the price of one of her black caps.\u201cI\u2019m going to wash my body and sleep now,\u201d Mama Kakiso said as she slipped into her home. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Full Transcript and Video: Trump News Conference", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump on Thursday announced his new nominee for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, during a news conference at the White House. Following is a transcript of that event, as prepared by the Federal News Service.For more coverage, read our live analysis.I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He\u2019s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.And so Alex, I\u2019ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he\u2019s going to be \u2014 I think he\u2019ll be a tremendous secretary of labor.And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition.Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, \u201cnever Trump.\u201d And Paul just left and he\u2019s given us his total support. And it\u2019s all about unification. We\u2019re unifying the party and hopefully we\u2019re going to be able to unify the country. It\u2019s very important to me. I\u2019ve been talking about that for a long time. It\u2019s very, very important to me.So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he\u2019s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.I think I\u2019ll say a few words, and then we\u2019ll take some questions. And I had this time. We\u2019ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we\u2019ve done some really good work. We\u2019re very proud of that.And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we\u2019ll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That\u2019s always a possibility.I\u2019m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we\u2019ve done.A new Rasmussen poll, in fact \u2014 because the people get it \u2014 much of the media doesn\u2019t get it. They actually get it, but they don\u2019t write it. Let\u2019s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is \u2014 to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, \u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d Now it means, \u201cThat\u2019s good for jobs.\u201d Very different.Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league \u2014 Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I\u2019m making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation\u2019s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit \u2014 a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that\u2019s possible. Maybe it\u2019s not, and that\u2019s OK, too.I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking \u2014 and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re talking about the power structure; we\u2019re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort \u2014 not all the time \u2014 and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say \u2014 they\u2019re honest and fantastic.But much of it is not a \u2014 the distortion \u2014 and we\u2019ll talk about it, you\u2019ll be able to ask me questions about it. But we\u2019re not going to let it happen, because I\u2019m here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It\u2019s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what\u2019s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea \u2014 we\u2019ll take care of it folks; we\u2019re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we\u2019ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you\u2019ve covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.We\u2019ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women\u2019s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It\u2019s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He\u2019s over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it\u2019s in large sections of the world.They\u2019ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer \u2014 another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they\u2019re the world\u2019s top sponsor of terrorism, and we\u2019re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it\u2019s not properly solved now, it\u2019s one of the worst agreements I\u2019ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I\u2019ve ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I\u2019ve had great from Congress, generally.We\u2019ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my \u2014 I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we\u2019re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don\u2019t have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it\u2019s depleted \u2014 it won\u2019t be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I\u2019m standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I\u2019m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we\u2019re having strong borders.Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They\u2019re so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I\u2019m doing probably aren\u2019t popular but they\u2019re necessary for security and for other reasons.And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I\u2019m here following through on what I pledged to do. That\u2019s all I\u2019m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn\u2019t supposed to get 222. They said there\u2019s no way to get 222, 230\u2019s impossible.270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they\u2019ve never seen before so that\u2019s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media\u2019s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they\u2019re not happy about it for whatever reason.And \u2014 but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I\u2019ll be in Melbourne, Florida five o\u2019clock on Saturday and I heard \u2014 just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can\u2019t get my cabinet approved.And they\u2019re outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who\u2019s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can\u2019t get approved. How do you not approve him? He\u2019s been a colleague \u2014 highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We\u2019re waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that\u2019s working very hard, that\u2019s being very much misrepresented about and we can\u2019t let that happen.So, if the Democrats who have \u2014 all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we\u2019ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.I\u2019ll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks \u2014 in the weeks coming. We\u2019ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We\u2019re going to make trade deals but we\u2019re going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We\u2019re going to have one on one deals.We\u2019ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it\u2019s many, many years. And then at the end of the process \u2014 they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.Now, they may be rejected with me but it\u2019s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it\u2019s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don\u2019t want the jobs going to other countries. We\u2019ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We\u2019ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.We\u2019ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody\u2019s ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say \u201clet me see your regulations\u201d and they\u2019re fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental \u2014 all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It\u2019s very important to me. But you don\u2019t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.We\u2019ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We\u2019ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation \u2014 take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.We\u2019ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We\u2019re becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.We\u2019ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general \u2014 now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we\u2019re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it\u2019s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I\u2019ve negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke.We\u2019ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is \u2014 that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.We\u2019re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we\u2019ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn\u2019t say that.We\u2019ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is\u2019s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.So we\u2019ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It\u2019s already happening. But big league.I\u2019ve also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.You look at Rex Tillerson. He\u2019s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don\u2019t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn\u2019t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I\u2019m announcing would never have come here.Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we\u2019re naming.Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades \u2014 decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we\u2019re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he\u2019ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that\u2019s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there.And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let\u2019s take some questions.Mara (ph), Mara (ph), go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.He didn\u2019t have to do that, because what he did wasn\u2019t wrong \u2014 what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That\u2019s the real problem.And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this \u2014 that they know nothing about it; they weren\u2019t in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.It\u2019s all fake news. It\u2019s all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal \u2014 I think it\u2019s very important \u2014 the illegal, giving out classified information. It was \u2014 and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.I\u2019ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that\u2019s \u2014 I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it\u2019s out there for the world to see. It\u2019s supposed to be secret. It\u2019s supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I\u2019m saying \u2014 the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that\u2019s classified? How do they do it?You know why? Because it\u2019s an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.Yes, go ahead.You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn\u2019t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn\u2019t remember. So either way, it wasn\u2019t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.But he didn\u2019t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn\u2019t remember. And that just wasn\u2019t acceptable to me.Yes?I think the one person \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spoken to him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don\u2019t think I ever met him. Now, it\u2019s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don\u2019t think I ever met him. I didn\u2019t talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don\u2019t think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That\u2019s what he does. I mean, people know that.That\u2019s Mr. Manafort, who\u2019s \u2014 by the way, who\u2019s by the way a respected man. He\u2019s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody \u2014 people knew that. Everybody knew that.So, these people \u2014 and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don\u2019t print it because that\u2019s not good for their stories.He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that\u2019s the extent.Russia is fake news. Russia \u2014 this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they\u2019re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.As you know, Mike Pompeo has \u2014 has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he\u2019s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.And just while you\u2019re at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time\u2019s story, yesterday. And it talked about \u2014 these are (ph) front page.So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I\u2019ll tell you something, I\u2019ll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I\u2019ve never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.And it was totally \u2014 they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.OK, go ahead.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)What\u2014 what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he\u2019s offered his services and you know, it\u2019s something we may take advantage of. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.As far as the general\u2019s concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn\u2019t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn\u2019t think anything is wrong, you know, really didn\u2019t think.It was really, what happened after that but he didn\u2019t think anything was done wrong. I didn\u2019t either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said \u201cwell I don\u2019t see\u201d \u2014 to me, he was doing the job.President Trump is expected to announce a new nominee for secretary of labor. Times reporters will be following live and offering analysis.The information was provided by \u2014 who I don\u2019t know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound like he did anything wrong there.\u201d But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as \u2014 as far as the actual making the call, fact I\u2019ve watched various programs and I\u2019ve read various articles where he was just doing his job.That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So \u2014 and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he\u2019s a fine man.We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It\u2019s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I \u2014 when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment \u2014 when I was called out on Mexico, I was \u2014 honestly, I was really, really surprised.But I said \u201cyou know, it doesn\u2019t make sense. That won\u2019t happen\u201d but that wasn\u2019t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who\u2019s a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said \u201cthat\u2019s terrible that it was leaked\u201d but it wasn\u2019t that important. But then I said to myself \u201cwhat happens when I\u2019m dealing with the problem of North Korea?\u201dWhat happens when I\u2019m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very \u2014 you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don\u2019t want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.So I\u2019m dealing with Mexico, I\u2019m dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the \u201cWashington Post\u201d and gets put into the \u201cNew York Times\u201d and I\u2019m saying \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen when I\u2019m dealing on the Middle East? What\u2019s going to happen when I\u2019m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?We got to stop it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a criminal penalty.It\u2019s very important to me and especially in this position. It\u2019s very important. I don\u2019t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it\u2019s true and, you know, over a course of time, I\u2019ll make mistakes and you\u2019ll write badly and I\u2019m OK with that. But I\u2019m not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it\u2019s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.I don\u2019t watch it any more because it\u2019s very good \u2014 he\u2019s saying no. It\u2019s OK, Jim (ph). It\u2019s OK, Jim (ph), you\u2019ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You\u2019re not the only one so don\u2019t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be \u2014 I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody\u2019s ratings are right now but I think that actually \u2014 I think that\u2019d actually be better.People \u2014 I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know, Peter (ph), is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower \u2014 I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I\u2019d appreciate it \u2014 again, I don\u2019t mind bad stories when it\u2019s true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.I\u2019m going forever and I still have a lot of people that we\u2019re waiting for. And that\u2019s all they\u2019re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he\u2019s got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they\u2019d be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they\u2019re happy and everybody\u2019s good.And sometimes \u2014 I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s fine. But I think it would \u2014 I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine \u2014 seriously \u2014 can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric \u2014 you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We\u2019ll do you next Jim, I do you next(ph).I didn\u2019t direct him, but I would have directed him because that\u2019s his job. And it came out that way \u2014 and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I\u2019ve watched many other people say that.No, I didn\u2019t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn\u2019t do it. OK? Jim?He said terrible things about her. But it wasn\u2019t classified information. But in one case, you\u2019re talking about classified \u2014 regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong \u2014 at my suggestion \u2014 and I give Reince great credit for this \u2014 at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.I don\u2019t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so \u2014 they were \u2014 when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn\u2019t even in the papers.Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she \u2014 and she should have reported herself.Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it\u2019s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job.\u201d QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don\u2019t understand. It seems that there\u2019s a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?(CROSSTALK)And I\u2019ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word \u201ctone.\u201d The tone is such hatred. I\u2019m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such \u2014 I do get good ratings, you have to admit that \u2014 the tone is such hatred.I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they\u2019re very honorable people. They\u2019re very \u2014 not because they\u2019re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That\u2019s all I can say. It\u2019s the most honest.But the tone, Jim. If you look \u2014 the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes \u2014 sometimes somebody gets...(CROSSTALK)Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I\u2019m amazed by it. And I just think you\u2019d be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know.I \u2014 I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s brutal.Now, they\u2019ll take this news conference \u2014 I\u2019m actually having a very good time, OK? But they\u2019ll take this news conference \u2014 don\u2019t forget, that\u2019s the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?(CROSSTALK)Tomorrow, they will say, \u201cDonald Trump rants and raves at the press.\u201d I\u2019m not ranting and raving. I\u2019m just telling you. You know, you\u2019re dishonest people. But \u2014 but I\u2019m not ranting and raving. I love this. I\u2019m having a good time doing it.But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, \u201cDonald Trump rants and raves.\u201d I\u2019m not ranting and raving.Go ahead.Sit down. Sit down. We\u2019ll...(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)I know what\u2019s good and bad. I\u2019d be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what\u2019s good. I know what\u2019s bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive \u2014 sometimes something that should be very positive, they\u2019ll make OK. They\u2019ll even make it negative.So I understand it. So, because I\u2019m there. I know what was said. I know who\u2019s saying it. I\u2019m there. So it\u2019s very important to me.Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it\u2019s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press \u2014 the public doesn\u2019t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don\u2019t know. But they don\u2019t believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go \u2014 as an example, you\u2019re CNN, I mean it\u2019s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running \u2014 this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don\u2019t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I\u2019m saying \u201chere\u2019s my chief of staff,\u201d a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some \u2014 all over the country, you take a look, he\u2019s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know \u2014 and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said \u201cyou take a look at Reince, he\u2019s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.\u201d I mean, they\u2019re fake. They\u2019re not true. And isn\u2019t that a shame because he\u2019d rather be working on healthcare, he\u2019d rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there\u2019s a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know \u2014 you know, whatever reason. But \u2014 and I understand that. But you\u2019ve got to be at least a little bit fair and that\u2019s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it\u2019s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.Now tomorrow, you\u2019ll say \u201cDonald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.\u201d It\u2019s not terrible. It\u2019s good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.Nobody talks about that. I didn\u2019t do anything for Russia. I\u2019ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?Hillary Clinton \u2014 that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I\u2019m a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that\u2019s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who\u2019s going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said \u201cI know politically it\u2019s probably not good for me.\u201d The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that\u2019s 30 miles off shore right out of the water.Everyone in this country\u2019s going to say \u201coh, it\u2019s so great.\u201d That\u2019s not great. That\u2019s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you\u2019ve had a lot of presidents that haven\u2019t taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can \u2014 now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But \u2014 but it\u2019s possible I won\u2019t be able to get along with Putin.Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said \u201cyou know.\u201d He\u2019s sitting behind his desk and he\u2019s saying \u201cyou know, I see what\u2019s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It\u2019s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he\u2019s got with this fake story.\u201d OK?And that\u2019s a shame because if we could get along with Russia \u2014 and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.So we\u2019ll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid- March. And after that, we\u2019re going to come up, and we\u2019re doing very well on tax reform.Yes?Then you would say, \u201cOh, he was too tough; he shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d Look, all of the...(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)Go ahead.Yes, I think that I\u2019ve already...Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we\u2019re not going to make a deal.Now, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to make a deal. I don\u2019t know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough \u2014 the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along \u2014 and don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There\u2019s no upside. We\u2019re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we\u2019re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.They\u2019re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing.(CROSSTALK)No...(CROSSTALK)Now, again, maybe I\u2019m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don\u2019t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I\u2019m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She\u2019s close to Russia.In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don\u2019t talk about military, and I don\u2019t talk about certain other things, you\u2019re going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I\u2019d say that. So I don\u2019t have to tell you. I don\u2019t want to be one of these guys that say, \u201cYes, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d I don\u2019t have to do that. I don\u2019t have to tell you what I\u2019m going to do in North Korea.(CROSSTALK)OK.Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that\u2019s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it\u2019s 80 percent of the time, a lot.We had a bad decision. We\u2019re going to keep going with that decision. We\u2019re going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.That\u2019s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that\u2019s like you. You have some bad people out there.Kelly said you can\u2019t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don\u2019t have time to come in.Now nobody ever reports that. But that\u2019s why we did it quickly.Now, if I would\u2019ve done it a month, everything would\u2019ve been perfect. The problem is we would\u2019ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would\u2019ve come into our country.Now in the meantime, we\u2019re vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.I know you have to get up and ask a question. It\u2019s so important.Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven\u2019t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don\u2019t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn\u2019t. I just have nobody to speak to.I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I\u2019m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I\u2019m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that \u2014 whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who\u2019s a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.Because (OFF-MIKE). However, what we\u2019ve already heard about and what we (OFF-MIKE) is (OFF-MIKE) so you\u2019re general forecast (ph) like 48 (OFF-MIKE). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the (OFF-MIKE)...(CROSSTALK)So here\u2019s the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti- Semitic person that you\u2019ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican \u2014 quiet, quiet, quiet.See, he lied about \u2014 he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I\u2019ve known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it.So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they\u2019re gang members and they\u2019re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way \u2014 it\u2019s a very \u2014 it\u2019s a very, very tough subject.We\u2019re gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don\u2019t forget and I have to convince them that what I\u2019m saying is \u2014 is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.But the DACA situation is a very, very \u2014 it\u2019s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.I\u2019m not talking about new laws, I\u2019m talking the existing law, is very rough, it\u2019s very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we\u2019re tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania\u2019s gonna be outstanding, that\u2019s right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.She, like others that she\u2019s working with, feel very, very strongly about women\u2019s issue, women\u2019s difficulties. Very, very strongly, she\u2019s a very, very strong advocate. I think she\u2019s a great representative for this country.And a funny thing happens, because she gets \u2014 she gets so unfairly \u2014 Melania, the things they say. I\u2019ve known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.She would go home at night and didn\u2019t even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you\u2019ll ever find. And the things they say \u2014 I\u2019ve known her for a long time \u2014 the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she\u2019s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.I\u2019ll just tell you this. I think she\u2019s going to be a fantastic first lady. She\u2019s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they\u2019re not doing this for money.They\u2019re not doing this for pay, they\u2019re doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school \u2014 because it\u2019s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left \u2014 she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that\u2019s a very nice question.(CROSSTALK)I think it\u2019s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.And by the way, if I might add, including the women\u2019s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We\u2019re going to try and fix as quickly as possible \u2014 you know, it takes a long time.It\u2019s taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we\u2019re going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we\u2019re going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.You go to some of these inner city places and it\u2019s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen this, and I\u2019ve sort of witnessed it \u2014 in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.They\u2019re living in hell. We can\u2019t let that happen. So, we\u2019re going to be very, very strong. That\u2019s a great question and \u2014 and it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a very difficult situation because it\u2019s been many, many years. It\u2019s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.There\u2019s one Chicago that\u2019s incredible, luxurious and all \u2014 and safe. There\u2019s another Chicago that\u2019s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we\u2019re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.And that\u2019s part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They\u2019ll do signs and they\u2019ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won\u2019t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.(CROSSTALK)We\u2019re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that\u2019s part of it. But we\u2019re going to work on education, we\u2019re going to work on \u2014 you know, we\u2019re going to stop \u2014 we\u2019re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we\u2019re going to try and stop crime.We\u2019re not going to try and stop, we\u2019re going to stop crime. But it\u2019s very important to me \u2014 but this isn\u2019t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try \u2014 I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.It\u2019s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Pinning Hopes on Economic Growth to Avoid Budget Cuts", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House had said Monday that the extra money for the Defense Department would be offset dollar-for-dollar with cuts elsewhere in the government. Aides singled out the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Internal Revenue Service as targets for austerity \u2014 plans that the White House has not backed away from.But on Tuesday, the president seemed to cling to a different hope \u2014 that a surge in economic growth would do the trick.\u201cI think the money is going to come from a revved-up economy,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News when asked how he would pay for his plans. \u201cI mean, you look at the kind of numbers we\u2019re doing \u2014 we were probably G.D.P. of a little more than 1 percent, and if I can get that up to 3 or maybe more, we have a whole different ballgame.\u201dThe comments, made ahead of his first presidential address to Congress, reflect the tension within the Trump administration over how to make bold investments in infrastructure and the military, cut taxes, protect Social Security and Medicare \u2014 and still remain fiscally responsible. Mr. Trump\u2019s hopes, moreover, appear at odds with the lower growth forecast by his own economic team and the forecasts of most economists.\u201cIf the economy sails, then I\u2019m right, because I said I\u2019m not touching Social Security,\u201d he said.Few if any economists foresee the burst of growth Mr. Trump is counting on. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the real gross domestic product will grow at an average annual rate of 2.1 percent through the end of 2018.Times reporters analyzed President Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday and the Democrats\u2019 response, which was delivered by former Gov. Steve Beshear of Kentucky.Even the president\u2019s own budget office is using an optimistic forecast \u2014 2.4 percent economic growth \u2014 to calculate the White House\u2019s anticipated deficit for the coming fiscal year. That rate is above most other estimates but well below the 3 percent Mr. Trump appears to be counting on.Mr. Trump faces significant obstacles when it comes to turning his budget blueprint into reality. He will need to get Congress to lift the military spending caps mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act, and he will have to convince Democrats and members of his own party that his priorities make economic sense.Early doubts among Republicans were palpable on Tuesday. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to reduce spending on foreign aid would be unwise for fiscal and security reasons.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, panned Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to make deep cuts at the State Department, calling the idea \u201cdead on arrival.\u201dReporters from The New York Times fact checked President Trump\u2019s first address to Congress.On the other side of the ledger, House Republicans openly worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to increase spending on military and other programs while taking entitlement cuts off the table.\u201cIt is essential that we put our nation onto a sustainable fiscal path,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said while discussing the 2018 budget. \u201cWe cannot simply call for more spending and more taxes that grows Washington\u2019s economy at the expense of the Main Street economy.\u201dAs the budget negotiations move forward, Mr. Mulvaney, a former representative from South Carolina who once favored government default over adding to the deficit, will be instrumental in persuading his old colleagues that Mr. Trump has the right approach. But asked on Tuesday about how the president would manage to keep all of his promises without making politically fraught cuts to entitlement programs, Mr. Mulvaney was noncommital.\u201cThose are bigger discussions for another day,\u201d he said on ABC News.Advertisement"}

More than 90 percent of their assets is backed by debt, with very little equity capital.We have a highly concentrated oligopoly of banks that someday could become expensive wards of the state once again unless we keep tight oversight of them. We need regulation to make sure we avoid another bankruptcy like that of Lehman Brothers.A gutting of the Dodd-Frank Act could once again allow the major Wall Street firms to eventually return to the reckless ways of the past and to leverage themselves up to a dangerous level. Because of Dodd-Frank, there have been no financial crises for almost a decade.

But it\u2019s not his friends who can\u2019t get money from the banks. After he bankrupted four companies, the big American banks have reportedly refused to lend him money and he has been forced to go to overseas banks to get financing.Narcissist that he is, he thinks that his own self-induced problems are the same as everybody else\u2019s.

{"Headline": "Trump to Ask for Sharp Increases in Military Spending, Officials Say", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will instruct federal agencies on Monday to assemble a budget for the coming fiscal year that includes sharp increases in Defense Department spending and drastic enough cuts to domestic agencies that he can keep his promise to leave Social Security and Medicare alone, according to four senior administration officials.The budget outline will be the first move in a campaign this week to reset the narrative of Mr. Trump\u2019s turmoil-tossed White House.A day before delivering a high-stakes address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump will demand a budget with tens of billions of dollars in reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department, according to four senior administration officials with direct knowledge of the plan. Social safety net programs, aside from the big entitlement programs for retirees, would also be hit hard.Preliminary budget outlines are usually little-noticed administrative exercises, the first step in negotiations between the White House and federal agencies that usually shave the sharpest edges off the initial request.But this plan \u2014 a product of a collaboration between the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney; the National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn; and the White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 is intended to make a big splash for a president eager to show that he is a man of action.Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers huddled in the White House this weekend to work on his Tuesday night prime-time address. They focused on a single, often overlooked message amid the chaos of his first weeks in the White House: the assertion that the reality-show candidate is now a president determined to keep audacious campaign promises on immigration, the economy and the budget, no matter how sloppy or disruptive it looks from the outside.\u201cThey might not agree with everything you do, but people will respect you for doing what you said you were going to do,\u201d said Jason Miller, a top communications strategist on the Trump campaign who remains close to the White House.\u201cHe\u2019s doing something first, and there\u2019s time for talk later,\u201d Mr. Miller added. \u201cThis is ultimately how he\u2019s going to get people who didn\u2019t vote, or people who didn\u2019t vote for him, into the fold. Inside the Beltway and with the media, there\u2019s this focus on the palace intrigue. Out in the rest of the country, they are seeing a guy who is focused on jobs and the economy.\u201dThe budget plan, a numerical sketch that will probably be substantially altered by House and Senate Republicans \u2014 and vociferously opposed by congressional Democrats \u2014 will be Mr. Trump\u2019s first big step into a legislative fray he has largely avoided during the first 40 days of his administration.Thus far, instead of legislating, he has focused on a succession of executive orders on immigration and deregulation written by Mr. Bannon\u2019s small West Wing team.Resistance from federal agencies could ease some of the deepest cuts in the initial plan before a final budget request is even sent to Congress. And Capitol Hill will have the last word.To meet Mr. Trump\u2019s defense request, lawmakers in both parties would have to agree to raise or end statutory spending caps on defense and domestic programs that were imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act.Mr. Trump is in a highly unusual position at a time when most presidents are finding their footing or confronting crisis. Despite his lament that he was handed \u201ca mess\u201d by President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump inherited a low unemployment rate, a lack of international crises requiring immediate attention and majorities in both houses of Congress.By contrast, when Mr. Obama took office, the country was losing 700,000 jobs a month, and the global financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse. By the time he stepped up to the rostrum for his first joint congressional address on Feb. 24, 2009, he had already accrued an impressive string of accomplishments, including the passage of a massive stimulus bill through the Democratic-controlled Congress, a gender pay-parity act, a children\u2019s health insurance law and executive actions that would ultimately help stabilize the financial and automotive sectors.With the prospect of a second Great Depression still high, Mr. Obama sought to rally the country, vowing, \u201cWe will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.\u201dMayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, said in an interview Sunday night that Mr. Trump was trying to create a \u201csense of urgency, which most people aren\u2019t feeling right now, which was a reality to us\u201d in order to generate support for his unspecified economic agenda, including an infrastructure bill and a tax overhaul.\u201cWhen it comes to all of these executive orders, the question is, does the public view what he\u2019s doing as action or motion?\u201d Mr. Emanuel added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have real action, you create a sense of motion, so the public views it as progress.\u201dIn putting together their budget plans, White House officials are operating under the assumption that the rate of the United States\u2019 economic growth this year will be 2.4 percent, according to one person who has been briefed on the matter. That is slightly ahead of current projections, but it is well below the 3 percent to 4 percent growth that Mr. Trump promised during the campaign.For next year, the operating assumption is only slightly higher, that person added, a sign that the budget process will not be too out of step with economic reality.The turmoil that has engulfed Mr. Trump\u2019s West Wing is largely of his own devising \u2014 part of a calculated effort by Mr. Bannon to move boldly despite his team\u2019s lack of experience, and despite the reluctance of many mainstream Republicans to work for a president whom many of them opposed in the party\u2019s brutal primaries.\u201cDuring his first month in office, President Trump has done exactly what he said he was going to do,\u201d said Thomas Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who ran his inaugural committee. \u201cNo president has worked harder or accomplished as much, even with tremendous political resistance forcing him to operate with a small team of outsiders possessing little government experience.\u201dLawmakers in both parties have complained that the president\u2019s big words are not yet matched by detailed policy prescriptions or a legislative affairs team capable of executing such undefined promises as repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or rewriting the tax code.The budget outline will give Mr. Trump an opportunity to add some specifics to an agenda that has been defined by bellicose speech and the broadest possible policy strokes.Still, aides said Mr. Trump did not plan to change his style for Tuesday\u2019s address. The speech, they said, is likely to have more in common with his clipped inaugural address \u2014 in which he declared, \u201cThe time for empty talk is over\u201d \u2014 than the fine-print litanies of policy proposals favored by President Bill Clinton or the high-flung invocations of national purpose preferred by President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama.Mr. Trump\u2019s team, conscious of his recent reversals and a first-month approval rating that is among the lowest ever recorded, has emphasized his determination to break the partisan gridlock and inaction that has kept congressional approval ratings in the 15 to 30 percent range for years.At the start of an interview last week with Sean Hannity of Fox News at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, called him \u201cPresident Action, President Impact, Donald J. Trump.\u201dIn a round-robin of Sunday show interviews, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump\u2019s policy adviser, maintained that the president had accomplished more in his first month than most of his predecessors had in their entire administrations.One West Wing official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about strategy, said the administration craved the split-screen television images of Mr. Trump at round-table discussions with business executives every few days on one side, and the vehement protesters of his administration on the other.But his critics say such photo opportunities are all an act, a not-very-entertaining real-life rendition of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d by an ineffective rookie president.\u201cThis man is not a doer,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, who will host a Monday \u201cpre-buttal\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s Tuesday speech. \u201cOh, please. He has nothing to show for what he\u2019s been doing in office for 40 days. It\u2019s all been squandered.\u201dGlenn Thrush and Kate Kelly reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Department Urges Appeals Court to Reinstate Trump\u2019s Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe administration\u2019s brief was the last in a series of urgent pleas to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which is now set to rule on the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency. The ruling will almost certainly be followed by an appeal to the Supreme Court.The court scheduled an hourlong oral argument for Tuesday. That gives at least another day of reprieve to foreign visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, as well as other immigrants, who initially were blocked from entering the United States by Mr. Trump\u2019s order.The administration\u2019s brief largely tracked its earlier arguments that dismissing the ban outright would threaten national security and disregard presidential authority. But it also asked the appeals court, at a minimum, to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u2014 appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government\u2019s case might not be successful.\u201cAt most,\u201d the brief said, the court order blocking the ban should be limited to \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\u201d That would allow the federal government to block people who have never visited the United States.On Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the administration stood ready to reinstate the entire ban. \u201cOnce we win the case, it will go right back into action,\u201d he said.Later on Monday night, Mr. Trump called threats \u201cfrom radical Islamic terrorism is very real.\u201d\u201cCourts must act fast!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation\u2019s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court. And none of the lower-court rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump.The Ninth Circuit scheduled the oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 3 p.m. Pacific time. It is to take place by telephone, and the court said it would be live-streamed on its website. Holding an oral argument by telephone in a major case is unusual.The case will be heard by Judge William C. Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush.Opponents of Mr. Trump\u2019s targeted travel ban made three kinds of arguments in their submissions to the appeals court, saying that the ban is unlawful, that it represents bad national-security policy, and that it is a threat to the nation\u2019s economy.Fifteen states and the District of Columbia \u2014 including New York, California, Massachusetts and Virginia \u2014 filed a supporting brief to argue that allowing the ban to stand would \u201ccause harm to the states, including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents.\u201dIn a brief filed Saturday, the Trump administration argued that Judge Robart\u2019s order would cause irreparable harm to national security.In response, lawyers for Washington and Minnesota said that was not plausible, because it would mean the nation had long been suffering \u201csome unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm.\u201d\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d the brief said. \u201cAs this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\u201dOn Monday, the Trump administration responded that the states were asking the courts \u201cto take the extraordinary step of second-guessing a formal national-security judgment made by the president himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority.\u201dThe states responded that \u201ccourts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants\u2019 true motives.\u201dThey added that the administration had taken \u201ca dizzying number of positions\u201d on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order itself appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it will not enforce that part of the order.Questions about permanent residents are not moot, the states\u2019 brief said, as the administration could again change positions.The officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama; Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton; Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser; and Leon E. Panetta, secretary of defense and director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama.Mr. Trump\u2019s order, the officials said, would endanger American troops and intelligence sources, disrupt counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts, damage the economy and have \u201ca devastating humanitarian impact.\u201d\u201cAnd apart from all of these concerns,\u201d the former officials said, \u201cthe order offends our nation\u2019s laws and values.\u201dThe third front in the legal battle against Mr. Trump\u2019s order was opened by the technology industry and other businesses.Almost 100 companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, urged the Ninth Circuit to continue to block the order, saying it \u201charms the competitiveness of U.S. companies.\u201dThe \u201cinstability and uncertainty\u201d created by the order, the brief said, \u201cwill make it far more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to hire some of the world\u2019s best talent \u2014 and impede them from competing in the global marketplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Extra Forces Needed in Gulf Now, Defense Chief Says", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis described Iran as the world\u2019s greatest sponsor of terrorism on Saturday, but he emphasized that there was no pressing need for the United States to beef up its military presence in the Persian Gulf region.\u201cI do not see any need to increase the number of forces we have in the Middle East at this time,\u201d Mr. Mattis said, speaking in Tokyo at a news conference as he wound up his visits to Japan and South Korea, his first foreign trip as defense secretary.The Trump administration imposed economic sanctions on Friday against 25 Iranians and companies that it said were connected with Iran\u2019s missile program and the country\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. But so far, the White House has not announced military steps to strengthen its presence in the region. No American aircraft carrier is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf, though the Navy was expected to rotate one into the area.Mr. Mattis defended the decision to put a spotlight on Iran\u2019s behavior, saying that it was important to make Iran recognize that \u201cit is getting the attention of a lot of people.\u201dBut Mr. Mattis said that the United States did not need to deploy additional military resources to signal its concern. \u201cRight now, I do not think that is necessary,\u201d he said.Mr. Mattis also signaled restraint on another hot spot: the South China Sea. Mr. Mattis said that China\u2019s territorial claim to almost all of its waters \u201chas shredded the trust of nations in the region.\u201d But he emphasized that he saw no need for more military maneuvers in the area.\u201cWhat we have to do is exhaust all diplomatic efforts to try to resolve this properly,\u201d he said.In a meeting on Saturday morning with Japan\u2019s defense minister, Tomomi Inada, Mr. Mattis reiterated the United States\u2019 commitment to defend Japan in any confrontation with China over disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu.For the Japanese government, that reassurance was perhaps the most important message of Mr. Mattis\u2019s visit, aside from his confirmation of the United States\u2019 broader commitment to the security of its allies in Asia. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Trump suggested he might pull back from those commitments unless countries like Japan contributed more to the cost of their defense.On Friday, after Mr. Mattis wound up a two-day visit to South Korea \u2014 where he sought to reassure officials that the U.S. commitment to that country\u2019s defense against North Korea had not changed \u2014 the defense secretary told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan that the United States would stand by the countries\u2019 mutual defense treaty.\u201cI want there to be no misunderstanding during the transition in Washington that we stand firmly, 100 percent, shoulder to shoulder with you and the Japanese people,\u201d Mr. Mattis said at the start of a meeting with Mr. Abe.During his meeting Saturday with Ms. Inada, Mr. Mattis did not bring up the matter of Japan\u2019s financial commitment to its military defense, according to briefings from both countries.The American security presence in Japan is most visibly represented by its military bases across the country, with the largest number of troops concentrated in Okinawa, a chain of islands south of the Japanese mainland.In his meeting with Ms. Inada, Mr. Mattis confirmed that the United States would proceed with relocating one of its bases, the Futenma Air Base in the south of Okinawa\u2019s main island, to a much less populated area in Nago, also on the main island.That announcement is likely to anger residents in Okinawa who want the base moved off the island altogether and have long complained about noise and violence. This week, the governor of Okinawa, Takeshi Onaga, visited several members of Congress in Washington to lobby them to persuade the Trump administration to withdraw the base from Okinawa.On Saturday, Mr. Onaga blasted Mr. Mattis for sticking to the relocation plan, calling it \u201cregrettable.\u201dAs a result, Mr. Onaga said in remarks to reporters in Washington, objections from Okinawans \u201ccould be intensified and eventually turned into a protest against the entire U.S. forces, and it could impact the stability of base operations. This could cause serious problems for the U.S.-Japan alliance.\u201dHisako Ueno and Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He was a genuinely strange and scary guy.\u201dThen, in a display of his virility, the 73-year-old character actor dropped to the floor and did one-armed push-ups.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Cabinet Is Mostly Bare. This Man Fills the Void.", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few weeks after the election, Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, was summoned to Trump Tower for a discussion about the economy. It would be the first of many such meetings with President-elect Donald J. Trump.During that sit-down, on Nov. 29, Mr. Cohn briefed Mr. Trump on what he regarded as the chief hurdle to expanding the economy, according to people who were briefed on the discussion: a stronger dollar, which would undermine efforts to create jobs.Mr. Cohn also argued that the bold infrastructure projects that Mr. Trump envisioned would need private-industry partners, those people said, in order to avoid weighing down the government with costs.That got Mr. Trump\u2019s attention.The president-elect turned to the other people in the room \u2014 his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; his chief of staff, Reince Priebus; and Steven T. Mnuchin, his campaign\u2019s chief fund-raiser and Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to be Treasury secretary \u2014 surprised that his infrastructure ideas had such a potential downside.\u201cIs this true?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the group, according to those people. Heads nodded. \u201cWhy did I have to wait to have this guy tell me?\u201d he demanded.It would not be the only time Mr. Cohn was a lonely voice in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner sanctum. Two and a half months after that initial meeting, with key economic posts in the White House and cabinet still vacant, he has become the go-to figure on matters related to jobs, business and growth. He resigned from his position at Goldman in December to become director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council.People with knowledge of his new role said that Mr. Cohn, a Democrat, is summoned to the Oval Office for impromptu meetings with the president up to five times a day \u2014 and that he reaches out to the president on other occasions. Mr. Trump, said one of these people, is oriented toward the bottom line when it comes to shaping policy, often asking Mr. Cohn, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dThe direct access to the president has been crucial as Mr. Cohn navigates a White House where Mr. Bannon and the policy director Stephen Miller are power brokers whose worldviews differ from his, and where unexpected presidential complaints, broadcast on Twitter, can significantly recalibrate the day\u2019s agenda.Topping Mr. Cohn\u2019s current to-do list: corporate and individual tax reforms, to be carried out at the same time; improvements to infrastructure to create new jobs; and regulatory relief in general.He is also studying how to revamp the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign to repeal \u2014 a promise that is proving to be more complicated to keep than he had expected.Mr. Cohn is working with a health care specialist and consulting with House Republicans: Speaker Paul D. Ryan; Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader; and Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. Cohn is determining which aspects of the act may be worth keeping (allowing people to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26 and mandating coverage of people with pre-existing conditions) and which may not (allowing people to sign up for health insurance outside of the typical enrollment periods).Orin Snyder, a corporate litigator and longtime friend of Mr. Cohn\u2019s who speaks to him regularly, said, \u201cHe is working around the clock, energized and focused like a laser beam on developing the best plan for implementing the president\u2019s economic agenda.\u201dThis account of Mr. Cohn\u2019s role in economic matters, amid the tumultuous first three weeks of the Trump administration, is based on interviews with four people who have observed or been briefed on his transition from Goldman to the White House and his early work in the administration.Mr. Trump has already vowed to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulation law that was passed in 2010, and has ordered a reassessment of an Obama-era rule requiring financial advisers to act in the best interest of their clients. The efforts have helped push up stock markets, particularly shares of financial companies.They have also generated outrage in some quarters. \u201cThe way I see this, there was a devastating financial crisis just over eight years ago,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said. \u201cGoldman Sachs was at the heart of that crisis. The idea that the president is now going to turn over the country\u2019s economic policy to a senior Goldman executive turns my stomach.\u201dIt is not just that Mr. Cohn, 56, has a prominent role in economic policy; he is one of the few senior administration officials addressing those issues on the job right now. Questions of job creation and financial regulation might fall within the purview of not only the National Economic Council but also of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 a panel of experts that has historically operated within the White House \u2014 and the Treasury secretary. But Mr. Trump indicated on Wednesday that the vacant position of council chairman would not be cabinet-level, and Mr. Mnuchin has yet to be confirmed.Mr. Cohn collaborates frequently with Mr. Kushner, who is now a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. Along with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, Mr. Cohn recently helped persuade the president not to pursue an executive order that would have rolled back rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.And when Mr. Trump lashes out publicly at a major company or orders a travel ban that inspires wide criticism, from Silicon Valley to Goldman, Mr. Cohn hunkers down on the policy work, people who have observed him said.Mr. Cohn was not looking for a new job when he first encountered Mr. Kushner last year at the behest of Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent who is a mutual friend, according to two people with knowledge of that meeting. Despite the generational divide \u2014 Mr. Kushner is 36 \u2014 the men hit it off, the two people said, and after Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory on Nov. 8, a meeting with Mr. Cohn was quickly arranged.After the initial get-together at Trump Tower, at which a range of jobs were discussed, including energy secretary and director of the Office of Management and Budget, additional talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohn quickly followed, a person who was briefed on those discussions said.On Dec. 12, Mr. Cohn\u2019s new post as National Economic Council director was announced, touching off a rapid career transition that included making extensive financial disclosures, preparing to sell or forfeit an enormous amount of Goldman stock and walling himself off from pending matters that could have posed a conflict of interest.Still, Mr. Cohn\u2019s 26-year career at Goldman, where he performed an array of jobs, including trading commodities, running mortgages and eventually overseeing day-to-day operations, ended with a remarkable windfall: cash and stock valued at $285 million.Ms. Warren and other critics, who have raised questions about Mr. Cohn\u2019s communications with Goldman employees on policy matters since joining the government, find that sum objectionable.A White House spokeswoman had no immediate comment, and a spokesman for Goldman said in a statement that the firm had not been involved in formulating any of the president\u2019s executive orders.Since relocating to Washington, Mr. Cohn has lived in a hotel near the White House, traveling by cab early each day to his new office in time for an 8 a.m. senior staff meeting with Mr. Priebus. At the urging of Dina H. Powell, a former Goldman colleague who is now a presidential adviser, Mr. Cohn hired Jeremy Katz, a former George W. Bush aide, as his deputy. Kenneth Juster, another Bush administration veteran who had become a partner at the private-equity firm Warburg Pincus, was put in charge of international economic affairs.Business interests have been central in Mr. Trump\u2019s early governing, and he has met with chief executives from, among others, Dow Chemical, Tesla and Under Armour to discuss job creation and border taxes. He has also met with the heads of food corporations, financial-services companies and airlines. Mr. Cohn was present for most of those meetings.On taxes, regulations and health care initiatives, \u201cI give them an A-plus,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign who was briefly considered for the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cRegarding trade and the dollar, I\u2019m giving them an incomplete.\u201dCorporate tax reform should be on an even faster trajectory, Mr. Kudlow added. \u201cThe longer you wait on that, the longer economic activity will be postponed. Twenty seventeen could turn out to be a difficult economic and market year, until you get it done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Popular Domestic Programs Face Ax Under First Trump Budget", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House budget office has drafted a hit list of programs that President Trump could eliminate to trim domestic spending, including longstanding conservative targets like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps and the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities.Mr. Trump has spoken volubly about the nation\u2019s drug problems, yet the list includes the White House\u2019s Office of National Drug Control Policy, which dispenses grants to reduce drug use and drug trafficking. And despite Mr. Trump\u2019s vocal promotion of American exports, the list includes the Export-Import Bank, which has guaranteed loans to foreign customers of American companies since the 1930s.While the total amount of annual savings of roughly $2.5 billion would be comparatively small, administration officials want to highlight the agencies in their coming budget proposal as examples of misuse of taxpayer dollars. An internal memo circulated within the Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday, and obtained by The New York Times, notes that the list could change. Proposals for more extensive cuts in cabinet-level agencies are expected to follow.During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised large but unspecified cuts to rein in the deficit, even as he promised to protect programs for his working-class voters and to drastically expand spending on the military, roads, bridges and airports. While the memo in no way resolves that contradiction, it suggests that he could lean toward a small-government philosophy that conservatives like Mr. Mulvaney have fiercely advocated.The Office of Management and Budget is currently operating with a skeleton staff; Mr. Mulvaney was only confirmed on Thursday. Still, officials there plan to ask agencies targeted for elimination for their responses by next Friday and to finalize the list by March 13, according to a person familiar with the process.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed cuts. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said this month that the administration would release a detailed budget in the next few weeks. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has spoken about government spending only in general terms.\u201cA balanced budget is fine,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. \u201cBut sometimes you have to fuel the well in order to really get the economy going.\u201dHe added: \u201cI want a balanced budget eventually. But I want to have a strong military.\u201dThe president\u2019s hope to increase military spending, shared by many Republicans, will probably be at the center of the looming budget battle in Congress. Funding for the current fiscal year is set to expire on April 28. The administration is expected to make a supplemental request before then for money to go to the military \u2014 and possibly a wall on the Mexican border.But under the Budget Control Act of 2011, spending on defense and domestic programs is capped. Democrats will demand that any lifting of those caps for the military be matched by a higher ceiling for domestic programs, setting the stage for a legislative logjam or a showdown over whether to preserve the parliamentary stalling tactic known as the Senate filibuster.Steve Bell, a former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee who is now with the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the programs identified in the memo are standard targets for Republican budget-cutters but of little significance in the government\u2019s financial picture.\u201cIt\u2019s sad in a way because those programs aren\u2019t causing the deficit,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cThese programs don\u2019t amount to a hill of beans.\u201dOne surprise for some close watchers of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is the inclusion of the Export-Import Bank on the O.M.B.\u2019s list. Other Republican candidates had promised to eliminate the bank, a favorite target of House conservatives like Mr. Mulvaney. Conservatives, led by the billionaire Koch brothers, have run a multimillion-dollar campaign to kill the bank, which guarantees loans for overseas customers of American corporations, by denouncing it as \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201dBut the president has stacked his White House with budget hawks. Stephen Miller, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most senior advisers, was a top aide to Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general and spent much of his Senate career trying to rein in government spending.For director of budget policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council, Mr. Trump chose Paul Winfree, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. In its own proposed budget blueprint, the Heritage Foundation recommended eliminating virtually the same programs listed in the Office of Management and Budget memo, along with a long list of others.Many of those programs have been attacked by conservatives since the Republican \u201crevolution\u201d of 1994. Led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, the House of Representatives at the time repeatedly went after funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, whose supporters dragged Big Bird and Kermit the Frog to Capitol Hill to make their case.The Appalachian Regional Commission, an independent agency aimed at developing some of the poorest parts of the country, has also been a target.These agencies have managed to survive partly because of powerful patrons in the Senate, including the late Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. Even now, with 48 seats in the Senate, Democrats have considerable leverage to save popular programs.Backers of the National Endowment for the Arts are likely to put up a particularly vigorous fight.\u201cThe public wants to see agencies like the N.E.A. continue,\u201d said Robert L.

{"Headline": "This Century Is Broken", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of us came of age in the last half of the 20th century and had our perceptions of \u201cnormal\u201d formed in that era. It was, all things considered, an unusually happy period. No world wars, no Great Depressions, fewer civil wars, fewer plagues.It\u2019s looking like we\u2019re not going to get to enjoy one of those times again. The 21st century is looking much nastier and bumpier: rising ethnic nationalism, falling faith in democracy, a dissolving world order.But then around 2000, something shifted. In this century, per-capita growth has been less than 1 percent a year on average, and even since 2009 it\u2019s been only 1.1 percent a year. If the U.S. had been able to maintain postwar 20th-century growth rates into this century, U.S. per-capita G.D.P. would be over 20 percent higher than it is today.Slow growth strains everything else \u2014 meaning less opportunity, less optimism and more of the sort of zero-sum, grab-what-you-can thinking that Donald Trump specializes in. The slowdown has devastated American workers. Between 1985 and 2000, the total hours of paid work in America increased by 35 percent. Over the next 15 years, they increased by only 4 percent.For every one American man aged 25 to 55 looking for work, there are three who have dropped out of the labor force. If Americans were working at the same rates they were when this century started, over 10 million more people would have jobs. As Eberstadt puts it, \u201cThe plain fact is that 21st-century America has witnessed a dreadful collapse of work.\u201dThat means there\u2019s an army of Americans semi-attached to their communities, who struggle to contribute, to realize their capacities and find their dignity. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics time-use studies, these labor force dropouts spend on average 2,000 hours a year watching some screen. That\u2019s about the number of hours that usually go to a full-time job.Fifty-seven percent of white males who have dropped out get by on some form of government disability check. About half of the men who have dropped out take pain medication on a daily basis. A survey in Ohio found that over one three-month period, 11 percent of Ohioans were prescribed opiates. One in eight American men now has a felony conviction on his record.This is no way for our fellow citizens to live. The Eberstadt piece confirms one thought: The central task for many of us now is not to resist Donald Trump. He\u2019ll seal his own fate. It\u2019s to figure out how to replace him \u2014 how to respond to the slow growth and social disaffection that gave rise to him with some radically different policy mix.Cowen shows that in sphere after sphere, Americans have become less adventurous and more static. For example, Americans used to move a lot to seize opportunities and transform their lives. But the rate of Americans who are migrating across state lines has plummeted by 51 percent from the levels of the 1950s and 1960s.Americans used to be entrepreneurial, but there has been a decline in start-ups as a share of all business activity over the last generation. Millennials may be the least entrepreneurial generation in American history. The share of Americans under 30 who own a business has fallen 65 percent since the 1980s.Americans tell themselves the old job-for-life model is over. But in fact Americans are switching jobs less than a generation ago, not more. The job reallocation rate \u2014 which measures employment turnover \u2014 is down by more than a quarter since 1990.There are signs that America is less innovative. Accounting for population growth, Americans create 25 percent fewer major international patents than in 1999. There\u2019s even less hunger to hit the open road. In 1983, 69 percent of 17-year-olds had driver\u2019s licenses. Now only half of Americans get a license by age 18.In different ways Eberstadt and Cowen are describing a country that is decelerating, detaching, losing hope, getting sadder. Economic slowdown, social disaffection and risk aversion reinforce one another.Of course nothing is foreordained. But where is the social movement that is thinking about the fundamentals of this century\u2019s bad start and envisions an alternate path? Who has a compelling plan to boost economic growth? If Trump is not the answer, what is?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Communist Party Guided China to Success", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySinosphereIn an interview, Mr. Heilmann discussed the underappreciated strengths of China\u2019s political system as well as how, under President Xi Jinping, it may have cast off some of the openness to experimentation that contributed to its success in recent decades.What is striking about your book are the case studies, showing how different ministries and commissions actually function.We wanted to show problem-solving, or what\u2019s known as the provision of public goods. For example, how exactly does it create a rural health care system? How does it ensure food safety? These are issues that governments around the world have to deal with. It\u2019s about more than ideology. It\u2019s about how the system actually works.Another unusual feature that we try to explain is how the system of cadres [party officials] functions. In the West, policies are set by law and then carried out by civil servants. In China, policy implementation depends on cadres. They are given clear metrics and goals for achieving things and then told to go do them. Major policy shifts and top-down initiatives are managed through this cadre system, not by making laws.For example? A key question you pose is how much of China\u2019s success can be ascribed to this political system. What\u2019s the answer?There are several important elements. One is the party successfully sets long-term political goals, such as the modernization of industry or technology, or infrastructure planning. As Deng Xiaoping made clear in the 1980s, it can concentrate resources in priority areas. I see this as a strength in the initial phase of development, from say the 1980s to the mid-2000s.Another crucial element is experimentation. This is something we ignore in the West \u2014 how unexpectedly flexible China\u2019s deeply bureaucratic system can be. This flexibility has been demonstrated in the ability to set up pilot projects in special economic zones, in local tests \u2014 such as for housing reform or bankruptcy in state enterprises. Very difficult measures were regularly tested in pilot projects for several years before national laws were enacted.You show how this flexibility arose from the Communist Party\u2019s revolutionary experience. This is very important. Because we have to ask ourselves, how did a socialist bureaucratic system get this kind of adaptability that you didn\u2019t see in Eastern Europe? It\u2019s due to the specific historical experiences of this party [in the 1930s and 1940s before coming to power]. It controlled very spread-out and not contiguous districts. So when it tried something like land reform it was done experimentally and in a decentralized fashion. This was fundamentally different from the Soviet Union.This willingness to experiment was also a hallmark of the Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin periods. There was an argument that reforms must proceed in sequence, so they had to be coordinated. But the effect has been that not much has happened since 2013 [when Mr. Xi became president] in terms of ground-up problem-solving. If you rely on hierarchy and discipline, the courage to experiment at the lower levels is squeezed out. People are afraid of trying things.Ironically, it\u2019s only now that some countries are looking at China as a model. Can it be a model? For many years I would have said no, but many countries are struggling with how to deal with pressing basic problems like maintaining internal security, building physical infrastructure and providing jobs. These are the basis of populist movements around the world. China is a point of orientation. It can\u2019t be duplicated because these other countries don\u2019t have a Communist Party with the special history and features of China\u2019s. But in terms of considering illiberal, state-directed solutions, China is often cited as an example of how an authoritarian government can deal with things differently. China\u2019s experience is thus a permanent question mark for the world when they ask if the Western model is the best.Toward the end of the book you offer several scenarios for how China might develop, and poll Merics staffers for their views. Most support the first scenario, which is a \u201ccentralized and disciplined party and security state (the Xi Jinping system).\u201d You are less sure, arguing that the risks are greater than people realize. I\u2019m not sure that the party can achieve everything it\u2019s set out to do. It\u2019s tried to keep a lid on all changes in society, but I doubt this can work over time. There are different lifestyles and forces in society. I\u2019m not sure they can be unified. I\u2019m very skeptical.Also, we shouldn\u2019t forget that hierarchical systems are susceptible to shocks. If Xi Jinping became seriously ill, what would happen to the political system? The system has been tailored to him. Or, if there are military skirmishes, how will the nationalistic forces in society react?This system is built for expansion, especially economic expansion, and setbacks are very hard to justify. It\u2019s easier in Western systems because you can change the government. But in China you can\u2019t. So the potential for disruption is greater than people imagine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arun Jaitley, India\u2019s Finance Chief, Aims to Spur Economy Hit by Cash Shortage", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe budget plan was presented by the minister of finance, Arun Jaitley, in a highly anticipated annual ritual. It included tax cuts for lower income taxpayers and small businesses, even as it came close to sticking with the country\u2019s target for reducing its budget deficit.\u201cWith this gradual approach, I\u2019ve ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation without compromising investment,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said in a two-hour speech before the Indian Parliament.The budget presentation came as five states in India prepare to go to the polls beginning Feb. 4th, including India\u2019s largest state of Uttar Pradesh. The prime minister is hoping to win that state to gain control over the upper house of Parliament, demonstrating strength in advance of national elections in 2019.His budget plan received mostly positive responses for taking measures to increase consumer demand and jobs while still adhering largely to the deficit plan. It calls for reducing the deficit to 3.2 percent of G.D.P. for next year from 3.5 percent in the current fiscal year, a bit short of the government\u2019s previously stated target of 3 percent.\u201cThe economy needs the spending to give consumption a boost, but the government is also giving weight to fiscal prudence,\u201d said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil Ltd., an Indian credit rating agency.Mr. Jaitley said his budget had increased capital investment by about 25 percent and raised rural and farm spending by 24 percent.The budget also cuts income taxes to 5 percent from 10 percent for people making between $3,700 and $7,400 annually. But he imposed a 10 percent surcharge on higher-income taxpayers.Small businesses with annual revenue of up to $7.5 million \u2014 96 percent of Indian businesses \u2014 would see their tax rates cut to 25 percent from 30 percent, Mr. Jaitley said.Much of the spending in rural areas will go to building roads, with the aim of increasing efficiency and access to markets while providing jobs, Mr. Joshi said. The budget also substantially increased India\u2019s expenditure on its rural employment program, to $710 million, the highest ever.Current laws do not require parties to report the sources of contributions of less than 20,000 rupees, or about $300. Mr. Jaitley\u2019s plan would reduce that to 2,000 rupees, or about $30.However, one activist, Jagdeep Chhokar, a founding member of the Association for Democratic Reforms, a nonprofit organization, dismissed the change as ineffectual, saying donors would simply slice contributions into $30 pieces. To achieve transparency, he said, the government will have to proscribe cash contributions entirely, instead requiring they be made digitally so they can be traced.The tax cuts for the middle class and spending increases in rural areas, where most Indians still reside, would help boost discretionary spending that had suffered after the currency ban, said Deepak Parekh, the chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation, one of India\u2019s largest mortgage lenders.\u201cIt is extremely well thought-out,\u201d Mr. Parekh said of the budget, in a telephone interview, crediting the government with being \u201cfrank enough to say the economy has taken a hit\u201d and proactive enough to provide a needed spending boost.Mr. Joshi said the government\u2019s budget, if executed well, could help restore some of the jobs lost. In addition to plans to increase capital spending, Mr. Modi\u2019s budget plan aims to build 10 million new affordable homes for the poor in rural areas by 2019.\u201cThe jobless will get support if these programs are executed well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Steady Gains in Economic Outlook, Fed Leaves Interest Rate Unchanged", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is waiting for more information about the Trump administration\u2019s economic plans, just like everyone else.After its first policy making meeting of the year, the Fed said on Wednesday that its economic outlook remained essentially unchanged since its previous meeting in December. The nation\u2019s slow-and-steady economic expansion has continued, with little sign in the latest data that it is flagging or accelerating.The question is what comes next.Fed officials said in the weeks before the meeting Wednesday that their uncertainty about the outlook had increased. President Trump has proposed significant shifts in economic policy \u2014 including changes in taxation, regulation and trade \u2014 that could affect growth.\u201cThe statement is written such that the F.O.M.C. will be able to adjust monetary policy as needed in response to the fiscal and trade policies of the administration,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.By raising rates, the Fed is gradually reducing the force of that stimulus.Fed officials predicted in December that they would raise the benchmark rate three times this year. But they have cautioned that changes in fiscal policy could alter those plans. If Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans seek to increase growth, for example by cutting taxes or spending a lot on infrastructure and the military, the Fed could raise rates more quickly.If Mr. Trump\u2019s policies weigh on growth, the Fed could move more slowly.The only hint of those pressures in the Fed\u2019s latest statement was a mention of increased public optimism about the outlook for the nation\u2019s economy.\u201cMeasures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late,\u201d it said.Fed officials are watching fiscal policy makers closely because the Fed has concluded that the American economy is growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace, meaning that, in the Fed\u2019s view, faster growth would probably lead to higher inflation.Changes in fiscal policy are most likely to have a gradual impact, however, so the tension between the Fed and fiscal policy makers may play out mostly in coming years.\u201cThe committee is probably still in a wait-and-see mode as far as fiscal policy is concerned,\u201d said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC.The Fed\u2019s assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat. The latest data showed \u201cthe labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace,\u201d the statement said. \u201cJob gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low.\u201dFed officials spoke in similarly optimistic tones in the weeks before the meeting.But seven years of tepid growth have not restored the economy to full health.The vote to leave rates unchanged was unanimous, the Fed said. And the tempered language of the statement led investors to mark down the modest chance of a rate increase at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in March, from about 20 percent before the February statement to about 18 percent afterward, CME Group said.Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed, will have a chance to elaborate on the central bank\u2019s economic outlook and policy plans when she delivers a semiannual report on monetary policy to Senate and House committees on Feb. 14 and 15.In the meantime, the Fed is the rare corner of official Washington where nothing is happening. Contrasting a lively week at the White House and on Capitol Hill with the Fed\u2019s announcement, Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, declared the Fed\u2019s headquarters \u201cthe most boring spot in Washington.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Department of Justification", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "FeatureStephen Bannon and Jeff Sessions, the new attorney general, have long shared a vision for remaking America. Now the nation\u2019s top law-enforcement agency can serve as a tool for enacting it.Supported byAt a time when other, more libertarian conservatives had begun to embrace critiques of the criminal-justice system, each man saw crime as yet another way that the fabric of society was deteriorating. While Bannon was chief executive, Breitbart created a specific tag for articles called \u201cblack crime\u201d and ran article after article demonizing the Black Lives Matter movement (calling protesters \u201cblood-lusting junkies\u201d) and showing Latino immigrants as violent (\u201cOne Sex Offender Illegal Alien Caught After Another Alleged Offender Legalized\u201d). The site also frequently covered Sessions\u2019s condemnations of criminal-justice reform. Opposing a bipartisan bill to reduce sentences for some nonviolent drug offenses, Sessions said last May that Republican supporters of the legislation \u201cin no way represent the conservative movement\u201d and warned against \u201csigning death warrants for thousands of American innocent citizens.\u201dWhy would the Trump administration paint a picture so starkly at odds with reality? It\u2019s simple: A vision of the nation besieged provides clear justification for policies that will advance Sessions, Bannon and Miller\u2019s divisive nationalism. In the administration\u2019s early moves, we can already see the contours beginning to take shape. An executive order presented as an emergency measure to protect the country from terrorists winds up barring immigrants coming here to study or work from seven countries that have not been a source of terrorist attacks in the United States since Sept. 11. Another order refers to immigrants who \u201cpose a risk to public safety\u201d and then makes millions of the undocumented people in the country a priority for deportation. Impending catastrophe grants the president broad powers, and those powers are used broadly.It is through the Justice Department that the administration is likely to advance its nationalist plans \u2014 to strengthen the grip of law enforcement, raise barriers to voting and significantly reduce all forms of immigration, promoting what seems to be a longstanding desire to reassert the country\u2019s European and Christian heritage. It\u2019s not an accident that Sessions, who presumably could have chosen from a number of plum assignments, opted for the role of attorney general. The Department of Justice is the most valuable perch from which to transform the country in the way he and Bannon have wanted. With an exaggerated threat of disorder looming, the nation\u2019s top law-enforcement agency could become a machine for trying to fundamentally change who gets to be an American and what rights they can enjoy.At the time, lawyers worked all over Washington, in the State Department, the Interior Department and elsewhere. But it wasn\u2019t until the opening in 1934 of the Justice Department\u2019s current headquarters, an imposing building the size of a large square block, that the department became a strong institutional presence. Justice Department lawyers flexed their muscles defending the New Deal, and the agency expanded in scope.For all the vast sweep of the Department of Justice as a whole, much of its influence over the major political conflicts of our time, and certainly those poised to dominate the next four years, is concentrated within the civil rights division, charged as it is with ensuring equal protection under the law. With a staff of roughly 700, the division is basically the watchdog of the government and also a kind of police of the nation\u2019s police, because it has the power to investigate departments for violations of civil rights law. It can also sue localities for discrimination in housing, education and employment, on the basis of sex, national origin, religion or disability as well as race. The division also protects the rights of people in prison and mental institutions.When the division was founded in 1957, it was staffed by a handful of lawyers who largely refrained from directly challenging Jim Crow in the South. But when Robert F. Kennedy became attorney general in 1961, things changed. He \u201chad his own ambitions,\u201d Shugerman says. \u201cEven as J.F.K. tried to steer the ship down the middle, R.F.K. pulled it toward civil rights.\u201d In the 1970s and early \u201980s, the civil rights division\u2019s ranks grew, attracting top law-school graduates to nonpartisan civil-service jobs. Many of them hoped to serve in the tradition of lawyers like John Doar, a Republican from Wisconsin who lived in a dorm for weeks with James Meredith, the first African-American student to attend the University of Mississippi, during his struggle to register for classes in 1962. \u201cMost of us were liberals, and we were passionate about fighting the country\u2019s long history of racial injustice,\u201d says William Yeomans, who worked in the division for 24 years, beginning in 1981.Political battles over the priorities of the division have been escalating for decades. During Democratic presidencies, the division has moved to challenge intentional discrimination by individuals (like a landlord who turns away an African-American couple and then rents to a white one) and has sought to combat policies that disproportionally affect minorities, even if it\u2019s not easy to prove they\u2019re racially motivated (like a low-income housing program that funnels African-American recipients into mostly minority areas). Republican administrations since the Reagan era, by contrast, have tended to bring individual rather than broad suits while also treating civil rights as race-neutral or colorblind and opposing affirmative action. They have also been equally likely to sue on behalf of white and black people who say they face unequal treatment. \u201cThe Republican view of civil rights focuses on the protection of the individual,\u201d says Robert Driscoll, chief of staff of the civil rights division during George W. Bush\u2019s first term. The Republican approach has caused tension with the career staff. \u201cWhenever the G.O.P. is in office, there\u2019s a certain amount of heat on whoever is in charge,\u201d Driscoll says. \u201cThe career people hated us when I was there.\u201dIn this way, the Justice Department under Obama used civil rights enforcement \u2014 or the potential for it \u2014 to check private, local and state entities that otherwise would have escaped federal intervention. But Sessions can pull back on such oversight, even to an extent (if he chooses) beyond that of his Republican predecessors. Invoking Trump\u2019s nightmare vision of America as beset by lawlessness, the department can unbind the hands of law-enforcement agencies around the country. On issues like immigration and voting rights, with public perceptions influenced by inflated tales of criminality (improper use of benefits, voter fraud), a Sessions-led Department of Justice can both feed the narrative of crime and react to it, through heightened investigations and prosecutions. A civil rights system built up to protect the minority from the majority could quickly turn into the reverse.While many conservative figures kept their distance from Trump during the campaign, one group embraced him wholeheartedly: law-enforcement unions. The rank and file did, too. A survey before the election by Police Magazine found that 84 percent of officers who planned to vote backed him, while just 8 percent supported Hillary Clinton. Trump\u2019s views on the Black Lives Matter movement, which many cops have seen as unfair and a danger to policing minority neighborhoods, no doubt played a part. Last summer, Trump called the movement a \u201cthreat,\u201d blaming it for the deaths of officers and adding, \u201cWe are going to have to perhaps talk with the attorney general about it.\u201dToday the test is how Trump\u2019s new attorney general will view the Justice Department\u2019s responsibility, conferred by Congress in 1994 after the beating of Rodney King, to investigate local police departments for a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of civil rights violations. With more than 12,000 police departments across the country, the division couldn\u2019t exercise anything approaching true national oversight even if it wanted to. (Perez and Gupta\u2019s total of 25 investigations was equal to that of the Clinton Justice Department over eight years; the Bush administration initiated 21.) But the Obama Justice Department\u2019s willingness to enter cities like Chicago, Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., after high-profile encounters between the police and African-Americans meant that officers everywhere had to reckon with the possibility of federal investigation \u2014 at a time when many of them already felt under siege.In appearing to categorically oppose consent decrees and signaling a lack of interest in broad new investigations, Sessions appears to be going further than even police groups do. \u201cNo officer worth his badge would say \u2018no investigations\u2019\u2009if an investigation is warranted,\u201d James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, told me. But that doesn\u2019t mean the police wouldn\u2019t like the Justice Department to back off in Chicago, where no consent decree was negotiated before Obama\u2019s and Gupta\u2019s departures, and it\u2019s now up to Sessions to decide what an agreement of any kind should look like, or whether it should exist at all.The question for the country is what happens if local police departments, relieved of the realistic prospect of federal oversight, feel their hands are untied in tense situations. On an evening in January when Fox News ran a segment on the recent spike in murders in Chicago, Trump tweeted a few minutes later that he could \u201csend in the feds!\u201d It\u2019s hard to know what Trump meant, but he was not talking about protecting civil rights. The next time a disturbing video of a police shooting surfaces, it\u2019s easy to imagine Trump and Sessions supporting the police without question and directing a crackdown on protesters, especially if they\u2019re mostly black. That would connect the Trumpist edition of law and order to the apparent project of undermining the rights of minorities and their claim on the national conscience.The Obama Justice Department responded by joining civil rights groups in suing Texas and North Carolina, claiming the laws had the effect of discriminating against minority voters. Matching voter rolls to the records in state and federal databases, experts hired by the Justice Department determined that more than 600,000 voters in Texas lacked the required ID and that they were disproportionately black and Latino. An appeals court ruled against Texas last July. Nine days later, a second appeals court struck down North Carolina\u2019s law, saying the restrictions \u201ctarget African-American voters with almost surgical precision.\u201d Obama urged other states to heed the lesson in his final speech as president: \u201cWe should be making it easier, not harder, to vote.\u201dBush appointees in the civil rights division were also caught trying to illegally push out career civil rights lawyers and replace them with conservatives. In an internal email, one Bush appointee, Brad Schlozman, wrote to another Republican: \u201cMy tentative plans are to gerrymander all those crazy libs right out of the section.\u201d By the end of Bush\u2019s term, most of the career attorneys had been pushed out or had left. \u201cThey attacked everything we were supposed to stand for,\u201d says Joe Rich, who spent 36 years in the division.During Obama\u2019s presidency, new career lawyers were hired, but Sessions could try to transfer them or lay them off. The Heritage Foundation has called for reducing the civil rights division\u2019s budget by $58 million, or about one-third.It falls to immigration agents at the Department of Homeland Security, not the Department of Justice, to pick people up. But Sessions has a major role to play. To begin with, he oversees the nation\u2019s immigration courts. The Feb. 20 guidelines call for the Justice Department to send a surge of judges to the border to turn people around with a type of speedy removal, entailing only the barest form of legal process \u2014 a practice that Trump just expanded far beyond what any president has authorized (and which now applies in the interior of the country as well). Sessions also has the authority to streamline appeals, by expanding a cursory form of review used during the Bush years, and to overturn Obama-era decisions that have made it easier to receive asylum or get legal counsel.Democratic mayors and governors have vowed not to cooperate with a federal crackdown, and Trump has responded with an order asking the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to withhold federal funds from them. It will be up to Sessions to decide how far to go in trying to cancel grants that cities receive from his department (for drug treatment and crime prevention, for example).In November 2013, the Justice Department succeeded in permanently blocking most of H.B. 56. The civil rights divisions of the Department of Justice and the Department of Education followed with a letter in 2014 to every school district in the country, warning against any policy that could dissuade students from enrolling because of their families\u2019 immigration status. The Justice Department also defended Obama\u2019s actions to allow young people brought to the United States as children, called Dreamers, and their close relatives to work or go to school without fear of deportation. Sessions could review that directive and call for withdrawing it, perhaps as a misuse of prosecutorial discretion. In other words, the Justice Department, especially in the last few years, has operated in several ways to make undocumented families more secure. Sessions can repurpose the machinery to do something else entirely.In almost all circumstances, the top law-enforcement official in the executive branch is expected to side with the chief of that branch \u2014 the president. Yet we want the attorney general to exercise his or her own judgment when we fear presidential wrongdoing. Nixon\u2019s attorney general, Elliot Richardson, and then the acting attorney general who was next in line, William Ruckelshaus, are celebrated for resigning when Nixon ordered them to fire the special prosecutor who was investigating his role in the Watergate break-in. Sessions is already facing questions about his independence for not recusing himself from any F.B.I. investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Because Sessions was an architect of the particular nationalist vision that drives Trump\u2019s approach to policing, voting and immigration, it\u2019s hard to imagine what the president (or Bannon) would want to do in those arenas that Sessions would not be ready to defend. Unlike Yates, he is in accord with their aims. He can simply perform the attorney general\u2019s ordinary duties, by doing his utmost to ensure Trump\u2019s orders survive legal scrutiny.What can stop Trump, Bannon and Sessions from using the Justice Department to achieve their goals? So far, judges across the country have prevented Trump from carrying out his refugee and travel ban, and they\u2019ve accepted lawsuits against him for review.Over time, however, more federal judges will be Trump appointees. It\u2019s not just Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court that\u2019s important for determining the legal fate of Trumpism. Rulings by lower court judges set expectations and establish rationales. Because of the high number of vacancies and older judges, Trump may be able to appoint a greater share of federal judges than any first-term president in 40 years.Judges are supposed to be entirely independent of the president even if he appoints them. The Constitution depends on it. And there are other constraints. The Justice Department\u2019s career staff exerts a strong pull toward the center. The public\u2019s restive mood and high level of engagement so far matter, too. It\u2019s no sure thing that Sessions, Bannon and Trump will succeed in carrying out their shared vision. But they\u2019re likely to work together, as long as they\u2019re each in office, to test how far the country will let them go.An earlier version of this article included outdated statistics. It is not the case that non-Muslim extremists have killed nearly twice as many Americans as radical Muslims since Sept. 11, 2001, according to the New America Foundation. That was true until the mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla. Radical Muslims have now killed nearly twice as many Americans as non-Muslim extremists since Sept. 11, 2001.Advertisement"}

Just an hour earlier, my partner and I wrangled them from the warmth of their rooms and the sweet oblivion of their rerun streams of \u201990s sitcoms to this moment. The youngest yelled from upstairs, \u201cThis is something you guys care about, not us!\u201d And he was right. Why would they want to spend a morning walking the freezing streets of Lower Manhattan? And if I weren\u2019t a mom, I might have said this, and the tour would have been over before it began.Still, we arrive 10 minutes late for a tour that asks everyone to be 15 minutes early.In my 20s and early 30s, when writing was still the sideline thing I hoped to one day not be so sideline, I walked the Lower Manhattan streets to my job as a word-processing temp. It was awful work that brought me each weekday morning either to the World Trade Center or to Wall Street to be ordered about by mergers-and-acquisitions bankers working for companies that no longer exist \u2014 Bankers Trust, Prudential-Bache, Manufacturers Hanover.As Sean drops this bit of knowledge, my children perk up \u2014 having seen Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s \u201cHamilton,\u201d they consider themselves scholars on the subject of our founding father. Suddenly this tour is relevant. Across from the tavern stands the spot of the first presidential mansion (demolished in 1856) where Samuel Fraunces managed the presidential staff.For me, New York is a city that is continually unlocking new doors \u2014 the tour is one that is at once devastating and amazingly empowering. When Sean stops our small group at Philipse Well on Pearl Street, we stand around it, staring down as he explains how this cistern exists on what was once the Philipse family\u2019s property and was a place where enslaved people were allowed to gather and engage with one another as they drew water. Any other gathering among more than three enslaved people was against the law.I had grown up believing New York to be a free state, but being one of the early free states and being a truly free state were very different.I learn that under British rule, enslaved people were treated worse than any other group of enslaved people in history. I watch my children watching Sean, who I have now decided is nothing short of exceptional, discuss the complexities of race, the importance of gathering, the genius and resilience of enslaved people. The group stares down into the well for a few somber moments, then moves on.In an attempt to make a life-to-text connection, I whisper to my daughter that she read about this in Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s \u201cBetween the World and Me.\u201d Radio silence and eyeroll \u2014 which mean I\u2019m getting through to her. Throughout the tour, Sean counters the brutality and inhumanity of enslavement with information about the constant uprisings and opposition. Because this is a tour company that also provides educational tours to school groups, Sean\u2019s clarity engages my son, who by this point is walking beside him.We move on to 5 Broad Street where we stand in front of the former location of Downing\u2019s Oyster House, where Thomas Downing, the son of freed slaves, catered to aristocracy in his lush restaurant, while his son, George, helped hide runaway slaves en route north in the basement.Bounty hunters, or \u201cblackbirders,\u201d as we learned they were called, roamed Manhattan in search of escapees. Even though slavery was abolished in New York in 1827, not all black folks living in New York were free. And the Fugitive Slave Act didn\u2019t help!Then Sean lets us know that while Alexander Hamilton was a man of manumissions who had a complicated history with slavery, the family of his wife, Eliza, were slaveholders. The disappointment in Eliza is clear on the faces of both children. In \u201cHamilton,\u201d she is beloved, a hero. But on the tour, by my children, not so much anymore.There is something else going on. I watch my children beginning to understand the complexity of the city they\u2019ve always known and loved deeply. They are coming to know that the history of their New York speaks to an even deeper history of their country, and to the fact that only a few subway stops away from our Brooklyn home, we can walk the same streets our ancestors walked \u2014 freely.Ms. Toussaint began the company with her friend, Sheila Collins. The plan was to give socially responsible and thoughtful tours of this great and complicated city. Her wealth of knowledge, her cleareyed approach, her stories and passion and honest commitment to African-American history reminded me of some of my best teachers in high school \u2014 the ones who made me laugh while learning, the ones who made me hungry for more. I saw this in the faces of my children. As Sean told the story of Ellen Craft, a light-skinned enslaved woman who escaped with her husband, William Craft, into freedom by passing as a white man and posing as his master, I saw my daughter smile \u2014 a smile that spoke to the pride of coming to this moment through a history of resistance.Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s most recent novel, \u201cAnother Brooklyn,\u201d was a finalist for the National Book Award, the NAACP Image Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fillon Scandal Indicts, Foremost, France\u2019s Political Elite", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The president of the National Assembly does it. The president of the Senate defends it. Dozens of rank-and-file parliamentarians do it, too. Hiring your spouse, son or sister in France\u2019s Parliament is perfectly legal.The answer has, belatedly, come roaring back from much of the country\u2019s press and public: They just don\u2019t get it.\u201cPenelopegate,\u201d a scandal named for Mr. Fillon\u2019s wife, now threatens to sink the ambitions of a man who little more than a week ago seemed all but certain to become France\u2019s next president.But the scandal has done more than add another volatile element to France\u2019s presidential campaign. It has also tapped a wellspring of anger in the French electorate and called into question the standard operating procedures of the political class.The outrage has buffeted the establishment, rendering it ever more vulnerable to the same angry populist forces that have already upset politics as usual from Washington to London to Rome.France\u2019s gilded political culture of immunity and privilege \u2014 free train and plane tickets, first-class travel, chauffeurs, all in a setting of marble and tapestries \u2014 can no longer be taken for granted, analysts warn.\u201cNepotism is part of French institutional genetics,\u201d said Matthieu Caron, an expert on government ethics at the University of Valenciennes. \u201cIt is unfortunately a \u2018great\u2019 French tradition.\u201dThe scandal over Mr. Fillon, he added, is \u201cmaking the National Front\u2019s day,\u201d even as Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party, too, faces its own no-show employment scandal in the European Parliament.The difference is that, unlike Mr. Fillon, who has campaigned on a platform of probity and high ethics, Ms. Le Pen has never \u201cpresented herself as the incarnation of republican morality,\u201d Mr. Caron said.Though a fixture of France\u2019s political landscape for over 40 years, the National Front has never held power at the top, and so can position itself outside the establishment.Just how much Mr. Fillon\u2019s scandal has improved the Front\u2019s chances of toppling the old order in elections this spring is among the most urgent questions facing France and Europe as a whole.The uproar has similarly lifted the hopes of Emmanuel Macron, the former Rothschild banker and economy minister in the Socialist government, who is running an insurgent campaign atop his own newly formed political movement.France\u2019s financial prosecutor is now looking into Mr. Fillon\u2019s cozy monetary arrangements with his wife. His parliamentary offices were raided this week, he and his wife, Penelope, were questioned by the investigators, and Mr. Fillon has said he will bow out of the race if he is indicted.But it is telling of the decades of slow rot that have eaten into France\u2019s political establishment that virtually no one in line to replace Mr. Fillon is untainted, either.In France, to be a high-level member of the political class is to enter an exalted state where it appears O.K. to summon a professional shoeshiner to the presidential palace (one of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s top aides was forced to resign after that and similar revelations). Lunches with the minister are at least three courses with wine, served by gloved footmen in gilt-paneled chambers hung with tapestries.Which may explain why Mr. Fillon, 62 and also a former prime minister, sounded plaintive this week, defending himself at a Paris trade show.He had been in France\u2019s Parliament for 30 years and his wife had been working for him that long, he said. \u201cIf they wanted to get me in trouble over this, they could have done it earlier,\u201d he complained.But that may be precisely the problem. Mr. Fillon didn\u2019t say it, but the implication seemed clear: Over years of fat parliamentary paychecks to his wife, nobody ever raised questions about it.And that, in spite of the fact that she was never seen around the building, did not have a badge or an email address, according to some news reports, and told interviewers over the years she stayed away from her husband\u2019s political life.The sense of entitlement, and indeed nepotism, is an inheritance of the country\u2019s monarchical culture, political experts and historians say.At least 20 percent, and probably more, of French parliamentarians hire family members. Others hire the wives, children or nephews of colleagues, according to some in Parliament \u2014 a mutual back-scratching that can profit both sides.Inside Parliament\u2019s stately marbled chambers this week, some deputies ducked questions about family hiring. Just a few wondered whether moral issues might be involved.\u201cOn the whole, they are not calling into question at all family employment,\u201d insisted Ren\u00e9 Dosi\u00e8re, a veteran Socialist deputy who has been associated with ethics reform in Parliament. Even he defended the practice, though he does not do it himself.\u201cIt is legal,\u201d Mr. Dosi\u00e8re mused. \u201cBut is it moral?\u201dThat question has not arisen publicly, until now, and for good reason, experts say. Employing family members \u201cbears witness to a culture of caste or oligarchy that makes it absolutely natural for politicians to profit to the maximum from political power,\u201d said Jean Garrigues, a leading historian of France\u2019s political culture.\u201cThere\u2019s a custom, a culture which has become part of French political life, which is a heritage of the monarchy, and which is completely French,\u201d Mr. Garrigues said. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that, as soon as he is picked, he\u2019s free to dispose of public money as he pleases.\u201dThat is so despite reforms in 2013 that have raised public expectations for change, something Mr. Fillon appears to have underestimated.Since the ethics reform, members of Parliament have to give the names of their assistants, though not necessarily their relationship to them.\u201cFran\u00e7ois Fillon is in a new world now,\u201d said Mr. Caron, the ethics expert. \u201cThere is a demand for transparency.\u201dSome lawmakers were indignant. \u201cI\u2019m transparent,\u201d one parliamentarian, Jean-Pierre Gorges, said angrily. \u201cI tell people, go see my wife and daughter, and you will see how hard they are working.\u201d\u201cPeople are mixing everything up,\u201d said Mr. Gorges, who represents the town of Chartres. \u201cIt\u2019s all just to have next to you an employee who is actually much closer to you, and can keep things confidential. You are not just a deputy 9 to 5, you know.\u201dThe scandal over Mr. Fillon is unlikely to simply blow over. \u201cWhat was tolerated 10 years ago will no longer be tolerated by the French,\u201d Mr. Garrigues said. \u201cThere\u2019s a disjunction between public opinion and the conservatism of the politicians.\u201dThat certainly appeared to be borne out in the comments of visitors to the grand old Parliament building this week. As the deputies ducked and scurried in a marble antechamber off the main hall, a visiting group from the rural Loiret d\u00e9partement expressed dismay at the affair.\u201cThis just casts a shadow over our political institutions,\u201d Marc Bouwyn said. \u201cAnd we are only now finding out about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron Steps Into France\u2019s Political Void", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Insults and rumors keep coming: His speeches are too long and full of feel-good banalities. He does not have a real program. His time in government was a failure. He is secretly gay. He is developing a personality cult. He favors capitalism, and besides, he is too young.If any surer sign was needed that Emmanuel Macron, the 39-year-old former minister of the economy, is the new front-runner in France\u2019s presidential race, look no further than the concentrated volley of wild attacks against him. Even the Russians, via pro-Kremlin websites, are piling on.But perhaps the only thing more improbable for France than electing Ms. Le Pen would be to elect Mr. Macron.Despite Ms. Le Pen\u2019s best efforts to remake her party, the National Front has traditionally been too toxic for a majority of French to embrace. So even though she currently leads in the polls, hardly anyone expects her to make it through the second round of the country\u2019s two-stage voting this spring to become president.While he has pushed a message that includes doses from left, right and center \u2014 maintain France\u2019s social protections, keep the country in the European Union and lighten the burden on business \u2014 it is a strategy that has also made him the candidate offering something just about everyone can hate.Or, perhaps more damning in France, it has risked making him into a mannequin candidate who stands for nothing.\u201cEmmanuel Macron doesn\u2019t want to define himself, and it\u2019s becoming a problem,\u201d Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis, a Socialist heavyweight and the party\u2019s secretary, said recently. \u201cMeanwhile, it\u2019s all a little bit hollow.\u201dWhen Mr. Macron started his campaign, snickers about his new movement\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cEn Marche,\u201d or, \u201cOn Our Way\u201d \u2014 all but drowned out whatever message the young minister was trying to project. \u201cOn our way \u2014 to what?\u201d the skeptics asked.That questions remains largely unanswered even as he now gains traction.A small stream of Socialist members of Parliament have signed on, despite threats of excommunication from the party, as well as some business and political leaders.Mr. Macron is married to his former high school drama teacher \u2014 this fascinates his countrymen \u2014 who is 24 years his senior, and he caused a scandal in his provincial hometown, Amiens, by wooing her. He is a former investment banker with Rothschild & Company, low on the list of most admired professions.Yet Mr. Macron and his wife, Brigitte, have been on the cover of Paris Match four times in the last year. The glossy magazine has published photographs of the minister giving a bottle to his wife\u2019s grandchildren.On Monday, he brought the gay rumors into the open, joking about them in a speech, to the surprise of French media: \u201cIt\u2019s disagreeable for Brigitte,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cShe\u2019s asking how I pull this off, physically.

In Lyon last weekend 8,000 people packed into the sports stadium to hear him, forcing thousands more out on to the grounds to watch Mr. Macron on giant screens.He spoke for nearly two hours, his face turned up in a kind of rapture, frequently addressing the crowd as his friends.There were many vague promises of hope and unity, and above all, delight in the huge crowd that had come out. \u201cYour presence, this wall of presences around me, this is living proof that we really are here,\u201d Mr. Macron said, beaming.\u201cIt\u2019s a demonstration of desire,\u201d he told the crowd, \u201cthe desire to picture a new future,\u201d he continued, in a literary language he says was imbibed early during a studious childhood, in his new campaign book \u2014 commentators have mocked the grandeur of the title \u2014 \u201cRevolution.\u201dIn his speech Mr. Macron claimed the mantle of left, right, center, Charles de Gaulle, and other factions, as well as writers like \u00c9mile Zola, Charles P\u00e9guy and Ren\u00e9 Char, all under the floating aegis of a \u201cwill to assemble\u201d and \u201creconciliation.\u201d\u201cAnd the Gaullists,\u201d he said, \u201cdid they not carry in their genes this will to assemble, this will not to capitulate to any faction, this incompatibility with conservatism, hatred of the other, and of division?\u201dThe crowd erupted in cheers of \u201cMacron, President!\u201dHe spoke of lowering taxes on companies, restraining capitalism, swiped at the \u201cobscurantism\u201d of Trump\u2019s America and denounced the National Front for \u201cbetraying fraternity because it detests those faces that don\u2019t resemble it.\u201dMostly, it wasn\u2019t concise or specific, but the crowd had not come for that.But those who braved the cold in Lyon \u2014 doctors, professors, self-described \u201ccompany heads,\u201d civil servants and many young people \u2014 appeared seduced by his high-flown rhetoric.\u201cLiberty, equality, fraternity: I don\u2019t know any other candidate who understands it so well,\u201d said Pierre-Alexandre Le Guerm, a 35-year-old town planner. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of courage, in a world where ideologies are dividing people. With his candidacy, we can have some hope.\u201d\u201cWith him, all the ideas are coming up from the base,\u201d said Monique Janin, 78, who was there with her husband, Raymond, 80, who had worked in the chemical industry. \u201cHe\u2019s just much more dynamic,\u201d she said of Mr. Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s about much more than simply criticizing others.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s got clear ideas, and he\u2019s not a divider,\u201d said Genevi\u00e8ve Kepenekian, 70, a retired doctor. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a realist.

And he goes off the beaten path,\u201d said Thomas Buy, 37, who said he had a string of beauty salons in the Lyon area.\u201cIt was pretty general,\u201d Mr. Buy conceded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait a little longer to see.

{"Headline": "Will We Lose the Doctor Who Would Stop the Next Flint?", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThese days, along with others in the community, I spend my time trying to make sure that the American dream is still a possibility for this city\u2019s kids. We are hoping to reduce the harm stemming from their exposure to lead with a model public health program of family support, home visits, early education, school health services, nutrition, health care access and more.But as a first-generation Iraqi immigrant, and as a doctor whose job is to train other doctors, many of them immigrants themselves, I fear that the American dream is corroding. I worry about the impact of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, for the moment blocked by court order, and how the Republican Congress will handle immigration issues.Of course, everyone in this country, except for Native Americans, came from somewhere else. Many of us were fleeing something, or were brought here by force in America\u2019s original sin. As an immigrant who holds a medical degree, I\u2019m in good company. The organization that accredits graduate medical training programs says that there are more than 10,000 licensed physicians in the United States who graduated from medical school in the seven countries the president listed in his travel ban.What our country stands to lose by walls and bans, in talent, drive, creativity and entrepreneurship, is staggering, but the personal toll is greater. In 1980, my family arrived here full of hope, trading a future of war, fascism and oppression for one of peace, freedom and opportunity. My parents are secular progressives, dissidents who opposed Saddam Hussein\u2019s increasingly murderous and autocratic regime. A future in Iraq might have included imprisonment or death at the hands of the government. It is through these everyday-grateful immigrant eyes that I first saw our country as a 4-year-old and still see it today.As a young immigrant, I may have been scared, and my school lunches looked and smelled different (no one knew what hummus or falafel was back then), but I was embraced in the suburban Detroit community where I grew up as one of the few brown kids.The ban, and other equally ignominious limitations to immigration that may be on their way, ignore the contributions of our immigrants. Perhaps these limitations are an effort to return us to a make-believe \u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d past. Whatever the motivation, my family and millions just like us are intertwined in the fabric of America. My mom taught English to recent immigrants, while my dad worked for General Motors as an engineer for 31 years, designing custom alloys. Together, they instilled in me and my brother an ethic of social justice and service-oriented work while providing us with a better life. The American dream was our reality.Today, people still want to come to America, as it remains the epitome of freedom and prosperity, the richest country that ever was, and blessed by tranquillity. Immigrants know that the laws here shelter diversity, protect rights and property, and provide the opportunity for economic prosperity. America is as great as ever. And as immigrants we understand it is our obligation to continue making it great for all of us, no matter where we came from.I grew up in an America that embraced, supported and celebrated me and my striving for a better life. I grew up confident and competent and keenly aware as an immigrant from a broken country that there is injustice in the world and understanding the need to always fight for justice. Indeed, this is what has guided and framed my work in Flint, where the children I treat woke to a nightmare of usurped democracy, environmental injustice and criminal government neglect.For my Flint kids, the immediate daily struggle continues. Even now, more than a year after the city\u2019s water problems were discovered, people here must rely on filtered and bottled water. We are still seeking the long-term government support to make sure kids here succeed. And while I\u2019m glad I was there to help bring the Flint water crisis to light, I can\u2019t help wondering if, with new limits on immigration, we are losing the next pediatrician who will expose a future public health disaster.The sanctuary our nation provides benefits all of us, but that is not why we do it. It is the right thing to do. It was right yesterday and it is right in this moment, too. The \u201cmother of exiles\u201d has always embraced our children.Today, there is a little brown girl like me, stuck beyond our border but hoping to come to this country. She is scared and tired. But her fresh eyes are wide, she is strong and hopeful, and she dreams our American dream.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Left of Communism", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRed CenturyOxford, England \u2014 \u201cUra! Ura! Ura!\u201d I vividly remember the wall of sound as stern, gray-uniformed soldiers met their commander\u2019s greeting: \u201cCongratulations on the 70th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!\u201dAn exchange student in Moscow in 1987, I had traveled to Gorky Street on that crisp November morning to see the military parade making its way to Red Square. A row of assembled Soviet and foreign dignitaries presided as the young servicemen paid homage at Lenin\u2019s Mausoleum. This impressive-seeming display was to showcase the enduring revolutionary energy of Communism and its global reach.The Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, spoke of a movement reinvigorated by the values of 1917 before an audience of left-wing leaders that included Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress and Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Banners bore the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky\u2019s proclamation \u201cLenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live forever!\u201dThe claim had a hollow ring, for the economic problems of the U.S.S.R. were evident to all, especially my Russian student friends, dependent on poorly provisioned universities for food. Even so, the system still seemed as solid as the mausoleum\u2019s marble. I, like most observers, would not have believed that within two years Communism would be crumbling, and within four, the Soviet Union would itself have collapsed.Soon, popular views of 1917 changed entirely: Unfettered markets seemed natural and inevitable, while Communism appeared to have always been doomed to Leon Trotsky\u2019s \u201cdustbin of history.\u201d There might be challenges to the globalized liberal order, but they would come from Islamism or China\u2019s state capitalism, no longer a discredited Marxism.Today, as we mark the centenary of the February Revolution \u2014 prequel to the November coup of Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks \u2014 history has turned again. China and Russia both deploy symbols of their Communist heritage to strengthen an anti-liberal nationalism; in the West, confidence in free-market capitalism has not recovered from the financial crash of 2008, and new forces of the far right and activist left vie for popularity. In America, the unexpected strength of the independent socialist Bernie Sanders in last year\u2019s Democratic race, and in Spain, the electoral gains of the new Podemos party, led by a former Communist, are signs of some grass-roots resurgence on the left. In 2015 Britain, Marx and Engels\u2019s 1848 classic, \u201cThe Communist Manifesto,\u201d was a best seller.So did I witness Communism\u2019s last hurrah that day in Moscow, or is a Communism remodeled for the 21st century struggling to be born?There are hints of an answer in this complex, century-long epic, a narrative arc full of false starts, near-deaths and unpredicted revivals.Take the life of Semyon Kanatchikov. The son of a former serf, he left rural poverty for a factory job and the thrill of modernity. Energetic and sociable, Kanatchikov set out to improve himself with \u201cThe Self-Teacher of Dance and Good Manners\u201d as his guide. Once in Moscow, he joined a socialist discussion circle, and ultimately the Bolshevik party.Kanatchikov\u2019s experience made him receptive to revolutionary ideas: a keen awareness of the gulf between rich and poor, a sense that an old order was blocking the rise of the new, and a hatred of arbitrary power. Communists offered clear-cut, convincing solutions. Unlike liberals, they championed economic equality; but unlike anarchists, they embraced modern industry and state planning; and against moderate socialists, they argued that change must come through revolutionary class struggle.In practice, these ideals were difficult to combine. An over-powerful state tended to stifle growth while elevating new elites, and the violence of revolution brought with it periodic hunts for \u201cenemies.\u201d Kanatchikov, too, became a victim. Though awarded prestigious appointments after the revolution, his association with Stalin\u2019s archrival, Trotsky, brought about his demotion in 1926.By then, the outlook for Communism was grim. The first flames of revolution in Central Europe in the aftermath of World War I had been extinguished. The U.S.S.R. found itself isolated, and Communist parties elsewhere were small and beleaguered. The American-forged modernity of the Roaring Twenties was unapologetically consumerist, not communist.But the flaws of laissez-faire soon came to Communism\u2019s rescue. The Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Depression that followed made socialist ideas of equality and state planning a compelling alternative to the invisible hand of the market. Communist militancy also emerged as one of the few political forces prepared to resist the threat of fascism.Even the unpromising terrain of the United States, uncongenial to collectivism and godless socialism, became fertile ground. Aided by Moscow\u2019s abandonment in 1935 of its sectarian doctrine for a policy of supporting \u201cpopular fronts,\u201d American Communists made common cause with moderate leftists against fascism. Al Richmond, a New York journalist at The Daily Worker, recalled the new optimism as he and his colleagues spent evenings in an Italian restaurant drinking toasts \u201cto life as it was just then, to that era, to its portents and hopes, sure of our responses to the rhythm of this time, for in it we heard our own beat.\u201dSuch optimism was shared by a select group. A victim of Stalin\u2019s purges, Semyon Kanatchikov died in the gulag in 1940.Many were willing to overlook Stalin\u2019s Terror for the sake of anti-fascist unity. But Communism\u2019s second coming in the late \u201930s and early \u201940s did not long outlast the defeat of fascism. As the Cold War intensified, Communism\u2019s identification with Soviet empire in Eastern Europe compromised its claim to be a liberator. In Western Europe, a reformed, regulated capitalism, encouraged by the United States, provided higher living standards and welfare states. Command economies that made sense in wartime were less suited to peace.But if Communism was waning in the global North, in the South it waxed. There, Communists\u2019 promises of rapid, state-led modernization captured the imagination of many anticolonial nationalists. It was here that a third red wave swelled, breaking in East Asia in the 1940s and across the post-colonial South from the late 1960s.For Geng Changsuo, a Chinese visitor to a model collective farm in Ukraine in 1952 \u2014 three years after Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist guerrillas entered Beijing \u2014 the legacy of 1917 was still potent. A sober peasant leader from Wugong, a village about 120 miles south of Beijing, he was transformed by his trip. Back home, he shaved his beard and mustache, donned Western clothes and evangelized for agricultural collectivization and the miraculous tractor.Revolutionary China only strengthened Washington\u2019s determination to contain Communism. But as America fought its disastrous war in Vietnam, a new generation of Marxist nationalists emerged in the South, attacking the \u201cneo-imperialism\u201d they believed their moderate socialist elders had tolerated. The Cuban-sponsored Tricontinental Conference of African, Latin American and Asian socialists in 1966 introduced a new wave of revolutions; by 1980, Marxist-Leninist states extended from Afghanistan to Angola, South Yemen to Somalia.The West also saw a Marxist revival in the \u201960s, but its student radicals were ultimately more committed to individual autonomy, democracy in everyday life and cosmopolitanism than to Leninist discipline, class struggle and state power. The career of the German student firebrand Joschka Fischer is a striking example. A member of a group named Revolutionary Struggle who tried to inspire a Communist uprising among autoworkers in 1971, he later became a leader of the German Green Party.The emergence from the late \u201970s of an American-led order dominated by global markets, followed by the fall of Soviet Communism in the late \u201980s, caused a crisis for the radical left everywhere. Mr. Fischer, like many other 1960s students, adapted to the new world: As German foreign minister, he supported the 1999 American bombing over Kosovo (against the forces of the former Communist Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic), and he backed Germany\u2019s welfare cuts in 2003.In the South, the International Monetary Fund forced market reforms on indebted post-Communist countries, and some former Communist elites proved eager converts to neoliberalism. Only a handful of nominally Communist states now remain: North Korea and Cuba, and the more capitalist China, Vietnam and Laos.Today, more than a quarter-century after the collapse of the U.S.S.R., is a fourth incarnation of Communism possible?One major obstacle is the post-\u201960s split between an old left that prioritizes economic equality and the heirs of Mr. Fischer, who stress cosmopolitan values, gender politics and multiculturalism. Moreover, championing the interests of the underprivileged on a global scale seems an almost impossible task. The 2008 crash only intensified the left\u2019s dilemma, creating an opportunity for radical nationalists like Donald J. Trump and Marine Le Pen to exploit anger at economic inequality in the global North.We are only at the beginning of a period of major economic change and social turmoil. As a highly unequal tech-capitalism fails to provide enough decently paid jobs, the young may adopt a more radical economic agenda. A new left might then succeed in uniting the losers, both white-collar and blue-collar, in the new economic order. Already, we\u2019re seeing demands for a more redistributive state. Ideas like the universal basic income, which the Netherlands and Finland are experimenting with, are close in spirit to Marx\u2019s vision of Communism\u2019s ability to supply the wants of all \u2014 \u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\u201dThis is all a long way from Moscow\u2019s Red Square in 1987, even farther from Petrograd\u2019s Winter Palace in 1917. There will be no return to the Communism of five-year plans and gulags. Yet if there is one thing this turbulent history teaches us, it is that \u201clast hurrahs\u201d can be as illusory as the \u201cend of ideology\u201d predicted in the 1950s or Francis Fukuyama\u2019s \u201cend of history\u201d of 1989.Lenin no longer lives, the old Communism may be dead, but the sense of injustice that animated them is very much alive.A picture supplied by Getty Images was initially posted with this essay. Editors later learned that the photograph, of Lenin giving a speech, had been manipulated by the Soviet authorities to erase several figures near Lenin, notably Leon Trotsky. The picture has been replaced because such unacknowledged alterations violate Times standards.David Priestland, a professor of modern history at Oxford University, is the author of \u201cThe Red Flag: A History of Communism.\u201dThis is the first in a series of essays about the legacy and history of Communism, 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}

Several activists said that they did not know how the campaign began or how many people would heed it, and that as far as they knew, there was no national organization behind it.His daughter, Laela Shallal, who manages finance and marketing for the company, said employees could choose between using some of their paid leave on Thursday, or going to work to clean or organize the restaurants and offices.\u201cWe think that this is really something that a lot of our staff feels really passionate about,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking their side, so that they feel the company they work for is living up to their values.\u201dAmaya Sales, a kitchen manager at the Busboys and Poets restaurant in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington, said workers first approached management early this week about taking part. \u201cIt\u2019s just to, like, show most of America how much important we are to do the hard work in the United States,\u201d Mr. Sales said.In a city with more than 2,000 restaurants, the day of closures and absences may not be enough to prevent anyone from getting a table. But given the upscale, popular businesses involved, it will be noticed.An immigrant advocacy group, Cosecha (the Spanish word for harvest), has been planning a day without immigrants on May 1. Maria Fernanda Cabello, a Cosecha organizer, said it was not behind Thursday\u2019s campaign, but viewed it as something of a dry run, and was working with some local groups that were promoting it.\u201cWe don\u2019t know where this started, and as far as we know, there isn\u2019t anyone putting it all together,\u201d Ms. Cabello said. \u201cWe started seeing messages about it in different cities a few weeks ago, and it\u2019s really picked up in the last couple of days.\u201dOwners of some smaller businesses said that they supported the idea but that the campaign was too hastily organized to justify closing. Josh Phillips, a co-owner of Espita Mezcaleria in Washington, said that rather than close, he wanted to donate a portion of his restaurant\u2019s proceeds on Thursday to the organizers of the campaign. But, he said, \u201cwe still don\u2019t know who\u2019s organizing it.\u201dEach dinner receipt, Mr. Phillips said, will be inscribed with the phrase, \u201cThis meal was made possible by immigrants.\u201dIvan Iricanin, who owns Ambar, a Balkan restaurant with locations in Washington and Arlington, Va., said that after meeting with his staff on Monday, he decided to keep the restaurants open. But, he said, about seven of his 100 employees chose not to work on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a lot of questions that were unanswered,\u201d Mr. Iricanin, 39, said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I think that some people are all for it and some are in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The news caused Deutsche Bank shares to plunge, and led to speculation the bank might collapse.\u201cI hope to never go through something like that again,\u201d he said.

But he did say that Deutsche Bank was proud to have employees of many nationalities and religions. \u201cWe are absolutely committed to equality, inclusion and freedom of movement,\u201d he said.In the short term, Mr. Cryan said, the turmoil that Mr. Trump created had been good for Deutsche Bank, prompting more intense trading on financial markets, generating commissions. \u201cWe have been very pleased\u201d with trading income during January, Mr. Cryan said.An earlier version of this article presented Deutsche Bank\u2019s 2015 fourth-quarter loss in the wrong currency.

{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s Trump-Like Immigration Order Rattles South America", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe measures announced by Mr. Macri in recent days made it much easier to deport immigrants and restrict their entry, prompting irate comparisons to President Trump and igniting a fierce debate over immigration.\u201cA decree like this scares people,\u201d said Arfang Diedhiou, 33, a Senegalese immigrant who runs his own clothing store here in the capital, Buenos Aires. \u201cIt came out just after what Trump did, a coincidence that seems very strange to me.\u201dArgentina\u2019s president, the son of an immigrant, has echoed some of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d theme, making it clear that his \u201cfirst concern\u201d should be \u201ccaring for Argentines, caring for ourselves.\u201d\u201cWe cannot continue to allow criminals to keep choosing Argentina as a place to commit offenses,\u201d Mr. Macri said during a news conference.Mr. Macri\u2019s immigration measures, while not as far-reaching as Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to halt refugees from around the world and freeze visas from seven predominantly Muslim nations, are raising diplomatic tensions in the region. Some South American leaders are attacking what they view as an attempt to mimic Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies and nurture xenophobic sentiment.\u201cBrothers, Latin American presidents, we can\u2019t follow the immigration policies of the North,\u201d President Evo Morales of Bolivia said.Claudio Su\u00e1rez, 65, a worker at a bakery in Buenos Aires, called the immigration curbs \u201cfantastic.\u201d\u201cNobody wants scum to come in from other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cMany foreigners come here because health services and education are free. The law should be even stronger.\u201dArgentina\u2019s history has been written by waves of immigration over the decades. After 19th-century wars of conquest killed off many indigenous people, the authorities encouraged millions of immigrants to come, largely from Europe, to help populate and develop the country.More recently, governments welcomed newcomers from Latin America, Asia and Africa, opening a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants and ensuring their access to public schools and health care.Officials in Mr. Macri\u2019s government, which took over in 2015 by vowing to ease polarization and roll back the economic policies of his leftist predecessor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, contend that they are still upholding Argentina\u2019s openness to immigrants.\u201cEveryone should remain calm, because Argentina will continue to be a hospitable and open country,\u201d said Horacio Garc\u00eda, Argentina\u2019s top immigration official.The new immigration decree says it is focused on fighting crime, arguing that 22 percent of inmates in the federal penitentiary system are foreigners. (When all of the country\u2019s prisons are taken into account the figure is closer to 6 percent.)The decree specifically mentions \u201corganized crime\u201d as a reason for the crackdown, but it expands the offenses that justify expulsion or blocked entry to include any crime that could lead to a prison sentence. Many worry that immigrants can now be expelled for minor crimes, like blocking a road during a protest.Immigrants hoping to fight a deportation order will have less than a week to file appeals. Previous measures granted 30 days to prepare a defense and the right to a government lawyer.\u201cImmigrants are hanging by a thread because anything could be cause for deportation,\u201d said Gabriela Liguori, director of the Argentina Commission for Refugees and Migrants, an immigrant rights group.But the immigration official, Mr. Garc\u00eda, said deportations \u201cwill only focus on serious crimes.\u201d He contended that the measure was necessary because Argentina had become \u201cdefenseless to criminals from other countries.\u201dFaced with criticism, officials in Mr. Macri\u2019s government have had to make it clear that they are ruling out building a Trump-like wall on the Bolivian border.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t immigration, but drug trafficking and contraband,\u201d Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said after the Bolivian authorities questioned why she was publicly singling out Bolivian, Paraguayan and Peruvian immigrants for scrutiny.Despite Mr. Macri\u2019s longstanding connection to the American president, Mr. Trump\u2019s victory put the government here in an awkward spot. After all, Mr. Macri had made no secret that he was rooting for Hillary Clinton, saying that Mr. Trump was focused on building walls.But then Mr. Macri seemed to draw on his ties to Mr. Trump, becoming one of the first Latin American leaders to speak with him after the American presidential election.The call was quickly mired in controversy. A prominent Argentine journalist claimed that Mr. Trump had used the occasion to request Mr. Macri\u2019s help in obtaining regulatory approval for a real estate project in Buenos Aires. Spokesmen for both leaders denied the assertion, though it emerged that Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who had no security clearance, had joined the phone call.Argentine authorities later confirmed that the Trump venture did not have the permits needed to begin construction. But in the end, plans for a Trump tower in Buenos Aires were called off as Mr. Trump came under pressure over potential conflicts of interest involving pending international deals.Critics say the new restrictions focus on poor immigrants to distract attention from the economy, which remains sluggish more than a year after Mr. Macri rose to power promising that market-friendly policies would usher in growth.Scrutinizing immigrants at times of stress is nothing new in Argentina, with the authorities long praising the country\u2019s history of receiving European immigrants while portraying immigration from neighboring countries as less desirable, said Guillermo Cantor, a sociologist who specializes in immigration.In the late 1990s, President Carlos Menem\u2019s government similarly cracked down on immigrants by associating them with street crime. In 2014, Mrs. Kirchner, the former president, threatened to expel foreigners who committed crimes in an overhaul of the penal code even after her government had legalized the irregular status of many immigrants.Other parts of Latin America are also grappling with bursts of anti-immigration sentiment. With his nation suffering broad economic declines, Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, ordered a crackdown on Colombian immigrants in 2015, forcing many to flee across the border. An influx of Haitian immigrants to Chile is fueling a debate there over racism and discrimination.On the streets of Buenos Aires, immigrants had varying reactions to Mr. Macri\u2019s decree. Jes\u00fas Oriona, 45, a Bolivian who moved to Argentina as a teenager, said the government was simply \u201cthrowing the blame at immigrants.\u201dBut Maria Alejandra Alviarez, 39, a nurse from Venezuela who moved here a year ago and works in a health food store, said Argentina had been \u201ctoo free and open\u201d before the decree.\u201cMacri\u2019s not saying people can\u2019t migrate, and qualified people like me will still be able to come here,\u201d she said.Still others here contend that the shift is strategic, seeking short-term political points by blaming foreigners for ills in Argentine society ahead of legislative elections this year.An article on Feb. 5 about a decree curbing immigration to Argentina misspelled the surname of a sociologist who said the scrutinizing of immigrants at times of stress was nothing new in Argentina. He is Guillermo Cantor, not Kantor.Frederick Bernas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Democrats Falling Into Trump\u2019s Trap?", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn one of many recent forums for the politicians vying to lead the Democratic National Committee \u2014 and, ideally, the party \u2014 out of the wilderness and into better times, the candidates were asked to distill the importance of fighting Donald Trump to 10 words or less.I heard clich\u00e9s: \u201cPower to the people.\u201d I heard fancy words: \u201cAnathema.\u201dI heard answers over 15 and 20 and even 25 words.Only one of the seven candidates onstage at this particular event \u2014 which took place in Washington just two days before Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 came in under the limit, with a reply that was more upbeat than downbeat and more assertive than reactive.\u201cFreedom, fairness, families, future,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., using four words. \u201cI got six left?\u201dHave Democrats learned and implemented all the right lessons from Trump\u2019s victory and from the party\u2019s brutal fade during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency? As the race for the D.N.C. chairmanship lurches toward its conclusion later this month and as Democratic lawmakers sweat the smartest strategy against Trump, I wonder. I worry.But the bad news \u2014 or, rather, the danger \u2014 is that this doesn\u2019t automatically translate into successful opposition. It\u2019s no guarantee that Trump will be contained and, after four years at most, forced to live out the balance of his fuming, fibbing days in the lavishly marbled cloisters of Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago.Yelling has an impact, but it takes you only so far if you don\u2019t choose your battles, marshal your fiercest energy for ones that can yield concrete results, and buckle down to the nitty-gritty of electing legislators who can actually vote against Trump\u2019s worst initiatives in numbers that exceed those of his abettors.Practicality is crucial. Proportionality, too. When you treat every last tweet of Trump\u2019s as if it\u2019s the botched operation in Yemen, voters lose sight of the botched operation in Yemen.Trump provokes ire by the minute, but the response needs to be fashioned by the day or even week, lest everything blur. Resistance is a dish best served with discernment. Too much salt and you can\u2019t taste the food itself.That\u2019s the trap with Trump, and Democrats fell into it during the presidential election, either not realizing how thoroughly he became the reference point for every conversation or not figuring out a way to mitigate that. Opposition to him crowded out support for anything else. Every negative moment came at the expense of a positive one.\u201cThe Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton pretty much communicated what was bad about Trump but failed to communicate what was great about Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party,\u201d said Sally Boynton Brown, the executive director of the Democratic Party in Idaho. She, too, is running for the top job at the D.N.C., and we spoke in late January in Houston, the site of another of the candidate forums.I also caught up there with former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, one of her rivals for the post. \u201cWhat voters heard from Clinton,\u201d he told me, \u201cwas not \u2018I feel your pain\u2019 but \u2018Vote for me because he\u2019s crazy,\u2019 and that\u2019s not a message.\u201dBy the time of the Houston event, the field of contenders for the D.N.C. chairmanship was up to 10. I sat down with more than half of them, and noticed a contradiction between their rightful worry about focusing too much on Trump and their continued focus on \u2026 Trump.And they\u2019re constantly swerving from vision to process: It\u2019s a tic they can\u2019t control. In Houston I was told that the party needed a more transparent presidential nominating system. And better voter-registration drives. And increased coordination between the D.N.C., the D.C.C.C. and the D.S.C.C. I supped on an alphabet soup.\u201cWe didn\u2019t make house calls,\u201d said Perez.\u201cWe abandoned the 50-state strategy,\u201d said Keith Ellison, a Minnesota congressman also running for the chairmanship.All of that\u2019s true. But none of it gets at larger challenges that were much less frequently mentioned, if at all: the necessity of grooming and rallying behind candidates who can forge an emotional connection with voters and are in sync with the moment; the imperative of studying the map, identifying every Senate and House seat that could possibly swing to Democrats in 2018 and playing a ruthlessly pragmatic game of chess; the articulation of a down-to-earth, visceral message that resonates with as many voters as possible. \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d didn\u2019t cut it.Another of the D.N.C. candidates, Raymond Buckley, the chairman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire, acknowledged to me, \u201cSometimes we try to impress ourselves too much by talking about issues that are overly complex when the populace really wants you to boil it down to a much more simplistic message.\u201dWhat might that message be? \u201cHope and opportunity,\u201d he said. That\u2019s Obama\u2019s old mantra, with \u201cchange\u201d swapped out for a word with more syllables.Three weeks after the election, I happened to attend a meeting of Democratic up-and-comers from around the country in Washington. Hoyer addressed them, using his remarks to wander through a dense fog of economic statistics that, he said, proved the superiority of Democrats in managing the American economy. It was the antithesis of a Trump speech, and even his audience of political nerds fidgeted.\u201cThat\u2019s an operational failure rather than a message failure or a candidate failure,\u201d said Jaime Harrison, the chairman of South Carolina\u2019s Democratic Party and another contender to lead the D.N.C.But it\u2019s all of the above, because someone as preposterous as Trump should have been too far behind to benefit from tiny margins and lucky breaks. And operational failures alone can\u2019t explain the Democratic disadvantages in the Senate, House, governor\u2019s offices and statehouses.This is no moment for mere tinkering, and the party can\u2019t afford the internal divisions on display in the D.N.C. race. After Joe Biden endorsed Perez last week, Bernie Sanders, who supports Ellison, shot back, \u201cDo we stay with a failed status quo approach or do we go forward with a fundamental restructuring?\u201dYou don\u2019t wage 2016 all over again. That\u2019s what brought us 2017, a year that \u2014 so far \u2014 I don\u2019t care to repeat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Today\u2019s Senator John Kennedy Is From Louisiana", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Kennedy sat down with The New York Times last month to talk about what his victory, and Mr. Trump\u2019s, says about a disillusioned middle class. The interview has been condensed.Q. Why did you decide you wanted to be in the Senate?A. I like policy. It\u2019s why I decided to enter government. The other thing I like about government \u2014 you have good days, you have bad days, but you never have a boring day, and that\u2019s important to me. I don\u2019t like to be bored. Not every week, not every month, but every now and then, you hit at a lick and you budge the ship of state, hopefully, in a better direction, and you feel good about that.The Senate respects the individual and the minority. It\u2019s a deliberative body. It\u2019s that way on purpose, and everybody counts. I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t in the House, but in the House, majority rules. In the Senate, minority can rule.Q. Why do you think you stood out in such a crowded primary?A. I looked the people of Louisiana in the eye and told them exactly what I thought in terms that normal people use. I did a commercial about Obamacare, and I started the commercial by saying, \u201cI mean no disrespect, but Obamacare sucks.\u201d And I believe that.There are a lot of Americans who are being left out of America, economically, socially, culturally. I think the root of some of the anger in Louisiana, in America, is that people look around and they see too many undeserving \u2014 I want to emphasize undeserving, because I don\u2019t want to paint with too broad a brush. But folks look around and see too many undeserving people at the top, with connections, getting bailouts; too many undeserving \u2014 not all, but some undeserving people at the bottom, getting handouts. And the rest of us in the middle get the bill.And the people in the middle can\u2019t pay those bills anymore. Their health insurance has gone up. Their kids\u2019 tuition has gone up. Their taxes have gone up. I tell you what hasn\u2019t gone up: their income. Median household income in America has improved in the last few years, but still not where it was in 2002, and they feel like they\u2019re being left behind. They feel like their children are going to be the first generation in America who won\u2019t be better off than their parents, and they know this because many of their children have moved back in with them.There\u2019s this feeling among many in America that it\u2019s harder than ever to get ahead in our country, that it\u2019s easier than ever to do nothing. There\u2019s a feeling that the people in Washington don\u2019t listen and they don\u2019t care.There were two groups of people who were passionate about their candidate in this past election: Trump supporters and [Senator Bernie] Sanders supporters. Now, Sanders supporters were concerned about the undeserving people at the top \u2014 well, generally speaking; I\u2019m not saying that they weren\u2019t concerned about undeserving people at the bottom, but they were more focused on the undeserving people at the top. Many of the Trump supporters were focused on the undeserving people at the bottom, but they\u2019re different sides of the same coin.And I don\u2019t think the American people, the middle class, are meanspirited about it. Look, the American people are the most compassionate people in the world. When you look at how much we spend on social programs in our country, it separates us from a lot of countries. In our country, if you\u2019re hungry, we\u2019ll feed you. If you\u2019re homeless, we\u2019ll house you. If you\u2019re too poor to be sick, we\u2019ll pay for your doctor. But all of that comes at a cost.Q. Why did Mr. Trump win your state by almost 20 points?A. He talked straight-up to the people. He didn\u2019t begin his sentences with, \u201cLet me say this about that.\u201d He talked to them.Q. Do you think there is a message there for Congress?A. Both sides have lost touch. And for the past eight years \u2014 maybe this is unfair, but this is the way many of the people in Louisiana looked at it; perception is reality in politics and in life sometimes \u2014 they would look at Congress and their attitude. My attitude was, you know, we\u2019ve got many good members of Congress. I just can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019ve been good for, for the last eight years. What have they done? Our middle class is failing. I can go through our domestic problems. Internationally, our friends don\u2019t trust us anymore. Our enemies don\u2019t respect us. I mean, what\u2019s working?Now, that\u2019s an overstatement. This is an extraordinary country. We\u2019re still the most powerful country in the history of the world and the wealthiest. But the economy, society, our culture is not working for a lot of people, and they\u2019re angry, and there\u2019s a fine line between fear and anger. They\u2019re scared first, and that fear bleeds into anger. And they want something done about it. They\u2019re entitled to be listened to and heard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Israeli Desert City Blooms as a Soccer Power", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEERSHEBA, Israel \u2014 As night began to fall and Shabbat came to an end, the lights of Turner Stadium crackled to life and Beersheba awoke.Unlike the bustling cities of Tel Aviv and, to a lesser extent, Jerusalem, this southern city of 220,000 people on the edge of the Negev is transformed into a ghost town by the Jewish holy day. The narrow streets and courtyards are empty and silent, even though Beersheba is a mixed city, with large Arab and Bedouin populations living alongside its Jews.Beersheba is different in other ways, too; it has traditionally been seen as a poor and underinvested city, a hot and sleepy place on the periphery of Israel. But in the past few years, especially when Turner Stadium\u2019s floodlights are switched on and the city stirs back into life, that has changed.Now, before every home game of Hapoel Beer Sheva, dozens of buses from the suburbs, villages and towns of the nearby Negev deliver thousands of fans. Men and women, young and old, dressed in red and chanting songs as they arrive, they have come to watch the only game in town: Israel\u2019s reigning soccer champion.\u201cThere is no similar team in Israel,\u201d said Ido Ellenbogen, a 26-year-old bar owner, as he headed to the stadium with his father to watch a recent league match against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv. \u201cThe city\u2019s mood is influenced by the team. If the team wins, the city is happy. If the team loses, everybody on Sunday is depressed. This team is part of the roots of the city.\u201dThe roots run deep in Beersheba, a biblical city that many believe is older than Jerusalem. The club was formed in 1949, one year after Israel declared independence. Much of its history had been cloaked in failure, aside from back-to-back league championships in 1975 and 1976, at a time when the game was amateur and the players, Ellenbogen said, \u201cworked in construction and smoked.\u201d\u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t realize what the team just did until the last whistle,\u201d said Aner Haim, a reporter for the local newspaper, Yediot HaNegev. \u201cPeople here cried like little babies. It was crazy, crazy, crazy.\u201dYet no one is mistaken about who is responsible for the rejuvenation of the club and, at least in part, the city. The club was transformed after being bought about 10 years ago by Alona Barkat, the wife of a wealthy Israeli tech entrepreneur. She is the only woman to own a professional soccer team in Israel and, depending on whom you speak to in Beersheba, Barkat is \u201cThe Queen,\u201d \u201cThe Messiah\u201d or \u201cThe Princess of the Desert.\u201d\u201cIt is a big love story,\u201d Haim said. \u201cEverybody loves Alona.\u201dBarkat\u2019s office can be found not in Beersheba but in the center of Tel Aviv, 60 miles north. Barkat, 47, grew up in the coastal city of Ashkelon before moving to Silicon Valley in California with her husband. Later they returned to Israel, looking for a social project to invest in.\u201cI was one time in my life in Beersheba, even though I live in the south,\u201d she said, explaining how in the past even she had bypassed the city, isolated as it is in the desert between Gaza, to the west, and the West Bank. She was introduced to the soccer club she would come to own by a friend, who explained how investing in the team would have ramifications far outside the game.In many ways, the city and its team have risen together. Tech companies have moved in. The university has expanded, bringing young people in growing numbers. The economy is quietly booming. For all those reasons, Beersheba is now Israel\u2019s fastest-growing city.Half of the city\u2019s population \u2014 100,000 people \u2014 celebrated in the streets after Hapoel Beer Sheva clinched the title last season. \u201cI\u2019ve got goose bumps right now just remembering it,\u201d Ellenbogen said.That result has led to other great nights, including a victory against the Greek side Olympiakos and another against the Scottish champion Celtic in the Champions League qualifiers. While Hapoel Beer Sheva missed out on a place in the group stage by a single goal, it has thrived after dropping into the second-tier Europa League, beating Italy\u2019s Inter Milan home and away and earning a tie against the Premier League club Southampton.On Thursday, Beer Sheva will host Besiktas of Turkey in a first-leg match in the Europa League\u2019s Round of 32. A high-risk return leg in Istanbul a week later promises to be fraught with security issues, but for now people here are reveling in the high-water mark in the desert city\u2019s soccer history.It has not come without its challenges. Although she always loved soccer, Barkat found owning a team could be tough. The city\u2019s remote location and poor reputation made it hard to attract players. Barkat had to pay \u201cdouble the salary\u201d for even average talent, she said. But she fell in love with the city.\u201cIt\u2019s Israeli society,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has Muslim, Jews, secular, religious, so it is a mix. What is unique is that people are accepting it.\u201dThe journey to the title did not follow a straight line; at one point, Hapoel Beer Sheva was relegated and its supporters became restless. So much so that in 2010 one of the club\u2019s coaches reported that he had been intimidated while leaving in his car after a match. Furious about the incident, Barkat called a news conference at which she threatened to walk away.\u201cHe felt threatened,\u201d she says now. \u201cThis was crossing a red line and I couldn\u2019t accept that.\u201dThe prospect of the departure of their benefactor was enough to quiet the fans\u2019 anger, and the supporters soon were loudly backing the team again, she said.The tipping point on the field came when the club persuaded the veteran Israeli national team player Elyaniv Barda to rejoin the team. Barda, 35, was born in Beersheba and started his career there before becoming a regular for the Belgian club Racing Genk. His arrival and the hiring of a 37-year-old coach, Barak Bakhar, in 2015, were the missing pieces. By the final game of Bakhar\u2019s first season in charge, he had brought Hapoel Beer Sheva to the brink of its first title in four decades.\u201cWe knew there was a lot of responsibility on our shoulders,\u201d Barkat recalled of the excruciating tension of watching the season\u2019s deciding match. \u201cAnd we felt we really wanted to give them this gift. We are part of everything that happens here.\u201dAs it is for every match, Turner Stadium was at full capacity when Hapoel Beer Sheva kicked off against Bnei Yehuda on Jan. 14. The home team quickly went down by a goal. But the South Stand, where the team\u2019s noisy ultras sit, simply sang louder. The team roared back, scoring twice and winning, 2-1.\u201cI was here about eight years ago \u2014 we were in the second division, we played in a very bad stadium,\u201d said midfielder Maor Melikson, who scored the tying goal. \u201cBut the last few years? Incredible.\u201dNow the team is focused on the chase for a second title, and its continuing campaign in Europe. First up are the two matches against Besiktas.Having traveled with Israel\u2019s national team, Melikson is used to playing in hostile environments. He was part of the Maccabi Haifa team that had to play a 2006 Champions League playoff match against Liverpool in Kiev, Ukraine, after a rocket hit Haifa\u2019s stadium during the Second Lebanon War. Later, after his move to Hapoel Beer Sheva, Israel launched a military operation in nearby Gaza, forcing a match to be moved to Cyprus, since Beersheba was then under fire.\u201cWe are used to the situation,\u201d he said dryly.The club has urged fans to seek advice from Israel\u2019s foreign ministry before traveling to the second leg in Istanbul, regardless of what is at stake. Last year, a suicide bombing in Istanbul targeted a Jewish tour group, and Israel\u2019s National Security Council urged all Israelis to leave Turkey immediately. In December, dozens of people were killed when a bomb exploded outside Besiktas\u2019s stadium after a league game.Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the prime minister\u2019s office declined to comment about the security situation, but Barkat said the team was taking its own precautions. For now, the home leg is the primary concern.After the victory against Bnei Yehuda, the crowds melted away. Ellenbogen prepared to return to his bar. Europa League success remains a dream for Beer Sheva fans, and a second title in a row is a real possibility, but at this point no one is taking either for granted.\u201cMy father\u2019s been a supporter for 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe always said to me: \u2018Let\u2019s just be happy as long as it is happening. Let\u2019s appreciate what is happening right now.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Energy Efficiency Could Offset Indian Point Shutdown, Report Says", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York could do without the power generated by the Indian Point nuclear plant, but making up for the loss of all that cheap electricity would be much easier if state officials changed their energy-efficiency policies.Mr. Cuomo and environmental groups \u2014 including the two that issued the report, Riverkeeper and the Natural Resources Defense Council \u2014 have railed against Indian Point for years, arguing that it posed a significant hazard in such a populous area. But supporters of the plant questioned how the state would replace the low-cost, carbon-free power produced there.Indian Point\u2019s two working reactors can produce about 16 million megawatt-hours of electricity per year, or about one-fourth of the amount consumed in New York City and Westchester County. A proposed transmission line could carry enough hydroelectric power to the city from Canada to make up for about half of Indian Point\u2019s output. The rest of the shortfall would have to come from other sources \u2014 gas-fired plants, solar panels or windmills \u2014 or by reducing demand.The report determined that the new sources would not be necessary if the state more aggressively pursued efficient use of electricity. It cited Massachusetts and Rhode Island as examples that New York\u2019s regulators could follow to drive down consumption.Those two states have been shaving about 3 percent off their electricity use annually by providing incentives for shifting to more efficient lighting, appliances and heating and cooling systems, according to the report, which was produced by Synapse Energy Economics in Cambridge, Mass. That is about three times the pace at which New York has been improving its efficiency.\u201cNew York can do even more\u201d in pressing for energy efficiency, said Paul Gallay, the president of Riverkeeper. By doing so, state officials could \u201celiminate any need whatsoever for nonrenewable energy to replace Indian Point.\u201dThe report did not include an estimate of how the planned shutdown of Indian Point would affect the monthly bills of customers of Consolidated Edison or other utilities that serve the state. But it concluded that the wholesale cost of supplying electricity in the state would rise by 0.2 percent to 2.1 percent, depending on how the gap is closed.\u201cThis independent analysis confirms that Indian Point\u2019s power can be adequately replaced by resources that are already in service or permitted and more that will come online,\u201d the New York State Department of Public Service said in a statement.The department said the state was \u201caggressively prioritizing energy efficiency by investing more than half of the state\u2019s $5.3 billion Clean Energy Fund on efficiency programs\u201d and by requiring utilities to develop their own efficiency initiatives.National Grid and other utilities serving New England \u201chave gotten very creative\u201d in finding ways to improve energy efficiency, said Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s no single silver bullet, but lots of silver BBs that add up to this savings.\u201dMr. Nadel said that, in 2015, the savings amounted to 2.9 percent of annual electricity sales in Rhode Island and 2.7 percent in Massachusetts, but just over 1 percent in New York. Rhode Island and Massachusetts tied Vermont at the top of the council\u2019s scorecard for electricity program savings; New York was tied for 14th with Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Oregon.Mr. Nadel said he was confident that New York could triple the amount of efficiency it has wrung from the system if it emphasized some of these measures, rather than relying on sources of renewable energy. \u201cIt\u2019s not as sexy, but energy efficiency is lower cost,\u201d Mr. Nadel said.Advertisement"}

He told members of Parliament that he wanted to sell Japan\u2019s bullet train technology in the United States so that states could build high-speed rail links and create jobs doing so.After Mr. Trump attacked Toyota on Twitter, the automaker announced that it would invest an additional $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, although it was not clear if that had already been planned.Other companies, including Sharp and Fuji Heavy Industries, have also recently talked publicly about existing plans to expand or build new factories in the United States, while Nisshinbo Holdings, an environmental and energy conglomerate that makes auto parts, said it would abandon a plan to build a car parts factory in Mexico.Mr. Abe has said that Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms about the yen are \u201cundeserved.\u201d It is true that the value of the yen has fallen steadily as Japan\u2019s central bank has injected cash into the economy, a policy that Mr. Abe will most likely try to explain to the president.Maybe. There are signs that Japan might be willing to pay or do more, but many experts contend that American troops are defending not only Japan but also America\u2019s own interests in Asia.The Pentagon is budgeted to spend about $5.5 billion to support troops and bases on Okinawa and elsewhere around Japan this year. Japan is set to spend $1.8 billion to support the bases, in addition to at least $4 billion on related expenses, including compensation for the communities that host the bases and money for relocating American troops.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Is Free in Hong Kong. Running a Food Truck Isn\u2019t (See Annex C).", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong JournalSo the story goes.Many people who live in Hong Kong beg to differ. This has long been a city of tycoons, with a few families holding sway over the supermarkets, drugstores and real estate market, limiting competition and keeping prices high. And in the past few weeks, four words have further shaken the story line that this former British colony is a free-market nirvana.Food Truck Pilot Scheme.Something had to be done to close the yawning food truck gap.Enter the Hong Kong government, keen to draw in more tourists.After more than a year of preparation, and even cook-offs to pick the lucky few, the food trucks are finally here. Eight for a city of 7.2 million. There are plans for eight more.The trucks are sights to behold. Gleaming and new, they are brightly and imaginatively painted, with names like Ma Ma\u2019s Dumplings and Mein by Maureen. One is emblazoned with a panda that bears a striking resemblance to Po of \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d fame.And the food \u2014 in the opinion of this hearty eater \u2014 is fabulous. The Shanghai barbecue pork bun from the Book Brothers truck melts in your mouth. The \u201cfive colored dumplings\u201d at Ma Ma\u2019s are delicious \u2014 an authentic taste of northern China.Just one ingredient seems to be missing: customers.In Hong Kong, the government agency that devised the Food Truck Pilot Scheme had a new, bold and innovative idea: stationary food trucks that don\u2019t park on the street. A spokesman for the city\u2019s Tourism Commission explained why in an email:\u201cSince the urban area of Hong Kong is already saturated with traffic, it would not be desirable from the traffic management and road safety angles to allow food trucks to park and operate on public roads. Moreover, as many locations in Hong Kong have already got a number of food establishments, it would thus be desirable to introduce food trucks away from those areas.\u201dAll these rules and regulations have Liu Chun-ho, the owner of Ma Ma\u2019s Dumpling, very worried. To meet the stringent requirements, he paid about one million Hong Kong dollars ($129,000) for his new Isuzu truck.Mr. Liu illustrates his challenge in units of dumplings. He needs to sell 200 bowls a day, at 40 Hong Kong dollars each, just to cover his fixed costs, he said. He is barely making that now, and fears business will plummet once summer comes with the monsoon rains and pounding semitropical sun that will keep customers away from the treeless, concrete square.\u201cThe government needs to loosen up,\u201d said Mr. Liu, 43. He has been to Thailand and Japan, and in those places, \u201cyou can set up shop anywhere, on the roads, on the streets,\u201d he said.To get there, pedestrians must take a zigzag of narrow paths through a giant construction project. The square, whose main attraction is a golden statue of a bauhinia flower, an emblem of the city, is also frequented by buses filled with tourists from mainland China.There, on a weekday afternoon, four employees of Book Brothers waited for customers to buy their delicious barbecue pork sandwiches, which come with a Hong Kong flag planted in the bun. Over a 15-minute stretch, they had one sale.One woman from mainland China balked at the price, 38 Hong Kong dollars ($4.90), for the small sandwich, saying she thought that was the price for three. That\u2019s a problem, said Chen Qiuling, one of the workers, who said two-thirds of their customers were from China.The workers at Book Brothers hope that their next location, closer to the city\u2019s central business district, will be busier. And if they can\u2019t sell their pork buns, they could always try something else, right? After all, that\u2019s what capitalism is all about.\u201cNo alteration of the signature dish proposed by the applicant in the application form will be allowed after the submission of Application and throughout the Scheme,\u201d it declares. \u201cIf the operator wishes to change dishes other than the signature dish, he should obtain prior written approval from the Venues and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "France\u2019s Obsession With Decline Is a Booming Industry", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Michel Onfray, a best-selling French pop philosopher, was sounding pretty upbeat on the phone, even though the title of his latest book is \u201cDecadence: The Life and Death of the Judeo-Christian Tradition.\u201dHis book had just come out, with an impressive press run of 120,000 copies, and was selling briskly in spite of \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 its gloomy prognostication. \u201cIf you think today about terrorism, the rise of populism, it was important to put that in perspective,\u201d Mr. Onfray said recently. His research, he added, \u201cshows a civilization that had been strong, that had ceased to be so and that\u2019s heading toward its end.\u201dFrance\u2019s preoccupation with decline has been dated by some scholars to the counter-Enlightenment of the early 19th century, and to the late 1970s and the end of three decades of postwar economic growth by others. Today, different \u201cdeclinist\u201d strains have merged, from Catholic reactionaries to nonreligious thinkers preoccupied by questions of national identity and political corruption.With France\u2019s presidential elections looming in April, these often abstract ideas are taking more concrete form as the hard-right National Front and the center-right Republican Party capitalize on sentiments of decline exacerbated by economic malaise and terrorist attacks.Mr. Onfray\u2019s \u201cDecadence\u201d begins with early Christian history, traverses the French Revolution, then sweeps in the Holocaust, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which Mr. Onfray says prefigured the 2015 attacks at the French satirical journal Charlie Hebdo. Though he looks beyond France in his diagnosis, his homeland is central for much of its nearly 600 pages.Mr. Baverez, a lawyer and economist whose \u201cChronicles of French Decline\u201d came out this week and whose \u201cFrance in Free Fall\u201d was a hit in 2003, said he didn\u2019t believe in the idea of declinism.Even in a country like France, where pleasure is held sacred, decline does seem to be better business than optimism.\u201cTo put it in Manichaean terms: Anything positive doesn\u2019t sell, and anything negative sells, as if there were a sort of masochism on the part of some readers,\u201d said the historian Robert Frank, the author of the 2014 book \u201cThe Fear of Decline: France from 1914 to 2014.\u201dThe right-wing magazine Valeurs Actuelles, which publishes frequent warnings about the decline of France and the threat of Islamic terrorism, saw its combined print and digital circulation rise to 119,000 copies last year from 86,000 in 2011, according to figures provided by the magazine.The decline boom seems to manifest itself in books and intellectual debate more than in popular culture, although some French television shows have waded into the murky waters. Recent seasons of \u201cEngrenages,\u201d or \u201cSpiral,\u201d a dark police drama, paint a bleak picture.He was referring to Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister in the current Socialist government who founded his own insurgent party and has been gaining momentum.Some hope the decline industry has peaked. \u201cI think Trump and Brexit were a kind of electric shock, and something changed,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Daumas, the editor of the Ideas section of the French left-wing daily Lib\u00e9ration.The challenge is that \u201cthe partisans of decline have formed a vocabulary, a way of speaking that\u2019s accessible to the broader public,\u201d Ms. Daumas said. \u201cThe progressive intellectuals of the left lost their public and are trying to get it back,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a real battle.\u201dDaphn\u00e9 Angl\u00e8s contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modi Faces \u2018Disappointed\u2019 Voters in India\u2019s Most Populous State", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIWANA, India \u2014 Villagers in the cane-growing region in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, helped sweep Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power nearly three years ago.But this time, they say, his party cannot count on their votes.\u201cAll farmers had their eyes set on Modi with a lot of hope,\u201d said Dharam Pal Singh, 40, a father of three, sitting cross-legged on a string bed in the courtyard of his two-story concrete house in the village of Kiwana, in western Uttar Pradesh. \u201cWe\u2019ve been disappointed.\u201dVoters in Uttar Pradesh began going to the polls last weekend, at the start of monthlong voting in seven phases across the state, and the final tally will not be known for several weeks. But if the vote is a referendum on Mr. Modi\u2019s first three years, it will also, to a great extent, determine whether he can follow through on the ambitious agenda with which he swept to power in 2014.Farmers are hurting here in the fields of northern India, where the sugar mills are months behind in payments for the cane harvest. In village centers, the tea sellers, painters and day laborers we meet say they are suffering, too, after Mr. Modi\u2019s anti-corruption initiative in November banned the largest currency notes. That caused a severe cash shortage that has choked business.Mr. Modi\u2019s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, commonly called the B.J.P., does not control the government of Uttar Pradesh, which determines sugar cane prices and the school and health policies that are the source of many local woes. But because Mr. Modi so successfully sold people on the promise of transformative change in the national campaign in 2014, villagers hold him responsible anyway.And their sentiments \u2014 in a state whose population of more than 200 million accounts for one in six people in the country \u2014 are hugely important now. If Mr. Modi can win here, he will control the upper house of Parliament, which has successfully stymied his economic agenda since his landslide victory in 2014. He would also enter the 2019 campaign for re-election with enough momentum to appear almost invincible.Two polls in January showed Mr. Modi\u2019s B.J.P. in the lead, although one suggests the political alliance marshaled against him is experiencing a last-minute surge that has it in a statistical tie. Our interviews with villagers suggest that they are less inclined in this election to support Mr. Modi, whom they voted for in 2014 believing, perhaps unrealistically, he would transform their corner of rural India into a place of development and opportunity.The election may still go the B.J.P.\u2019s way, but what seemed like a slam-dunk a month ago looks as if it could be very close. A major reason for the change in fortunes was the victory of Akhilesh Yadav, the 43-year-old chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and president of the Samajwadi Party, in a power struggle with his father. He emerged not only with control over the party, but also with his image burnished, experts said.It served to distinguish Mr. Yadav in the public eye from his family and party, both with images tarnished by years in power in a state that is performing poorly by most measures, experts say.\u201cBefore the fight, the biggest selling point for the B.J.P. was, \u2018Surely you don\u2019t want another term with these unsavory guys,\u2019\u201d said Siddharth Varadarajan, editor of The Wire, an online Indian news site, in an interview. \u201cNow that Akhilesh has got them off his back, he\u2019s cleansed the image of his government as nonperforming, where gangsters had sway.\u201dBut at a more fundamental level, disappointed villagers said in interviews that they had given up hope that any politician would be able to change things and had instead fallen back on traditional caste allegiances.\u201cModi had promised good days,\u201d Kaloo Kureshi, 38, a day laborer who says he voted for Mr. Modi in 2014, said at a tea stall in the town of Shamli. \u201cIf he gave us good days, everybody would be voting for him now.\u201dFarming and brickmaking continue to be the principal sources of employment in western Uttar Pradesh, but most people have radically different aspirations for their children. Though they live far from the glittering malls and high-tech companies of India\u2019s big cities, they want their children to receive the education they need to get jobs in the modern economy they see on television. That brings enormous frustration because local government schools are wholly inadequate to the task.Mr. Singh\u2019s wife, Rekha, sitting across from him on the string bed in their courtyard, said their children needed to be taught English so they could get good jobs, but that the government schools still taught in Hindi. In addition, teachers are frequently absent. More than 31 percent of rural teachers in Uttar Pradesh are absent on any given day, compared with a nationwide rate of nearly 24 percent, a survey by Karthik Muralidharan at the University of California, San Diego, found in 2010.In village after village, parents complained about the government schools. But with the sugar mills months behind in payments, the farmers have been unable to pay school fees, making them feel powerless to demand changes.\u201cWe have to stand by quietly now,\u201d said Jay Kumar, 32, sitting in the courtyard of the house he shares with his father and several brothers. \u201cWe dare not tell the teachers anything since we can\u2019t even pay school fees on time.\u201dAnd Mr. Kumar is among the affluent people in his village of Khandrawali. Ten cows and buffalo lie around his courtyard in the late morning as he and a group of male relatives discuss politics.In 2014, they say, they voted for Mr. Modi, believing he would bring good governance. But things have gotten worse locally, they say. Even though Mr. Kumar is a member of the elected village governing body, the panchayat, he, too, was paid months late for his sugar cane harvest. Crime is worse after riots that took place between Hindus and Muslims in nearby villages in 2013, leading thousands of Muslims to flee.\u201cPeople come and snatch our mobiles and steal our buffalo at gunpoint,\u201d he said.A few miles away are villages of Jaats, a different caste of Hindus who also voted heavily in favor of Mr. Modi. On a village corner in Lisarh, a sugar cane farmer, Vipin Malik, and a group of men chatted outside a store in the afternoon, reclining in wicker chairs.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a single vote in my village for Modi,\u201d Mr. Malik said, folding his arms across his chest and leaning back in his chair.In Shamli, the nearest town, where the best private schools and doctors\u2019 offices are, Mr. Modi\u2019s party also appears out of favor, in large part because of the cash shortage.Mohammed Arshad, 26, a house painter wearing a Nike cap, said he was getting far less work because of the shortage. \u201cPeople who are supposed to pay me are unable to, and I can\u2019t pay daily wage laborers,\u201d he said.With so many people barely working, demand for tea and snacks has fallen by 75 percent, said Mohammed Yunus, 54, a tea stall owner, stirring three shallow pots of sweets and samosas.\u201cThose who had four teas now get two teas, and they are cutting out sweets,\u201d he said.Meherbaan Ahmed, who sells old tires, said business had almost shut down since the currency ban. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have winter clothes for our children. We are all worried.\u201d\u201cIn 2014, everybody, even the smallest kids, were saying, \u2018Modi, Modi.\u2019 Now nobody is asking about him,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said.Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

After such a positive declaration, both Europeans and Americans must simply practice what they preach.\u201d\u201cOn Saturday in Munich,\u201d Mr. Tusk said, \u201cyou mentioned that during your trip across Europe in 1977 with your older brother, you found yourselves at some point in West Berlin, marveling at what you saw, then crossing through Checkpoint Charlie only to see the \u2018shadow of repression hanging over people.\u2019\u201d\u201cAs you know,\u201d Mr. Tusk continued, \u201cI had been living under this shadow for over 30 years.\u201dIn his statement, Mr. Tusk also recalled President Ronald Reagan\u2019s fight against communism.A cavalcade of surrogates for Mr. Trump \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and now Mr. Pence \u2014 have come to Europe in recent days to try to settle nerves here. Their speeches have helped.But nobody is quite sure whether these surrogates truly speak for Mr. Trump or whether, even if they do, Mr. Trump might soon change his mind.Among the concerns shared by many European policy makers is the possibility that the Trump administration will impose protectionist tariffs as part of the president\u2019s goal of bringing jobs back to the United States.In brief remarks before his own meeting with Mr. Pence, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, warned that the United States was more dependent on Europe than was commonly believed.\u201cThe U.S. economy is depending more than some in the U.S. would think on the exchanges, the trade volumes, including Indiana, by the way, between the U.S. and the European Union,\u201d Mr. Juncker said, referring to the state where Mr. Pence was governor before becoming vice president.In his own remarks, NATO\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he had been reassured of the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to NATO.\u201cI have heard exactly the same firm message from the president of the United States in two phone calls, from the vice president in meetings today and in Munich, and from Secretaries Mattis and Kelly,\u201d said Mr. Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, referring to Mr. Mattis and the secretary of Homeland Security, John F.

{"Headline": "Yes, Mr. President, Banks Are Lending", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThis is the party line: Banks aren\u2019t lending nowadays because the regulatory burden they face is too onerous. And that is hurting the economy and job creation.Articulating this view, President Trump has vowed to slash financial regulations to fix the problem.\u201cFrankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can\u2019t borrow money,\u201d he said in early February. \u201cThey just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank,\u201d the Wall Street reform law of 2010.Anecdotes can be compelling, of course. So many people with nice businesses who can\u2019t borrow money. That sounds very bad.But the actual figures tell a different story.Indeed, a look at recent bank results shows that lending among the big institutions is rising, not falling. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the most recent period, Bank of America, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and Wells Fargo all reported increases in their average loan figures.So banks are not lending less.Still, they could be doing more lending, says the veteran bank analyst Richard Bove, of Rafferty Capital Markets. And higher volumes of lending \u2014 of course, assuming the loans are appropriate \u2014 would help create jobs and fuel economic growth.There is no doubt that Congress\u2019 regulatory response to the financial crisis of 2008, which was largely fueled by reckless mortgage lending, tightened the rules for banks. Chief among them was a requirement that these institutions set aside greater amounts of capital to cover potential losses. That was justified, but it is crimping lending.And there are other reasons these institutions are relatively restrained in their lending, Mr. Bove said.\u201cYou cannot make the case that bank loans have not grown as a result of Dodd-Frank,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only case you can make is that Dodd-Frank has been a depressant on bank loans because of the increase in capital ratios and the need to put more money into liquidity.\u201dOther drags on loan growth, Mr. Bove said, include rising interest rates, which reduce the value of the securities these banks hold. Increasing interest rates contributed to diminished common equity positions at a group of banks Mr. Bove follows.Bank managers cannot control interest rates. But they can control the amount of dividends they pay out to shareholders, and the amount of stock they buy back in the open market. And generous distributions to shareholders by bank officials are a big factor in diminishing the money left over for making loans.Stock buybacks and lush dividends come out of a bank\u2019s retained earnings, also its source for increased lending. And Mr. Bove characterizes these payouts as financial engineering, pursued by bank executives interested in making their stocks perform better. He criticizes this practice, because while dividends and buybacks are good in the short-term, fewer loans will translate into reduced long-term earnings power at a bank.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that stock buybacks and high dividend payments eat into banks\u2019 common equity and slow down their ability to make loans,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis also slows down the secular growth rate of the company.\u201dThe amounts being paid out are considerable. During 2016, Wells Fargo returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases net of stock issued to employees. And in the most recent quarter, J. P. Morgan returned $3.8 billion to shareholders. That included $2.1 billion of net stock buybacks.Representatives for the banks declined to comment for this column. But officials at these institutions often contend that buying back stock and paying rich dividends are ways of returning excess capital to their shareholders, who are entitled to that money.At a presentation in 2014, for example, Marianne Lake, J. P. Morgan\u2019s chief financial officer, described the bank\u2019s capital allocation decisions: \u201cThe first priority is to support appropriate business growth and to provide a healthy dividend payout with the potential to increase over time,\u201d she said.Shareholders love their dividends and stock buybacks, of course, so none are likely to complain about these practices. Both help to keep share prices aloft as well.But buying back shares and paying rich dividends to shareholders diminishes a bank\u2019s common equity. And among 18 large banks that Mr. Bove follows, 14 showed declines in common equity in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of increased interest rates, buybacks and dividends. The combined decline in equity totaled almost $18 billion; in his view, that means the banks have lowered their ability to lend by $250 billion.To be sure, none of these banks are paying out all of their excess capital in dividends or stock buybacks. And that leaves them with a much fatter cushion for bad times.But Mr. Bove said that he had recently spoken with some bank executives who are considering paying out all the growth they report in retained earnings or common equity. \u201cThis would effectively negate any contribution that profits would make to retained earnings,\u201d Mr. Bove wrote in a recent research note. \u201cThe combination of further interest rate increases and large buyback programs would accelerate the decline in common equity and the ability of banks to make loans.\u201dIt is nothing new for the private sector to complain that regulations are cutting into their businesses. Given that the Dodd-Frank law runs to over 1,500 pages, undoubtedly some of its rules could be eliminated without bringing back reckless lending. This is especially true for smaller institutions. One of Dodd-Frank\u2019s bigger errors was to require smaller banks that had played no role in the crisis to ramp up their compliance duties as well. This was unfair and, yes, burdensome.Mr. Bove said he believes that some of the regulations should be reversed, but the elements he cited are not those that Republicans are focusing on.\u201cThe Republicans in the House and Senate cannot even agree with each other as to what should be deregulated,\u201d he pointed out in a recent research note. \u201cIn the Senate, they want a big-government approach to change the structure of the industry. In the House, there is a desire to get rid of irritating amendments to Dodd-Frank. Nothing is going to get done.\u201dIf Mr. Bove is right, that might be a good outcome. But this much is clear: The next time someone tells you that a wide swath of financial regulations needs to be reversed because they are crimping bank lending, you can tell them they\u2019ve got only part of the story.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
