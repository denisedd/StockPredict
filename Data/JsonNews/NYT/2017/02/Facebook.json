{"Headline": "Where the World\u2019s Wealthiest Invest Their Billions", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBernard Arnault, 67, is the richest man in France. Trained as a civil engineer, he got his start in business from his father, who had a successful construction company. He shifted the focus of his father\u2019s company to real estate and then turned his eye to luxury goods. Through his Groupe Arnault, the silver-haired Parisian sits at the helm of the luxury goods companies Christian Dior and LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. He is also a major art collector, having acquired works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol.His vast wealth sits predominantly in companies he controls. He has $34.8 billion held among Christian Dior, LVMH and Carrefour, a French retail chain. The next largest distribution is in cash at $2.9 billion; this is money from salaries, dividends and holdings that give him liquidity when he needs it. Then come the homes. He has a mansion in Paris worth $55 million and a home in the Bahamas worth $30 million, as well as yachts and art. His wealth shows how a single concentrated position in a company can increase your worth tremendously.Steven A. Ballmer, 60, scored a perfect 800 on the mathematics portion of the SAT and punched his ticket from an elite private school in Detroit to Harvard University. In his sophomore year, he lived in the same dorm as Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft. In 1980, he dropped out of Stanford University\u2019s business school to start working for Mr. Gates. He was paid $50,000 but given a stake in the nascent company. He rose to become chief executive in 2000 \u2014 a post he held for nearly 14 years. Shortly after stepping down, he bought the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team for a record $2 billion. The team had been mired in controversy with a previous owner, Donald Sterling.Even though Mr. Ballmer left Microsoft, the vast bulk of his wealth remains in company stock \u2014 $21.4 billion. He has $7.3 billion more in cash. It makes his stake in the Clippers seems paltry. He also has $450 million in Twitter shares. He owns a $14 million home in Hunts Point, Wash., and properties on Whidbey Island worth about $4 million.Susanne Klatten, 54, the richest woman in Germany, can trace the source of her wealth to \u201cthe ultimate driving machine,\u201d BMW. Her grandfather founded an industrial conglomerate that owned the German automotive company \u2014 and had a stake in its more staid rival, Daimler-Benz. The company also owned the chemical giant Altana. Her father, Herbert Quandt, took over the family businesses when his father died in 1954. When he died in 1982, Ms. Klatten received stakes in BMW and Altana, of which she is now the sole owner. As her father was credited with saving BMW from bankruptcy, she is credited with making Altana a top company in Germany. She is also chairwoman of the SGL Group, which produces graphite and carbon-fiber products.Her wealth is tied up in her companies, with over half, or $12.1 billion, in the BMW Group. An additional 16 percent is in Altana, and 1 percent is in the SGL Group. She has 22.5 percent in cash. She has a family office that creates privacy around the breakdown of her wealth.Azim Premji, 71, was born into the family that started Western India Vegetable Products, which produced hydrogenated oils. When Mr. Premji was at Stanford University, his father, who started the company, died, and he left college to take it over. At 23, he became chief executive. He diversified the Mumbai-based company\u2019s offerings into soap and baby care products. In 1981, he ventured into information technology. The company boomed through the 1980s and \u201990s, and in 2000 the renamed Wipro went public in New York. In 2009, Mr. Premji handed over the day-to-day running of the company. He devotes time to philanthropy, having given half his Wipro shares to a charity that supports education and health causes in India.His wealth appears to remain fairly concentrated, with 64 percent of it in Wipro shares. An additional 13 percent is in a related company, Wipro Enterprises, and 20 percent is shielded by his family office. Public records show that he has a $20 million stake in JM Financial (about 0.2 percent of his wealth), $180 million in cash and $1 million in property in Mumbai. Given his total worth, his properties and holdings are probably much greater, but he has structured his wealth to protect his privacy.Carlos Alberto Sicupira, who turns 69 this year, hails from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, which ranks just behind New York City (where he keeps a residence) for the most billionaires in the Americas. He began his career in finance at Banco de Investimentos Garantia. He later served as chief executive of Lojas Americanas, a Brazilian shopping chain. He is a founder of 3G Capital, a private equity firm that has become known in recent years for partnering with Warren E. Buffett, the second-wealthiest man in the world, on deals like the acquisition of Heinz in 2013 and, two years later, its merger with Kraft.Much of Mr. Sicupira\u2019s wealth rests in a series of deals 3G did with breweries starting in 1999. He has a $5.8 billion stake in the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev, which accounts for nearly 67 percent of his wealth. He has nearly $1 billion more in 3G itself. He still holds a $220 million stake in Lojas Americanas, where he remains chairman. He has an additional $1.6 billion in cash and a $2.5 million apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.Shari Arison, 59, was born in New York but splits her time now between Tel Aviv and Miami. Her father, Ted Arison, started Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. In 1990, he moved back to Tel Aviv, where he was born, and established Arison Investments. It later acquired Bank Hapoalim, Israel\u2019s largest bank, and renamed itself the Arison Group. It has investments in finance, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and water. When her father died in 1999, Ms. Arison inherited 35 percent of his wealth. (She has a brother, Micky, who owns the Miami Heat basketball team.) As owner of the Arison Group and a philanthropist, she promotes good deeds. The investment group\u2019s motto is \u201cDoing good is good for business,\u201d and through her charity she has sponsored Good Deeds Day, which encourages people to volunteer.Ms. Arison\u2019s wealth is divided fairly evenly among different investments. She owns $1.6 billion of stock in Carnival Cruise Line, $1.6 billion of stock in Bank Hapoalim, $1.1 billion in the Arison Group itself and holds $1 billion in cash. She has a stake in an Israeli housing and infrastructure company and homes in the Bal Harbour section of Miami and in Tel Aviv.Ever worn Nike, Adidas, Puma or Uniqlo? Those items may have come from one of Ma Jianrong\u2019s factories. His company is the leading textile manufacturer in China. Mr. Ma, 52, began working in the textile industry as a teenager and later earned a master\u2019s degree from Zhejiang University of Technology. His father, Ma Baoxing, was chairman of the weaving company that became Shenzhou International Group Holdings. In the late 1990s, the younger Mr. Ma took over the company and increased its revenue and net profit by 23 times in seven years. A member of the Chinese Communist Party, he is an official in the Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Congress.The exact composition of his wealth is hard to determine. He seems to have about $340 million in cash, with the rest in Shenzhou International Group Holdings.Patrice Motsepe, 55, was born in Johannesburg and began his career as a lawyer with American firms in South Africa. He attended university and law school during the apartheid era and practiced law for six years, becoming the first black partner in a South African law firm. In 1994, after Nelson Mandela became the country\u2019s first black president, Mr. Motsepe quit law to start Future Mining, a mining services company. With that as his start, he began acquiring mines and other mining companies. By 2004, the accumulated entities became African Rainbow Minerals. He owns the Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club, a soccer team in South Africa\u2019s premier league, and last year he started a private equity firm and financial services company.His wealth, which places him among South Africa\u2019s richest people, is well diversified. The largest portion of his wealth, 36 percent, is in cash and its equivalents. He has nearly 30 percent in Africa Rainbow Minerals, and a similar amount in Sanlam, a financial services firm of which he is deputy chairman. Some 5 percent of his wealth is in the Harmony Gold Mining Company. Two homes are worth $7 million, or one-third of 1 percent of his wealth.In search of quick Chinese food? Panda Express, with its 1,900 locations around the United States, is there to serve some up. Peggy Cherng, 69, founded the chain with her husband, Andrew. When the restaurant began expanding from Glendale, Calif., into the full-fledged chain it is today, she used her science background to make the business tech-savvy early on and then applied her knowledge of logistics to streamline the process. Ms. Cherng, who was born in Myanmar (then Burma), was raised in Hong Kong and met her husband at Baker University in Kansas. She holds a master\u2019s degree in computer science and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, and began her career at the defense contractor McDonnell Douglas. She and her husband live in California.Her largest holding is in the Panda Restaurant Group, which also owns Panda Inn. It is worth $1.2 billion, or 77 percent of her wealth. Nearly 19 percent of her wealth is in cash. She also has a large position, some $60 million, in the Golden Eagle Retail Group, a real estate development company. The rest of her wealth is in three homes in California.Smile, you\u2019re a billionaire. Kevin Systrom, 33, is a founder of the photo-sharing site Instagram, on which Beyonc\u00e9 announced her latest pregnancy and set a record for most shares. Mr. Systrom went to Stanford University and, after graduating in 2006, put in time at Google before venturing out on his own. In 2010, he and a friend got the idea for Instagram. Two years later, the company was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stock. He owned 40 percent of the company. He remains the chief executive.Mr. Systrom\u2019s wealth is tied to Facebook \u2014 at 88 percent. But he has about $160 million in cash. He also has $600,000 in Walmart stock from his role as a director of the company and the chairman of its technology and e-commerce committee.An article last Sunday about the investments of many of the world\u2019s billionaires misstated the name of the town in which Steven A. Ballmer, former chief executive of Microsoft, lives. It is Hunts Point, Wash. \u2014 not Huntsville.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In an Age of Cybercrime, Low-Tech Thieves Target Mailboxes", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkThe streets of Upper Manhattan were quiet, but a police officer saw two men standing in front of a blue mailbox at Broadway and Academy Street.It was around 1:30 a.m., Jan. 17.One of the men was holding a plastic bottle, which was tied to a string. While his partner stood lookout, the other man lowered the bottle into the mailbox, as if he were feeding a line off a pier, played the string a bit, then pulled it out.Four pieces of mail were stuck to the bottle.When the police officer stepped forward, the two men took off, leaving behind the plastic bottle. They were quickly caught. The mail was stuck on the bottle with glue.\u201cSuch devices are commonly used to obtain mail from inside of mailboxes,\u201d Officer Vito Guagenti said in a criminal complaint.This may be the age of cybercrime, but in some New York neighborhoods crooks are on a spree of fishing old-fashioned snail mail out of street corner mailboxes, using decidedly low-tech tools like plastic bottles, glue and string.Or, as in another case in Upper Manhattan, a glue trap like those typically used to catch mice.Some thieves wash the ink off the checks they snare and change the payees\u2019 names. Others make trouble by using the account information.Over the last year or so, the police and postal inspectors made about 150 arrests in the Bronx on charges of mail fishing, according to Donna Harris, a spokeswoman in New York for the United States Postal Inspection Service.\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping this low profile,\u201d she said. After realizing that \u201cwe weren\u2019t going to arrest our way out of the problem,\u201d Ms. Harris said, the postal authorities started changing the Bronx street mailboxes to make them harder to pilfer.Like fishing fleets that go where the schools are running, the mail thieves seemed to have pulled anchor in the Bronx and sailed to northern Manhattan. Since October, 14 arrests have been made there, Ms. Harris said.Laurie Piette was walking her dog one morning in November in the Inwood neighborhood and spotted an envelope addressed to Con Edison that was stuck to a mouse glue trap. The envelope had been torn open, but the return address was legible. She posted an inquiry on Facebook.Eventually, word got to the sender, Helen M. Churko, who had mailed her Con Edison bill and check a few days earlier.A picture of the torn envelope stuck to the mouse glue trap was posted online.\u201cIt was a great photograph,\u201d Ms. Churko said, but shocking. \u201cLiterally the minute I stopped getting hysterical, I called my bank and told them what was going on.\u201dWith electronic payment available for many bills, you might think that the pickings would be slim for mailbox thieves. But particularly in parts of Inwood and along Fort Washington Avenue in Washington Heights, older residents are more likely to use checks to pay their bills by mail.For her part, Ms. Churko said she wrote checks because she was on computers all day at work. \u201cI\u2019m old school when it comes to things like money,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are too many stories about cybertheft and identity theft.\u201dAlso, many landlords do not accept electronic payment. A few days into January, Andrew Graham dropped his rent check into a mailbox at Broadway and Dongan Place. He got a call from his bank. Someone had taken the check and written another name over the landlord\u2019s. \u201cWhoever\u2019s committing fraud in this way is really looking for unbanked folks who are mailing out money orders or cash,\u201d he said.Barbara Kennedy mailed her rent check in a box at Fort Washington Avenue and 183rd Street after the last pickup on Dec. 28. The next morning, she saw the mailbox had been pried open and emptied. She stopped payment. \u201cI put two posts on Facebook to alert people,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.People are being advised not to deposit mail after the last pickup of the day or on weekends. \u201cThat lets it sit in the box overnight,\u201d said Ms. Harris of the postal inspectors. (She said to report suspicious activity to 212-330-2400 or 911.)The Police Department also advised using gel ink, which is harder to wash off.\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to write our checks with indelible ink?\u201d Ms. Churko said. \u201cThis ticks me off even more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Winter Health Watch", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 9:39 a.m.Good morning on this drizzly Wednesday.We\u2019re a little more than a month away from the first day of spring.So close, yet so far.To help us get through the final stretch of winter with our health intact, we spoke to Dr. Alexandra Sowa, an internist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, who busted some cold-weather myths for us.To start, she told us, \u201cThe cold does not bring colds.\u201dBut last week we hit 60 degrees one day and had a blizzard the next. Are these extreme weather shifts not making us sick?Not quite, according to Dr. Sowa.\u201cTemperature shifts are not responsible for an increase in illnesses,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have a decrease in humidity level \u2014 when it\u2019s 60 and beautiful, and the next day it\u2019s 20 degrees and freezing cold \u2014 your airways might get dried out, and seasonal allergies or asthma might be exacerbated. But it\u2019s probably not a virus causing the irritation.\u201dThere are allergies during the winter?Absolutely.\u201cAllergies don\u2019t just come from flowers or trees,\u201d Dr. Sowa said. \u201cPeople are allergic to dust, and when we\u2019re cooped up inside \u2014 in offices with dried-up, poor heating systems \u2014 dust can be a real trigger in getting sick.\u201dWhat about dos and don\u2019ts? Is it dangerous to leave for work without drying your hair?\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that going outside with a wet head is going to get you sick.\u201dHow about going out without a hat and gloves?\u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily going to get sick, but the cold weather can be a real stressor on your body if you\u2019re not properly prepared for it,\u201d Dr. Sowa said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a surge in stress hormones that will leave you run down and more susceptible to the circulating viruses in the air.\u201dIs running outside in 30- or 40-degree weather a bad idea?\u201cIt\u2019s totally fine,\u201d Dr. Sowa said, underscoring the importance of staying active this time of year. Unless you have asthma, she added, it\u2019s better to be outdoors exercising now than it is to be idling inside.Any other no-brainers, besides exercising, getting enough sleep and eating well?Wash your hands, Dr. Sowa said: \u201cPeople don\u2019t wash their hands nearly as well as they think they might.\u201dPractice respiratory etiquette. \u201cIf you sneeze, sneeze not in a subway car full of people but into the crook of your elbow,\u201d she said. \u201cConfined spaces where people aren\u2019t covering their mouths are likely where they\u2019re transmitting the most active viruses.\u201dGet a flu vaccine. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late; last year there was a late-peaking flu season that went into May.\u201dAnd if you drink, keep alcohol intake to a reasonable level. \u201cThe propensity to not go outside, stay inside and go to bars is going to wreak havoc on your immune system,\u201d Dr. Sowa said. \u201cIt interferes with your sleep, and instead of your body fighting a cold, it might have to be fighting off the effects of a hangover.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:If you\u2019re allergic to crummy weather, today will make you woozy.Until then, it\u2019s cold.And temperatures are expected to plummet again tomorrow.A 5-cent bag fee, or no 5-cent bag fee?That was the question before Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, until last night.Either way, it\u2019s food for thought the next time you shop.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do You Need to Worry About Trump\u2019s Reforms? It Depends", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdventures in CapitalismI get it: You are freaked out. You don\u2019t like this president. Practically every day, he sets off some new crisis and, according to your Facebook feed, does something that might destroy the nation. You\u2019re wondering if you should start buying canned foods and ammunition.Among those concerns may be President Trump\u2019s pledge to do \u201ca big number\u201d on the financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, reforms known as the Dodd-Frank Act.It\u2019s a turbulent time. So, as a public service, I\u2019m going to regularly evaluate some of Mr. Trump\u2019s activities, and help you decide which ones are cause for alarm \u2014 and which, to be honest, are fairly rational attempts at governing, the same kinds of shifts we might expect if Hillary Clinton or a different Republican had been elected president.The Dodd-Frank law can essentially be broken into two parts. There is the act\u2019s core legislation, which placed new constraints on banks\u2019 financial activities and required them to hold onto more money as a cushion against crisis. This core legislation also created an independent regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has become a proud thorn in the side of many financial firms.The secondary aspects of Dodd-Frank, however, have almost nothing to do with stabilizing the economy or protecting consumers. They include provisions like forcing companies to disclose their use of conflict minerals, or to report payments that oil and mining companies make to foreign governments. There\u2019s a provision that regulates how much it costs to swipe a credit card.\u201cSome of these changes are depressing, because they undermine transparency and increase corruption, but they\u2019re not going to blow up our financial system,\u201d said Michael Barr, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury and one of the key architects of Dodd-Frank. \u201cThey leave the core of Dodd-Frank intact.\u201dAnd preserving that core is important, because Dodd-Frank\u2019s purpose isn\u2019t to make the financial system more virtuous, it\u2019s to make it more stable. Two years after the world\u2019s economic system imploded in 2008, the Obama administration and a Democratic Congress erected these new rules to prevent another crisis from happening. Some aspects of the resulting Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act were widely applauded; others were controversial from the start.In the intervening seven years, as the legislation has been tested by the real world, a consensus has emerged that some shifts are needed. \u201cWe wrote this in the wake of a major crisis, and I think the legislation reflected that,\u201d said Barney Frank, a former representative from Massachusetts who was a co-sponsor of the law. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve learned a lot since then, and some parts of the law should change to reflect that.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump signed an executive order last week to identify \u201cgovernment policies that inhibit federal regulation of the United States financial system,\u201d it was widely seen as the first step in overhauling Dodd-Frank.One paranoid view of Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions is that he aims to neuter or kill Dodd-Frank outright \u2014 a concern the president himself has fueled by saying that \u201cDodd-Frank is a disaster\u201d and pledging to \u201cdismantle\u201d it.However, such major revisions would require Congress\u2019s assistance, and it\u2019s unlikely that Democrats or moderate Republicans would go along. Even portions of Wall Street think killing Dodd-Frank is a terrible idea. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a law with good intentions,\u201d said H. Rodgin Cohen, the dean of Wall Street lawyers. \u201cIt just needs adjustments and regulators who understand the need to balance safety alongside economic growth.\u201dSo many hope that Mr. Trump and, more important, congressional Republicans simply want to alter Dodd-Frank. And this is the hard part of forecasting how panicked you ought to be, because we don\u2019t know specifically what the president and Congress will propose.Mr. Frank and numerous other policy makers concede that Dodd-Frank should be reformed to include more exemptions for smaller banks, and that Congress should raise the threshold at which a bank is deemed a potential risk to the economy. Lawmakers from both parties say the law creates too much unnecessary paperwork.So if you hear lawmakers proposing such fixes, you probably don\u2019t need to despair that another financial crisis is around the corner.But if the president is genuinely intent on killing Dodd-Frank, then more angst is warranted. If, for instance, lawmakers try to erase Dodd-Frank\u2019s core provisions, or eliminate or weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it\u2019s appropriate to worry. A leaked memo on Thursday from Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who has declared that he \u201cwill not rest until Dodd-Frank is ripped out by its roots and tossed on the trash bin of history,\u201d laid out plans to weaken the bureau\u2019s leadership, a move that should grab your attention.Other reasons to worry would be if Dodd-Frank reforms pass Congress without any Democratic votes \u2014 signaling that sober congressional minds, which often agree on banking rules, have been elbowed aside by radicals. If so, I suggest exploring which red wines go well with canned beans.Right now, however, you need not panic. It took more than a decade to brew up the toxic mess that became the financial crisis. It took two more years to pass Dodd-Frank. It will require more than an executive order and a leaked memo to undo those protections. As long as concerned citizens keep their eyes open, we\u2019ll all have plenty of time to prepare to freak out.Advertisement"}

She said the committee had no regrets.Karin Cecilie Kullmann was born in Oslo on April 13, 1951, and grew up in Baerum, an affluent suburb west of the capital. Her father, Kjell Elsner Kullmann, was a dentist; her mother, the former Anne-Lise Heiberg, a dental assistant.She became politically active as a teenager in the late 1960s, when the Conservative Party was strong in her local community but weak in national government.In 1977, while in her 20s, she took part in a televised debate as leader of the party\u2019s youth wing, appearing at times to outshine the party\u2019s leader, Erling Norvik, with her wit and knowledge.It was as if she had \u201cswept into our television set, sparks flying,\u201d Guri Hjeltnes, a Norwegian author and journalist, recalled.Ms. Kullman Five\u2019s interest in human rights activism dated from the 1970s, when dissidents like Andrei D. Sakharov were challenging the Soviet power structure.She was a member of Parliament from 1981 to 1997 and minister of trade and shipping from 1989 to 1990.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Refugee, Immigrant and Citizen", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this splendid Monday.When Luis Mancheno was 14 and living in Quito, Ecuador, he knew he had to learn English, and fast.It was around that age that he realized he would eventually need to leave his evangelical family, his all-boys Catholic school and his country: He feared they would reject him for being gay.So he holed up with the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books, and he studied the movies\u2019 English subtitles.\u201cI was able to identify with Harry, being different in a world where no one understands you,\u201d Mr. Mancheno said.Over the years, Mr. Mancheno grew from a teenager with a secret into a young adult facing violent persecution. He became an immigrant from Latin America, a refugee and eventually an American citizen. Now a lawyer in New York City, Mr. Mancheno, 30, is supporting others on that journey.Mr. Mancheno was one of more than 100 names submitted by readers as being a model New Yorker who has made a difference in the community and put others first in challenging situations.\u201cMy job is to give a voice to all the Luises out there,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cwho are completely alone, completely resourceless, and who are fighting a gigantic system that tells them that they don\u2019t have the right to a better life.\u201dHis experiences in Ecuador were harrowing, and the breaking point came in 2007, when he and a gay friend were drugged at a bar. He woke up with his pants down, in his car, on the edge of a cliff. The car had been crushed beneath a light post.Soon after, he inquired about an international exchange program, and, with limited English and $200 in the bank, he left Ecuador on a student visa, bound for college in Oregon. There, he learned about refugee law and decided to apply for asylum. By 2009, it had been granted.\u201cI saw myself \u2014 and I still see myself \u2014 in every single one of the clients that I represent,\u201d Mr. Mancheno said. \u201cI see the fear in their faces, the uncertainty, the powerlessness.\u201d\u201cPeople from all over the world \u2014 Russia, all different countries in Africa and Europe \u2014 we were all there saying that we wanted to be a part of this country,\u201d he recalled of that morning in June. \u201cAnd just like that, by raising my hand and putting it down, suddenly, I was an American citizen.\u201dSince then, the climate for refugees and immigrants coming to America has changed dramatically.\u201cI am Latino. I am an immigrant. I am gay. I am a refugee. And every single one of those elements that are part of my identity are under attack today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even then, there\u2019s now an opportunity for me to actually change the narrative.\u201d\u201cRight now, that\u2019s what I want to do with my day, with my time, with my energy,\u201d Mr. Mancheno said. \u201cThe Constitution will never allow me to be president, but if I could, I would run today.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Our February springtime will stick around until Friday.For many Christians of New York, Lent begins this week, on Ash Wednesday.During Lent, which lasts about six weeks, observers may give up everyday habits or luxuries as a way to commemorate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.For those observing Lent, we\u2019d love to know: What are you giving up this year, and why?Advertisement"}

As Professor Coffey noted, researchers once faced difficulty in getting feedback from peers before publication, and their projects were often closed to outsiders.This change was initially gradual. But it has increased at pace in recent years as the cost of cloud computing has plummeted and researchers have become comfortable in uploading their work onto social media.According to Mr. Madisch, the social network has signed up 12 million scientists, or roughly 60 percent of all such potential users worldwide.Researchers now upload roughly 2.5 million papers to ResearchGate every month. In comparison, scientists added the same amount of research over the first four years of the network\u2019s operation.On Tuesday, the social network said that it had raised $52.6 million from a range of investors, including Goldman Sachs, Bill Gates and Benchmark Capital, a venture capital fund. The money, which more than doubles the amount it has raised previously, was secured in late 2015, but was only made public on Tuesday in accordance with German corporate accounting rules.Recently, he said, another scientist contacted him through the network, asking to borrow his computer code for an unrelated project, something that would not have been possible if Mr. Mahbub had not posted regular updates about his research.\u201cI had no problem about sharing my code with him,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Will Social Media Help or Hurt Your College and Career Goals?", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudent OpinionAs you become more valuable to the marketplace, good things will find you. To be clear, I\u2019m not arguing that new opportunities and connections are unimportant. I\u2019m instead arguing that you don\u2019t need social media\u2019s help to attract them.My second objection concerns the idea that social media is harmless. Consider that the ability to concentrate without distraction on hard tasks is becoming increasingly valuable in an increasingly complicated economy. Social media weakens this skill because it\u2019s engineered to be addictive. The more you use social media in the way it\u2019s designed to be used \u2014 persistently throughout your waking hours \u2014 the more your brain learns to crave a quick hit of stimulus at the slightest hint of boredom.Once this Pavlovian connection is solidified, it becomes hard to give difficult tasks the unbroken concentration they require, and your brain simply won\u2019t tolerate such a long period without a fix. Indeed, part of my own rejection of social media comes from this fear that these services will diminish my ability to concentrate \u2014 the skill on which I make my living.The idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance athlete, and it should be to you if you\u2019re serious about creating things that matter.Most employers and customers I\u2019ve talked to are ultimately looking for confirmation of their excitement about you, not reasons for suspicions or doubts. Not having any profile could be seen as a red flag, so why give a potential employer any reason to question your candidacy?Your social media presence \u2014 and, really, your whole digital footprint \u2014 is no longer just an extension of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It\u2019s as important as your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Social media use is now a standard of the hiring process, and there\u2019s little chance of going back.You need to realize that social media wields great power: What you say there \u2014 including saying nothing at all \u2014 has an effect on your network or on the employer who is checking out your Instagram account. But remember that you control what people see. By being more judicious about what you share or by altering the platform settings where possible, you can manage your digital trail to increase the odds that a potential employer will form a positive impression of you.\u2014 Do you think social media will help or hurt your college and career goals? Why?\u2014 Was either columnist more persuasive, in your opinion? Which one, and why?\u2014 Did you have a strong opinion about the value of social media to a person\u2019s professional life before you read the articles? Regardless of your stand either way, did reading the columns sway you to one side or the other? Why or why not?\u2014 Conduct a personal social media audit. Make a list of your social media accounts, including old platforms you no longer use.

{"Headline": "Are Liberals Helping Trump?", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisJeffrey Medford, a small-business owner in South Carolina, voted reluctantly for Donald Trump. As a conservative, he felt the need to choose the Republican. But some things are making him feel uncomfortable \u2014 parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, for example, and the recurring theme of his apparent affinity for Russia.Mr. Medford should be a natural ally for liberals trying to convince the country that Mr. Trump was a bad choice. But it is not working out that way. Every time Mr. Medford dips into the political debate \u2014 either with strangers on Facebook or friends in New York and Los Angeles \u2014 he comes away feeling battered by contempt and an attitude of moral superiority.\u201cWe\u2019re backed into a corner,\u201d said Mr. Medford, 46, whose business teaches people to be filmmakers. \u201cThere are at least some things about Trump I find to be defensible. But they are saying: \u2018Agree with us 100 percent or you are morally bankrupt. You\u2019re an idiot if you support any part of Trump.\u2019 \u201dHe added: \u201cI didn\u2019t choose a side. They put me on one.\u201dLiberals may feel energized by a surge in political activism, and a unified stance against a president they see as irresponsible and even dangerous. But that momentum is provoking an equal and opposite reaction on the right. In recent interviews, conservative voters said they felt assaulted by what they said was a kind of moral Bolshevism \u2014 the belief that the liberal vision for the country was the only right one. Disagreeing meant being publicly shamed.Protests and righteous indignation on social media and in Hollywood may seem to liberals to be about policy and persuasion. But moderate conservatives say they are having the opposite effect, chipping away at their middle ground and pushing them closer to Mr. Trump.\u201cThe name calling from the left is crazy,\u201d said Bryce Youngquist, 34, who works in sales for a tech start-up in Mountain View, Calif., a liberal enclave where admitting you voted for Mr. Trump is a little like saying in the 1950s that you were gay. \u201cThey are complaining that Trump calls people names, but they turned into some mean people.\u201dMr. Youngquist stayed in the closet for months about his support for Mr. Trump. He did not put a bumper sticker on his car, for fear it would be keyed. The only place he felt comfortable wearing his Make America Great Again hat was on a vacation in China. Even dating became difficult. Many people on Tinder have a warning on their profile: \u201cTrump supporters swipe left\u201d \u2014 meaning, get lost.He came out a few days before the election. On election night, a friend posted on Facebook, \u201cYou are a disgusting human being.\u201d\u201cThey were making me want to support him more with how irrational they were being,\u201d Mr. Youngquist said.Conservatives have gotten vicious, too, sometimes with Mr. Trump\u2019s encouragement. But if political action is meant to persuade people that Mr. Trump is bad for the country, then people on the fence would seem a logical place to start. Yet many seemingly persuadable conservatives say that liberals are burning bridges rather than building them.\u201cWe are in a trust spiral,\u201d said Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University. \u201cMy fear is that we have reached escape velocity where the actions of each side can produce such strong reactions on the other that things will continue to escalate.\u201dIt is tempting to blame Mr. Trump for America\u2019s toxic political state of mind. He has wreaked havoc on political civility and is putting American democratic institutions through the most robust stress test in decades. But many experts argue that he is a symptom, not a cause, and that the roots go deeper.Many experts compare today with the 1960s and the Vietnam War protests. That period was far more violent but culminated in a landslide victory for Richard Nixon in 1972, after he famously appealed to the \u201csilent majority,\u201d who he believed resented what they saw as disrespect for American institutions. Others say that democracy was far healthier then and that you have to go farther back to find a historical parallel.\u201cThere is really only one period that was analogous, and that is the Civil War and its immediate aftermath,\u201d said Doug McAdam, a Stanford sociology professor. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting we are there, but we are straining our institutions more than we really ever have before.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with protesting as long as it\u2019s peaceful, but this is destroying the country,\u201d said Ann O\u2019Connell, 72, a retired administrative assistant in Syracuse who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cI feel like we are in some kind of civil war right now. I know people don\u2019t like to use those terms. But I think it\u2019s scary.\u201dMrs. O\u2019Connell is a registered Democrat. She voted for Bill Clinton twice. But she has drifted away from the party over what she said was a move from its middle-class economic roots toward identity politics. She remembers Mr. Clinton giving a speech about the dangers of illegal immigration. Mr. Trump was lambasted for offering some of the same ideas, she said.\u201cThe Democratic Party has changed so much that I don\u2019t even recognize it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people are destroying our democracy. They are scarier to me than these Islamic terrorists. I feel absolutely disgusted with them and their antics. It strengthens people\u2019s resolve in wanting to support President Trump. It really does.\u201dMr. Medford compares Mr. Trump to a jalopy.\u201cIt\u2019s like I need to get from Charleston to Atlanta, and suddenly the most beat-up car on earth shows up and says, \u2018Do you need a ride?\u2019 I think, wow, if I had any other way to get there, I\u2019d choose it. But there\u2019s only this terrible car. And it might not even make it.\u201dBut he doesn\u2019t want to get out, at least not yet, and the resignation of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, hasn\u2019t changed that. Late last year, he hit it off with a woman in New York he met online. They spent hours on the phone. They made plans for him to visit. But when he mentioned he had voted for Mr. Trump, she said she was embarrassed and didn\u2019t know if she wanted him to come. (He eventually did, but she lied to her friends about his visiting.)\u201cIt invalidated anything that\u2019s good about me, just because of how I voted. Poof, it\u2019s gone.\u201dMrs. O\u2019Connell feels hopeless. She has deleted all her news feeds on Facebook and she tries to watch less TV. But politics keeps seeping in.\u201cI love Meryl Streep, but you know, she robbed me of that wonderful feeling when I go to the movies to be entertained,\u201d she said. \u201cI told my husband, I said, \u2018Ed, we have to be a little more flexible, or we\u2019re going to run out of movies!\u2019 \u201dAs for the country, she is worried.\u201cChange doesn\u2019t occur until you hit rock bottom, like an alcoholic, on his knees, begging for help,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we still have farther to go.\u201dSabrina Tavernise is a national correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Personal Trainer for Heartbreak", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a traumatic breakup, Julia Scinto, a fashion designer in Manhattan, found herself searching online sites far and wide, looking for any available resource to help her feel better.\u201cI even considered hypnosis,\u201d said Ms. Scinto, who designs women\u2019s wear for Macy\u2019s private label.Instead, she discovered Mend, an app and online community that serves as part personal trainer, part online refuge for the brokenhearted.\u201cIt\u2019s this charming and endearing voice of a friend,\u201d Ms. Scinto said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a line, \u2018We never get tired of hearing about your breakup,\u2019 and those words are like an oasis in the desert.\u201dGeri Dugan, who works as a psychiatric nurse practitioner in Chicago, knows all too well the mixed emotions that come after a love affair ends. After being stunned by a relationship that didn\u2019t work out, she said, she felt like an \u201cemotional basket case.\u201dMs. Dugan found Mend through Ms. Huerta\u2019s podcast \u201cLove Is Like a Plant.\u201d Now, for more than eight months, she has been applying Mend\u2019s daily regime, which includes monitoring one\u2019s self-care, journaling exercises, a Spotify playlist and a book club on Good Reads. She has also navigated through difficult days with support from Mend\u2019s Facebook group.It \u201creally helped normalize the experience,\u201d Ms. Dugan said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m even recommending it to some of my patients going through things like divorce.\u201dIn her Santa Monica, Calif., office, just blocks from the Pacific, Ms. Huerta, 30, with a tumble of dark hair and giant blue eyes, admitted that she had always been drawn to matters of the heart. \u201cMend started very organically after I went through a breakup,\u201d she said between sips of her hand-blended rooibos tea. \u201cI had a lot of resources at my disposal \u2014 I had supportive friends and access to therapy \u2014 but I still was having such a hard time moving forward.\u201dMs. Huerta, identified by the name Elle on Mend, found online sites that offer breakup advice to be disappointing, with generic insights like \u201cIt just takes time\u201d or wearisome directives like \u201cPost a photo on social media of yourself with someone new.\u201dShe said she set out to build a better digital experience for the newly solo, where users could shake their feeling of helplessness and take action. As a former Google employee, she was familiar with the tech field and took her cues from fitness and brain-health apps. \u201cWe are taking those parts of our lives very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cYet we weren\u2019t doing that with our love lives, which is at the core of who we are.\u201d\u201cOne of my personal missions is to erase the shame and taboo of heartbreak as something to just get over,\u201d Ms. Huerta said. One way she addresses that is by drawing on her background in science. (She has a degree in geosciences from Wellesley, and her father is a geophysicist.) She counsels the Mend community that it\u2019s not just emotion that causes a wave of intense feelings, it\u2019s also biology.\u201cIt\u2019s different for everyone,\u201d Ms. Huerta said, \u201cbut when you go through a separation with someone who you have been intimate with, your body can tell that there\u2019s been a separation. You\u2019re giving off hormones, and they are giving off hormones, over time you become addicted to that source of feel-good hormones.\u201dAlthough much of Ms. Huerta\u2019s advice for Mend users is grounded either in science or in her own romantic mistrials, and she encourages a range of options, like meditation and mood-boosting teas, she firmly believes in the magic and mystery of love, which no data, chart or study can pinpoint. It is that belief that will inform a Mend app update scheduled to roll out in the spring.One sentiment remains: \u201cIt\u2019s true what they say,\u201d Ms. Huerta said. \u201cLove really is the drug.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber and Starbucks Protests Show Boycotts Need More Than a Hashtag", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyBoth groups had the same goal, whether they were trying to stick it to the president or stick with him: to bring the fight to the companies that may (or may not) do the literal bidding of the new administration. And their weapon was their daily budget.Both actions, however, were not actual boycotts, at least if you ask a purist. \u201cThey are calls for boycotts,\u201d said Monroe Friedman, the unofficial dean of American boycott studies and an emeritus professor of psychology at Eastern Michigan University. Sustaining a true boycott, he noted, requires more than a hashtag.As well intentioned as it may be, this makes for some exhausting reading. It\u2019s also exhaustive \u2014 so much so that the organizers felt duty-bound to include a list of entities not being boycotted at this time. It is O.K., for instance, to shop in a bookstore, even if that store sells a book by Mr. Trump.First, there are the one-sided issues. No one, he said in an interview this week, is on the side of child labor, for instance. These kinds of boycotts tend to draw more supporters and have a greater chance of success.Boycotts ensued \u2014 but good luck to you if your goal is to change the mind of a guy like that. And if you\u2019re going to try, don\u2019t send him letters telling him that you\u2019re not going to buy his tea anymore. (He doesn\u2019t sell it.) And don\u2019t give him a reason to disparage your intellect by misspelling \u201cchef\u201d as \u201cchief.\u201d\u201cThese are failing countries attempting to assume moral superiority over the West,\u201d Mr. Savage said. \u201cWhatever else is wrong there, at least they\u2019re beating up queers and keeping them from getting married or speaking about themselves publicly.\u201dMr. Diermeier invoked the Disney example: Good luck talking a child out of a promised trip to its theme parks. (Disney has, for whatever reason, stayed silent on the travel ban thus far, even though it has this built-in protection of the youth vote.)But if the company had left the surge on, the same protesters would have probably accused it of profiteering off the work stoppage. So there was no way for Uber to win, though if it had posted no Twitter message at all it might have escaped notice.Still, this alone is hardly the cause for a boycott. So what\u2019s really going on here?We\u2019ll probably never know exactly how much the boycott affected Mr. Kalanick\u2019s choice to quit Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory board, or whether he did so because his employees urged him to. It\u2019s possible they could no longer stand the perception that their boss was helping a president whom many of them loathe.According to Mr. Friedman, the boycott dean, a true, successful boycott requires a sustained campaign and plenty of money or time. Consumers who don\u2019t have much of either, however, can take heart in one big change that the travel-ban controversy has revealed.It is now more clear than ever that the companies where we spend our billions answer to us. Pummel the ones that you disagree with for their views, or criticize the ones that are too cowardly to side with the man their country elected. But no matter what you feel about what is going on in Washington, isn\u2019t it rather nice to see large corporations back on their heels a bit?Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

Two years ago, with the support of my wife, daughters and son-in-law, I began hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\u201cAt the time, I did not imagine I would hold the mayor\u2019s position, but here I am.\u201dMs. Herbst has been active in local government since 2003 as an elected alderman, road commissioner and mayor pro tempore. In 2016, she was appointed New Hope\u2019s mayor after the previous official in that post died.As of Wednesday morning, the New Hope town website was still referring to her as Mayor Jeff Herbst.But Ms. Herbst implied in her statement that she was patient: \u201cI\u2019m not especially sensitive to the pronoun I\u2019m called, and I expect people to take time to make the change. I use the name Jess, a simple change from Jeff.\u201d\u201cI live my life as a female now, and I will be performing my duties to the town as such,\u201d she wrote.On the town website, she also invited the public to make comments in the town\u2019s public meeting on Jan 31.Ms. Herbst, 58, said in a telephone interview that after posting her statement on Jan. 23, she attended the council meeting for the first time dressed as a woman.\u201cIt was phenomenally positive; everyone was supportive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a fairly packed crowd for a tiny town \u2014 there were 15 or 20 people there. I explained to the people who had not just had a chance to see the website, and everybody said, \u2018O.K.,' and we went on and had a meeting.\u201dBut as an elected official who was later appointed as mayor, Ms. Herbst said that she was given a \u201cvery stern lecture\u201d by the town attorney about laws that govern elections and canvassing, and that she was told not to change her name before the coming election cycle.Ms. Herbst also said she has received thousands of messages of support, and three negative ones.Critics said the bill discriminated against transgender people.Terri Burke, the executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said Mayor Herbst was showing \u201ctremendous courage in discussing her identity with the public.\u201cWe applaud Mayor Herbst\u2019s decision to serve her community openly in public office and take a stand against hateful rhetoric coming from some of our legislators,\u201d Ms. Burke said in an email.\u201cSome Texas lawmakers are attempting to exclude transgender Texans from public spaces with legislation like SB6, but we should be making it easier for them to share their skills and talents with us, not pushing them out of public restrooms and public life.\u201dMs. Herbst said that she had the support of her family. Her wife grew up in New Hope, and the couple have lived in the town with their two daughters since 1999.\u201cIt is gender identity, not sexual preference that applies to me,\u201d the mayor wrote. \u201cI love my wife, and she loves me. We have no intention of change. My daughters have been adamant supporters of me and are proud to tell people their father is transgender.\u201dIn the interview Wednesday, Ms. Herbst said she began living full time as Jess toward the end of September, and gradually broke the news to friends, family and co-workers. Finally, there was no one left to tell but the wider town population, and that was when she made the announcement.\u201cI am being who I am and doing what I have to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not trying to make some sort of big statement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No longer would anyone have to buy a $99-a-month triple-play package when all they wanted was the History Channel.Over the last two decades, consumers have felt liberated as traditional bundles unraveled \u2014 from music to media to retail.For instance, Craigslist and myriad other digital start-ups siphoned lucrative job and real estate listings from traditional newspaper bundles. Meanwhile, media firms held onto the economically challenged business of delivering news and entertainment.Proponents of the breakdown of the bundle economy most often cite cable television. Superficially, the evidence is compelling: In the last six years, pay TV penetration has declined from about 90 percent to 80 percent of homes \u2014 with more than two million homes cutting the cord in the last couple of years alone.But paradoxically, the same forces that allowed classified ads and news to be so easily separated also drastically increased the economic rationale for bundling across the board.Consumers merely have swapped one bundle for another (or often, several). There are more than 65 million subscribers to cheaper \u201cover the top\u201d packages provided by Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Sling TV and others (even excluding Amazon Prime Video). One does not always think of all of these as \u201cbundles\u201d because these services do not consistently categorize their content using the commonplace TV channel taxonomy. However, their aggregation of shows looks more and more like a traditional cable bundle.We are in the age of the great rebundling, when firms use packages of services as a way to increase their scale advantage and thus deepen the moat around their businesses.In music, the story is even starker than in television. At one time, consumers used to buy a collection of songs \u2014 on vinyl, cassette and then compact disc. It was possible to buy a single song or two in these formats, but the internet facilitated more and more people downloading individual tracks.Yet, today, there is an inexorable consumer shift to all-you-can-eat bundles of music. Already more than 60 million people pay for Spotify, Apple Music and others. These music bundles will increasingly be combined with other services as well to build competitive advantage. This newspaper currently includes Spotify with certain new subscriptions. And it is easy to see how Google and Apple will increasingly integrate music packages into their broader suite of services (as Amazon already has).Bundling has always worked well for products for which consumers have widely varying tastes and willingness to pay. The magic of bundle economics allows consumers to get more for less, while also maximizing revenue for the provider. Imagine that there are two hungry diners at a burger joint where the restaurant\u2019s marginal cost of food is zero-ish. One customer is willing to fork over $5 for a burger and $1 for fries. The other will shell out $5 for fries but only $1 for a burger. By selling a la carte, the restaurant maximizes revenue by pricing each item at $5. Both consumers leave hungry, and the business takes in $10. However, both diners would snap up a $6 bundle, allowing them to sate their appetites while shelling out $12 in total. Everyone is better off (perhaps not healthwise).In the digital environment, two additional forces are driving this tidal wave of digital bundling.First, the near-zero marginal cost of distribution makes all-you-can-eat packages compelling. Even heavy users of streaming services can potentially be profitable customers if the underlying economics of rights payments are well managed.The Federal Communications Commission appears to be relaxing its position on the bundling of data and services. The agency had been investigating the practice of \u201czero-rating,\u201d whereby a wireless carrier like T-Mobile allows its subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data cap. Recently, the F.C.C. dropped this investigation \u2014 believing that this kind of bundling is now commonplace in a competitive market. Plainly this is the thin edge of the wedge for net neutrality. Connectivity and cloud computing services will most likely start to include \u201cunrated\u201d services to differentiate themselves further from other commodity providers. In the short term, this shift will most likely be a boon for consumers. Time will tell whether this stifles long-range innovation \u2014 especially in bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming.Second, firms need to mitigate the high cost of attracting and retaining online consumers. Netflix can amortize the expense of acquiring and servicing a subscriber over the hundreds of dollars of revenue they will generate if they hang around for a couple of years. Selling individual shows for a few bucks a pop would be vastly more expensive in marketing, billing and service costs.Tying several services together (even when they are not all directly complementary) increases customer loyalty. Amazon Prime has more than 66 million subscribers. Just a few years ago, it was mostly a free-shipping service. Now, it includes an extensive library of free e-books, videos and music. The large base of Prime subscribers makes life hard for would-be Amazon competitors \u2014 who have to contend not just with Amazon\u2019s scale in any particular vertical but also the combined value of the eclectic products and services that Amazon bundles together. This value may also increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning help personalize these applications. Walmart may be four times larger than Amazon in retail, but Amazon\u2019s bundle magnifies the impact of its size, reducing its scale disadvantage.For insurgents, this trend complicates the already formidable challenge of competing with the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple \u2014 all of which have been adept at weaving various interconnected services together to magnify their scale advantage.Technology investors are obsessed with network effects. These help make firms like Facebook and eBay so valuable \u2014 because additional users increase utility for everyone, making it hard for upstarts to compete. But investors often forget that network effects are just a subset of scale advantages. Superior scale is what protects most businesses from competition. It would be hard to start a business to take on Coca-Cola because of its size advantage \u2014 especially in local bottling, distribution and marketing.During the road show for the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape, its chief executive, Jim Barksdale, famously commented that there are \u201conly two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.\u201d For many firms, the bundle is not a decaying symbol of legacy distribution. Rather, it is the new network effect: a critical strategy to amplify scale in the hope of building or deepening a moat to protect against foes everywhere.Jeremy G.

Not that I\u2019m a Democrat anyway, but that seems to be the opposition party.\u201dIn response to Mr. Gardner\u2019s complaints that the people showing up at his office to request town-hall-style meetings were paid protesters from other states, one group showed up at his office with a banner on which members had written their Colorado ZIP codes.National groups are looking past the recess, to try to keep up the momentum for the local efforts.Ms. Sussman, at the Center for American Progress, said her group planned a training and planning session in April for new activist leaders. Save My Care, another Washington group, is to begin an online campaign on Monday where people can register to have a hospital wristband sent to their congressional representative. The wristbands, which read \u201cI will lose my health care if you vote to repeal,\u201d will be delivered to Congress after the recess.Planned Parenthood is signing up \u201cdefenders\u201d and holding 90-minute training sessions to help teach new activists how to tell reporters and lawmakers their personal experiences with the group\u2019s health services, and what it would mean to lose them.The group is planning a rally in Milwaukee on Feb. 25, the last weekend of the recess week, with Planned Parenthood patients from Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s district expected to testify how they would be affected if clinics lost funding. Mr. Ryan has said he would defund Planned Parenthood in any repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Still, said Nicole Safar, the group\u2019s director of government relations in Wisconsin, \u201cThis is more about movement-building than targeting Paul Ryan.\u201d\u201cThis is a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put as much pressure as we can on Paul Ryan during the recess, for sure, but this isn\u2019t going to end any time soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Cohen said he delivered the proposal to the White House in a sealed envelope in early February.Mr. Artemenko, a little-known politician who has tried to brand himself as a Trump-style populist, has not been arrested or formally charged with a crime.He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: An Upwelling of Outrage Against a Presidential Action", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsFirst: Snap (the maker of Snapchat) finally unveiled its I.P.O. documents. It\u2019s been years since a big American consumer tech company went public, so everyone on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley has been salivating over Snap\u2019s debut on the market. And what we learned can be boiled down to two sentences: Snap is making a whole lot of money. And it\u2019s losing even more.Another interesting data point was the size of its user base. Snapchat has about 160 million daily users. That\u2019s not small! But it\u2019s not that big, either, compared to Facebook and Instagram. It\u2019s more in line with Twitter, which is not doing all that well.Here\u2019s Snap\u2019s problem. Part of what made companies like Facebook so successful is this economic term and Silicon Valley buzzphrase: network effects. Essentially, the larger a network gets, the more people tend to find value in it. Facebook is the classic example of positive network effects strengthening the site over time.Snapchat has a bit more difficult time doing that. It doesn\u2019t have a follower model similar to Facebook\u2019s, which means it takes a bit more effort to find new or interesting people to interact with on Snapchat. Also, content posted by people who aren\u2019t your friends isn\u2019t easily discoverable, another issue of keeping people engaged, in my mind.A lot of folks compare Snapchat to Twitter, which I think is a pretty apt way of looking at it. Both companies really rely on brand advertising \u2014 basically, high-dollar accounts from huge advertisers rather than a bunch of smaller accounts that make up the long tail of revenue \u2014 and that seems to pale in comparison to the advertisers that go with, say, Google or Facebook.And, as Facebook will tell you all day long, advertisers love targeting data, which Facebook has in droves. Snapchat, less so.This is moving much faster than I thought it would. I\u2019m not surprised Silicon Valley is a liberal bastion; I am surprised that workers here reacted so strongly to the new order. Were you? And where do you think this goes?And to your earlier point, the speed of how people mobilized so quickly was indeed breathtaking. I think a lot of it had to do with a feeling of helplessness among people that I heard about quite a bit. They wanted to do something, hence the protests, but also deleting and boycotting Uber felt satisfying to many, like they were taking a stand. We\u2019ll see if that blows over now that Travis is off the council.If that\u2019s not towering hypocrisy, I don\u2019t know what is.Till next week?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even in Texas, Mass Imprisonment Is Going Out of Style", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesIt promises to be a bleak four years for liberals, who will spend it trying \u2014 and, most likely, failing \u2014 to defend health care, women\u2019s rights, climate change action and other good things. But on one serious problem, continued progress is not only possible, it\u2019s probable. That is reducing incarceration.In an era of what seems like unprecedented polarization and rancor, this idea has bipartisan support. The Koch brothers and Black Lives Matter agree. The American Civil Liberties Union and the American Conservative Union Foundation agree. Bernie Sanders and Newt Gingrich agree.Here\u2019s what they agree on:\u2022 The United States went overboard on mass incarceration in the 1980s and 1990s.\u2022 This has ruined a lot of lives \u2014 of those incarcerated, yes, but also others among their families and communities.\u2022 The evidence says that harsher sentences don\u2019t prevent crime and may even lead to more crime.\u2022 Jailing people is really, really expensive.\u2022 Prison brings no help and much harm to the 80 percent of prisoners who are addicted to drugs or mentally ill.\u2022 There are alternatives to imprisonment that keep Americans safe.(There are also crime and justice issues that these liberals and conservatives do not agree on, such as the death penalty, the merits of private prisons and, of course, guns.)Even all this agreement is no guarantee of progress in Washington. President Trump\u2019s policies on crime are whatever slogans get the crowd roaring.Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a D-plus record on this issue as a senator. He supported reducing the disparity in sentencing for cocaine and crack possession. He did vote for the Prison Rape Elimination Act \u2014 kudos for that, I suppose.But last year, Mr. Sessions, along with a few other Republican senators, blocked the major bill on this issue, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, from coming to a vote. So the administration can be expected to be unhelpful, with Congress a question mark.California slashed its incarceration rate by 27 percent between 2006 and 2014 after a court order. New York cut its rate by 18 percent, largely because of reform of the Rockefeller drug laws that mandated long sentences for possession. New Jersey\u2019s rate dropped by 24 percent.More remarkable \u2014 and probably more persuasive to other states and to Congress now \u2014 is the shift in red states, where incarceration rates have been the highest. In the last decade, they have dropped substantially in South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia and, notably, in lock-\u2019em-up Texas.Texas enthusiastically joined the national prison-building binge of the 1980s and 1990s under Govs. Ann Richards, a Democrat, and George W. Bush, a Republican.Several factors contributed to change. Starting in 2003, the coalition held town hall meetings on prison reform throughout Texas. The group had refined its message through polling: don\u2019t talk about race, do emphasize that reform would save taxpayers money, increase public safety and strengthen communities. Ya\u00f1ez-Correa said the events drew a surprising amount of support, even in conservative strongholds.The cost of prisons was a huge issue. In 2007, the Texas Legislative Budget Board projected that the state would need more than 17,000 new prison beds over five years, a building project that would cost $530 million, never mind the operating costs.That pushed the ultraconservative House speaker, Tom Craddick, to a breaking point. Jerry Madden, the Republican chairman of the House Corrections Committee, said in an interview that Craddick took him aside. \u201cDon\u2019t build new prisons,\u201d Craddick told him. \u201cThey cost too much.\u201dMadden was an engineer and took that approach, asking: What is proven to work to keep people out of prison? How much of that do we need to buy in order to not build more of them?That there was a conservative research group to consult was in itself remarkable. \u201cNo one in conservative think tanks worked on criminal justice, other than to advocate for more prisons and more incarceration,\u201d said the foundation\u2019s director, Brooke Rollins, who had been Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s policy director.\u201cConservatives are wrong on crime,\u201d he told a startled Rollins. \u201cScripture would not call us to build prisons and forget people.\u201d Dunn believes that crime victims want restitution and repentance, while the prison system merely incapacitates. On his personal website, he wrote that \u201cnonviolent crimes should be recompensed in a way that gets people back into the work force and adding to communities as quickly as possible,\u201d and that Texas should \u201cfocus on restoring victims and communities damaged by crime.\u201dAt Dunn\u2019s urging, Rollins hired Levin part time to work on a conservative approach to criminal justice reform.\u201cWe found the conservative and liberal think tanks agreed on 70, 80 percent of the stuff,\u201d said Madden. And it\u2019s those areas of agreement that were put in the bill.The reforms passed nearly unanimously \u2014 and although Perry had previously vetoed narrower reforms, this time he signed them. (He now endorses the Right on Crime agenda.) Reforms continue today: 16 bills passed in the last legislative session, including one allowing people to erase their criminal records in some circumstances.Expanding drug treatment was a major step. \u201cThe parole board was saying, \u2018This prisoner could be released \u2014 but he has to get through drug treatment first,\u2019 \u201d said Madden. \u201cBut we had 1,000 people waiting for drug treatment. The engineer in me was looking at it like lines in a supermarket. Open up more lines! It\u2019s a lot cheaper than keeping people in prison for an extra year.\u201cPublic safety is absolutely first, always,\u201d said Madden. \u201cBut the public\u2019s safer if the guy is no longer using drugs.\u201dThe state now has drug courts, veterans\u2019 courts and mental health courts. \u201cThey are there to provide help, but at the same time, structure,\u201d said Madden, who is retired from the legislature. \u201cYou have a problem and we\u2019re going to help you with your problem.\u201dMany inmates were in prison for technical violations of their probation or parole. Now those violations often bring rapid sanctions and supervision instead of a return to prison.The rate of incarceration in Texas state prisons fell by 17 percent from 2007 to 2015, according to the coalition, and the juvenile incarceration rate fell by nearly three-quarters. Recidivism is dropping steadily. At the same time, the crime rate has dropped by 27 percent.Texas still has much to do. It ranks sixth or seventh in the nation in imprisonment rates. Some 8,900 people are in the state jail system for crimes that are neither violent nor sexual. Many are there for drug charges, but they often can\u2019t get treatment in jail. Thousands of people are sent back to prison each year for technical revocation of parole or probation. As for juveniles, 22,000 are in the adult system, where they are at high risk of sexual assault and suicide.Advertisement"}

Roof, the avowed white supremacist who killed nine black churchgoers in June 2015.The suspect, Benjamin T. S. McDowell, was arrested Wednesday in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm. He is in federal custody pending a detention hearing next week.In an affidavit, Grant Lowe, a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, described Mr. McDowell as a felon who, according to the police in Horry County, had developed ties to white supremacist groups.In December, the affidavit said, Mr. McDowell sent the message, \u201cI love love to act what u think,\u201d and included a link to the website for Temple Emanu-El, a conservative synagogue in Myrtle Beach. (A person who answered the phone at the synagogue declined to comment.)

In their conversations, the affidavit said, Mr. McDowell \u201cindicated he sought a way to conduct an attack on nonwhites without getting caught\u201d and said he wanted to do something on a large scale and write on a building, \u201cIn the spirit of Dylann Roof.\u201dThe affidavit said Mr. McDowell wanted to buy a .40-caliber Glock handgun and hollow-point ammunition. The undercover agent arranged to meet with Mr. McDowell, who agreed to pay $109 for the gun and ammunition. He was arrested soon afterward.A court filing said a public defender had been appointed to represent Mr. McDowell, but messages left with the offices of the federal public defender in Columbia, S.C., and Florence, S.C., were not returned.

I was half-asleep in my Brooklyn apartment and almost didn\u2019t pick up the phone, assuming it was a friend at a bar or a party wanting to meet, when I was in for the night.Not only was it not a social call, it assured that I was not spending the night at home. The message was from Omar Jadwat, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, saying that an Iraqi refugee had been detained at Kennedy Airport. I had contacted him \u2014 maybe even pestered him a little \u2014 several times over the last week about visa holders getting hassled while trying to enter the country, and now it was happening to a man named Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi.Mr. Alshawi\u2019s wife was anxiously waiting for him in Houston. They had heard he was about to be deported.Scrambling at a moment\u2019s notice and being on call 24 hours a day is part of the job. But, though the travel ban was a big deal, it still isn\u2019t every day you call a colleague after midnight, especially when you aren\u2019t really sure if there\u2019s a story yet. At first I was relieved that Houston bureau chief Manny Fernandez was awake until I heard why: He\u2019d had an excrutiatingly long workday just behind him, including a five-hour drive to Laredo and another five hours back. He had only just gotten home at around 11 p.m. his time.Yet without a word of complaint, he went straight back to his car and drove to see Mr. Alshawi\u2019s concerned wife. I ordered a car and headed for the airport to see what I could find out.At first I couldn\u2019t find the lawyers. I walked back and forth, texting Julie Kornfeld from the International Refugee Assistance Project, \u201cWhere are you I\u2019m at door 2.\u201d She wrote back, \u201cWe r near arrivals.\u201d I was so tired, I hadn\u2019t even realized I was looking for them in the departures area.The arrivals hall at Terminal 4 was eerily quiet. There was a woman selling Dunkin Donuts coffee, but the trays in the glass case were bare of food. It would be hours before the doughnuts and muffins arrived. There were a few drowsy passengers. And there was an active if exhausted legal team of three attorneys \u2014 Ms. Kornfeld and Mark Doss from the refugee assistance project and Jonathan E. Polonsky from the law firm Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton \u2014 as well as a CUNY law student, Katy Naples-Mitchell.A number of Customs and Border Protection agents eyed the lawyers and the journalist observing them carefully. \u201cA new day has dawned,\u201d one of the officers said under his breath as he and a partner went to get coffee.\u201cOver my head,\u201d the other said, demonstrating with a wave of the hand above his head.It turned out that there were at least two Iraqis being held, both of whom were already flying across the ocean when Mr. Trump signed the order. The officials there refused to allow the three attorneys into the detention area to see their clients.Mr. Polonsky told me that his client, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, had seen his wife and children make it through, but the officers stopped him, separating the family. He said that Mr. Darweesh had worked with the United States for a decade, including by fighting alongside the 101st Airborne while acting as an interpreter. I read, in his file, glowing letters of recommendation from soldiers and diplomats that described his hard work on behalf of the United States, and I knew there was a story.Meanwhile, using the address I received from the lawyers, Mr. Fernandez found the wife of the first detainee, Mr. Alshawi, whose relatives had worked with the United States government in Iraq. She told him how their son was asleep in the house; the boy neither knew that his father had made it to the United States nor that he might be sent back without ever leaving the airport.As we waited I asked Mr. Doss what they were doing on their computers and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing the facts of a habeas petition.\u201d I had to dig back into my memory a little to civics class in high school: a writ of habeas corpus, literally \u201cYou may have the body\u201d in Latin, a petition to free someone who had been unlawfully detained. \u201cThis will be the first legal challenge to the executive order,\u201d he added.\u201cCan I see that when you file it?\u201d I asked him. You can feel like a pest at moment\u2019s like that, but the fear that you could miss out on a story outweighs a moment of embarrassment.\u201cIt\u2019s a public document at that point,\u201d he answered with a shrug.Behind the scenes, lawyers from the National Immigration Law Center, the Yale Law School\u2019s Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization, the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as IRAP and Kilpatrick Townsend had been writing a series of petitions on behalf of Mr. Darweesh, Mr. Alshawi and all the unknown detainees in custody, or as it would come to be known \u201cDarweesh v. Trump.\u201dThe little pieces began to coalesce: an officer telling Mr. Doss to \u201cCall Mr. Trump;\u201d the separated families; Mr. Darweesh\u2019s work with the 101st Airborne; and the emotional scene in Houston. It never feels like you have anything, and then the little fragments come together and form a picture clearer than you had ever expected.By 8:17 a.m., the legal challenges had been filed, the airport had begun to fill up, there were Boston cream donuts for sale and, after seven hours of reporting, we had a story. I hadn\u2019t pulled an all-nighter since a suicidal pilot had crashed a Germanwings passenger jet into the French Alps nearly two years ago, but the adrenaline of the story had me wide awake.An editor told me we were putting out a news alert. The realization that a headline would flash across millions of phone screens felt a little like a modern version of \u201cstop the presses.\u201d In just 17 words, we incorporated the detention of refugees, the president\u2019s ban and the legal action against it. I watched the article pinball around Twitter faster than I had ever imagined.Within a couple of hours, two members of Congress, Representatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, had arrived, demanding to see the people in detention. They learned that at least a dozen individuals were being held. The first protestors had started showing up for what grew to be an enormous, clamorous demonstration, with people shivering in the January cold but chanting, \u201cBuild a wall, we\u2019ll tear it down\u201d as they played trumpets, drums and even banged on pots and pans.A visibly shaken Mr. Darweesh emerged into the airport. As he described his ordeal to the immigration lawyers and a few journalists, he choked up, remembering being handcuffed by representatives of the same country he had fought to help. \u201cThis is America,\u201d he said, pointing to the lawyers and politicians who had worked for his release, in an emotional statement broadcast repeatedly on news reports that night.We did not know it yet but Mr. Alshawi would be let out that evening, not long before a judge ruled on the historic petition with both of their names on the top, blocking part of the president\u2019s actions and preventing the government from deporting some of the arrivals.Halfway across the country, I spoke with Manny. I told him I\u2019d been working on a bench in front of a Dunkin Donuts kiosk. He told me he was working at an IHOP. \u201cI think you got the better end of that deal,\u201d I said.I spent 19 hours at that airport in all, typing on my Mac laptop, tethering my iPhone to it for a Wi-Fi signal, checking Twitter and sending encrypted messages. I even broadcast a Facebook Live video. But the main tools I used were three pens, a notebook and a lot of questions. Those guys who yelled \u201cstop the presses\u201d would have gotten the gist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "These \u201980s Artists Are More Important Than Ever", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImages and technological media now pervade every minute of our lives so thoroughly that much of what passes for reality is indistinguishable from its representation. The urban environment is a cloaca of hypnotic, animated signage, sounds and image streams that follow us into taxicabs and hospital waiting rooms, and in turn, any banality, from a misspelled street sign to a funny advertisement, is considered suitable to become an image on social media.This didn\u2019t happen overnight. One of the least helpful clich\u00e9s of recent years has been the declaration that some phenomenon or person is \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d; the presumption that history is headed, with occasional setbacks, toward a much-improved, even utopian state of things could only be endorsed by someone unfamiliar with history. Mistaking the perfection of our devices for the perfection of ourselves relieves us of responsibility for what happens to the world: It will just naturally turn out O.K., sooner or later. But technology can easily outrun our comprehension of what it does to us, even while it incarnates our wishes, fears and pathologies. (What could be more pathological than a nuclear weapon?)Our present bedazzlement-by-pixels was anticipated by a loosely affiliated group of artists who emerged in New York in the mid-1970s and early \u201980s \u2014 before iPhones, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. \u201cThe Pictures Generation\u201d has become a ubiquitous, awkward catchall term, probably abrasive to the artists themselves, for something that was less an organized movement than a heterogeneous expression of a zeitgeist. Their art was connected by an interest in examining power and identity in a media-saturated, politically uncertain age. The name derives from a 1977 show at Artists Space curated by Douglas Crimp, simply called \u201cPictures,\u201d where five of these artists \u2014 Troy Brauntuch, Jack Goldstein, Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo and Philip Smith \u2014 were featured. A survey exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum a few years ago folded in another 25.Some of the artists that carry the Pictures Generation label are well-known to the general public, such as Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, David Salle and Cindy Sherman; many have achieved canonical status in the art world, with their work featured at multiple venues throughout any given year, all over the world. A few, such as Walter Robinson and Troy Brauntuch, are only now starting to get long-overdue recognition. A number of them, like Louise Lawler, the subject of a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York this spring, have re-entered public consciousness at a moment that is oddly similar to the one in which they first appeared. The questions they all first addressed in a faraway, predigital period may be even more relevant today than they were then.The Pictures artists, so-called, were born in Cold War America, during the schizoid cultural meshing of unparalleled national prosperity with the daily threat of looming nuclear annihilation. They grew up with Hollywood movies, low-def network television and ad-heavy pictorial magazines like Look and Life as the audiovisual wallpaper of their childhoods, mostly in American suburbs.16 PhotosThe initially black-and-white, then gradually colorized media world they absorbed trafficked heavily in prescriptions for living: heterosexual families with gleaming teeth in an all-white America; unambiguous gender stereotypes; dream homes in tidy neighborhoods; knee-jerk patriotism; holidays made sparkling with margarine; and an ever-expanding, ever-better smorgasbord of branded consumer products including cars, watches, cigarettes and anything else that could plausibly enhance a quotidian middle-class lifestyle.As the dreary conformity of America during the Eisenhower years loosened dramatically in the \u201960s, mass media got more sophisticated at manipulating public moods and private consciousness. Families that had prospered in the \u201950s passed enormous buying power to their offspring, who became a lively demographic for a brilliantly adaptive advertising industry, a juggernaut that could selectively appeal to bikers, hippies, African-Americans, feminists, student protesters and bohemian types as readily as it did its traditional suburban targets.Despite the political violence and social atomization of the \u201960s, the sense of a stable country still on the rise was sustained, for the most part, by a general belief in the solidity of its institutions, including the media. This optimism lost much of its credibility as the \u201960s counterculture fizzled into paranoia and bleakness during the Nixon years. American failure no longer felt impossible. The Pictures artists came of age in this disillusioning period, sharply aware that the images and narratives they\u2019d been nurtured on were not only bogus but insidiously coercive. They were reflective people who read widely, wrote well and could easily articulate their concerns, well-versed in the deconstructive approach to texts and images of theorists like Jean Baudrillard and Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes\u2019s deflation of authorship and originality, Laura Mulvey\u2019s groundbreaking writings on the male gaze in cinema and Conceptual art\u2019s distillation of the artwork to its self-conscious, philosophically pointed idea. They were intellectuals as well as artists, a disfavored combination throughout most of American art history: Artists weren\u2019t supposed to think about the implications of what they were doing, or the overall context in which it appeared.Pop Art made the art world desirable to the general public, but this admiration constricted during the \u201960s, with the ascendant asceticism of Conceptual art and Minimalism, which called into question the whole idea of art as something to look at. The Pictures artists initially had to contend with a small nexus of established galleries unwelcoming to new work, and a presiding narrative about \u201cadvanced art\u201d that inevitably led to the disappearance of art objects. They were too fastidious, and too smart, to discard the poise and economy of Conceptualism in favor of some inchoate, spontaneous \u201cself-expression\u201d \u2014 the construction of the self, after all, was one of the things they were pondering.So they experimented, showing early work in alternative spaces, which were rapidly losing funding. Providentially, the commercial rise of painting at the end of the \u201970s brought serious revenue back to the art world, and with it a number of new galleries receptive to emerging artists \u2014 like Metro Pictures, where many of these artists got their start. For the first time ever, young New York artists could hope to earn serious money by making art. The work they produced in the \u201970s and early \u201980s might be described as a theatricalization of Conceptual art, or a caustic mimicry of both fine art and commercial illustration.17 PhotosPerhaps because photographs are already \u201ccopies\u201d of what they picture, and because photography was barely considered art at the time, so many of the Pictures artists found it the most congenial medium for what they wanted to do: to point at things already in the world, and make what they implicitly signified apparent.Photographs could be staged to emphasize the look of artfully subtle, unremarked female stereotypes in movies (Cindy Sherman), or to picture toy housewives in miniature home interiors, evoking the pathos of domestic imprisonment (Laurie Simmons). Photos could be excavated from the morgues of bygone magazines and science journals, blown up and bannered with jarring, sardonic captions (Barbara Kruger). Images could be scissored out of National Geographic and Vogue, and repatriated to blocks of strident primary colors, where their fetishistic weirdness became hilariously disturbing (Sarah Charlesworth). A photo could present art in the settings it occupies after it\u2019s sold, on walls of rich collectors, corporate offices and other privileged venues \u2014 today, typically, a billionaire\u2019s storage facility (Louise Lawler).Not everyone made photographic works, but all were engaged in photo-derived imagery. Robert Longo\u2019s large-scale charcoal-and-graphite drawings of \u201cMen in the Cities\u201d were sourced from photographs of the artist\u2019s friends and are key icons of the period; the remarkable painters in this group (Thomas Lawson, Walter Robinson, David Salle and Michael Zwack, to cite a few) found powerful ways to provoke questions about how we process representations of reality, in which contexts, with what quality of attention.The use of existing images, which might be altered in scale, cropped, rephotographed, angled or simply presented in copied form \u2014 \u201cappropriation,\u201d as practiced by Richard Prince and Sherrie Levine, among others \u2014 inspired indignant critical sniping from writers like Robert Hughes. Yet it had a perfectly respectable lineage in art history. These pictures revealed how contrived, unnatural and seductive the originals actually were. They attracted and repelled simultaneously. Such works created a nervous sense of how representation operates in the everyday world \u2014 almost subliminally much of the time, tapping into myths and illusions sunk deep in our brains, influencing the way we act, how we dress, behave in public, occupy space, choose and attract sexual partners, spend money, make friends and enemies.But above all else, the Pictures artists addressed power, especially patriarchal power, at its quotidian level of social engineering, as well as in its grip on art history. If we are to think of the Pictures Generation as an art movement, then it was the first one in history that included a substantial number of women artists. Much of the early resistance to it was flagrantly misogynistic, though its male artists came in for their own share of ridicule from newspaper and magazine critics, whose favorite dismissive word for this art was \u201cbrainy.\u201dWhen it first appeared, in a predigital world, Pictures art looked imperiously distanced from its subject matter, detached from its own japeries and even merciless in its view of American life\u2019s visual detritus and empty glorification of the arbitrary. But a backward glance at these artists reveals plangent nostalgia for innocent first encounters with a visual culture that proved far from innocent. It\u2019s no accident that we are giving these artists a careful second look now. Whatever progressiveness was afforded by the Obama era has come full circle to an isolationist longing where an unpredictable celebrity president speaks directly to an electorate that is collectively backlit by technology\u2019s artificial glow. The emotional resonance of the Pictures Generation has accrued over time, strengthened by its curious suitability to the present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg, Bucking Tide, Takes Public Stand Against Isolationism", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Thursday stepped into the raging debate about globalization.He pledged that he would push Facebook, which has more than 1.8 billion users worldwide, in a direction that would help convince individuals and governments that \u201cprogress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.\u201dThe letter comes close to a political statement by a chief executive who, as the leader of a global company, is essentially arguing against a tide of isolationism that is rising across the world.In an interview this week at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Mr. Zuckerberg said that when he started Facebook, \u201cthe idea of connecting the world was not controversial.\u201d\u201cThe default assumption was that the world was just incrementally moving in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s actually a real question.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg released his missive amid a fierce debate over the merits of globalization. In the United States, President Trump has displayed a deep streak of nationalism. Last year, Britain voted to quit the European Union. Those moves and others have been taken as signs of how globalization has caused strains \u2014 making it more difficult for companies to navigate a new world order.Mr. Zuckerberg said his reasons for writing the updated letter began to take shape before last year\u2019s presidential election, spurred by broader trends. He said he recognized that more people were feeling left behind by globalization, and by societal and technological changes. As a result, he wanted to focus different parts of Facebook in a way that helped people better come together.\u201cWe have to build a global community that works for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t have much doubt that this is the right direction to go in the long term.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said he planned to reorient Facebook, which turned 13 this month, around these new realities. His letter is filled with abstract ideas, including the notion of \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d and how to create stronger online communities, with few detailed steps about how to realize those goals.One top priority is building inclusive online communities that are supportive, safe and informed environments, to help strengthen bonds in the offline world as well. Mr. Zuckerberg also stressed the idea of using Facebook to create this \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d \u2014 essentially a digital means of connecting people around shared interests \u2014 mirroring social groups in the physical world like churches, governments and unions. That may encourage connections among people that transcend national and international barriers, he said.While Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned several concrete steps that Facebook has taken toward some of these goals, he gave few other specifics. He did not address how his vision might conflict with those of political leaders around the world, nor did he mention how emphasizing global connections benefited Facebook\u2019s finances.Getting to this point did not come easily. Since going public, Facebook has been on a growth tear, becoming one of the world\u2019s biggest and most valuable public entities.Facebook users disagreed, arguing that the photograph was not titillating but rather illustrated the perils of modern warfare. The social network eventually allowed the image to be posted on its site, noting that it had inherent news value.Mr. Zuckerberg said the episode made him realize how ineffective Facebook\u2019s content policy was at a global scale, given that cultural norms vary greatly by country. He said Facebook needed to get to a place in which users could perhaps choose their own content policies based on local laws and preferences, a marked departure from the company\u2019s blanket global approach of the past decade or more.\u201cI don\u2019t think that we, sitting here in California, are best positioned to know what the norms in communities around the world should be,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cAt some point, you just need a more dynamic system where people can just express that themselves.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg spent much of his letter focused on the importance of personal relationships. He pointed to \u201cvery meaningful groups\u201d \u2014 Facebook groups that people frequently engage in and return to \u2014 that are often centered on topics like parenting, sports or other shared interests. When people find an interest they are passionate about and form such a group, they are some of the most tightly connected relationships on Facebook, he said.To foster more of these groups in a safe way, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook needed to change some of the ways that it operated. That includes improving community safety with product updates similar to Facebook\u2019s \u201csafety check,\u201d a tool that lets people mark themselves safe during catastrophes. Mr. Zuckerberg said that governments regularly called Facebook to confirm that Safety Check was activated during crises like the massacre at a nightclub in Florida last year.Mr. Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook\u2019s role in keeping communities well-informed, which will necessitate tackling misinformation and highly polarized news. He alluded to Facebook\u2019s shifting role as a distributor of news, saying the social network is \u201cnot just technology or media.\u201dFacebook\u2019s goal, Mr. Zuckerberg said, was not to usurp traditional institutions like governments, religious groups and other communities that share interests. (When asked if he wanted to run for president of the United States, he laughed and declined.) Instead, he said, creating tightly knit online groups would make these traditional institutions stronger.It also would not hurt that such groups and connections could well make Facebook more essential to people, which in turn may increase the company\u2019s profits.\u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built to deal with modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cI just think it would be good if more people thought about things like this.\u201dAn article on Friday about an update to Facebook\u2019s mission statement misstated, in some copies, the location of a nightclub massacre last year. It was in Florida, not Paris. (A nightclub massacre in Paris occurred in 2015.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Billionaire\u2019s Party Is a Lens on Wealth in the Trump Era", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookSo, Stephen A. Schwarzman had another birthday party.The celebration for his 70th birthday at his Palm Beach, Fla., home over the weekend included live camels, trapeze artists and a performance by Gwen Stefani. Some reports speculated the party cost as much as $20 million, a price tag that insiders say is ridiculously inflated, but clearly the event fell in the category of over-the-top expensive.Normally, a birthday party for a boldface name wouldn\u2019t warrant a sentence outside the gossip pages. But Mr. Schwarzman is the billionaire co-founder of the Blackstone Group as well as President Trump\u2019s latest BFF as the chairman of the president\u2019s strategic policy forum \u2014 and his last birthday bash turned into a cultural flash point.You might recall that, a decade ago, Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s 60th birthday party \u2014 reportedly for some $5 million at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan \u2014 spun into a yearslong existential crisis on Wall Street about the evils of conspicuous consumption.Oh, how times have changed.The collective yawn may say something larger about the shifts in the way parts of the country think about great wealth \u2014 and perhaps how they have always thought about big money.Mr. Trump\u2019s election and the nominations of his cabinet of billionaires may draw ire from his critics, but the people who elected him \u2014 who draw largely from the middle and lower classes \u2014 appear nonplused by his, and other people\u2019s, showy displays of wealth. Indeed, judging by various polls, much of the country aspires to live like Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Trump.While Mr. Trump himself did not attend the party, his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, did. So did others from the administration, including Elaine L. Chao, the transportation secretary; Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Wilbur Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary. Other guests included everyone from the prominent financier Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the fashion designer Donatella Versace to Susan George, executive director of the Inner-City Scholarship Fund in New York.People who were there said that the tennis courts had been covered with Asian-themed staging, and that Mr. Schwarzman was presented an oversize cake that looked like an Asian temple. But even a generous tally of all the most lavish components couldn\u2019t get you anywhere within shouting distance of $20 million: Even if, theoretically, Gwen Stefani had charged the $1 million that Rod Stewart was said to have charged at Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s 60th (and she didn\u2019t; the figure was substantially lower), it would take 20 of her to get to that price tag.A friend of Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s said that one of the lessons from the 60th birthday\u2019s blowback was he was never going to satisfy his critics, and that he had to live his life on his own terms. At age 70, said the friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to express candid views, Mr. Schwarzman has given a lot back and does not need to placate everyone.In truth, Mr. Schwarzman has become perhaps the most successful financier on Wall Street over the past decade, growing Blackstone to become the pre-eminent asset manager in the country, pulling far ahead of his private-equity rivals and turning his firm into one of the largest real estate investors in the world. And his generosity has extended to several nine-figure donations \u2014 that\u2019s more than $100 million each \u2014 to Yale, the New York Public Library and a scholarship program modeled after the Rhodes for students from the United States to attend Tsinghua University in China.Last week, responding to scholarship recipients\u2019 criticism over his decision to help Mr. Trump, Mr. Schwarzman wrote in a letter: \u201cI regret that some scholars have reservations about my following this approach with the new administration in Washington. In life, you\u2019ll often find that having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice.\u201dThe populist, anti-Wall Street sentiment that was so loud after the financial crisis found its voice last year in the campaign of Bernie Sanders \u2014 and to some degree, ironically, in Mr. Trump\u2019s. Whatever animus exists against fat cats has been muted among Mr. Trump\u2019s red-state voters, at least temporarily, as long as he follows though on his promise to create jobs. It\u2019s a point that many of us in the media \u2014 myself included \u2014 largely missed.Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election may speak volumes about how large parts of the country view big business today, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to lower taxes and deregulate parts of Wall Street. And Mr. Schwarzman is at the center of many of those efforts.At the time, much of the media was regularly reporting on income inequality, the widening gulf between the rich and poor.The NPR article was based on the results of a survey by the Pew Research Center that bear repeating: They showed \u201ca significant shift in public perceptions of class conflict in American life,\u201d but \u201cthey do not necessarily signal an increase in grievances toward the wealthy.\u201dMaybe that explains it. Or perhaps everyone who criticized Mr. Schwarzman a decade ago is now just too busy focusing on Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "During Breaks in Super Bowl, Advertisers Enter Political Debate", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBudweiser had a simple, noncontroversial idea for its 2017 Super Bowl ad.The label, owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev, wanted to show itself as a \u201cchampion of the American dream,\u201d said Ricardo Marques, a vice president at Budweiser.That was last May. Several months later, Mr. Marques said, the company landed on the idea of telling a heartfelt story about its founder. It then spent months gathering feedback before shooting the spot in early January.Budweiser could not have foreseen the roiling sociopolitical debate that would be unfolding when the ad aired, shortly after President Trump moved to sharply limit immigration. Nor could it anticipate the viral effect of the spot, which showed Adolphus Busch\u2019s journey to the United States from Germany in the 1850s and the discrimination he overcame on his way to success.\u201cThis was not something we came up with at the last minute to make any sort of political statement,\u201d Mr. Marques said.

{"Headline": "YouTube\u2019s Monster: PewDiePie and His Populist Revolt", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookFelix Kjellberg, known to his fans as PewDiePie, is by far YouTube\u2019s biggest star. His videos, a mix of video-game narration, humorous rants and commentary, have cumulatively been viewed billions of times, and more than 53 million people subscribe to his channel. He has been called \u201cthe king of YouTube\u201d and countless variations thereon, and he has remained unchallenged on that perch for years, making millions of dollars and leveraging his popularity into outside ventures.It\u2019s tempting to write off this scandal as an inscrutable product of a teen subculture, wrapped up in layers of irony and the peculiar language and aesthetics of YouTube. It is likewise easy to frame the episode as an isolated collision between offensive speech and careful sponsors. But it\u2019s most useful to understand Kjellberg\u2019s meltdown in the context of the vast platform on which it took place \u2014 YouTube \u2014 and the nascent strains of politics that could come to define it.With more than a billion users, YouTube has become not merely a platform but almost a kind of internet nation-state: the host of a gigantic economy and a set of cultures governed by a new and novel sort of corporation, sometimes at arm\u2019s length and other times up close. It\u2019s a system Kjellberg has spent recent months antagonizing in a broader and less-inflammatory way, even as he continued to thrive within it. He bemoaned its structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube\u2019s very own populist reactionary.For product reviewers and gamers, for the unboxers and the how-to teachers, for the interchannel drama analysts, the bloggers, the makeup artists and the pranksters, YouTube looms large not just as a context but also as a character. The daily exigencies of life on YouTube are perhaps the only subject that cuts across every major YouTube category. Showbiz loves to make movies about showbiz, and television loves to make television about TV. YouTube has simply democratized this impulse.It makes sense that YouTube would become home to such a performatively self-aware economy. It is, after all, one of the most mature of the major social platforms. It is extremely culturally productive, and can claim genuine stars as its own. Above all, it pays. And in the people who depend on the platform to pay their bills, it inspires a peculiar mixture of paranoia, desire, gratefulness and disdain that shows up clearly in their work. YouTube\u2019s peculiar relationship with the economy within it is fraught, promising and poorly understood. It\u2019s also unique among social-media platforms \u2014 but maybe not for much longer. For now, most of the biggest internet platforms are understood as venues for communication, expression and consumption. YouTube has given us a glimpse at what happens when users start associating social platforms with something more: livelihoods.Watch enough YouTube programming on any subject and you\u2019ll gradually come to understand the struggles of starting and maintaining a channel. You\u2019ll become familiar with the mementos Google sends creators at subscriber milestones \u2014 a silver \u201cplay\u201d button at 100,000, around which time your favorite YouTubers might start talking about quitting their day jobs, and a gold one at a million, when they are more to likely have done so. You\u2019ll hear plenty about conversations with YouTube support, many of which contradict one another. You\u2019ll develop opinions about YouTube\u2019s copyright rules, age restrictions and advertising policies. You\u2019ll get an intuitive sense of the YouTube attention marketplace and how people try to take advantage of it, and you\u2019ll hear about advertising rates. You\u2019ll hear conspiracy theories \u2014 some rooted in daily shared YouTube experience, others rooted in less visible fears, desires and resentments \u2014 some of which gain considerable traction.And why shouldn\u2019t you? YouTubers are not employed by YouTube, but they are paid by YouTube, because it matches their videos, automatically, with advertisers. The platform and the video-makers share a clear and common goal: to persuade audiences to watch more videos in order to make more money from ads. But even with a unifying cause, creators inevitably discover smaller ways in which their goals and YouTube\u2019s are at odds. It is in YouTube creators\u2019 interest, for example, to understand the best practices for getting the most YouTube subscribers, or the best strategies for making videos that YouTube might algorithmically recommend. But it is in YouTube\u2019s interest for the inner workings of its platform \u2014 including recommendation algorithms, the way it calculates advertising rates and the precise locations of its boundaries \u2014 to remain at least somewhat secret, to prevent creators from gaming the platform\u2019s quirks at the expense of either YouTube\u2019s user experience or its bottom line. Criticism from its creators is one of the many things YouTube tolerates to maintain this arrangement, which is otherwise clearly working to their benefit.Emergent politics of social platforms differ in scope and character and sit along peculiar axes, some familiar, others new. On Twitter, which does not pay popular users, they revolve around matters of speech and harassment; the platform hosts a range of progressive movements as well as an extremely visible and openly racist reactionary movement, and they have been at war. On Facebook, which is bigger and less combative, they focus on censorship and governance. But on any major platform, they tend to grow from the same fertile place: the gap between the structures built by the company and what users are allowed to do within them. Inevitably, this leads users to fundamental political questions: Who gets what, and why? Who gets to do what, and why?Here, again, it is helpful to situate Kjellberg properly. He initially rose to popularity within the video-gaming subculture, which, beginning with the \u201cGamerGate\u201d movement and continuing through the American presidential election, became surprisingly and darkly politicized. His core audience is young, and his sensibility clearly appeals to a masculine teenage impulse to shock and provoke. The YouTube platform plainly incentivizes such attention-grabbing behavior, right up until the point that it becomes a liability to its operators or their other partners \u2014 a familiar dilemma in the entertainment world, sure, but one that plays out quite differently on YouTube, which is considerably and deliberately less hands-on with its talent. It\u2019s telling that YouTube\u2019s biggest star portrayed the platform as distant and capricious. It\u2019s alarming that following his performative hostility led him to where it did: attempting to rationalize the use of anti-Semitic speech under the guise of transgression.Maker Studios, which seeks to create a sort of auxiliary production apparatus for YouTube, has less of a connection to the platform than any of the YouTubers it has partnered with, who belong much more to their audiences, and to YouTube. Its severing of ties, in the bigger context of YouTube, amounts to a disavowal. YouTube\u2019s reaction, and how it follows up, is the thing to watch. As, of course, is Kjellberg\u2019s. His most recent video, posted after Maker Studios and Google made their announcements, was a lighthearted play-through of a gag video game called \u201cGenital Jousting,\u201d and did not reference the scandal. His commenters, on the other hand, did, asking almost uniformly that he not apologize for anything.The full character of the burgeoning politics of platforms remains to be seen. But right-wing movements have found early traction and see opportunity. Even as farce, Kjellberg\u2019s performance has been illustrative, and a small number of eager observers say they hope that, as backlash mounts, it will be galvanizing. \u201cIf Pewdiepie wasn\u2019t #AltRight before,\u201d Vox Day, a former video-game designer and an alt-right leader posted on Gab.ai, a private, Twitterlike service popular with the movement, \u201che is now.\u201dJohn Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

The rebels called themselves the Suleiman Soldiers.The man whom prosecutors identified as Mr. Sakhanh was wearing a neat brown jacket and appeared to be joking around. He was holding a Kalashnikov rifle, with which he shot a man at his feet.\u201cWe also found information on YouTube and Facebook that specified the time and place where they were captured,\u201d Mr. Attorp said. \u201cWe were able to show how little time passed between the capture and execution of the prisoners. Some of the information was posted by the Suleiman Soldiers themselves. There was only 41 hours between their being taken captive in one location and brought to another village and executed. There wasn\u2019t any form of quasi-judicial procedure or due process. And that\u2019s why they found him guilty.\u201dMaurizio Romanelli, the prosecutor in Milan, who oversaw an investigation after Mr. Sakhanh took part in an attack on Syrians living in the Lombardy region of Italy, said there had been a productive collaboration between the Swedish and Italian authorities.\u201cThe trial took place and what\u2019s important is the result,\u201d Mr. Romanelli said on Thursday.Mr. Sakhanh\u2019s defense lawyer, Thomas Olsson, argued that the captured prisoners had been convicted of rape and murder after a fair trial \u2014 regardless of the circumstances.In a news release issued by the Stockholm District Court, the judge, Tomas Zander, said that an important question during the five-day trial, which ended Jan. 23, was whether a nonstate actor \u2014 in this case, the rebels \u2014 could establish its own courts to uphold law and order within the context of a civil war, as opposed to an international conflict.The court concluded that a nonstate actor might be able to establish a legitimate court in some circumstances, but not this one.\u201cThe soldiers were executed less than two days after they were captured,\u201d Judge Zander said. \u201cFor that reason, the court ruled it was not possible that the executions were preceded by a fair trial in which a legitimate court sentenced the soldiers to death.\u201dHe added: \u201cSeven people were executed in a particularly cruel manner where the victims were forced to bend down on their knees, with their hands tied behind their backs. The victims showed signs of torture and were unable to defend themselves. Therefore, the defendant is found guilty of serious crimes against international law.\u201dMr. Olsson, the defense lawyer, said in a phone interview that the verdict demonstrated the problems of trying a case like this in a Swedish court.\u201cThe district court accepted our argument that a nonstate actor in an armed conflict may establish courts,\u201d Mr. Olsson said. \u201cBut they said there have been major gaps in the proceedings. The difficulty in that argument is that nobody knows what happened before the executions. The distance and the fact that it is in a different country makes it impossible to investigate a case.\u201dMr. Olsson added: \u201cYou can\u2019t investigate the crime scenes. You can\u2019t bring out witnesses, interview people. When the court is criticizing the procedure, they criticize something that nobody knows anything about.\u201dHe said that Mr. Sakhanh planned to file an appeal.

{"Headline": "Bookstores Stoke Trump Resistance With Action, Not Just Words", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA hundred people packed a bookstore in Brooklyn to write postcards to elected officials and, as the invitation urged, \u201cplot next steps.\u201d In St. Louis, bookstore owners began planning a writer-studded event to benefit area refugees. At a bookshop in Massachusetts, a manager privately asked his senior staff members how the store should respond to the Trump presidency.\u201cGo hard,\u201d they told him.In the diffuse and suddenly fierce protest movement that has sprung up on the left since President Trump took office, bookstores have entered the fray, taking on roles ranging from meeting place to political war room.All over the country, independent bookstores have filled their windows and displays with \u201c1984,\u201d by George Orwell; \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here,\u201d by Sinclair Lewis; and other books on politics, fascism, totalitarianism and social justice.

How high can we turn up the heat?\u2019\u201dSome stores, including large chains like Barnes & Noble, with customers from across the spectrum, have steered away from the political realm. Some stores say they have worked to keep the latest book displays balanced \u2014 with titles from the left and the right.\u201cMy taste comes into play,\u201d said Cathy Langer, the director of buying for the Tattered Cover in Denver, \u201cbut my politics do not, ever.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s raise our voices together and let the incoming administration know that they do not speak for us,\u201d the store wrote to customers in an email before the rally.Political organizing is perhaps a natural extension of what bookstores have done for centuries: foster discussion, provide access to history and literature, host writers and intellectuals.\u201cAll bookstores are mission-driven to some degree \u2014 their mission is to inspire and inform, and educate if possible,\u201d said Elaine Katzenberger, publisher and executive director of City Lights in San Francisco, a store with a long history of left-wing activism.\u201cWhen Trump was elected, everyone was just walking around saying: \u2018What do I do. What do we do?\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cOne of the places you might find some answers is in books, in histories, in current events, even poetry.\u201dFor many booksellers, the urge to join a protest movement is new. Several who were interviewed said they had never before tried to mobilize their customers politically; many are, for the first time, making their own political views crystal clear.\u201cThis is just one of the places where people went,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were gutted from the election, people just came in to pet the books.\u201d\u201cI think bookstores are a place where people go to understand the world,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re just one of many places that will become a center of activism.\u201dGayle Shanks, a co-owner of Changing Hands in Phoenix, said her store\u2019s Facebook page had gone political, as staff members filled it with articles about national politics and First Amendment issues. At the suggestion of one of her young employees, staff members began piecing together a display of books written by authors from the seven majority-Muslim countries from which Mr. Trump suspended immigration.More than 50 recipients wrote back with praise, thanking her for airing her views. One man did not. \u201cShut up and sell books,\u201d he wrote.And some stores have been more muted, conscious of alienating more conservative customers.\u201cA lot of bookstores kind of want to be everything to all people,\u201d said Josh Christie, an owner of Print, a bookstore in Portland, Me. \u201cThey want to be apolitical and carry everything from every viewpoint.

{"Headline": "A Low-Tech Guide to Becoming More Politically Active", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 No matter which political party you belong to, one thing is clear: Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency has galvanized political activism to a level of passion not seen since the civil rights movement.Far less clear is what you can do in reaction to the Trump administration\u2019s changes.And in an era that promises instant gratification \u2014 like cars, couriers and food summoned to your driveway with the tap of a smartphone app \u2014 you might think tech is a quick and easy solution to becoming a political activist. But it turns out software and web tools can go only so far.At best, tech is an excellent resource for staying on top of political activities. But at some point, you will have to go outside or pick up the phone and engage with people, like fellow citizens and members of Congress.But what else can you do besides following news and events on Twitter and Facebook? What follows is a guide to some of the most useful resources and tools I uncovered after interviews with tech-skilled activists.The first challenge to getting more politically active is filtering out the torrent of political news to understand what you should care about.Another approach is following the legislation you care about. Mr. Tauberer\u2019s tool, GovTrack.us, lets you share your location, select an issue and view the bills that have been introduced.For example, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California introduced a bill to nullify the effect of the executive order on immigration. The site says there is a 7 percent chance of the bill being enacted. You could then contact Ms. Feinstein\u2019s office to say you support or oppose her bill.For example, if you live in Dallas and disagree with President Trump\u2019s nominations, the site instructs you to call Senator John Cornyn and say, \u201cHi, I\u2019m a resident of Dallas and I would like Senator Cornyn to vote against President Trump\u2019s nominations for his cabinet.\u201dYou will only get so far working alone. At some point, joining a group will help you coordinate broader actions like protests or coordinated phone calls.Where to find one? That will depend on your political beliefs: You will have to ask around or search social networks like Meetup.com, a site to find local events and people who share your interests.Some unique forms of activism can emerge from working with a team. Lea Yu, an organizer for Tech Workers Coalition, said she met fellow activists at a contest in December in which people were asked to make tech tools for political activism.\u201cA single, lonesome tweet doesn\u2019t get a consumer very far if they want a company to take a stand,\u201d Ms. Yu said. \u201cBut when hundreds of tweets are coordinated, you see companies like Visa and Uber becoming very responsive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Canada Transforms, an Anti-Immigrant Fringe Stirs", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Deschamps stepped out of his apartment building in the Limoilou neighborhood of Quebec City recently and stopped when he saw a sticker wrapped around a light pole.\u201cBurn Your Local Mosque,\u201d it read, around a silhouette of a Turkish-style mosque against an orange flame. He snapped a cellphone photo and added it to his collection of anti-Muslim propaganda popping up around the city.That rapid transformation is stirring the most conservative elements of the white Canadian population, who see the country as their own, despite the fact that Europeans took the land from a patchwork of indigenous peoples who had long existed there.Few people believe that this stirring, which is moderate by United States standards, contributed directly the shooting Sunday inside Quebec City\u2019s largest mosque, in which six worshipers were killed and eight injured. And no evidence yet has emerged that the accused assailant, a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois university student, had ties to specific groups. But the attack has put many on guard that Canada\u2019s embrace of Muslim immigration is raising tensions. Even the most radical groups seem to sense that expressing extreme views can be dangerous.There are at least 100 right-wing extremist groups in Canada, according to two Canadian studies published last year, with most of them active in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia.While their targets include gays and lesbians, Jews and other minorities, Muslims have faced a sizable amount of the hostility. In 2014, the last year for which statistics are available, Canadian police forces recorded 99 religiously motivated hate crimes against Muslims \u2014 up from 45 in 2012, according to Statistics Canada.Some critics have blamed Donald J. Trump\u2019s nationalistic language, but right-wing extremism has long thrived in Canada among skinheads, white supremacists and others, said Barbara Perry, a global hate crime expert at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Oshawa, Ontario, and the lead author of a report published last year in the journal Studies in Conflict & Terrorism.\u201cA lot of that sentiment has been there,\u201d said Ms. Perry, who said the internet has helped spread the ideology.Canada has witnessed a flurry of nationalist groups proliferating in recent years, including the Soldiers of Odin, a white nationalist group that began in Finland. While the Canadian group has denied racist beliefs and members have participated in community foot patrols in cities like Edmonton and Vancouver, its main Canada Facebook page has anti-Muslim screeds and derogatory references to immigrants.The Canadian authorities have recorded thousands of hate-motivated crimes in recent years, but Ms. Perry said Canadian law enforcement officials have played down the threat of right-wing extremists, preferring instead to focus on Islamic terrorism. \u201cThat\u2019s where all the money and attention goes,\u201d she said. \u201cLaw enforcement officers in communities with a fairly well known right-wing presence, they either denied they were there or that it was an issue.\u201dThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service declined to comment on actions they have taken to monitor and stop the spread of white nationalist groups, though the intelligence service has in the past minimized the movement\u2019s influence, telling the Canadian news media that \u201cright-wing extremist circles appear to be fragmented and primarily pose a threat to public order and not to national security.\u201dAnti-racism activists and others opposed to such views say the government has not done enough to protect vulnerable groups. In 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s government repealed hate speech provisions in the Canadian Human Rights Act, which supporters said hindered free speech. A federal court ruled that the provisions did not violate freedom of expression, but they have not been reinstated.Daniel Gallant, a former white supremacist from Vancouver who changed his views 15 years ago and is now a social worker and a law student, said widespread Canadian denial about the prevalence of right-wing extremism was a major problem. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere,\u201d he said.A 2016 telephone survey by the Canadian polling firm Forum Research found that in a random sampling of 1,304 Canadians, Muslims were the focus of the most animosity in Quebec, where 48 percent of respondents expressed dislike of the religion.\u201cIt is clear from these findings that respondents in Quebec are the most likely to hold unfavorable feelings towards Jewish and Muslim people,\u201d said the firm\u2019s president, Lorne Bozinoff.Nowhere have those elements been as vocal as Quebec City.Handbills, posters and occasional demonstrations by such groups as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche (which translates roughly as \u201cpeople of original Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois stock\u201d) have proliferated in the city. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche\u2019s slogan is \u201cI exist, so I act,\u201d but as with fringe movements everywhere, it and other groups are most active behind the anonymity of the internet.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to know their numbers,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Leman-Langlois, a sociology professor at Laval University who studies Quebec\u2019s far right, adding that there is a small core to each group and that the followers are less active. He said the movement has fragmented and re-formed and groups have changed names for the past 20 years, although the recent surge in immigration has strengthened their cause. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing,\u201d he said.La Meute, a group that includes many Afghanistan war veterans, has gathered about 43,000 followers since it started a closed Facebook page last year. The name means \u201cwolf pack\u201d in French, and its members are not politically virulent by United States standards but focus on concerns about Muslim immigration.At the other end of the scale are followers of L\u00e9gitime Violence, a proudly fascist heavy metal band that announces its concerts to a vetted list of fans and performs songs like \u201cFinal Solution,\u201d which is as subtle as it sounds.Other extremist groups in Quebec include Atalante Qu\u00e9bec; Pegida Qu\u00e9bec, which is an offshoot of a German group; and Soldiers of Odin.Calling these groups \u201cfar right\u201d may be a misnomer. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche says its members include people with different political beliefs, including socialists and libertarians. The common denominator is an opposition to immigration, particularly by Muslims.\u201cOur objective is not to shrink to a minority,\u201d said R\u00e9mi Tremblay, spokesman for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche. He says groups like his have helped to start a debate about immigration and multiculturalism that was \u201cunthinkable\u201d when the group formed 10 years ago. \u201cWe want to free the tongues of the people so they start thinking about this without the constraints of political correctness,\u201d he said.That conversation among largely anonymous anti-immigration extremists exists in the broader context of a right-leaning talk radio culture in Quebec that has been critical of Muslim immigration and what it sees as a failure by Muslims to assimilate into Canadian culture. Talk radio of this stripe is rare elsewhere in Canada and is reminiscent, albeit far more mild, of the raucous right-wing shows in the United States.The radio stations Radio X and FM93 are among those cited as giving voice to anti-Muslim activists. While their own commentary may be muted, they give a platform to less-tolerant voices from sites like Point de Bascule, which means Tipping Point, and Poste de Veille, which translates roughly as \u201cWatchtower\u201d and whose website shows a pirate ship with a jihadist flag as its sail approaching Quebec City.One popular conspiracy theory links Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the Muslim Brotherhood, a pan-Arab group that supports the application of Islamic law in Muslim communities.Even Quebec City\u2019s mayor, R\u00e9gis Labeaume, who was visibly moved at a news conference on Monday while showing support for the Muslim community, has expressed frustration with some orthodox Muslim customs.In 2014, during interviews about the appearance of the \u201cburkini\u201d at community pools, he recalled one extremely hot summer day seeing a man dressed in shorts and sandals while his wife was wearing a full niqab \u2014 head-to-toe covering including black gloves. Mayor Labeaume said his own wife had to hold him back from insulting the man and \u201cripping his head off.\u201dMany people have called for toning down the talk in the wake of Sunday\u2019s mosque shooting in a suburb of Quebec City by a professed immigration opponent.\u201cThe tone should definitely be more respectful on all sides,\u201d said Dominic Maurais, who hosts a show on Radio X and is a leading voice of Quebec\u2019s conservative talk shows. Mr. Maurais noted that he was pro-immigration.\u201cHowever, we should all be careful about letting political correctness win over crucial, frank and essential discussions about radical Islam and Islamic values in our democracies,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Souche and Atalante Qu\u00e9bec issued a joint statement deploring the violence and calling the gunman deranged.Advertisement"}

Now He Faces Prison.", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 From his hometown in northeast China, Kwon Pyong used the internet to mock and criticize the nation\u2019s rulers, including posting a selfie in which he wore a T-shirt that likened President Xi Jinping to Hitler.Mr. Kwon\u2019s fate showed that even crude online posts about China\u2019s rulers can lead to a prison term these days, Liang Xiaojun, one of the dismissed lawyers, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. The Communist Party authorities are especially sensitive about protecting the image of Mr. Xi, and comparisons with the Nazi dictator seem sure to anger them.\u201cBefore, there were cases of people like Liu Xiaobo tried for subversion for long commentaries and essays, but now even short comments on Weibo and Twitter can be treated as inciting subversion of state power,\u201d Mr. Liang said. \u201cThat point is a change from before. There are other cases like it, including ones that haven\u2019t come to trial yet.\u201dWeibo is China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter, a popular platform for short comments shared with followers.But Mr. Kwon\u2019s lawyers said they did not know which ones were classified as subversive and did not know whether the picture of the T-shirt was one of them because officials denied their requests to see Mr. Kwon and the case files. They also disputed the claim that such criticism amounted to subversion.The two lawyers hired by Mr. Kwon\u2019s parents were excluded from defending him in court days before the trial started, when a judge demanded extra paperwork and then Mr. Kwon\u2019s father said their services were no longer needed.\u201cA judge from the court told us that we needed to provide a letter of introduction from our local bureau of justice\u201d in Beijing, Zhang Lei, who was Mr. Kwon\u2019s other defense attorney, said by telephone. \u201cThat\u2019s an impossible request and outside the bounds of the law. It\u2019s an unlawful and unreasonable demand.\u201dMr. Kwon embodies a phenomenon that worries the Chinese government: young people, exposed to foreign ideas, sometimes through study abroad, who feel free to criticize the government, perhaps na\u00efvely believing that they won\u2019t get into serious trouble, Mr. Liang said.\u201cHe\u2019s from a younger generation that\u2019s absorbed ideas about democracy and freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a clearer spirit of opposition.\u201dMr. Kwon studied aerospace engineering at Iowa State University but worked for the family trade business after finishing his studies in 2014, Mr. Liang said. Yanbian, the city where Mr. Kwon lives and stood trial, is a hub for trade between China and North Korea, and South Korean businesses have also invested there, partly because of its ethnic Korean population.But in his spare time, Mr. Kwon\u2019s thoughts turned to the wider world. He often sent messages criticizing the Chinese government\u2019s censorship and political controls and voicing support for dissidents and other banned causes. In one of his Twitter posts, he discussed being told to \u201cdrink tea,\u201d a popular Chinese euphemism for being questioned by security officials.But trouble came to Mr. Kwon that month, after he posted a picture of the provocative T-shirt and then, according to later accounts from overseas human rights groups, told friends that he would wear the T-shirt in a show of protest on Oct. 1, China\u2019s National Day.On Sept. 30, Mr. Kwon sent a message to friends, \u201cThere\u2019s trouble,\u201d and then he disappeared, according to the Human Rights Campaign in China.His family later learned that he had been taken away by the police. Officials had told his parents that Mr. Kwon could expect a prison sentence of one and a half years, as long as he dropped Mr. Liang and Mr. Zhang as his lawyers, Mr. Zhang said. Mr. Kwon\u2019s parents initially resisted that demand but on Monday told the lawyers that they were no longer needed.\u201cThe authorities were insistent that he plead guilty,\u201d Mr. Liang said. \u201cHe\u2019s been under all kinds of pressure.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the sentencing of Zhang Haitao, an activist, to 19 years in prison on charges of \u201cinciting subversion.\u201d It was January of last year, not last month.Advertisement"}

Charger was Lakota Sioux, and she had left the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota for Portland, Ore., just a few months earlier. But in the summer of 2015, she flew home for her friend\u2019s funeral. Then, two days later, while she was still in Eagle Butte \u2014 the largest town on the Cheyenne River Reservation with a population of 1,300 \u2014 another friend killed herself. Charger was shocked. \u201cIt hurt all of us because these were people who we thought we knew but really we had no idea what they were going through,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really woke us up.\u201dIn the weeks that followed, more teenagers on the reservation killed themselves with belts, knives and handfuls of Benadryl. Native American teenagers and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average, with suicides often clustering in epidemics that hit and fade. Suicide is so common on the reservation that Lakota youth don\u2019t bother to say \u201ccommitted suicide\u201d or \u201cattempted suicide.\u201d They just say \u201cattempted\u201d or \u201ccompleted.\u201d By the end of that summer, Jasilyn told me, 30 Cheyenne River kids attempted and eight completed.The article continues:Together with White Eyes and their friend, Trenton Casillas-Bakeberg, [Charger] formed a youth group. They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California, where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives. They went to the tribal council, demanding and getting funds for a safe house for young people. Most of all they counseled young people, urging them to look out for one another and get involved. \u201cYeah, it looks all pretty on Facebook,\u201d Charger remembered saying, \u201cbut really, what\u2019s going on in real life? You can be busy getting on Snapchat while someone\u2019s getting bullied.\u201dAs the suicide wave crested and broke, the youth group, now called the One Mind Youth Movement, turned to something more political. They spent that fall as part of the local campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline, whose route would cut under the Cheyenne River just upstream from the reservation that bears its name. And after the Obama State Department denied the Keystone XL permission to cross the U.S.-Canadian border in November 2015, they moved their focus to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the company Energy Transfer Partners was trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline. That pipeline would move half a million barrels of oil a day beneath the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux, which is one of the cousin bands to Cheyenne River, as well as for other downstream Sioux reservations.

{"Headline": "Feyisa Lilesa, Marathoner in Exile, Finds Refuge in Arizona", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLAGSTAFF, Ariz. \u2014 The young boy was getting reacquainted with his father after an absence of six months and climbed on him as if he were a tree. The boy kissed his father and hugged him and clambered onto his shoulders. Then, when a protest video streamed on television, the boy grabbed a stick, and the lid of a pot to serve as a shield, and began to mimic a dance of dissent in the living room.There is much joy and relief, but also continued political complication, in the modest apartment of Feyisa Lilesa, the Ethiopian marathon runner who won a silver medal at the Rio Olympics and gained international attention when he crossed his arms above his head at the finish line in a defiant gesture against the East African nation\u2019s repressive government.Afraid to return home, fearing he would be jailed, killed or no longer allowed to travel, Lilesa, 27, remained in Brazil after the Summer Games, then came to the United States in early September. He has received a green card as a permanent resident in a category for individuals of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business and sports.On Valentine\u2019s Day, his wife, Iftu Mulisa, 26; daughter, Soko, 5; and son, Sora, 3, were reunited with him, first in Miami and then in Flagstaff, where Lilesa is training at altitude for the London Marathon in April. Their immigrant visas are valid until July, but they also hope to receive green cards.\u201cI\u2019m relieved and very happy that my family is with me,\u201d Lilesa said, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cBut I chose to be in exile. Since I left the situation has gotten much, much worse. My people are living in hell, dying every day. It gives me no rest.\u201dLilesa\u2019s Olympic protest was against Ethiopia\u2019s treatment of his ethnic group, the Oromo people, who compose about a third of the country\u2019s population of 102 million but are dominated politically by the Tigray ethnic group.The Ethiopian government has said that Lilesa could return home safely and would be considered a hero, but he does not believe this. He lists reasons for his suspicions, and they are personal: His brother-in-law, Tokkuma Mulisa, who is in his early 20s, has been imprisoned for about a year and reportedly tortured, and his health remains uncertain. His younger brother, Aduna, also a runner, was beaten and detained by the Ethiopian military in October.Aduna Lilesa, 22, said he was training in Burayu, outside the capital, Addis Ababa, on Oct. 16 when soldiers approached him. They hit him in the head with the butt of a rifle, kicked him and threatened to shoot him, he said, while demanding information about Feyisa.Fearing for his life, a gun pointed at him, Aduna said he lied and told the soldiers what he thought they wanted to hear about his brother: \u201cHe is a terrorist; he is no good.\u201dSince the Olympics, Aduna said, his wife has been suspended from her job with Ethiopian government radio. He is living with Feyisa in Flagstaff until mid-March, when he will return home to his wife and young son. \u201cIt is not safe, but my family is there,\u201d Aduna Lilesa said. \u201cIf I live here, they will be confused.\u201dUnease extends, too, to the Ethiopian running community.When Feyisa Lilesa runs the London Marathon, one of his primary challengers figures to be Kenenisa Bekele, a three-time Olympic champion on the track and a fellow Oromo who is considered by many the greatest distance runner of all time. The two runners were never close and tension between them increased last September in Berlin, where Bekele ran the second-fastest marathon time ever.Asked specifically about Lilesa\u2019s Olympic protest, Bekele said it was better to get an answer from him. Asked about other Ethiopian runners who have made similar crossed-arm gestures, Bekele said that sport should be separate from politics, that everyone had a right to protest in Ethiopia and that the government was trying to \u201csolve things in a democratic way.\u201dBekele has received some criticism for not being more forceful in his remarks, and on social media in Ethiopia there is a split between supporters of the two runners. \u201cMany people are being killed,\u201d Lilesa said of Bekele. \u201cHow can you say that\u2019s democratic? I\u2019m very angry when he says that.\u201dHis own social awareness, Lilesa said, began when he was a schoolboy, living on a farm in the Jaldu district, sometimes spelled Jeldu, west of Addis Ababa. Security forces used harsh tactics to break up student protests, he said, and sometimes his classmates simply disappeared. He belongs to a younger Oromo generation emboldened to resist what it considers to be marginalization by Ethiopia\u2019s ruling party.\u201cBefore, people would run away; they feared the government, the soldiers,\u201d Lilesa said. \u201cToday, fear has been defeated. People are standing their ground. They are fed up and feel they have nothing more to lose.\u201dWhen he was named to Ethiopia\u2019s Olympic team last May, three months before the Summer Games, Lilesa felt it was urgent to make some kind of protest gesture in Rio de Janeiro. But he did not tell anyone of his plans. If he told his family, they might talk him out of it. If the government found out, he might be kicked off the Olympic team or worse.He continued to visit Oromo people detained in jail and to give money to Oromo students who had been dismissed from school and left homeless. He was wealthy for an Ethiopian, independent, and he sensed that the government monitored some of his movements.He worried that he could be injured or killed in a staged auto accident. Or that someone might ambush him when he was training in the forests around Addis Ababa. When the doorbell rang at his home, he went to the second floor and peered outside before answering.\u201cI was really fearful,\u201d Lilesa said. \u201cBeing an Oromo makes one suspect.\u201dOn the final day of the Olympics, his moment came. As he reached the finish of the marathon, in second place behind Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya and ahead of Galen Rupp of the United States, Lilesa crossed his arms. It was a familiar Oromo gesture of protest and one that carried great risk, both to his career representing Ethiopia and to his family.\u201cGiving up running for Ethiopia was the least I could do, because other people were giving up their lives,\u201d Lilesa said.Iftu Mulisa, his wife, was watching at home in Addis Ababa with 15 or 20 relatives and friends. There was loud cheering and celebrating, and then Lilesa crossed his arms. The cheering was replaced by silence and confusion and fear.\u201cEveryone was asking: \u2018Does he come home? Does he stay? What happens next?\u2019\u201d Mulisa said. \u201cIt was so shocking. He hadn\u2019t told anyone.\u201dFor two or three days, Lilesa said, he did not answer the phone when his wife called.\u201cI had put them in this position and I just didn\u2019t know what to say to her,\u201d he said.Still, he felt he had made the right decision.\u201cI needed to do this,\u201d Lilesa said. \u201cI thought of it this way: When a soldier enlists, you know the risks, but because you swore to defend the country or the law, you don\u2019t think about the consequences.\u201dWhen he finally spoke to his wife, Lilesa said, he tried to calm her and tell her everything would be O.K. But the uncertainty was difficult.\u201cHe had never been gone more than a week or two,\u201d Mulisa said. \u201cHaving young kids made it more difficult. They missed him and asked questions I couldn\u2019t answer. But I was hopeful we would be reunited one day.\u201dIn a diplomatic whirlwind, Lilesa secured an immigrant visa to the United States and eventually moved to Flagstaff, a training hub at nearly 7,000 feet where athletes often go to enhance their oxygen-carrying capacity. He was invited there by a runner from Eritrea, which neighbors Ethiopia.Even in the best of situations, distance running can be an isolating life of training twice a day and sleeping. Lilesa kept in touch with his family through video chats, but they were disrupted for a period when the Ethiopian government restricted internet access.In Ethiopia it is the traditional role of the wife or maid to prepare the food, to do the domestic chores. Without his family, Lilesa said, he sometimes ate only once or twice a day, too tired to cook dinner, hardly recommended for marathoners who routinely train more than 100 miles per week.\u201cI had to fend for myself in a way I\u2019ve never done in my life,\u201d he said.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know he had been arrested and there I was in Brazil, finding about his death on Facebook,\u201d Lilesa said of Fayissa. \u201cHe had helped me so much at different times of my life.\u201dEventually, Mulisa and their two children received immigrant visas to enter the United States and left Addis Ababa in mid-February for Frankfurt, Germany, then Miami, where Lilesa greeted them at the airport. The scariest time, Mulisa said, came when she walked down the Jetway to the plane, afraid the Ethiopian government would prevent her from leaving at the last minute.Most likely, Lilesa said, his family was permitted to leave because to do otherwise would have generated negative publicity. In Miami, there was more emotion than words, Mulisa said, as the children hugged their father and she told him, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would see you so soon.\u201dWhile he will surely not be chosen to compete for Ethiopia at the Olympics and world track and field championships while in exile, Lilesa can still make hundreds of thousands of dollars as an independent, elite marathon runner. Since the Olympics, he has run a marathon in Honolulu and a half marathon in Houston. A GoFundMe campaign for him and his family, started by supporters, raised more than $160,000. The London Marathon is two months away.If the political situation changes in Ethiopia, he said, he and his family will move home. He does not expect that to happen soon. In the meantime, he hopes that his wife and children will be permitted to make yearly trips there to visit relatives. For himself, he said he had no regrets.\u201cThis has given me more confidence, more reasons to try harder, more reasons to compete so that I can use this platform to raise awareness,\u201d Lilesa said. \u201cI\u2019m constantly thinking, what else can I do?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 to demean a sitting senator.In a party-line vote, 49 to 43, senators upheld Mr. Daines\u2019s decision, forcing Ms. Warren into silence, at least on the Senate floor, until the showdown over Mr. Sessions\u2019s nomination is complete. He is expected to be confirmed on Wednesday.Democrats argued that Mr. McConnell was enforcing the rule selectively, citing examples of Republicans appearing to test the boundaries of Rule XIX. In one instance from 2015, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused Mr. McConnell of lying \u201cover and over and over again.\u201d In another, last year, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas described the \u201ccancerous leadership\u201d of Senator Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader.Republicans accused Ms. Warren of violating the rule repeatedly, saying she had been warned before Mr. McConnell\u2019s objection. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, suggested that Ms. Warren had been rebuked over \u201ca quotation from Senator Ted Kennedy that called the nominee a disgrace to the Justice Department.\u201d\u201cOur colleagues want to try to make this all about Coretta Scott King, and it is not,\u201d he said.But when Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, sought clarification, he was informed that while a warning was issued over the letter from Mr. Kennedy, the ruling itself hinged on Mrs. King\u2019s letter.

{"Headline": "Where in the World Can We Find Hope?", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat is a mopey, Trumpatized liberal to do? When I need solace, I head (in my mind, anyway) to two beacons of hope: Denmark and Canada. There, too, democracy needs fixing, and thoughtful people are trying to mend the alienation between policy makers and voters \u2014 to persuade the experts and the common people not to give up on one another. They have almost convinced me that they might succeed.It won\u2019t be easy. Even in Denmark, that progressive utopia, liberal confidence in democracy has frayed. The left-wing Social Democratic Party governed Denmark for much of the 20th century, but now it keeps losing elections. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost most on this question of immigration, foreigners,\u201d Kristian Weise, who heads Cevea, a center-left think tank in Copenhagen, told me. \u201cThe response in the party has been to move to the right, to match the rhetoric and policies of the xenophobic populist right.\u201dMr. Weise lamented the progressive elite\u2019s refusal to double down on liberal principles and plainly communicate those principles to voters. \u201cPeople growing up after 1989 within the Social Democratic movement became very nonideological, because suddenly there were no longer the big contradictions,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitics became both technocratic and also very spin-oriented.\u201dAfter the end of the Cold War, it was tempting to think that the big questions were settled; experts would work out the details of democracy and capitalism. Yet as governments placed more trust in a technocratic elite, popular faith in government eroded. Across the West, rates of voter turnout and party affiliation declined.Meanwhile in Denmark \u2014 as in so many places \u2014 the tide of global capitalism eroded familiar ways of life. Rural communities hollowed out, and immigrants with strange clothes and creeds moved in. \u201cThere are bigots out there, but we believe the majority attracted to the populist right is disenchanted,\u201d Mr. Weise said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel the establishment is listening to them: \u2018You can\u2019t keep order in my world.\u2019 \u201dUffe Elbaek, a member of the Danish Parliament, helped found a new party in 2013 called the Alternative. He told me that the Alternative seeks to \u201cchange the political culture\u201d by crowdsourcing its platform through \u201cpolitical laboratories\u201d that invite Danes to read policy papers and meet with experts. \u201cThis is not politics coming from above, or outside, but from the inside and bottom up,\u201d Mr. Elbaek said.The typical town hall meeting \u201chappens when something\u2019s gone wrong, or a decision has been made, and an elected official is trying to explain it,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is dressed up as an opportunity to have your say. We try to subdue tension and emotion by giving a rational, technocratic account of the decision. Then what we do \u2014 least helpfully \u2014 is ask people to do the very thing we know most people are petrified of, and that\u2019s stand in front of a room of strangers and speak at an open mike.\u201d Naturally, \u201cit comes to seem that the essential quality of the public is volatile emotionality,\u201d he said: Schumpeter\u2019s \u201cprimitive\u201d voter.Instead, Mr. MacLeod\u2019s company sends out invitations to randomly selected households and then draws names to assemble a representative panel of volunteers. They meet with experts and policy makers for several weekends to study an open policy question. Eventually the panels issue nuanced recommendations on matters ranging from hospital budgets to mass transit.\u201cIf we start from the premise that people are more curious than we give them credit for, and that they are kind \u2014 if we design for their better angels \u2014 then lo and behold, the phantom public that seems to haunt public discourse disappears,\u201d he said.Deliberative democracy is no panacea. It can only supplement the electoral process, and cannot compensate for more systemic American problems like gerrymandering and the erosion of campaign finance regulation. Moreover, it can devolve into glorified market research that treats participants as focus groups, not engaged citizens. The result is outsize influence for well-funded interest groups and public relations consultants.The most dangerous threat posed by President Trump and his European allies does not lie in any single executive order or diplomatic crisis, but in their barren and cynical view of community. Sometimes I still worry that they are right: Maybe our prejudices and tribes are our most essential features, never to change. We have no choice but to hope that they are wrong.Advertisement"}

Participation in this march was another expression of this. If feminists in the U.S. need support, I\u2019m willing to join them.We also wanted to contribute to the march\u2019s diversity. So my friends made posters, in both Chinese and English. This was meant not just as a response to American feminists, but also to show women in China that we were engaged in international issues. In fact, I think promoting this march in China was more important than supporting American feminists. That\u2019s why we organized the interactive broadcast through WeChat.How have Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss and Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory affected the women\u2019s rights movement?The election outcome signaled that the world is not ready to be headed by a woman and that insulting women in speech and actions does not prevent a man from taking power. On the internet in China now, some people are mocking feminism. Seeing that a sexual harasser can become president only encourages sexists. So the environment for Chinese feminism worsened after this election.In addition, like many feminists in developing countries, we are concerned that Trump may cut off government funds to global women\u2019s development programs. Such funding should be the duty of the United States as a major nation.The most serious consequence would be if Trump rejects the duty of safeguarding global human rights. For the human rights movement in China, that would greatly reduce the room for maneuver.How have you kept up your feminist activities in New York?I hold online discussions with my colleagues in China and elsewhere nearly every day.At first my work in the United States mainly concerned the Feminist Five. Even though they were soon released from detention, the case wasn\u2019t resolved for another year. During that time, they weren\u2019t completely free and were subjected to a lot of harassment and restrictions. We wanted the international community to pay attention to them.We discovered that some people knew almost nothing about Chinese feminism and only learned something about it because of this case. We realized then that a lot of important information about Chinese feminism had not been communicated to the West. So I thought maybe we could carry on our work in the United States.

{"Headline": "Netanyahu Feels at Home at the White House", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJERUSALEM \u2014 The Benjamin Netanyahu on the White House podium Wednesday was the Netanyahu of old. Though politically weakened at home, the Israeli prime minister seemed uncharacteristically relaxed and self-confident. The smiles, the handshakes, the joking reference to President Trump\u2019s book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and the prime minister\u2019s grandfatherly banter with the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, this was the Netanyahu whom Israelis have not seen in years.By opening the news conference with a reference to the Jewish people\u2019s painful history, President Trump afforded the prime minister an opportunity to do what he does best, what he did when he first took the world stage as Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in 1984. The president gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a chance to make the case for the legitimacy of the Jewish people\u2019s return to their ancestral homeland.That was more than a rhetorical opportunity. For Mr. Netanyahu and many Israelis, Palestinian denial of that legitimacy is the real reason for the failure of the peace process. From the White House and in the presence of a sympathetic president, the prime minister was finally able to assert that the Palestinian commitment to a two-state solution has long been a hoax, that the Palestinians have employed two narratives, one for international consumption and another for Palestinians at home.The belief that President Abbas sees the two-state solution as a steppingstone to a one \u2013 Arab \u2013 state solution leaves many Israelis cynical about the peace process and tiring of the rhetoric about two states. Mr. Trump may have shifted that momentum.Outward appearances of confidence notwithstanding, Palestinian leaders undoubtedly understand that the jig is up \u2013 gone (for now) are the days in which they can tell the world one story and their people another. That actually gives Israelis hope that \u2013 if the Palestinians want political sovereignty \u2013 the Palestinian Authority will have to lay the groundwork by forging an entirely different narrative about Israel and Jews.There is still no reason to assume that President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu can forge a deal. Mr. Trump\u2019s White House is in disarray, Mr. Netanyahu is under investigation for corruption and politically weakened, Mr. Kushner has not a day of diplomatic experience, the other Arab countries that Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu hope will be part of an agreement may or may not cooperate and Palestinian hatred of Jews may be too deeply entrenched.Yet there is at least cause for a glimmer of hope. On Wednesday, whatever ambivalences about Mr. Trump many Israelis have, they heard from a United States president sympathetic to their story, sensitive to their fears of Iran and committed to their safety. That may matter a great deal. For Israelis who feel safe and protected are infinitely more likely to make accommodations for peace.Advertisement"}

Mnuchin, is very likely to be confirmed by the Senate on Monday night.By the looks of his Facebook feed, Richard DeAgazio is a big fan of President Trump\u2019s. Witness his Facebook feed on anti-immigrant protests in Italy, courtesy of the Russian propaganda network RT, the photo of Bill Clinton with a woman that he spuriously identifies as the former president\u2019s new girlfriend, and a caricature of Barack Obama in a sombrero.But Mr. DeAgazio did the current president no favors with his fanboy posts from Mar-a-Lago this weekend in a public dining room as the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, and the president of the United States scrambled to respond to a North Korean ballistic missile test.\u201cHOLY MOLY !!! It was fascinating to watch the flurry of activity at dinner when the news came that North Korea had launched a missile in the direction of Japan. The Prime Minister Abe of Japan huddles with his staff and the President is on the phone with Washington DC. the two world leaders then conferred and then went into another room for hastily arranged press conference. Wow.....the center of the action!!!\u201dIt was a remarkable display on Mr. Trump\u2019s part of a lack of concern for prying eyes and security awareness.But hey, Mr. DeAgazio also posed with the service member who carries the nuclear launch codes for the president.\u201cThis is Rick...He carries the \u201cfootball\u201d The nuclear football (also known as the atomic football, the President\u2019s emergency satchel, the Presidential Emergency Satchel, the button, the black box, or just the football) is a briefcase, the contents of which are to be used by the President of the United States to authorize a nuclear attack.\u201dMr. DeAgazio\u2019s Facebook page is no longer publicly accessible.Numerically, there may not have been many of them, but voters who sided with Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald J. Trump in 2016 most likely delivered the White House to President Trump, with his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida.Democrats want them back.In polling and focus groups in those three states, the Democratic \u201csuper PAC,\u201d Priorities USA, says it has reason to believe the elusive Obama-Trump voter can be brought back into the Democratic fold, according to a Priorities USA strategy memo to be released Monday afternoon. Half of the Obama-Trump voters they reached confessed to mixed feelings about their 2016 vote, and only 35 percent of those \u201csoft Trump voters\u201d have confidence that Mr. Trump will do a good job as president.That is especially true for women who voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump and did not have a college degree.Another group under a microscope are people who voted in 2012 but did not bother last November. Such drop-off voters described themselves as surprised by the outcome of the election and \u201cextremely unhappy\u201d about the results, the memo says.The good news for Democrats: Both groups are leery of tax and social welfare policies that favor the wealthy over the struggling middle class.The bad news: Reaching them won\u2019t be easy. They get their information from their own sources like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other online outlets that are notoriously wrong.Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was born into politics, the son of another Canadian leader, Pierre Trudeau.So when he came to the White House to break the ice with President Trump, he knew just the gift to warm the new president\u2019s heart: a picture of himself.\u201cHe gave me a picture of myself and your father, and what a great picture. I will keep that in a very special place,\u201d Mr. Trump said, meaning, presumably, a picture of \u201chis father.\u201dLast year, the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn waged an all-out battle with the Environmental Protection Agency, complaining that regulations were strangling the oil industry. Now, as Mr. Trump\u2019s special adviser on overhauling regulation, Mr. Icahn has the ear of the president and a front-row seat as the administration rewrites regulation.The letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, comes days before the Senate is expected to take up the nomination of Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump\u2019s candidate to head the E.P.A.Icahn Enterprises, Mr. Icahn\u2019s firm, has large investments in companies that are affected by E.P.A. regulations, which he has described as stifling. But it is his majority investment in CVR Energy, an oil refiner, that is of biggest concern to the senators. CVR is required by the E.P.A. to blend its oil or buy credits, something Mr. Icahn has called \u201ccompletely, totally absurd.\u201d He has blamed the E.P.A. for the bankruptcies of several oil refineries in the United States.An activist investor and outsider for most of his career, Mr. Icahn staked his career on attacking the chieftains of intransigent companies and regulators. The caustic approach often resulted in victory, a strategy that earned him accolades from Mr. Trump as a \u201cbrilliant negotiator.\u201d Mr. Icahn was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters and a donor during the campaign. During the transition, he weighed in on candidates like Mr. Mnuchin for Treasury secretary and Mr. Pruitt, who has also been vocal in his criticism of E.P.A. regulation.At the time of his appointment, the transition team said Mr. Icahn, 80, would not serve as a federal employee and would not have specific duties. Since the election in November, CVR\u2019s stock has gained 69 percent, rallying to $21.58 a share.As virtually anyone in the United States \u2014 and much of the world \u2014 knows, the new president of the United States is fond of communicating via Twitter, and he wanted his audience to understand on Sunday that he is much loved in Florida.He did beat Hillary Clinton in the Sunshine State, and crushed his Republican primary race opponents.Twitter is a double-edged communications sword.Advertisement"}

What impact do you think it has had in your life \u2014 whatever your racial or ethnic identity \u2014 and in our society more broadly?\u201dHarold Bailey Jr., a retiree and the chairman of Team Westport, the town\u2019s diversity committee, said in an interview on Thursday that the question \u2014 devised in September \u2014 was not intended to be leading.\u201cWe are not implying anything about our town other than this town has an openness to exploring the topic and discussing it,\u201d he said.But merely mentioning white privilege seems to have struck a nerve, with much of the criticism coming from out of town.The term is used, most often by those who lean left politically, to reflect what they identify as a wide range of societal advantages white people knowingly or unknowingly enjoy. The classic example of unequal treatment is the ability to easily hail a cab, but there are more serious ones, such as easier interactions with the police. The term tends to make some white people bristle because they interpret it to mean that their success is unearned or that they benefit from racism.Bari Reiner, 72, told The Associated Press that Westport welcomes anyone who can afford to live there.\u201cIt\u2019s an open town,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no barricades here. Nobody says if you\u2019re black or whatever, you can\u2019t move here.\u201dSome of the response on Facebook were much more spirited.Westport, which is about 50 miles from midtown Manhattan and about 13 miles east of Stamford, Conn., created the diversity committee in 2003 to \u201cmake Westport a more welcoming community on an ongoing basis,\u201d Mr. Bailey said.In an overwhelmingly white area, it\u2019s all the more important to discuss race, he said. While the adults might commute into New York City or maybe once lived in more diverse areas, the students are less likely to have been exposed to people who aren\u2019t like them, he said.The committee, he added, is intended \u201cto get folks to take a look at what\u2019s not here demographically, and to think about it and talk about it and keep it in the forefront.\u201dSo, mission accomplished.For all of the hand-wringing among adults, the students appear to have greeted the essay contest and the resulting uproar with a shrug. Some students said the question wasn\u2019t a big deal in the high school until the media spotlight arrived, and that they were comfortable discussing white privilege.\u201cIt isn\u2019t that much of a taboo subject,\u201d said Fritz Schemel, a 17-year-old senior at Staples High School.He said he had read several essays in English classes debating the term. At the very least, he found the essay question to be the start of a reasonable discussion. Students who disagreed with the concept were free to say so, he said.Claire Dinshaw, also a 17-year-old senior at Staples, said the discussion was important \u201cbecause on a daily basis, we really aren\u2019t exposed to much diversity within our town.\u201cIt\u2019s important to learn about that and figure out how the nation as a whole works, because the whole nation isn\u2019t going to be 93 percent white,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Settlement Sees Friendly Faces in Trump Administration", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIT EL, West Bank \u2014 There\u2019s the Friedman Faculty House, the Rabbi Morris Friedman Center for Computer Sciences, a Friedman fitness room at a pre-army academy, a playground and a plaza.And as president of the American fund-raising arm of Beit El\u2019s yeshiva complex, he has raised millions of dollars for its related institutions, including housing projects for teachers and students. He has made almost yearly visits there during the Jewish holiday Sukkot.In the days leading up to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s first meeting with Mr. Trump as president, and Mr. Friedman\u2019s confirmation hearings, which are expected to start on Thursday, the mood in Beit El seemed to encapsulate all the uncertainty and contradictions manifested by the new administration.But Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation once made a $10,000 donation to Beit El\u2019s yeshiva institutions in honor of the Friedmans. And the parents of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, have donated generously, Yaakov Katz, a founder of Beit El and its fund-raising enterprise, said in a radio interview in December.Swinging between hopes of almost unbridled settlement growth and skepticism, several residents said they were \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201dLocated north of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, in the heartland of the territory of any future Palestinian state, Beit El is an ideological hotbed of the settler movement and has strong biblical associations. Its name is Hebrew for house of God, and some scholars have identified its location as the place where Jacob, the biblical patriarch, laid his head on a pillow of stones and dreamed of angels ascending and descending a ladder between heaven and earth.A large, upright stone on a terraced hillside on the edge of the settlement is revered as the one that Jacob slept on, then anointed with oil, after God appeared in the dream and promised all the land around to him and his progeny.Archaeological excavations in the area have found signs of ancient life. The Palestinian village of Beitin sits on a nearby hill.Founded in 1977 on private Palestinian land originally seized by Israel for military purposes, the settlement was later approved by the Israeli courts under the rubric of general security. Now it is home to about 6,500 people who mostly live in modest, low-rise two- or four-family buildings. There are plans in the pipeline for at least 300 new apartments in eight-story buildings to be constructed on a rise by the entrance to the settlement.But the yeshiva complex has so far proven to be Beit El\u2019s main engine of growth.On a recent morning, dozens of yeshiva students in their late teens or early 20s were huddled over Talmudic texts, alone or in pairs, in the vast hall of a new building that was completed last year.\u201cBeit El\u2019s greatest \u2018product\u2019 is its educational institutions,\u201d said Chaim Silberstein, a South African-born resident and member of the local council who moved here as a yeshiva student in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry.\u201dMr. Katz, known as Ketzale, was the driving force behind the yeshiva, its religious high schools for boys and girls and the pre-army academy. A charismatic former member of the Israeli Parliament from a hard-right party, Mr. Katz, a staunch nationalist, is credited with building up the fund-raising network in the United States and bringing in tens of millions of dollars.Mr. Friedman\u2019s late father, Morris, commemorated on a plaque as a \u201cfounding member of Beit El,\u201d was one of the first American Jews to meet Mr. Katz when he started going to the United States more than quarter of a century ago and could barely speak English, according to Mr. Silberstein. Another was Eugen Gluck, Beit El\u2019s main American benefactor, whose name graces the settlement\u2019s clinic.The yeshiva complex also runs a tour company and a rabbinical website. One of the stated goals of its online efforts, it says, is to \u201cdelegitimize the notion of the two-state solution,\u201d spreading its influence far beyond the geographical confines of Beit El.The government retroactively approved another project of 20 apartments in a building under construction when it announced thousands of new settlement housing units last month. Wedged between existing buildings, the project had to be redesigned because parts of it were also found to have encroached on Palestinian-owned land.Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement group, recently revealed that the latest plan was developed by the nonprofit Sukkat Ovadia Learning Center, another beneficiary of the Friends of the Beit El Yeshiva network, having received more than $600,000 in 2015, according to its financial reports.Mr. Silberstein, the council member, said that old land records of the area were notoriously imprecise and that many, though not all, of the building irregularities were innocent mistakes. Mr. Friedman, he added, was a settlement builder in a \u201cfigurative\u201d sense.\u201cAny donor likes to think he\u2019s a builder,\u201d Mr. Silberstein said. \u201cA donor doesn\u2019t like to pay for salaries and food.\u201dBeit El\u2019s other concerns are small-scale by comparison: a factory for tefillin, or phylacteries; a bakeshop called Herby\u2019s; and some workshops for aluminum and carpentry. Local Palestinians are employed, mainly in construction.Even after 40 years, there is a constant tension between the temporary and the permanent.Mr. Silberstein said his \u201cmacro outlook\u201d was to create a momentum in building throughout the West Bank that would lead to an \u201cirreversible situation\u201d and \u201csolidify Israel\u2019s presence in its historic homeland.\u201d At the micro level, he said, he hopes Beit El\u2019s population will reach 10,000 in the next five years and ensure that even in the event of any withdrawal from the territory, Beit El would end up within Israel\u2019s borders.Elena Mordechai, a special education assistant and mother of nine, moved here from Jerusalem in the 1990s. She said her friends thought she was crazy to invest in Beit El then, when Israel and the Palestinians seemed poised to reach a territorial agreement. Now she puts her faith in God.\u201cWe trust that the one who is running things is the Holy One, blessed be he, up there,\u201d she said. \u201cNot Bibi,\u201d she added, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname, \u201cand not Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I don\u2019t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn\u2019t wear one.\u201dThe White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes.Within moments of Mr. Spicer\u2019s comment, reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe.Mr. Spicer added that the story was \u201cso riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology.\u201d He went on, \u201cLiterally, blatant factual errors, and it\u2019s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or so-called reporting.\u201dThe overall piece, which described Mr. Trump\u2019s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic shake-up of a Washington culture he has never inhabited, was \u201cnot an accurate portrayal of what\u2019s really happening,\u201d Mr. Spicer concluded.Mr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning.On Twitter, Mr. Trump called the reports \u201cfake news\u201d that sought to marginalize him.If you missed Mr. Trump talking to Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News during the Super Bowl, you will have another chance tonight.In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to characterize The Times\u2019s coverage, which was based on interviews with several of his White House\u2019s most senior officials and others aware of the administration\u2019s inner workings, as \u201cfiction\u201d based on fabricated sources.It\u2019s official: Silicon Valley really, really despises Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order.The brief, filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is blunt and direct. The ban, it says, \u201chinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations \u2014 and hire new employees \u2014 outside the United States.\u201dIt is a remarkable statement of unity from the country\u2019s technology companies, many of which rely heavily on foreign workers. And it is a shot across the bow for Mr. Trump, foreshadowing a rocky relationship with Silicon Valley leaders over the next four years.The companies were not the only ones joining in opposition. Susan E. Rice, former President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, was among the leaders of a petition signed by a group of former National Security Council officials.The Justice Department on Monday corrected the record on an attention-grabbing claim that one of its lawyers made in a Northern Virginia courtroom about the impact of President Trump\u2019s executive order on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.That number, however, came under question later on Friday, when a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs said that the real number was around 60,000 and that the larger figure had inaccurately included diplomatic visas that were not affected by the ban.\u201cIn response to a question from this court as to how many individuals have been affected by the executive order, government counsel presenting oral argument, based on information he had received, stated that 100,000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of the executive order,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Department of State has since provided undersigned counsel with a revised number, which is roughly 60,000 visas.\u201dAn outside, pro-Trump political group is adding veteran fund-raisers and Republican Party strategists, and is also employing one of the president\u2019s campaign ad makers to try to ensure Senate confirmation of his remaining cabinet nominees.It\u2019s part of a $4 million effort, with three other ads focused specifically on the nominations of Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Tom Price for secretary of health and human services.Some of those ads have been broadcast in states with critical races in the 2018 midterms. The other new advisers are Cara Mason, who worked as the finance director for the Trump Victory committee under Reince Priebus; Rob Collins, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director; Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff; and Rob Simms, a former National Republican Congressional Committee executive director.With Mr. Trump\u2019s administration still evolving, the 45Committee has moved to fill a void, supporting the White House as it finds itself besieged by critics.Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff known for his uncompromising stance on illegal immigration, is back in the news months after losing his bid for re-election.Now he is asking supporters to help him raise $1 million for his legal defense fund. Mr. Arpaio faced numerous lawsuits alleging abuse and faulty medical care in several jails, and taxpayers in Maricopa County, where he was sheriff, spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense.In his email, Mr. Arpaio attributed his re-election defeat to a host of enemies, including \u201cleftist financier George Soros,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department.Mr. Soros spent an estimated $2 million last year opposing Mr. Arpaio, and the Justice Department under Mr. Obama filed criminal contempt-of-court charges against the sheriff for refusing a judge\u2019s order to stop discriminating against Latinos.As the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s largest county, Mr. Arpaio gained a national reputation for immigration raids that targeted heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around the Phoenix area.Thousands of people were caught up in the raids, which were often carried out without any proof of criminal activity, and which critics called racial profiling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Back-Channel Plan for Ukraine and Russia, Courtesy of Trump Associates", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was hand-delivered to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia.Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, who delivered the document; Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia; and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort.At a time when Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny \u2014 with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F.B.I. and Congress \u2014 some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into Russia-related efforts behind the scenes.Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an American-Russian alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms.But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a Trump-style leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence \u2014 \u201cnames of companies, wire transfers\u201d \u2014 showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin.\u201cA lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U.S. agent, a C.I.A. agent,\u201d Mr. Artemenko said. \u201cBut how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?\u201dMr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F.B.I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials; he has denied any illicit connections.While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko \u201cis not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U.S. administration.\u201dBut given Mr. Trump\u2019s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine\u2019s expense \u2014 potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko\u2019s.It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors.Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a Trump-branded tower in the republic of Georgia and a short-lived mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems.Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business.Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers.He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.)Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth.He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraine\u2019s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,\u201d he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. \u201cOur time has come!\u201dMr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine \u2014 and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years.The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. \u201cIt is a gross violation of the Constitution,\u201d he said in written answers to questions from The Times. \u201cSuch ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests.\u201dThe reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenko\u2019s project also includes the dissemination of \u201ckompromat,\u201d or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan.Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenko\u2019s proposal reach the White House.But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light.Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump.He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.)Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense.\u201cI want to stop a war, number one,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber two, I absolutely believe that the U.S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run.\u201dAfter speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House.Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president.\u201cFraud is never good, right?\u201d Mr. Cohen said.He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn\u2019s office.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect middle initial for Paul Manafort.

{"Headline": "Snap Aims for Valuation of More Than $20 Billion in I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The parent company of Snapchat is poised to hold one of the biggest initial public offerings in years, but while its market debut is eagerly awaited, the start-up has so far tempered expectations for the size of the stock sale.Even at the top of that range, Snap would end up with a valuation on the lower end of the $20 billion to $25 billion mark that it had anticipated months ago. Either way, it is still up from the approximately $16.5 billion the company valued itself late last year.The final pricing of the new shares \u2014 and the company\u2019s valuation \u2014 could still change. The share price will be not be set until after Snap embarks on a nearly two-week tour of investors that will take its executives across the country. The company is expected to begin trading around March 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol SNAP.Even if the value were to drop, it would still be one of the biggest technology offerings of the decade. At this stage of the offering process, Twitter was valued at more than $12 billion, including options and restricted stock units, in October 2013. A year earlier, Facebook was valued at $86 billion at a similar stage.Three of Snap\u2019s top executives \u2014 the co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel, the chief strategy officer Imran Khan and the chief financial officer Andrew Vollero \u2014 will make the tour along with underwriters to pitch investors on what remains the most highly anticipated I.P.O. so far this year.The road show, as the process is known, formally began on Thursday as the three men visited several of the underwriters. Morgan Stanley, the lead bank, hosted the executives at its Midtown Manhattan headquarters to speak with its sales force in a standing-room-only meeting.Morgan Stanley also plastered Snap\u2019s name \u2014 in its familiar bright yellow \u2014 on the electronic zipper outside its building.And Goldman Sachs installed a vending machine that sells Snap\u2019s Spectacles \u2014 sunglasses with an integrated camera that can upload videos to Snapchat \u2014 in the mezzanine lobby of its downtown Manhattan headquarters.The message that Snap is selling is relatively simple. The company has quickly become one of the technology world\u2019s brightest stars, and its offering stands out in a largely barren landscape for new stocks.But potential investors are liable to question whether Snap can maintain its enviable user growth rate, particularly as Facebook has unabashedly copied many of the service\u2019s top features within Instagram.Snap\u2019s executives will most likely emphasize how highly the service\u2019s users are engaged with the app, which as of last year averaged about 158 million users each day. Unlike other social media companies, Snap has been clear in prioritizing North America and Europe over more global ambitions, at least for now.Prospective investors may also question how long Snap will take to post a profit. The company has disclosed that it lost $514 million last year, up from $373 million in 2015. But its revenue grew by about seven times over that same span, to $404.5 million last year from $58.7 million in 2015.Investors who buy into Snap will have little say in the company\u2019s strategic direction, however. Even after the I.P.O., Mr. Spiegel and a fellow co-founder, Robert Murphy, are expected to retain nearly 89 percent of the voting shares because the shares to be sold in the offering will hold no voting rights.From its beginning in a Stanford dorm room six years ago, Snapchat has grown from a trendy redoubt for millennials into a top destination for both users and advertisers. It started life as a way for people to send self-destructing photo messages to friends, but it has since added more ambitious tools that let users compile \u201cstories\u201d about their days and special filters that let users transform their faces into dogs, fairies or paid-for content like Taco Bell tacos.Snap is expected to produce huge wealth \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 for its existing investors, notably Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, who each own 227 million shares.

{"Headline": "Building Trust Cuts Violence. Cash Also Helps.", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesRichmond, Calif. \u2014 DeVone Boggan could teach a class on the art of making a statement. In 2010, he invited a group of the most dangerous gun offenders in Richmond, a Bay Area city of about 100,000 residents, to a conference room at City Hall. At each seat was a name card starting with \u201cMr.\u201d and an information folder labeled \u201cOperation Peacemaker.\u201d Wearing a suit and his signature fedora, Boggan began the meeting by apologizing on behalf of the city for not reaching out to the men sooner. Peace in Richmond, he told them, must come through them. When the meeting was over and everyone got up to leave, Boggan called them back. The men, already wary, assumed they would be arrested. Instead, Boggan handed each an envelope containing $1,000. \u201cWe wanted to send sound waves through the community,\u201d Boggan said. \u201cFacebook blew up.\u201dThe previous year, Richmond police department officials had told Boggan, the director of the city\u2019s Office of Neighborhood Safety, that they thought 17 men were responsible for 70 percent of the city\u2019s gun crime. At the time, Richmond was among the most dangerous cities in the country. Its homicide rate had reached 46 per 100,000 residents \u2014 triple Chicago\u2019s rate. At one point, the City Council had even considered declaring a state of emergency. Boggan asked each official to independently send him the names of the 17 men, an exercise that yielded 28 unduplicated names. In the three months it took to make contact with all of them, three died of gun related injuries. He invited the remaining 25 to City Hall, and 21 showed up.Boggan is the architect of Operation Peacemaker Fellowship, a controversial program initiated in 2010 that shares features with Cure Violence and Ceasefire, two other programs that, over the last two decades, have become models for reducing gun violence. Like the others, Boggan\u2019s method uses data and intelligence to identify people highly likely to commit or become victims of gun violence; it then connects them with job training, mentorship and social services while deploying outreach teams to intervene in conflicts.But it also does something else. After six months, its subjects \u2014 most are African-American males between 14 and 27 years old \u2014 are eligible for a monthly cash stipend of up to $1,000 for up to nine months (Boggan\u2019s meeting in 2010 with the first cohort was played out in a way designed to turn heads and attract more fellows into the program). The city\u2019s average homicide rate in the five years that preceded the arrival of Operation Peacemaker was 40 per 100,000 residents. In the next five years, it dropped by nearly 60 percent.For one 29-year-old former fellow, LaVon Carter Jr., that element was critical. \u201cWhen I knew they weren\u2019t the police, that\u2019s when they gained my trust,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t be talking to you about stuff that I did and exposing this and that and you\u2019re the police. That don\u2019t work.\u201d Carter became a fellow soon after his release from a five-year prison term. He had heard about the program while incarcerated. Like all fellows, he was recruited because the neighborhood safety agency\u2019s outreach team, which is composed largely of streetwise former felons turned \u201cneighborhood change agents,\u201d had determined that, once out of prison, there was a high likelihood of Carter shooting someone, or being shot himself, within the next six to 12 months.At a time when algorithms are increasingly being used to predict the likelihood of future criminality, Richmond\u2019s Office of Neighborhood Safety selects fellows based almost entirely on old-fashioned street intelligence. Its \u201dchange agents\u201d regularly engage with young people from the city's toughest neighborhoods. They get to know where prospective fellows live and work, whom they spend their time with, who their enemies are, what their family life is like, and what interactions they\u2019ve had with rival gangs and with law enforcement.That timely on-the-ground knowledge enables the change agents to build a psychology-based profile of each prospective fellow and assess who are most likely to be involved in gun violence. There have been four Peacemaker cohorts to date, and a total of 93 people have been invited into the program. Of those, 84 have accepted. As of January, the program had a dropout rate of zero. \u201cThe money is the bait,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIt all starts off about the money, and then once you get involved with it and start being around these people, meeting all these people that you would have never been exposed to, it opens your eyes to a bigger picture.\u201d Fellows have traveled to Washington, D.C., South Africa, Mexico and Disneyland. Boggan describes seeing \u201cone of the baddest dudes around\u201d wearing Mickey Mouse ears.Fellows are also invited to meet with prominent members of the community, including top corporate executives and members of Congress. \u201cI\u2019d never been around people like that before,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThrough my whole stint in prison, everything that I was thinking about was illegal; how I was gonna get out and get money \u2026 now I work ten hours a day. I\u2019m a heavy equipment operator. I never thought I\u2019d be out here driving Tonka toys for real.\u201dFellows are also connected to a \u201ccouncil of elders\u201d \u2014 older African-American men who serve as mentors and role models \u2014 and attend weekly classes to help them develop social and emotional skills like conflict negotiation and anger management.While Operation Peacemaker does attach conditions to fellowship stipends, fellows are never explicitly asked to put down their guns. Instead, fellows must make steady progress toward certain life goals, which can include finding safer housing, kicking substance abuse, getting a driver\u2019s license or paying off a parking ticket. The size of the stipend each month depends on how well fellows progress toward these goals. Boggan said he has written checks for as little as a dollar.In 2009, Richmond\u2019s homicide rate was by far the highest when compared to Oakland, Stockton, San Bernardino and Inglewood, four cities with populations over 100,000 with crime rates among the state\u2019s highest. By 2014, Richmond\u2019s rate was the lowest in that group, though the next year it nearly doubled and stayed that high through 2016. But even with the uptick, the city is now at a seven-year decrease of more than 50 percent, and officials in many cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore and Philadelphia, are watching Richmond closely.Perhaps the most remarkable outcome of Operation Peacemaker are the fellows themselves. Of the 84 who have participated since the program\u2019s inception, 69 haven\u2019t had a firearm-related injury, and 64 have not been suspects in a firearm-related crime. And then there\u2019s this: 79 of the 84 are still alive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Keep U.S. Jobs, Chip Makers Share a Factory and Pin Hopes on Trump", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "Computer chips are still made in the United States, but foreign competition is looming. The industry wants President Trump to help.Supported byLEHI, Utah \u2014 Nestled at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains here, the IM Flash plant is a paragon of American high-tech manufacturing.Robots glide along the ceiling, moving silicon wafers the size of dinner plates between hulking machines that deposit and etch microscopic layers of material to build the most advanced memory chips in the world.For the 1,700 technicians and scientists who tend to the robots and troubleshoot problems in the delicate manufacturing process, the jobs offer generous pay and benefits and easy access to Utah\u2019s many outdoor attractions.For Intel and Micron Technology, the two American companies that jointly own and operate IM Flash, the venture allows both of them to sell cutting-edge, three-dimensional memory chips while sharing the multibillion-dollar costs of a modern semiconductor factory.The memory chips produced at the plant are \u201cprobably one of the biggest advances of technology in the last 20 years,\u201d said Jon Carter, who oversees Micron\u2019s strategy for new memory products. And, as he was quick to point out, all of the work was done in the United States. \u201cMicron has done a really good job of having a good footprint on the home front,\u201d he said.In many ways, however, the IM Flash plant is an outlier. While companies based in the United States still dominate chip sales worldwide, only about 13 percent of the world\u2019s chip manufacturing capacity was in this country in 2015, down from 30 percent in 1990, according to government data.Chip makers attribute the decline to a variety of forces, including high American tax rates and the hefty subsidies offered by foreign governments for new semiconductor plants, which can cost as much as $10 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s quite a bit more expensive to build a factory in the U.S.,\u201d said Stacy J. Smith, the executive at Intel overseeing manufacturing, operations and sales. Intel \u2014 which predominantly manufactures in Oregon and Arizona but also has factories in Ireland, Israel and China \u2014 estimates that the extra cost for an American plant is more than $2 billion.Chip makers are hopeful that President Trump, who has promised large corporate tax cuts and a tougher approach to trade with China, will help them.Intel said it was talking with the Trump administration and Congress about a broad corporate tax cut as well as other ways to improve the financial incentives for chip makers to locate new projects here. Although the United States has 76 semiconductor plants, many of them are older, and few new ones are being built.Intel, whose work force relies heavily on highly skilled immigrants, is also pressing the administration to continue allowing such immigrants to enter the country. \u201cWe benefit from being able to hire the best talent from around the world,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The chip industry spends about one-fifth of its revenue on research and development, but it wants more federal funding for basic research into fundamental problems, like how to pack transistors closer together and whether materials other than silicon could form the basis of future chips.\u201cWe would like this administration to double down on investments in basic research in universities,\u201d said John Neuffer, the chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group that represents American chip makers. \u201cHelp us pedal faster.\u201dForeign countries have become more appealing for chip manufacturers, in part, because of the rise of contract chip foundries owned by Samsung of South Korea and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. They have made it easy for American tech companies like Qualcomm and Apple to design cutting-edge chips in the United States but outsource production to Asia.\u201cToday, it\u2019s a modest threat, but two, three, four years out, if China plays out as it plans, it could be very significant to subsectors of our industry,\u201d Mr. Neuffer said.Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., builds most of its chips in the United States. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, relies on company-owned plants in Asia for the majority of its production, but has a large American manufacturing presence. Both companies conduct most of their research and development in this country.The approach they have taken to 3-D memory chips illustrates the complexity of the business as well as the global forces pushing on the industry.The IM Flash plant in Lehi was built in 1994 and was Micron\u2019s first factory outside Boise. In 2005, Intel and Micron struck a partnership to expand the plant and make flash memory there, sharing costs and output.The two companies have spent the past 11 years developing the newest type of memory, which they call 3-D XPoint. The design combines the functions of a computer\u2019s ultrafast working memory and its slower, longer-term storage to create a hybrid aimed at companies like Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil, which need to process vast amounts of data reliably and at the highest speeds.David Kanter, the principal analyst at the research firm Real World Technologies, said the technology, which is still being tested by the first round of customers, was very promising. \u201cIt could the change the way that computing operates,\u201d he said.However, as with all new chip technologies, the initial products are likely to be expensive. The Lehi plant will continue to make traditional, cheap 2-D memory chips while gradually expanding production of the newer chips.Both companies have turned to foreign factories to hedge their bets with other products \u2014 less expensive, less capable 3-D flash memory designs aimed at the broad slice of the market that wants better performance but is unwilling to pay top dollar for the best technology available.Micron committed $4 billion to expand a plant it owns in Singapore to make the 3-D flash memory chips, which it began selling last year.Intel converted an aging factory it built a decade ago in Dalian, China, into one that produces state-of-the-art 3-D memory chips.\u201cChina is the largest market for us on the planet,\u201d said Mr. Smith of Intel. \u201cIt made sense to locate some production in China.\u201dIndeed, China is an integral part of Intel\u2019s long-term strategy. Although national security rules restrict the export of certain American chip technologies, the company has found other ways to operate in the country, where most of the world\u2019s computers and smartphones are built.Given China\u2019s position as the biggest buyer of American chips, the industry is concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of a trade battle with China. At the same time, chip makers believe that China has sometimes treated American companies unfairly and relish the idea of help from Washington on that front.Rob Magness, an IM Flash employee who works with the equipment that etches and polishes the silicon wafers, is optimistic, but said he knew just how fragile the industry was.During his 25 years making chips, he has seen employer after employer downsize and move factories offshore as they coped with the brutal economics of chip making.\u201cAll the places I came from are dying,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other two memory companies I worked for actually went under. The prices just got too cheap.\u201dAn article on Feb. 27 about computer chip makers\u2019 hopes that Trump administration policies will keep manufacturing in the United States referred incorrectly to the production of chips by Micron. The majority of them are made in Asia, not in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Loss in Court Doesn\u2019t Dim Excitement Over Huge Growth", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 From the spread of fake news to a nasty court fight in Texas, it has been a rough few months for Facebook. But company executives can take heart in two things: Despite an audience nudging toward two billion users, more and more people are still flocking to the service, and more and more advertisers are spending money on it.Facebook\u2019s fourth-quarter sales, announced Wednesday, handily beat Wall Street estimates. And even a $500 million jury verdict that went against the company earlier in the day did little to diminish enthusiasm about its finances.Facebook said sales had totaled $8.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, up 51 percent compared with a year ago, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations of $8.5 billion. Not surprisingly, user growth is at a peak.\u201cIn the past we\u2019ve taken steps to reduce spam and clickbait, and now we\u2019re approaching misinformation and hoaxes the same way,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said during a conference call with investors. He pointed to the company\u2019s closer ties to publishers and fact-checking organizations and the high priority it had placed on making changes to its news feed and ad network.The controversy over fake news seemed to have little effect on users\u2019 appetite for the website. Total profit for the quarter was $3.6 billion, annual ad revenue was up roughly $10 billion compared with 2015, and more than half of the site\u2019s 1.86 billion regular visitors used it daily.\u201cThe verdict is nonmaterial to our business,\u201d Sheryl K. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview. \u201cWe had a really strong quarter, capping off a really great year.\u201dFacebook paid $2 billion to acquire Oculus, which makes a headset, the Rift, that immerses users in 3-D games and videos. Mr. Zuckerberg has predicted that virtual reality could be the next big computing platform, like the smartphones of today or the personal computers of a decade ago.The financial damages were far lower than the up to $6 billion that the plaintiff, the games publisher ZeniMax Media, had sought, in part because the jury was unmoved by its argument that Oculus employees stole ZeniMax trade secrets.In a statement, Tera Randall, a spokeswoman for Oculus, said the company planned to appeal the verdict.\u201cThe heart of this case was about whether Oculus stole ZeniMax\u2019s trade secrets, and the jury found decisively in our favor,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed by a few other aspects of today\u2019s verdict, but we are undeterred.\u201dThe damages were nonetheless meaningful to ZeniMax, which publishes the Elder Scrolls series, the Fallout series and other well-known video games. The jury based the damages award on finding a series of copyright and trademark violations involving ZeniMax software by one or more of the defendants, a group that included Oculus and several of its employees.The biggest portion of the award stemmed from the finding that Palmer Luckey, an Oculus founder, had violated a confidentiality agreement he signed with ZeniMax as he was forming Oculus. ZeniMax said it was exploring options for preventing Oculus from its continued use of computer code that infringes on ZeniMax copyrights, including seeking a court order.\u201cTechnology is the foundation of our business, and we consider the theft of our intellectual property to be a serious matter,\u201d said Robert Altman, ZeniMax\u2019s chairman and chief executive. \u201cWe appreciate the jury\u2019s finding against the defendants and the award of half a billion dollars in damages for those serious violations.\u201dThat figure may decrease as litigation between the companies continues. But Facebook may not be too worried about it.As the results announced Wednesday showed, Facebook\u2019s dominance in internet advertising is surpassed only by Google\u2019s. And Ms. Sandberg\u2019s latest efforts to woo small businesses are paying off: Tens of millions of businesses market their products across Facebook and Instagram, the photo-sharing app it owns.Shares of Facebook rose 2.5 percent, to $136.69, in after-hours trading.Wall Street is looking for Facebook to show revenue growth outside its news feed, the social network\u2019s moneymaking ad machine. The company has cautioned analysts that it is nearing the limit of its ad load \u2014 the amount of ads it chooses to place between user-posted content like news stories and status updates \u2014 inside the feed.That means increased pressure on properties like Instagram, which recently announced that it had more than 600 million users.Although Facebook does not disclose revenue figures for Instagram, it said on Wednesday that five million businesses were now on the app and that its latest feature \u2014 a messaging service similar to Snapchat \u2014 was already being used by a quarter of Instagram\u2019s user base.An article on Feb. 2 about Facebook\u2019s loss in a court case, using information from a representative for the plaintiff, misstated the financial damages that the games publisher ZeniMax Media had sought in its lawsuit over the theft of trade secrets involving the virtual reality start-up Oculus, now owned by Facebook. ZeniMax sought up to $6 billion, not $4 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Intelligent Weaponry Gets Smarter", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert O. Work, the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump, calls them his \u201cA.I. dudes.\u201d The breezy moniker belies their serious task: The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts, and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield.Last spring, he asked, \u201cO.K., you guys are the smartest guys in A.I., right?\u201dNo, the dudes told him, \u201cthe smartest guys are at Facebook and Google,\u201d Mr. Work recalled in an interview.Now, increasingly, they\u2019re also in China. The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology, which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare.The Pentagon\u2019s plan to bring A.I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies.Last year, for example, Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech.That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence.Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons. In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on brand-new Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nation\u2019s leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons.But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls.In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagon\u2019s ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, today\u2019s new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees.As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nation\u2019s government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence.Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field.\u201cThe Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies,\u201d said Adam Segal, a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at the Council on Foreign Relations.The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as \u201cremote warfare,\u201d said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers.\u201cThey are making their machines more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cA little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost.\u201dWhether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States.Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and self-confident to understand the speed of the Chinese competition.\u201cThere are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then U.S. media reports only on the U.S. version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the U.S.\u201dThe company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a \u201cHumanoid Answering Robot.\u201d\u201cOur goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future,\u201d said Qingfeng Liu, Iflytek\u2019s chief executive.The speed of the Chinese technologists, compared to United States and European artificial intelligence developers, is noteworthy. Last April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intel\u2019s laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from Intel and Google to build a self-driving car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal \u2014 taking a demonstration to the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas \u2014 after just nine months of work.\u201cThe A.I. technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely home-brewed,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cWe wrote every line by ourselves.\u201dTheir first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis.The United States\u2019 view of China\u2019s advance may be starting to change. Last October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is now publishing more research than scholars here.Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make A.I. a priority in its military systems.Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view.\u201cIt is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in A.I., and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a Taiwanese-born artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both Microsoft\u2019s and Google\u2019s China-based research laboratories.Mr. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $675 million to invest in A.I. both in the United States and in China.\u201cUsing a chess analogy,\u201d he said, \u201cwe might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the master-level A.I. scientists.\u201dWhat is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American A.I. research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China.In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baidu\u2019s Silicon Valley A.I. Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit Stanford University artificial intelligence courses.One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom.Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly.In a reflection of the desire to become a center of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by Intel\u2019s Xeon processors; after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing.The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge.

{"Headline": "The Anti-Trump Activist Taking On Retailers", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Sitting in a basement office that she rents by the hour, Shannon Coulter ticks off the activities she gave up in defiance of President Donald J. Trump: renting movies with her husband on Amazon, and shopping at Nordstrom, Macy\u2019s and other retailers that sell Ivanka Trump\u2019s products.A Nordstrom bag sat on a nearby table. It represents a victory lap of sorts for Ms. Coulter, who has almost single-handedly spearheaded a retail revolt against the president and his family. She was wearing a new silver Elizabeth and James lariat necklace purchased at the department store soon after it scrubbed Ms. Trump\u2019s name from its website.\u201cThe goal,\u201d Ms. Coulter said, \u201ccame originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscience.\u201dIt\u2019s been a wild ride these past few months for Ms. Coulter, who runs her shoestring movement from her home, or from cheerfully decorated work spaces like this one \u2014 surrounded by bright-blue furniture, clam chairs and decorative pillows that feel more Silicon Valley than anti-administration war room.Thousands of people have contacted the stores Ms. Coulter has on her boycott list, including Macy\u2019s and Amazon. Retailers including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and T.J. Maxx have backed away from products connected to Ms. Trump, the president\u2019s oldest daughter, since Ms. Coulter\u2019s efforts began. A herd of activists and celebrities, including the feminist writer Gloria Steinem, the Olympic diver Greg Louganis and the actress Lucy Lawless of \u201cXena: Warrior Princess,\u201d have expressed support.The attention has transformed Ms. Coulter, 45, a digital marketing specialist, into the unlikely general of the digital army now supporting her campaign, Grab Your Wallet.\u201cPeople describe me as an activist in media coverage, I don\u2019t know who they\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything this organized or structured or purposeful.\u201dThe new role has taken up much of her time, and has made her the target of criticism and attacks from Trump supporters. She\u2019s lost count of how many times she has been called a \u201cbully\u201d or a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d The abuse gets more menacing with each victory; a recent email included her mother\u2019s name in the subject line, with threats to publish more of her personal information.In the latest twist, the boycott has drawn Ms. Coulter, a self-described progressive liberal, into a growing debate over whether targeting Ms. Trump is sexist.And she said she worries that people will think she is profiting from the venture. Ms. Coulter was particularly upset when a knockoff \u201cGrab Your Wallet\u201d group sold clothing and other merchandise on Facebook. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a T-shirt, we don\u2019t have stickers, nothing,\u201d she said, adding that she does not accept compensation from companies, or donations.\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us envisioned that some of the things that have happened would happen,\u201d said Sue Atencio, who helped Ms. Coulter get the site started.In many ways, Ms. Coulter has embraced her new position. She answers emails at all hours and scours Twitter for tips on companies to add, or remove, from the boycott list. Then there are the phone calls \u2014 lots and lots of phone calls \u2014 from angry Trump supporters or journalists or the companies that want to get off her list.There is no doubt that it has changed her life. She doesn\u2019t sleep or socialize as often as she used to. Most of her work on Grab Your Wallet is done after she eats dinner with her husband, taking up what free time she has.\u201cShe went underground, basically,\u201d said Amie Penwell, a fellow San Francisco resident who hasn\u2019t seen much of her friend of seven years recently.The negative attention has made Ms. Coulter careful about her privacy. She insisted on meeting at the work space for an interview, to avoid having a reporter at her home, out of fear that it could be targeted. She would not let her husband, whom she met online in 2010, be interviewed.Born in Indiana, Ms. Coulter studied journalism at Penn State. She said she began her career by \u201cpiggybacking\u201d on the Bay Area\u2019s technology boom, helping start-ups with their email marketing.A year ago she started her own agency, DoubleKnown, which helps executives and small businesses build their online presence through blog posts, social media feeds and other digital tools. The company has one other employee and a handful of education and technology clients, but has stopped taking on new accounts since Grab Your Wallet took off.Political activism has not been a big part of Ms. Coulter\u2019s life since college, when she spoke at a rally raising awareness about violence against women. Her most recent organized effort came after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015, when she circulated a list of lawmakers who had voted against tougher gun control measures.\u201cMaybe that gave me a taste of what something like this would be like,\u201d she said, describing herself as a chronic list maker. \u201cI like the efficiency of them.\u201dAfter becoming incensed by the video, Ms. Coulter began searching retailers\u2019 websites for Trump-branded products and collecting the names on a spreadsheet. Wondering who else might be interested in a boycott, she looked at Twitter, and found Ms. Atencio, who had tweeted \u201cfashion not fascism.\u201dMs. Coulter contacted her and suggested they announce the boycott together.Since then, most of the work has fallen to Ms. Coulter, though she refers to Ms. Atencio as her \u201cspiritual guide\u201d and sounding board. Ms. Atencio, 59, sees herself as the less visible half of a musical duo. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the Garfunkel and Shannon is Paul Simon,\u201d Ms. Atencio said.Grab Your Wallet now includes a list of places to shop and not shop, and a short script for people who want to call companies to complain. As many as 32,000 people visit her site in an hour, Ms. Coulter said. When the women\u2019s marches took place across the country in January, 350,000 people arrived during a 24-hour period.In early February, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus removed Ms. Trump\u2019s name from their websites. Employees at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls were instructed not to display Ivanka Trump products and to throw her signs in the trash.None of the retailers credited Grab Your Wallet with their decision \u2014 the department stores blamed poor sales \u2014 and it is not possible to know to what degree Ms. Coulter and her followers have influenced the companies\u2019 decision making. But in the waning days of January, Trump-related complaints, many of which mentioned Grab Your Wallet, were Nordstrom\u2019s most common customer feedback, according to a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to speak publicly. Nordstrom said it did not have \u201cspecific numbers\u201d on the number of customers it had heard from.Monitoring those spikes, updating her list and responding to emails, tweets and press inquiries have become Ms. Coulter\u2019s second full-time job.\u201cMy life is so completely here,\u201d she said, gesturing to her MacBook, \u201cthat it all just sort of overlaps and is an endless stream of emails and tweets and Facebook posts.\u201dShe does get some help from volunteers, like the woman who helps run the legitimate Grab Your Wallet Facebook group, which has more than 12,000 members. But for the most part, Ms. Coulter is on her own.That means the threats and negative attention are also directed largely at her. People ask her why she\u2019s \u201cattacking another woman,\u201d or call her a bully.\u201cWe have to stop destroying women based on the men in their lives,\u201d Ms. Pirro said during a recent episode of her show.S.E. Cupp, a conservative author and commentator, stopped short of calling the boycott of Ms. Trump\u2019s products sexist. But in an email, Ms. Cupp said that it seemed \u201cmisdirected.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m never a fan of going after the kids, grown or not, of presidents,\u201d she said. \u201cNor does it feel consistent with the anti-Trump argument \u2014 that he\u2019s \u2018anti-woman\u2019 \u2014 to economically punish his daughter, a working wife and mother.\u201dA spokesman for Ms. Trump\u2019s brand declined to make someone at the company available for an interview. In a statement, the company said it had been \u201cswept into the political fray, becoming collateral damage in others\u2019 efforts to advance agendas unrelated to what we do.\u201dMs. Coulter finds such comments perplexing. She pointed out that Ms. Trump moved to Washington and has taken on an informal advisory role in the White House. She frequently sits in on her father\u2019s meetings with foreign leaders. Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, the real estate developer Jared Kushner, is a top adviser to President Trump.In addition, Ms. Coulter said, Ms. Trump played a prominent role in the presidential campaign.\u201cSomeone who passionately campaigned for a man who likes to grab women by the genitals will never convince me that she\u2019s on the side of women,\u201d she said. \u201cEver.\u201dMs. Steinem also said that Ms. Trump was fair game, particularly after the election, when it can no longer be argued that she is just doing her \u201cfilial duty\u201d on the campaign trail.\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to boycott her not because he is her father,\u201d Ms. Steinem said, \u201cbut because she supports his policies.\u201dMs. Steinem specifically faulted Ms. Trump\u2019s proposed parental-leave policy for its exclusion of fathers and non-birth mothers.Despite the long hours, Ms. Coulter said she could continue running Grab Your Wallet indefinitely. She\u2019s considering turning the campaign into a nonprofit and running it full time, and is struggling to figure out what to do with her fledgling business.\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand what the right next step is,\u201d she said. \u201cI think as long as he\u2019s in office, this will be alive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the interest of public tranquillity we will not dwell on the nuclear codes in his office.From the start, the Trump administration was a dark combination of mean and inept. But it was, on occasion, at least sort of mesmerizing. For instance, on Wednesday the nominee for secretary of labor went down the drain. Because somebody thought it was a good plan to go for a cabinet member with a history that includes employing an illegal immigrant housekeeper and an ex-wife who once went on \u201cOprah\u201d to talk about spousal abuse.Back in the good old days last week, Kellyanne was in trouble for violating the rule against federal officials giving endorsements.

The kind of thing we could have complained about at dinner parties for a month without losing our appetites.The majority of American voters who didn\u2019t support Donald Trump used to watch him on TV with a kind of cynical amusement as he bragged about fake election results and crowd sizes. Now every time it happens you can\u2019t help thinking \u2014 wow, is this guy really unhinged? On Wednesday, in the middle of a press conference with the prime minister of Israel, Trump responded to a question about anti-Semitism in America by immediately pointing out he had won 306 Electoral College votes. (\u201cWe were not supposed to crack 220.\u201d)And the president was so out to sea he couldn\u2019t come up with a consistent cover story for why Flynn left.

Except for the part where our president dealt with the crisis over their new ballistic missile while dining at Mar-a-Lago in front of throngs of resort guests and their Facebook friends.It is true that Trump and Kim Jong-un both share an affinity for peculiar haircuts and public shows of adoration.

{"Headline": "A Bilingual Cameroon Teeters After English Speakers Protest Treatment", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAMENDA, Cameroon \u2014 Lawyers have long put up with laws that aren\u2019t translated into their native English. They have endured French-speaking judges whose English is barely passable and who aren\u2019t familiar with their judicial system.Last fall, after another new law, regarding business transactions, was not translated, the lawyers here in Bamenda, a bustling city in Cameroon\u2019s northwest, decided they\u2019d had enough. They organized a demonstration to protest a government that they believed had long slighted their English-speaking region by failing to uphold a constitutional promise of a bilingual nation.The demonstrations grew, as teachers vented their frustration that the government in Yaound\u00e9 \u2014 dominated by the French-speaking majority \u2014 sent teachers with shoddy English skills to schools in their area. Hundreds of citizens joined in, carrying banners and chanting against what they said were longtime injustices against their region.By December, the protests had turned violent. Security forces used live ammunition to disperse demonstrations in Bamenda. At least two unarmed protesters were killed and others were injured, according to human rights groups. News media reports said as many as four protesters died.As the violence and calls for secession in English-speaking areas rise, the issue is quickly becoming a big problem for the central government. In recent days, protest organizers have called on businesses in Anglophone areas to stop paying taxes.For four decades, Cameroon was split into English and French territories. After independence in the early 1960s, the nation unified into one republic made up mostly of French speakers and a minority who speak English and adhere to British common law. The setup has been plagued by constitutional disputes and complaints from English speakers who say the government gives them fewer resources and generally fails to represent their interests.Cameroon, a Central African nation so geographically and ethnically diverse it is known as \u201call Africa in one country,\u201d has been ruled since 1982 by President Paul Biya, 83, who spends weeks at a time in European hotels and is seen as increasingly out of touch with a growing population of young people.The demonstrations have spread to Buea, an English-speaking city in the southwest, where a video circulated on social media of police officers hovering over female students lying in the mud and of officers beating students in their dormitories.In recent weeks, dozens of protesters have been arrested and moved to Yaound\u00e9.\u201cWe don\u2019t call it arrested; we call it abducted,\u201d said one government employee who considered the detentions in a French-speaking city yet another slight to English speakers. The worker comes from an English-speaking area and did not want to be identified out of fear for his safety and that of his family.Protesters have been accused of violence, too. But the government\u2019s heavy-handed response has revived calls in the English-speaking area to break away from the rest of the country, further inflaming the situation.\u201cCameroon is one and indivisible and shall so remain,\u201d Issa Tchiroma Bakary, Cameroon\u2019s information minister, told reporters at a news conference last month.American diplomats have called for a peaceful resolution of the dispute. The government and protesters have tried to negotiate.A group of lawyers who organized the protests came up with a list of grievances, but before they could be fully resolved, Nkongho Felix Agbor-Balla, the president of the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium, and Fontem Neba, the group\u2019s secretary general, were arrested.On the same day as their arrests, Jan. 17, the government declared the group illegal.\u201cAny other related groups with similar objectives,\u201d according to a government letter presented to the news media, \u201care hereby prohibited all over the national territory.\u201dThe jailed lawyers have been charged with inciting terrorism, a crime that landed them before a military tribunal, raising alarms from human rights groups. Last month, Amnesty International called for the release of Mr. Agbor-Balla and Dr. Neba, saying their detention was unlawful.\u201cThese two men have been arrested solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression,\u201d said Ilaria Allegrozzi, a Central Africa researcher for Amnesty. \u201cThis flagrant disregard for basic rights risks inflaming an already tense situation in the English-speaking region of the country and is clearly an attempt to muzzle dissent.\u201dWith protest organizers in jail, members of the Cameroonian diaspora have intervened, sending messages to supporters by WhatsApp and Facebook.Government officials circulated their own warning message to WhatsApp users, cautioning them that they risked up to two years in prison if they spread information on social media that they could not prove.The government has shut down the internet in English-speaking areas, angering a population accustomed to using social media to communicate, and internet-based cash transfers to send money for business transactions and to relatives.In English-speaking towns recently the population seems to disappear on some days. The streets are quiet, shops close down and classrooms sit empty as daily life is suspended, in a form of protest called Operation Ghost Town, organized by English-speaking Cameroonians.In English-speaking areas, demonstrators have turned violent against people who have not supported the Ghost Town movement, which is hampering commerce and keeping students from classrooms.A few days ago, a shop in an English-speaking town that reportedly stayed open during a Ghost Town protest day was set on fire. And a message circulating on social media warned students at the University of Bamenda to boycott classes or \u201cthe blood of those killed in this struggle will be on their heads.\u201dFrancois Essomba reported from Bamenda, Cameroon, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.Advertisement"}

Sessions as a federal district court judge for the Southern District of Alabama. My professional and personal roots in Alabama are deep and lasting.Anyone who has used the power of his office as United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to our courts.Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.For this reprehensible conduct, he should not be rewarded with a federal judgeship.I regret that a long-standing commitment prevents me from appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However, I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr. Sessions\u2019 confirmation and I request that my statement as well as this letter \u2018be made a part of the\u2019 hearing record.I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr. Sessions.Sincerely,Coretta Scott KingHere is the text of the statement.Statement of Coretta Scott King on the Nomination of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III for the United States District Court Southern District of AlabamaSenate Judiciary CommitteeThursday, March 13, 1986Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to express my strong opposition to the nomination of Jefferson Sessions for a federal district judgeship for the Southern District of Alabama. My longstanding commitment which I shared with my husband, Martin, to protect and enhance the rights of Black Americans, rights which include equal access to the democratic process, compels me to testify today.Civil rights leaders, including my husband and Albert Turner, have fought long and hard to achieve free and unfettered access to the ballot box. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen. Mr. Sessions\u2019 conduct as U.S. Attorney, from his politically motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his indifference toward criminal violations of civil rights laws, indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness and judgment to be a federal judge.The Voting Rights Act was, and still is, vitally important to the future of democracy in the United States. I was privileged to join Martin and many others during the Selma to Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965. Martin was particularly impressed by the determination to get the franchise of blacks in Selma and neighboring Perry County. As he wrote, \u201cCertainly no community in the history of the Negro struggle has responded with the enthusiasm of Selma and her neighboring town of Marion. Where Birmingham depended largely upon students and unemployed adults (to participate in non-violent protest of the denial of the franchise), Selma has involved fully 10 percent of the Negro population in active demonstrations, and at least half the Negro population of Marion was arrested on one day.\u201d Martin was referring of course to a group that included the defendants recently prosecuted for assisting elderly and illiterate blacks to exercise that franchise. ln fact, Martin anticipated from the depth of their commitment twenty years ago, that a united political organization would remain in Perry County long after the other marchers had left. This organization, the Perry County Civic League, started by Mr. Turner, Mr. Hogue, and others as Martin predicted, continued \u201cto direct the drive for votes and other rights.\u201d In the years since the Voting Rights Act was passed, Black Americans in Marion, Selma and elsewhere have made important strides in their struggle to participate actively in the electoral process. The number of Blacks registered to vote in key Southern states has doubled since 1965. This would not have been possible without the Voting Rights Act.However, Blacks still fall far short of having equal participation in the electoral process. Particularly in the South, efforts continue to be made to deny Blacks access to the polls, even where Blacks constitute the majority of the voters. It has been a long up-hill struggle to keep alive the vital legislation that protects the most fundamental right to vote. A person who has exhibited so much hostility to the enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise of those rights by Black people should not be elevated to the federal bench.The irony of Mr. Sessions\u2019 nomination is that, if confirmed, he will be given life tenure for doing with a federal prosecution what the local sheriffs accomplished twenty years ago with clubs and cattle prods. Twenty years ago, when we marched from Selma to Montgomery, the fear of voting was real, as the broken bones and bloody heads in Selma and Marion bore witness. As my husband wrote at the time, \u201cit was not just a sick imagination that conjured up the vision of a public official, sworn to uphold the law, who forced an inhuman march upon hundreds of Negro children; who ordered the Rev. James Bevel to be chained to his sickbed; who clubbed a Negro woman registrant, and who callously inflicted repeated brutalities and indignities upon nonviolent Negroes peacefully petitioning for their constitutional right to vote.\u201dFree exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to American democracy that we can not tolerate any form of infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been disenfranchised in our nation\u2019s history, none has struggled longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than Black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box denied so persistently and intently. Over the past century, a broad array of schemes have been used in attempts to block the Black vote. The range of techniques developed with the purpose of repressing black voting rights run the gamut from the \u2014 straightforward application of brutality against black citizens who tried to vote to such legalized frauds as \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d exclusions and rigged literacy tests.The actions taken by Mr. Sessions in regard to the 1984 voting fraud prosecutions represent just one more technique used to intimidate Black voters and thus deny them this most precious franchise. The investigations into the absentee voting process were conducted only in the Black Belt counties where blacks had finally achieved political power in the local government. Whites had been using the absentee process to their advantage for years, without incident. Then, when Blacks realizing its strength, began to use it with success, criminal investigations were begun.In these investigations, Mr. Sessions, as U.S. Attorney, exhibited an eagerness to bring to trial and convict three leaders of the Perry County Civic League including Albert Turner despite evidence clearly demonstrating their innocence of any wrongdoing. Furthermore, in initiating the case, Mr. Sessions ignored allegations of similar behavior by whites, choosing instead to chill the exercise of the franchise by blacks by his misguided investigation. In fact, Mr. Sessions sought to punish older black civil rights activists, advisors and colleagues of my husband, who had been key figures in the civil rights movement in the 1960\u2019s. These were persons who, realizing the potential of the absentee vote among Blacks, had learned to use the process within the bounds of legality and had taught others to do the same. The only sin they committed was being too successful in gaining votes.The scope and character of the investigations conducted by Mr. Sessions also warrant grave concern. Witnesses were selectively chosen in accordance with the favorability of their testimony to the government\u2019s case. Also, the prosecution illegally withheld from the defense critical statements made by witnesses. Witnesses who did testify were pressured and intimidated into submitting the \u201ccorrect\u201d testimony. Many elderly blacks were visited multiple times by the FBI who then hauled them over 180 miles by bus to a grand jury in Mobile when they could more easily have testified at a grand jury twenty miles away in Selma. These voters, and others, have announced they are now never going to vote again.I urge you to consider carefully Mr. Sessions\u2019 conduct in these matters. Such a review, I believe, raises serious questions about his commitment to the protection of the voting rights of all American citizens and consequently his fair and unbiased judgment regarding this fundamental right. When the circumstances and facts surrounding the indictments of Al Turner, his wife, Evelyn, and Spencer Hogue are analyzed, it becomes clear that the motivation was political, and the result frightening \u2014 the wide-scale chill of the exercise of the ballot for blacks, who suffered so much to receive that right in the first place. Therefore, it is my strongly-held view that the appointment of Jefferson Sessions to the federal bench would irreparably damage the work of my husband, Al Turner, and countless others who risked their lives and freedom over the past twenty years to ensure equal participation in our democratic system.The exercise of the franchise is an essential means by which our citizens ensure that those who are governing will be responsible. My husband called it the number one civil right. The denial of access to the ballot box ultimately results in the denial of other fundamental rights. For, it \u2018 is only when the poor and disadvantaged are empowered that they are able to participate actively in the solutions to their own problems.We still have a long way to go before we can say that minorities no longer need be concerned about discrimination at the polls. Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and Asian Americans are grossly underrepresented at every level of government in America. If we are going to make our timeless dream of justice through democracy a reality, we must take every possible step to ensure that the spirit and intent of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution is honored.The federal courts hold a unique position in our constitutional system, ensuring that minorities and other citizens without political power have a forum in which to vindicate their rights. Because of his unique role, it is essential that the people selected to be federal judges respect the basic tenets of our legal system: respect for individual rights and a commitment to equal justice for all. The integrity of the Courts, and thus the rights they protect, can only be maintained if citizens feel confident that those selected as federal judges will be able to judge with fairness others holding differing views.I do not believe Jefferson Sessions possesses the requisite judgment, competence, and sensitivity to the rights guaranteed by the federal civil rights laws to qualify for appointment to the federal district court. Based on his record, I believe his confirmation would have a devastating effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my husband\u2019s dream that he envisioned over twenty years ago.

{"Headline": "Netanyahu\u2019s Meeting With Trump to Set Tone for U.S.-Israel Relations", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 As President Trump appeared to shift closer to the political center on several contentious policies on Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested on Sunday that it was unrealistic to expect their two countries to agree completely on all issues.But amid growing challenges from the right, Mr. Netanyahu said he was the strongest leader to navigate the relationship \u2014 the nation\u2019s most important, yet often its trickiest.The Israeli leader\u2019s comments came the night before he leaves for Washington for his first face-to-face meeting with Mr. Trump as president.And on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu was quoted on Army Radio telling members of his right-wing Likud Party that \u201cto believe there are no restrictions now would be a mistake.\u201dThe meeting with Mr. Trump on Wednesday is expected to set the tone for the American-Israeli relationship, which was notably frosty under President Barack Obama because of Israeli settlements in occupied territory, Israel\u2019s vehement opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran and personality clashes with Mr. Netanyahu.Although Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the settlements have tamped down expectations on the right of a new era unfettered by American constraints, some analysts here portray the president\u2019s position as politically beneficial to Mr. Netanyahu. He is portraying himself as an experienced hand in dealing with Washington \u2014 unlike, he suggested, more aggressive forces on the right who are suggesting an annexation of some settlements.\u201cI have navigated Israeli-U.S. relations in a prudent manner, and I will continue to do so now,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu told cabinet members on Sunday, according to an official transcript of his remarks, in which he noted that he and Mr. Trump \u201chave known each other for years.\u201dHis main rival to the right, Naftali Bennett, the Jewish Home Party leader and education minister, warned Mr. Netanyahu not to discuss the possibility of a state for Palestinians \u2014 though Mr. Netanyahu has tepidly endorsed one and Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that he would like to make an unspecified \u201cdeal\u201d for peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\u201cIf in their statements after the meeting they mention, for the first time in Trump\u2019s term, their obligation to forming Palestine or two states in one way or another, we will all feel it in our flesh for years to come,\u201d Mr. Bennett warned in a Facebook post. \u201cThe earth will shake.\u201dThe tussle between the two men is personal \u2014 Mr. Bennett would like to succeed Mr. Netanyahu as prime minister \u2014 and central to the longstanding conflict here: Mr. Bennett argues that the time for a separate state for Palestinians is over and that Israel has an opportunity under Mr. Trump to significantly expand Jewish presence in the West Bank.Mr. Trump has also backed off, for now at least, a campaign promise to relocate the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a move opposed by the Palestinians, who would consider it a de facto recognition of Israel\u2019s annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war.Here again, political analysts have seen Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s influence, with the prime minister possibly communicating that such a move was not a top priority given the reaction it could provoke among Palestinians.The Israeli news media also reported over the weekend that Tzipi Livni, a prominent Israeli lawmaker, may be offered a position as an under secretary-general for the United Nations chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oscars Mistake Casts Unwanted Spotlight on PwC", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Oscar for best picture was being presented at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday night, Tim Ryan, the United States chairman of PwC, was sitting in a plush seat in the Dolby Theater, watching with satisfaction.PwC, an accounting firm based in London, has tabulated the votes for the Academy Awards for 83 years. And the Oscars, while not its most lucrative client, is perhaps its most important. The firm leans on its long history as Hollywood\u2019s chief vote-counter to enhance its appeal in efforts like business development and recruiting.So when \u201cLa La Land\u201d was named the best-picture winner and the producers began delivering their acceptance speeches, it appeared Mr. Ryan\u2019s work for the night was done.Then chaos erupted on the stage. A PwC partner had handed Warren Beatty, a presenter of the award, the wrong envelope. Faye Dunaway, presenting the award with Mr. Beatty, erroneously announced that \u201cLa La Land\u201d had won. Moments later, after the two PwC partners who oversee the voting came onstage, the \u201cLa La Land\u201d producers announced that \u201cMoonlight\u201d was in fact the winner.Mr. Ryan watched in horror as the bizarre scene played out before Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars and tens of millions of people watching around the globe. In a dizzying turn of events, his firm, which normally occupies a back seat at the glamorous event, was suddenly at the center of one of the most sensational stories in Oscars history.\u201cI knew something was up,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Monday, zeroing in on the discordant moment when he noticed two of his employees interrupting the best picture acceptance speeches. \u201cIt\u2019s not their job to come out on stage.\u201dAs the magnitude of the gaffe set in, Mr. Ryan went into crisis-management mode.\u201cWhat was going though my head at the time was, \u2018We have to get to the bottom of this, and if we made a mistake, we\u2019ll own up to it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cMy philosophy in life is, bad news doesn\u2019t age well.\u201dReaction to the mistake has been swift and harsh.On Monday, the hashtags #envelopegate and #Oscarfail were trending on Twitter, and PwC, a business that markets its services to other businesses, was newly on the tip of many consumers\u2019 tongues in an unforgiving fashion.Just as quickly as the fortunes of \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d changed, PwC, one of the so-called Big Four accounting firms, had a major brand crisis on its hands.\u201cNot since Janet Jackson and her wardrobe malfunction on the Super Bowl have we seen something quite as glaring as this snafu,\u201d said Andrew D. Gilman, the chief executive of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group, referring to the 2004 episode. Although most of PwC\u2019s clients are aware that mistakes can happen, \u201cthe name of the firm has unfortunately been a little sullied,\u201d he added.PwC was quick to accept responsibility for the mistake.According to Mr. Ryan and others briefed on the process, a PwC partner, Brian Cullinan, handed Mr. Beatty the wrong envelope.Instead of the envelope containing the winner for best picture, Mr. Cullinan accidentally handed Mr. Beatty a duplicate of the envelope for best actress \u2014 an award Emma Stone had accepted for her role in \u201cLa La Land\u201d just moments before.For the Oscars, PwC uses two complete sets of the envelopes, with one placed on each side of the stage. Mr. Cullinan was handling one side, and the other partner overseeing the voting process, Martha L. Ruiz, was handling the other. It isn\u2019t clear what led Mr. Cullinan to hand Mr. Beatty the wrong envelope.The design of the envelopes could have been a factor. The envelopes were redesigned this year to feature red paper with gold lettering that specified the award enclosed, rather than gold paper with dark lettering. That could have made the lettering harder to read. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, not PwC, is responsible for the design and procurement of the envelopes.Whatever the reason, PwC was left searching for answers. As celebrities and guests hit the town for celebrations, Mr. Ryan spent the hours after the awards show speaking with Mr. Cullinan, Ms. Ruiz, members of the Academy and the show\u2019s producers.\u201cI spent the bulk of the night with Brian trying to understand what happened,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much in terms of parties last night.\u201dMr. Ryan and others at PwC were scrambling to contain the damage all night. The firm released a statement early Monday apologizing and taking responsibility for the mistake. Later in the day, Mr. Ryan wrote an email to PwC employees.It is too early to tell how the error will affect the PwC brand.A privately held partnership, PwC provides accounting, tax advisory and consulting services to most of the world\u2019s largest corporations. It reported sales of $36 billion during its last fiscal year, up 7 percent from the previous year. The entertainment and media sector accounted for just 4.2 percent of sales.PwC would not comment on its financial arrangement with the Academy, and Mr. Ryan said that there had not been any discussions about whether its longstanding contract was in jeopardy.But how clients think of PwC may change.Mr. Gilman, the crisis communications specialist, said he was curious to see if PwC kept the Oscars contract. \u201cThey have branded themselves around this event saying, \u2018We\u2019re trusted\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s the implication. Now I think that will take a hit.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the Dolby Theater. It is in Hollywood, not downtown Los Angeles.An article on Tuesday about the effect on the reputation of the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers after its mistake on the Best Picture award at the Oscars rendered incorrectly the name of an advertising agency it recently selected.

{"Headline": "Reports of Raids Have Immigrants Bracing for Enforcement Surge", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Austin, Tex., undocumented women working in a laundromat cowered in the back of the room, petrified after seeing a video and a photograph of apprehensions outside a local grocery store and burger joint.A day laborer and mechanic in Staten Island told his 17-year-old son where the list of emergency contacts were, including the name of the guardian who would take responsibility for him and his two younger siblings.In Savannah, Ga., undocumented restaurant workers were asking for rides rather than walking home, afraid they might be stopped and questioned.As reports of immigration raids and roundups have rocketed across Twitter, Facebook and texts around the country, undocumented immigrants, their lawyers and advocacy groups are bracing for the increased enforcement that President Trump has called for.\u201cThese are agents going into apartment buildings or agents going to worksites,\u201d said Ms. Volpe, who had a client arrested, along with five others, at a construction site in Washington last week. \u201cThis is new.\u201dHer case \u201cillustrates the new reality\u201d in the United States, said the message, from the foreign ministry.Officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, said the immigration roundups that people were seeing did not represent an increased tempo. The agency has about 100 fugitive teams constantly working to bring in those wanted on a variety of immigration offenses, and these teams have been just as active as they were during the Obama administration, officials said. In 2012, the most active year for deportations during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, 409,849 people were deported.In a news release Friday, ICE described as routine a five-day \u201ctargeted enforcement action\u201d in which roughly 160 people were arrested in six counties around Los Angeles. Of those, 150 had criminal histories, some of them serious.Some had already been ordered deported before Mr. Trump took office; according to ICE statistics, there are 960,000 people with deportation orders who are not in custody.\u201cThe rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible,\u201d ICE said in a statement Friday. \u201cThese reports create panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger.\u201dOfficials noted, however, that they did expect the numbers and deportations to increase in line with the president\u2019s order. In Los Angeles, for example, the county sheriff\u2019s department was told by ICE that it planned to issue \u201cdetainers\u201d for every illegal immigrant charged with a crime, no matter how serious, according to Capt. Elier Morejon.\u201cOne challenge here is that every single enforcement action done outside the jail looks like Trump\u2019s deportation force,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as we know, under Obama enforcement was very high.\u201d\u201cThe distinguishing factor under Trump is justifiable fear and anxiety,\u201d he added. \u201cThose are categorically new.\u201dThough New York City is a so-called sanctuary city where the police and jail officials do not automatically cooperate with immigration agents, undocumented immigrants can still be picked up in many places.Patricia Lavelle, a public defender in New York who represents immigrants in criminal cases, has begun telling her clients about the two main places where they could be apprehended by immigration officials: outside of courthouses before or after appearances, or at home, if they are living at the same address that they provided to the police when they were charged.\u201cI\u2019ll ask, \u2018Are you still at that address? Because if you are not, it\u2019s harder for them to find you,\u2019 \u201d she said, \u201cYou sort of let them put two and two together.\u201dAs to whether that advice could lead some clients to avoid showing up for court \u2014 lawyers are not supposed to encourage clients to become fugitives \u2014 \u201cthere is a tension there,\u201d Ms. Lavelle said.\u201cBut I would tell them that a warrant issued for your arrest is not something you would want.\u201dImmigrant advocacy groups like Make the Road New York have been holding regular \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d workshops in case ICE comes to the door, and one on Wednesday in Queens drew 40 people.Esmeralda, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico in Alexandria, Va., is trying to find a new place to live with her 2-year-old daughter after her husband was deported to Mexico after a routine check-in at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office. She is now wondering if she should apply for a visa \u2014 which could end up in her becoming legal, or put her at risk because it notifies the government of her presence here.\u201cI have to look out for her,\u201d she said of her daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and her now.\u201dIn Savannah, the immigrant community has been on high alert this week. Social media posts spread around town, warning of the presence of ICE agents in various trailer parks, and informing people of their rights if confronted by an agent.In Austin on Friday, more than a dozen women in a laundromat were trading news in Spanish gleaned from text messages and Facebook feeds about enforcement actions in the area. In one case, an ICE agent was injured during a scuffle with a man who had been arrested in a parking lot, according to the agency.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that ICE officers have significantly more presence in Austin, and they are arresting people at street stops,\u201d said Denise Gilman, director of the University of Texas Immigration Law Clinic. She said it appeared the agency was targeting people who already had deportation orders against them, and then catching others in their dragnet.One woman in the laundromat, who is 42 years old and asked not to be named because she came here illegally from Mexico, wrote down a list of phone numbers for her boss, who is documented, and arranged for her boss to pick up her 11-year-old son from school if she was detained.\u201cI wanted to throw up, but now I have a plan so I feel calmer,\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Ron Nixon, Ciaran McEvoy, Jennifer Medina, Meredith Hoffman, Manny Fernandez and Richard Fausset.Advertisement"}

Sidewalks resemble broken china, and 15 elementary schools have crumbled or caved in.Much is being written about climate change and the impact of rising seas on waterfront populations. But coasts are not the only places affected. Mexico City \u2014 high in the mountains, in the center of the country \u2014 is a glaring example. The world has a lot invested in crowded capitals like this one, with vast numbers of people, huge economies and the stability of a hemisphere at risk.How climate change is challenging the world\u2019s urban centers.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.One study predicts that 10 percent of Mexicans ages 15 to 65 could eventually try to emigrate north as a result of rising temperatures, drought and floods, potentially scattering millions of people and heightening already extreme political tensions over immigration.The effects of climate change are varied and opportunistic, but one thing is consistent: They are like sparks in the tinder. They expose cities\u2019 biggest vulnerabilities, inflaming troubles that politicians and city planners often ignore or try to paper over. And they spread outward, defying borders.That\u2019s what this series is about \u2014 how global cities tackle climate threats, or fail to. Around the world, extreme weather and water scarcity are accelerating repression, regional conflicts and violence. A Columbia University report found that where rainfall declines, \u201cthe risk of a low-level conflict escalating to a full-scale civil war approximately doubles the following year.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s term for climate change is \u201cthreat multiplier.\u201dAnd nowhere does this apply more obviously than in cities. This is the first urban century in human history, the first time more people live in cities than don\u2019t, with predictions that three-quarters of the global population will be urban by 2050. By that time, according to another study, there may be more than 700 million climate refugees on the move.For many cities around the world, adapting to climate change is a route to long-term prosperity. That\u2019s the good news, where societies are willing to listen. But adaptation can also be costly and slow. It can run counter to the rhythms of political campaigns and headlong into powerful, entrenched interests, confounding business as usual. This is, in effect, what happened in New Orleans, which ignored countless warning signs, destroyed natural protections, gave developers a free pass and failed to reinforce levees before Hurricane Katrina left much of the city in ruins.Unlike traffic jams or crime, climate change isn\u2019t something most people easily feel or see. It is certainly not what residents in Mexico City talk about every day. But it is like an approaching storm, straining an already precarious social fabric and threatening to push a great city toward a breaking point.As Arnoldo Kramer, Mexico City\u2019s chief resilience officer, put it: \u201cClimate change has become the biggest long-term threat to this city\u2019s future. And that\u2019s because it is linked to water, health, air pollution, traffic disruption from floods, housing vulnerability to landslides \u2014 which means we can\u2019t begin to address any of the city\u2019s real problems without facing the climate issue.\u201dThere\u2019s much more at stake than this city\u2019s well being. At the extreme, if climate change wreaks havoc on the social and economic fabric of global linchpins like Mexico City, warns the writer Christian Parenti, \u201cno amount of walls, guns, barbed wire, armed aerial drones or permanently deployed mercenaries will be able to save one half of the planet from the other.\u201dAn element of magical realism plays into Mexico City\u2019s sinking. At a roundabout along the Paseo de la Reforma, the city\u2019s wide downtown boulevard, the gilded Angel of Independence, a symbol of Mexican pride, looks over a sea of traffic from the top of a tall Corinthian column.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.Tourists snap pictures without realizing that when Mexico\u2019s president cut the ribbon for the column in 1910, the monument sat on a sculptured base reached by climbing nine shallow steps. But over the decades, the whole neighborhood around the monument sank, like a receding ocean at low tide, gradually marooning the Angel. Fourteen large steps eventually had to be added to the base so that the monument still connected to the street.Deeper in the city\u2019s historic center, the rear of the National Palace now tilts over the sidewalk like a sea captain leaning into a strong headwind. Buildings here can resemble Cubist drawings, with slanting windows, wavy cornices and doors that no longer align with their frames. Pedestrians trudge up hills where the once flat lake bed has given way. The cathedral in the city\u2019s central square, known as the Z\u00f3calo, famously sunken in spots during the last century, is a kind of fun house, with a leaning chapel and a bell tower into which stone wedges were inserted during construction to act more or less like matchbooks under the leg of a wobbly cafe table.Loreta Castro Reguera is a young, Harvard-trained architect who has made a specialty of the sinking ground in Mexico City, a phenomenon known as subsidence. She pointed down a main street that stretches from the Z\u00f3calo and divides east from west, following the route of an ancient Aztec dike.The whole city occupies what was once a network of lakes. In 1325, the Aztecs established their capital, Tenochtitl\u00e1n, on an island. Over time, they expanded the city with landfill and planted crops on floating gardens called chinampas, plots of arable soil created from wattle and sediment. The lakes provided the Aztecs with a line of defense, the chinampas with sustenance. The idea: Live with nature.Then the conquering Spaniards waged war against water, determined to subdue it. The Aztec system was foreign to them. They replaced the dikes and canals with streets and squares. They drained the lakes and cleared forestland, suffering flood after flood, including one that drowned the city for five straight years.\u201cThe Aztecs managed,\u201d Ms. Castro said. \u201cBut they had 300,000 people. We now have 21 million.\u201dMexico City today is an agglomeration of neighborhoods that are really many big cities cheek by jowl. During the last century, millions of migrants poured in from the countryside to find jobs. The city\u2019s growth, from 30 square miles in 1950 to a metropolitan area of about 3,000 square miles 60 years later, has produced a vibrant but chaotic megalopolis of largely unplanned and sprawling development. Highways and cars choke the atmosphere with heat-inducing carbon dioxide \u2014 and development has wiped out nearly every remaining trace of the original lakes, taxing the underground aquifers and forcing what was once a water-rich valley to import billions of gallons from far away.The system of getting the water from there to here is a miracle of modern hydroengineering. But it is also a crazy feat, in part a consequence of the fact that the city, with a legacy of struggling government, has no large-scale operation for recycling wastewater or collecting rainwater, forcing it to expel a staggering 200 billion gallons of both via crippled sewers like the Grand Canal. Mexico City now imports as much as 40 percent of its water from remote sources \u2014 then squanders more than 40 percent of what runs through its 8,000 miles of pipes because of leaks and pilfering. This is not to mention that pumping all this water more than a mile up into the mountains consumes roughly as much energy as does the entire metropolis of Puebla, a Mexican state capital with a population akin to Philadelphia\u2019s.Even with this mind-boggling undertaking, the government acknowledges that nearly 20 percent of Mexico City residents \u2014 critics put the number even higher \u2014 still can\u2019t count on getting water from their taps each day. For some residents, water comes only once a week, or once every several weeks, and that may mean just an hour of yellow muck dripping from the faucet. Those people have to hire trucks to deliver drinking water, at costs sometimes exponentially higher than wealthy residents pay in better-served neighborhoods.Overseeing the city\u2019s water supply is a thin, patient man with the war-weary air of an old general: Ram\u00f3n Aguirre D\u00edaz, director of the Water System of Mexico City, is unusually frank about the perils ahead.\u201cClimate change is expected to have two effects,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe expect heavier, more intense rains, which means more floods, but also more and longer droughts.\u201dIf it stops raining in the reservoirs where the city gets its water, \u201cwe\u2019re facing a potential disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way we can provide enough trucks of water to deal with that scenario.\u201d\u201cIf we have the problems that California and S\u00e3o Paulo have had,\u201d he added, \u201cthere is the serious possibility of unrest.\u201dThe problem is not simply that the aquifers are being depleted. Mexico City rests on a mix of clay lake beds and volcanic soil. Areas like downtown sit on clay. Other districts were built on volcanic fields.Volcanic soil absorbs water and delivers it to the aquifers. It\u2019s stable and porous. Picture a bucket filled with marbles. You can pour water into the bucket, and the marbles will hardly move. Stick a straw into the bucket to extract the water, and the marbles still won\u2019t move. For centuries, before the population exploded, volcanic soil guaranteed that the city had water underground.Mexico City\u2019s water crisis today comes partly from the fact that so much of this porous land \u2014 including large stretches of what Mexico City has supposedly set aside for agriculture and preservation, called \u201cconservation land\u201d \u2014 has been developed. So it is buried beneath concrete and asphalt, stopping rain from filtering down to the aquifers, causing floods and creating \u201cheat islands\u201d that raise temperatures further and only increase the demand for water. This is part of the sprawl problem.Now, picture layered sheets of plastic. On a molecular level, clay acts sort of like that. It doesn\u2019t really absorb water. Instead, water settles between the sheets. When the water is drained, the sheets can collapse and crack. If all of Mexico City were built on clay, it would at least sink at the same rate and \u201csubsidence would be an anecdote,\u201d Mr. Aguirre said.But because the city is built on a mix of clay and volcanic soil, it sinks unevenly, causing dramatic and deadly fissures. In Iztapalapa, Pedro Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, director of ecological studies at the Metropolitan Autonomous University, climbed down into what felt like a ravine where a street had given way. He\u2019s been tracking the problem for years. Fifteen thousand houses in the area, he said, had been damaged by sinking ground.Deep below the historic center, water extracted from aquifers now can end up just beyond the city limits, in Ecatepec, at one of the largest pumping stations along the Grand Canal. The pump, completed in 2007, was built to move 11,000 gallons per second \u2014 essentially water that now needs to be lifted up from where the canal has collapsed, just so that it can continue on its way.The man in charge of this herculean undertaking is Carlos Salgado Ter\u00e1n, chief of the department of drainage for Zone A in Mexico City, a trim, no-funny-business official in a starched bright green shirt. According to Mr. Salgado, the Grand Canal today is working at only 30 percent of capacity because of subsidence. He admitted that it was a Sisyphean struggle to keep up with the city\u2019s decline. Parts of the canal around Ecatepec have sunk an additional six feet just since the plant was built, he said.He showed me around one morning. The canal is wide open, a stinking river of sewage belching methane and sulfuric acid. Apartment blocks, incongruously painted cheerful Crayola colors, hug the bank. A lonely tricycle sat in a parking lot near where the station\u2019s giant, noisy engines churn out greasy white foam that coats the black water.Mr. Salgado asked if I wanted a tour of the filters. \u201cThe smell can be unbearable, and it\u2019s very unhealthy,\u201d he cautioned.The district of Tlalpan is on the opposite side of Mexico City. There, Claudia Sheinbaum, a former environment minister who developed the city\u2019s first climate change program, is now a local district president. She has the slightly impatient, defensive mien of someone wrestling with an impossible mission.\u201cWith climate change, the situation will only get much worse,\u201d she said. A warming climate will only increase the city\u2019s problems with pollution, specifically ozone. Heat waves mean health crises and rising costs for health care in a city where air-conditioning is not commonplace in poor neighborhoods. She seconded what Mr. Aguirre had said about the threat of drought. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cif there is drought we are not prepared.\u201dFor the time being, Well 30 helps supply Tlalpan with drinking water. One recent morning, large trucks, called \u201cpipas,\u201d some with neat lettering that promised \u201cagua potable,\u201d crowded a muddy turnoff beside the highway. From a low cinder-block building, painted red, scrawled with graffiti and crowned in barbed wire, sprouted two long, angled pipes connected to dangling hoses. The arrangement of the pipes and hoses looked something like the gallows in a game of hangman.These pipes plunge 1,000 feet down to reach an aquifer. Trucks, endlessly, one after another, wait their turn to fill up, positioning themselves beneath the hoses.This is where residents of Tlalpan get water when they can\u2019t get it from their faucets. It takes more than 500 trips a day to satisfy the parched citizens of the district. Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, the district representative at the well, distributes assignments from a desk in the red building piled with stacks of orders that residents file. Drivers wait at his window, as at a fast-food drive-through, to pick up their assignments.\u201cThe pump is always working,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cAt least it is still good water.\u201dTo the east, in Iztapalapa, some wells tap into a noxious stew contaminated by minerals and chemicals. Angry residents wait in lines overnight to plead with pipa drivers, who sometimes pit desperate families against one another, seeing who pays the bigger bribe.Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, who helped manage the water supply for Iztapalapa for 32 years, said the health effects of contaminated water were clear to residents whose infants regularly broke out in rashes and whose grandparents suffered colitis.In some cases, the wait for water trucks can make the cable guy look punctual: Deliveries may be promised in three to 30 days, forcing residents to stay home the whole time, because orders are canceled if there\u2019s no one in the house when the trucks arrive.\u201cWater becomes the center of women\u2019s lives in places where there is a serious problem,\u201d points out Mireya Imaz, a program director at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \u201cWomen in Iztapalapa can spend all night waiting for the pipas, then they have to be home for the trucks, and sometimes they will ride with the drivers to make sure the drivers deliver the water, which is not always a safe thing to do.\u201d\u201cIt becomes impossible for many poor women to work outside the home,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole system is made worse by corruption.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much what I heard talking to women in Iztapalapa. Virginia Josefina Ram\u00edrez Granillo was standing in the courtyard of a community center in San Miguel Teotongo, a hilly neighborhood on the edge of the district, next to a wishful mural showing a woman washing clothes in her sink with a running faucet.\u201cWe line up at 3 in the morning for the pipa,\u201d Ms. Ram\u00edrez said, pointing toward a distant spot where the trucks arrive. \u201cWe wait for hours to get water that doesn\u2019t last a week, and usually there aren\u2019t enough pipas. Sometimes there is violence. Women sell their spaces in the line. If you\u2019re from the wrong political party, you don\u2019t get water. You have to show your party affiliation, your voting ID.\u201dPeople in rich neighborhoods on the other side of town, \u201cthey don\u2019t have to think about water,\u201d she added. \u201cBut for us it is something we think about all day, every day.\u201dFinally, there are places in Mexico City that even pipas can\u2019t reach, where the precariousness of the entire water system, and by extension the whole city, is epitomized in a few scruffy acres.Diana Contreras Guzm\u00e1n lives in the highlands of the district of Xochimilco, where the roads rise almost vertically and dirt byways lead to shanties made of corrugated tin, cinder block and cardboard. A young single mother, she lives with nine relatives in a one-room shack. Ms. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s father and three brothers are janitors. Her sister works in an office. To reach a bus to get to work, more than a mile down the hill, they set out at 4:30 a.m., leaving Ms. Guzm\u00e1n, most days, to care for four small children \u2014 and to deal with water.Once a week, a pipa delivers water farther up the hill, where the road is paved. When that happens, Ms. Guzm\u00e1n, a small, thin woman, spends two hours climbing up the hill and back down again, seven times in all, lugging 90 pounds of water on each return trip. Sometimes Josu\u00e9 and Valentina, two of the children, try to help, dragging half-gallon bottles. Ms. Guzm\u00e1n can\u2019t leave the house for long, she said, in case someone steals water from her cistern.For 100 gallons from the pipa, she pays 25 cents. But this doesn\u2019t begin to supply her family with enough water. So every day she also pays \u00c1ngel, a neighbor in his 70s who owns a pair of donkeys named Reindeer and Rabbit. The donkeys trudge plastic containers of water, four at a time, from a well down the hill.Ms. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s family earns $600 a month. They ultimately have to spend more than 10 percent of that income on water \u2014 enough to yield about 10 gallons per person per day.The average resident in a wealthy Mexico City neighborhood to the west, nearer the reservoirs, consumes 100 gallons per day, experts note. The wealthy resident pays one-tenth what Ms. Guzm\u00e1n does.\u201cIs there any clearer indication that everything about water in this city comes down to inequity?\u201d said David Vargas, whose company, Isla Urbana, produces a low-cost rainwater-harvesting system.I put this question to Tanya M\u00fcller Garc\u00eda, the city\u2019s secretary for the environment. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly breaking records for the warmest months,\u201d she said, handing over a report on Mexico City\u2019s sustainability plans. There are predictions that by 2080 the city\u2019s average temperature will have risen several degrees and that annual rainfall will have decreased 20 percent.Ms. M\u00fcller was defensive about the city\u2019s inability to supply every resident with clean water, insisting that the numbers of those unserved were exaggerated. She listed progressive new programs intended to combat pollution, preserve green spaces and reduce the demand for cars by improving mass transit. This city is full of brilliant people with good ideas, including a plan to create a water fund into which corporations drawing heavily on the water supply would pay \u2014 to help improve services in less advantaged areas. Another plan envisions a public park that would double as a rainwater collection basin. And there\u2019s a long-term agenda to turn the airport into a green, mixed-use district.Meanwhile, the Mexican federal government envisions constructing a giant new airport on a dry lake bed, exactly the worst place to build. It recently cut to zero federal money budgeted for fixing the city\u2019s pipes, Metro and other critical infrastructure. Partly this is just politics. The mayor of Mexico City has talked about running for president. The current administration doesn\u2019t want to do him any favors. At the same time, the federal government has its own agenda, promoting highways, cars and sprawl.The disconnect between local and federal officials is not unique to Mexico. Often big cities find themselves undermined by state and federal politicians catering to a different electorate, as if in the end the consequences won\u2019t be ruinous for everyone.\u201cThere has to be a consensus \u2014 of scientists, politicians, engineers and society \u2014 when it comes to pollution, water, climate,\u201d Ms. Sheinbaum, the former environment minister, stressed. \u201cWe have the resources, but lack the political will.\u201dIt turns out Ms. Sheinbaum herself lives in a house that can count on water from the tap only twice a month.So she, too, orders pipas to come to fill her cistern.Zoe Mendelson contributed research.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White.

They were thumbing through online dictionaries, looking for a definition of \u201cimpugn.\u201d On Wednesday morning, the dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster posted on its website that searches on the word had surged.\u201cIt\u2019s been at the top for almost 12 hours now,\u201d said Peter Sokolowski, the company\u2019s editor at large.As he wrote on the Merriam-Webster website: \u201cImpugn means \u2018to oppose or attack as false or lacking integrity\u2019 or \u2018to criticize (a person\u2019s character, intentions, etc.) by suggesting that someone is not honest and should not be trusted.\u2019 It comes from the Latin word pugnare meaning \u2018to fight,\u2019 which is also the root of pugnacious and pugilism.\u201dA tweet posted to the dictionary\u2019s feed linking to this definition quickly racked up several hundred retweets.At a time when many are questioning the definition of common words they thought they understood, after years of the English language being degraded by text messages and hashtags, dictionaries have made a surprising comeback in the United States.On dictionary apps and websites, \u201clookups\u201d (which, according to Merriam-Webster, is one word) of words or phrases related to news events have precipitously increased.

{"Headline": "How to Get Better Customer Service, and Skip the Rage", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat is the most efficient and least painful path to get good customer service? Call the company\u2019s toll-free number? Chat online? Send an email? Complain on social media?In 1976, that figure was 32 percent.Mr. Broetzmann said companies sometimes rely on \u201cdisingenuous approaches,\u201d which can be vexing or meaningless to customers, to internally measure their performance. For example, some call centers require a representative to say a customer\u2019s name at least three times during a call.\u201cWhen it comes to selecting metric and data sources, it doesn\u2019t make sense to measure something simply because it\u2019s always been measured or because it\u2019s the latest industry trend,\u201d the report said. \u201cUsing old approaches or data sources and expecting new or different outcomes is a quick path to insanity.\u201d\u201cDisrespect can inspire rage because in the most primitive parts of our brains it\u2019s tied to our survival,\u201d she wrote. In days when we were cave dwellers, \u201cto be overlooked or irrelevant was to die,\u201d she added.The customer rage study found that nearly 50 percent of respondents found the statement \u201cYour call is important to us, please continue to hold\u201d very annoying, with another 17 percent saying it should be banned. Runners-up were: \u201cThat\u2019s our policy\u201d; \u201cWe are currently assisting other customers. Your call will be answered in the order in which it was received\u201d; and \u201cCan I get your account information again?\u201dFor quick solutions to small specific problems, try online chats, Ms. Yarrow said. They are ideal for handling issues like a promotion code or learning when your product will arrive.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the place for empathy or to complain,\u201d she said.Write down as many details as possible, such as the name of the person you are talking to. Ask how the company is tracking you \u2014 is it by your name, or either a phone, account or case number? All of that can be useful if you need to follow up, Mr. Robbins said. You can ask to \u201cescalate\u201d a call, which is lingo for wanting to speak with a supervisor.No matter how frustrated you are, remain calm and treat representatives with \u201cthe utmost dignity,\u201d Mr. Broetzmann said. Experts suggest referring to the representatives by name because it signals you are interested in working with them.The researchers analyzed 36 hours of calls between customers and employees at a Canadian call center. When customers were not aggressive, fewer than 5 percent of the calls had problems. But researchers found that when customers used second-person pronouns \u2014 such as \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d \u2014 and interrupted, the service worsened in more than 35 percent of the calls.For companies, customer service is more than an exercise in public relations. The customer rage study, drawing on several sets of data, extrapolated that businesses risked losing more than $202 billion in 2015 as a result of serious problems with their products and services.As the customer management institute\u2019s report observed, \u201cIf organizations don\u2019t get on board with meeting customer expectations, they\u2019ll soon discover that they may not have many customers left around to serve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Burn an American Flag? Some Iranians Are Saying No", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Burning American flags and homemade effigies of American presidents is a cherished tradition among Iranian hard-liners, but as the country prepares for the anniversary on Friday of the 1979 revolution that established the Islamic republic, others want to thank Americans instead.Iranians have taken notice.The Twitter user added that the theme of #LoveBeyondFlags resonated from the Azadi Tower, a landmark at the western entrance of Tehran, to the Statue of Liberty in New York. The tower\u2019s name can be translated as \u201cfreedom.\u201dOther social media users shared images of Iranian and American wrestlers clasped in embrace, and of protesters who have thronged airports to welcome citizens of Iran and the other six countries \u2014 Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 who had managed to enter the United States.Twitter and Facebook are blocked by Iranian state censors, but users have installed special software that helps bypass the block.In Washington, a coalition of Iranian-American groups and Iranian individuals was among the latest to take legal action against the Trump administration, announcing on Thursday that it had filed a lawsuit in federal court to block the president\u2019s order as unconstitutional.\u201cThe executive order shunts aside the intricate matrix of statutes and regulations that govern the U.S. immigration system, and casts many thousands of families adrift without so much as a passing glance at the Constitution,\u201d the lawsuit states.\u201cThis travel ban has galvanized the Iranian-American community in unprecedented ways,\u201d Cyrus Mehri, a Washington-based Iranian-American civil rights lawyer, said in a news conference by telephone about the lawsuit. \u201cWe are gathering together and uniting to stop this ban not only for our community, but all others adversely affected.\u201dA demographic portrait of the immigrants from the countries targeted by President Trump\u2019s ban.Iran\u2019s National Day celebration often features homemade versions of the American and Israeli flags going up in flames, as masses of Iranians gather in rallies that are a sign of ideological strength. It is also a day out for families and young people, who are as interested in the Chinese products being sold in stalls along the demonstration routes as they are in political sloganeering.Criticizing actions by hard-liners is dangerous in Iran, where the judiciary and the police are focusing increasingly on online dissent. In recent months in several Iranian provinces, social media users were arrested after they posted \u201cundesirable\u201d content or spoke out against the Islamic republic\u2019s policies.One political analyst, Nader Karimi Joni, considered close to the government, said he supported those protesting the flag-burning. \u201cLook at the kindness Iranians received at U.S. airports by those protesting Trump. We insult those people when we burn their flag,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, some encourage these actions.\u201dBut hard-liners said it was their right to burn the American flag, or any flag for that matter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be thankful for Americans welcoming Iranians rendering services to that country,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst.He also said that the United States had recently increased tensions with Iran. \u201cIt is clear some here are chickening out, and calling for compromise with America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we must burn the U.S. flag, as long as they are hostile to us.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Keep Your Valentine\u2019s Day Flowers Alive", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesIf you\u2019ve received a bouquet from that special someone this Valentine\u2019s Day, or any other special occasion, you may be looking for ways to extend the gesture as long as possible.Just like hangover cures, there are many theories about the best method for keeping flowers fresh. I wanted to find out if one method reigned above all. So I asked some flower experts and tried my own (not very scientific) homegrown experiment.To start, I bought nine stalks of chrysanthemums from a grocery store and put each stalk in a clean glass bottle with about 12 ounces of warm water and the following common treatments:\u2022 Water alone\u2022 Water and putting flowers in a refrigerator every night\u2022 Sprite (\u00bc cup) and water\u2022 Vinegar (1 tbsp.), sugar (1 tbsp.) and water\u2022 Vodka (\u215b tsp.), sugar (1 tsp.) and water\u2022 Aspirin (1 crushed) and water\u2022 Penny, sugar (1 tsp.) and water\u2022 Bleach (2 drops), sugar (1 tsp.) and water\u2022 Flower food (\u00bd packet) and waterThere\u2019s some science behind these methods. But a word of caution before you try one: That little packet of flower food that came with the flowers may be your best bet. It likely has the right blend of antibacterial agents, a sugar source for food and an acidifier that will extend the life of your arrangement.But if you didn\u2019t get one of those packets \u2014 or if you are harvesting flowers straight from the garden \u2014 here are some things you should know.Let\u2019s rewind first, to the moment you receive a fresh bouquet. Before you even put your flowers in water, there are a couple of things you should do.Ideally, you should first put your flowers in water around 110 degrees (and your additives, of choice), and then keep the vase in a cool place for at least a couple of hours. This process, called \u201chardening\u201d or \u201cconditioning,\u201d helps because warm water molecules move up the stems more quickly, while a cool environment minimizes water loss through the flowers\u2019 petals and leaves.Though you might intuitively want to place flowers by a window, direct sunlight can actually stress cut flowers more than helping them \u2014 remember, your blossoms are not really photosynthesizing anymore so they don\u2019t need sun to make food. Normal indoor lighting works just fine.Change the water at least once a week, recutting the stems and adding more preservative or food each time.In total, I kept my flowers for 10 days. Every day I randomly shuffled the flowers around, to ensure that positioning wouldn\u2019t explain the outcomes. On Day 5, I fully replaced the water and treatments for each vase.So how did my treatments fare? In theory, soda, vinegar and aspirin should acidify the water so it more closely resembles the sap inside plant cells, helping the flowers take up fluid more easily. Vodka is thought to inhibit the production of ethylene, a gaseous hormone that causes flowers to mature and fruits to ripen. Copper, bleach and vinegar are antibacterial, and refrigerating should slow water loss and the breakdown of tissues.By far, the worst performers were aspirin and vinegar with added sugar. Flowers in the aspirin solution started wilting just four days in, while flowers in vinegar and sugar started wilting on Day 6.Though the flowers in the Sprite treatment stayed healthy, the solution had spots of fungus on its surface, which was not surprising because it contained a lot of sugar but no antibacterial ingredients.The flowers in the penny solution also looked good, though the water appeared slightly cloudy, likely because the copper didn\u2019t dissolve enough to provide any antimicrobial effects. \u201cIt\u2019s a great psychological remedy, perhaps,\u201d said Dr. Wien.While the bouquets in aspirin and vinegar sagged, all the other flowers appeared robust, even in plain water. That may show the best way to ensure your blooms last longer: Get a resilient flower. Without realizing it, I had chosen one of the hardiest flowers for my experiment.This kind of chrysanthemum will probably live at least two weeks in the vase, and \u201cyou will not see a difference in any treatment,\u201d Dr. Meyer predicted when I talked to her on Day 5 of my experiment.Because of genetic differences, certain flowers \u2014 like chrysanthemums and carnations \u2014 simply last longer than others, Dr. Anderson said. Though roses are a favorite for Valentine\u2019s Day, they usually don\u2019t last longer than a week, he added, a bit shorter than many other flowers. \u201cTheir petals aren\u2019t as tough and waxy, so they lose a lot of water and wilt fast.\u201dOf course, even if you pull out all the stops, you won\u2019t be able to ward off the inevitable. So, smell your roses while they last.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protests Rock Romania After Government Weakens Corruption Law", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHuge protests, among the largest since the fall of communism, have rocked Romania after the government passed a law that would effectively allow official corruption.More than 250,000 Romanians took to the streets, about half of them in the capital, Bucharest. \u201cThieves, thieves,\u201d they shouted, denouncing the government and corruption. A few demonstrators clashed with riot police.The measure had been debated for several weeks, but the government decided to adopt it abruptly late on Tuesday night, stunning observers. Officials including Liviu Dragnea, the leader of the governing Social Democratic Party, stand to benefit from the measure. Mr. Dragnea faces charges of abuse of power involving a sum of 24,000 euros, or about $25,800.Romania\u2019s top judicial watchdog, the Superior Magistrates\u2019 Council, on Wednesday issued a constitutional court challenge to the decree. Another body, the Higher Judicial Council, which helps oversee the court system, has also challenged the law.President Klaus Iohannis, whose role as head of state is largely ceremonial but who commands respect in many parts of the country, asked the constitutional court to strike it down.Mr. Iohannis, who was elected in 2014 as the first president from the country\u2019s German-speaking minority, called Tuesday a \u201cday of mourning for the rule of law.\u201dIn the northwestern city of Cluj, Raluca Sandor, a 30-year-old pharmacist, braved cold weather to take part in the demonstrations.\u201cThis decree will drag Romania back in time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Social Democratic Party is the most corrupt party, and they are trying to save themselves from prosecution. I want the government to resign and these decrees to be canceled.\u201dAnother demonstrator in Cluj, Alexandrin Pop, 30, said, \u201cI\u2019m protesting because I see this as an assault on the judiciary and the rule of law.\u201dAlexandra Zaraf, 27, one of many young protesters in Bucharest, asked, \u201cWhat self-respecting government issues emergency ordinances at 9 p.m. and publishes it in the middle of the night?\u201d She added, \u201cIn a world where we talk about corruption, they want to change legislation and encourage it or go easy on punishing it.\u201dUntil recently, Romania, which joined the European Union in 2007, along with Bulgaria, was seen as making slow but steady progress on corruption. The new law threatens to create a new problem for the bloc\u2019s executives in Brussels, who are already troubled by problems like the Greek debt crisis, sluggish growth among the countries that use the euro currency and Britain\u2019s plans for withdrawing from the bloc.Analysts feared that the government could further reverse the country\u2019s progress and that an open conflict between the government and the president could create a lasting deadlock.\u201cI don\u2019t understand what the protesters are upset about,\u201d Mr. Dragnea said before the decree was passed on Tuesday.In fact, senior political and business figures, including Mr. Dragnea, were under investigation and likely to be convicted under the rules the decree was concerning.\u201cRomania is far from being a success story,\u201d Ms. Mungiu-Pippidi said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe ended impunity, we managed to put in jail very important people. But the problem is that corruption has not gone down \u2014 people who replaced those people behave similarly.\u201d\u201cThis is a disaster for the Social Democratic Party, which wanted to change its image of a corrupt party and show that there is a new generation prepared to rule,\u201d said Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj.Mr. Miscoiu described the ruling party as \u201ca rural conservative party with a left-wing component in social and economic policies\u201d that was more similar to the ruling conservatives in neighboring Hungary and Poland than their leftist counterparts. He said the Social Democrats could follow the playbook of the right-wing leaders in those countries, consolidating power and clashing with the European Union, and \u201cplaying a little bit on the populist, nationalist side, trying to show that Romania has the right to have its own policies, including in justice.\u201dGlen Johnson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Danish Man Who Burned Quran Is Prosecuted for Blasphemy", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 42-year-old man who burned a Quran and posted a video of it on Facebook has been charged with blasphemy in Denmark, a striking decision by prosecutors in a country that is largely secular but has grappled with the role of Islam in public life.The decision stunned many Danes: No one has been convicted of blasphemy in Denmark since 1946, and the country has a long tradition of free speech; burning the flag is not a punishable crime.The controversy led to deadly riots, attacks on Danish embassies in the Middle East and a trade boycott against Denmark. But Danish prosecutors at the time refused to charge the newspaper\u2019s editors with blasphemy.The decision to charge the Quran burner was made by a regional prosecutor in Viborg, on the Jutland peninsula, and had to be approved by the country\u2019s attorney general.No one has been convicted of the crime since 1946, when a man dressed himself up as a priest and mock-baptized a doll at a masquerade ball.In the current case, the suspect, who was not identified by the authorities but called himself John Salvesen on Facebook, uploaded video footage of a Quran being burned in his backyard. In the 4-minute, 15-second clip, the clicking sounds of a lighter are heard before flames engulf the large leather-bound book.The video was posted on Dec. 27, 2015, to a Facebook group called \u201cYes to Freedom \u2014 No to Islam.\u201d Above the video, shared 415 times, were the words: \u201cConsider your neighbor, it stinks when it burns.\u201d One commenter wrote: \u201cIf I had the Quran I\u2019d also burn it, that\u2019s the only thing it\u2019s good for. Gives a bit of heat.\u201dThe man\u2019s Facebook page was full of messages critical of Islam, refugees and women. In one post, he even wrote, \u201cI hate children.\u201dThe video did not get widespread attention at the time. The defendant \u2014 his true name is still not clear and under Danish law cannot be released unless he is convicted \u2014 was charged last year with hate speech, but the indictment was later changed to blasphemy, a decision prosecutors announced on Wednesday. A trial has been scheduled for June. If convicted, the defendant faces up to four months in prison or a fine.His lawyer, Rasmus Paludan, argued that his client had burned the Quran in \u201cself-defense.\u201d\u201cThe Quran contains passages on how Mohammed\u2019s followers must kill the infidel, i.e. the Danes,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s an act of self-defense to burn a book that in such a way incites war and violence.\u201dMr. Paludan also noted that in 1997, a Danish artist burned a copy of the Bible on a news show by a state broadcaster but was not charged. \u201cConsidering that it is legal to burn a Bible in Denmark, I\u2019m surprised then that it would be guilty to burn the Quran,\u201d he said in a phone interview.Mr. Paludan said his client \u201cloves freedom of expression and loves Denmark.\u201d Speculating on the decision to bring charges, he said, \u201cThe fear of Islam and Muslims may be far greater now, and the prosecution service may be a lot more apprehensive of Islam and its followers.\u201dMr. Mchangama said he thought the prosecutor was motivated by a desire to fend off the threat of terrorist attacks. \u201cDanish authorities are afraid that the Quran burning could spark a new crisis, and if they say that they\u2019ve actually charged this person, this is a way to appease or at least avoid such a crisis,\u201d he said.Denmark is one of only five countries in the European Union that has a blasphemy law on the books. Some say the case could lead to a rallying cry to abandon such laws once and for all.Mr. Mouritsen, noting the 1997 decision not to prosecute, asked, \u201cWhy should this all of a sudden be an issue, when everybody agrees that the blasphemy law is a thing of the past?\u201dThe decision to press charges was condemned by the right-wing, anti-immigration Danish People\u2019s Party, which said it would push to rescind the blasphemy law.The 2005 cartoon controversy was followed by deadly attacks that have left Western Europe deeply shaken.In Denmark, \u201cthe very idea that religion is taken seriously is the antithesis of being a good citizen,\u201d said Mr. Mouritsen, the political scientist. \u201cThis is very important.\u201dMartin Selsoe Sorensen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 264 Haircuts, a Marriage Ends", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveElizabeth lofted the black cape as I watched it billow in front of me like a sheet blossoming on a clothesline. She fastened the buttons around my neck, placed her hands on either side of my head and whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d\u201cDo what?\u201d I asked.\u201cThis,\u201d she said, gesturing around us. \u201cI have to let you go.\u201dStill, she reached into a black case and pulled out scissors and a comb. The scent of freshly cut grass drifted through an open kitchen window along with the squeals of neighborhood children.\u201cWho will cut your hair?\u201d she asked.I shrugged my shoulders.For more than 22 years, roughly 264 haircuts, we had shared this ritual. She would run her hands through my hair, nudging my head forward and sideways, her fingers mere inches away from the secret thoughts and desires swirling inside of my skull.She pulled up a swath of hair with a comb and began to snip.When we first met, in the 1980s, I wore my hair parted on the side, a preppy conservative look. On our second date, she swept back my bangs with her fingertips and offered to cut my hair for the first time. Over the years, clumps of my dark hair have slid down the cape and pooled on the kitchen floor. Eventually, the side part vanished and flecks of gray started to mingle with the black. Now, the hair that fell was mostly gray, peppered with black strands.\u201cDo you have the clippers?\u201d I asked.She reached into the case and pulled out the heavy Wahls. When she turned them on, they emitted a low electronic buzz.\u201cCut it all off,\u201d I said.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want you to buzz it all off.\u201dIf I didn\u2019t have any hair, it wouldn\u2019t matter that I no longer had her to cut it.\u201cGo on,\u201d I said. \u201cDo it.\u201dI watched the hair tumble onto the cape. Her breasts pressed against my shoulder as her hand brushed the hair from my head. And then I felt something wet fall on my cheek. I heard a sound, like a hiccup, and then I heard it again, but it was more like a sucking noise, like someone trying to catch a breath. Her tears began to fall.\u201cShh, it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d I said.She stood back, her face red and blotchy. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you look so different now.\u201dShe held up a mirror, and I winced. \u201cOh man,\u201d I said. There was something honest and bold about the look. \u201cShave off the rest.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019ll look like a cancer patient.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just hair.\u201dShe finished. As if my thoughts had been laid bare, too, she said: \u201cYou know I\u2019m stronger now. I can make it on my own.\u201d\u201cI know that,\u201d I said.For two months, ever since I moved out, we had been engaged in a weekend dance of me visiting to keep contact with our girls, staying in our home in Virginia as if nothing had changed. But everything had changed.She rubbed lotion on my neck and pulled out the straight razor. I felt the cool metal on my skin as she nudged my head forward and down with her fingertips.I closed my eyes. I could hear our 14-year-old daughter chattering on the telephone and laughter coming from the TV. Our dog\u2019s claws clicked across the floor.\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat on you,\u201d I said, keeping my head down and my eyes closed.The blade stood still for a moment, then skimmed down the back of my neck.\u201cI had to get that H.I.V. test,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you were acting so out of character.\u201dI was offended when she had first told me this. How many times had we made love? Was it greater or fewer than the number of haircuts? Of course the test was negative. I could count on one hand the number of people I had been intimate with before her.The first was my childhood neighbor in Greensboro, N.C. He and I were too young to understand our dark fumbling during sleepovers. In college, I lost my virginity to Sally, a red-haired flute player, in a rite of passage that I simply wanted to get over.When I was 20 and in Colorado for the summer with my aunt Sheila and her psychic girlfriend, I stumbled out of a bar on the edge of town walking arm in arm with Don, my aunt\u2019s handsome young friend. Under the shadow of Pikes Peak, he and I kissed. I heard Sheila\u2019s voice in the distance calling out, \u201cHe\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s gay yet, Don!\u201dBut I knew.When I first started seeing Elizabeth, at 21, I told her about Sally but not Don. That part of my life was supposed to have been erased by conversion therapy, which involved me praying with my mother at the dining room table every day not to be the way I was.The first time Elizabeth and I had sex was on a sofa in my brother\u2019s off-campus apartment in Raleigh, N.C. Neither of us was a virgin, so there was no awkward fumbling, just as there was no passionate taboo. I recognized it for what it was; this was as good as it could get.For more than 22 years, after our daughters were born and as my hair became grayer and Elizabeth\u2019s body became softer, I kept my secret locked away. Then, on a Wednesday night 10 years ago in a Walmart parking lot, Elizabeth saved me. \u201cAre you gay?\u201d she asked.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be,\u201d I said.Shortly after, our marriage ended, but while I was still making my weekend visits, there was Ray. On our second date, I ripped the clothing off his body. Afterward, he held up his pants and examined the broken zipper and popped button.\u201cThose were my favorite pants,\u201d he said. I laughed. He did not.Elizabeth brushed the hair from my shoulders and removed the cape. I stood up, put on my shirt, and pulled the broom from the kitchen closet to sweep up.When the girls went to bed, I wandered the house taking stock of things that were no longer mine. There on the dining room table was the blue metal pitcher we found in an antique shop in New Hampshire. This painting, above the brick mantel, was my 20th wedding anniversary gift to her. Here was the sofa where Elizabeth and I once lay side by side with a sleeping dog at our feet. The wooden floors creaked as I passed.When I reached the top of the stairs, Elizabeth stood motionless in the dark hall.\u201cCan I sleep with you, just sleep, this one last night?\u201d I asked.\u201cDon\u2019t wake me in the morning,\u201d she said.She removed her nightgown. I took off my shirt.That was her side of the bed, and this used to be mine. Here was the blue comforter where we cradled our newborn girls. These were the pillows flattened with use.I lay awake on my back. She rested her hand on my neck. I turned to my right side, and she to her left as we twisted in our bittersweet ballet of goodbye.In the grainy morning light, I closed the bedroom door and tiptoed to my daughters\u2019 rooms. This was Sophie\u2019s. Those were the boxes filled with her dolls. I tucked her dark hair behind her ear and kissed her warm cheek.Here was Marisa\u2019s. These were her glasses. I picked them up and cleaned them with the tail of my shirt.\u201cI\u2019m just going to work now,\u201d I muttered, a half-truth in the half-light.This, behind me, was the house full of secrets, and here before me was the path that lay ahead. This is what I left: an empty chair at the table, the scent of my skin on the sheets, an old painting, a sleeping dog, a blue pitcher, my lingering shadow on the front steps before I let go.What will be on students\u2019 minds this year?If you have a story that illustrates the current state of love and relationships, email it to us at essaycontest@nytimes.com, along with your name, college, graduation year, email address and phone number.

Outside, activists became bouncers, turning away a line of people from the overstuffed site. Inside, hands shot up in answer and a cheer went up from those who had swarmed the airport to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.Mr. Lander continued ticking off some of the many other locations where protests have erupted across the city.\u201cAnd who was at Foley Square?\u201d The crowd roared again.\u201cAnd who was at the protest last week just down the street?\u201d The room almost shook.The distaste for President Trump in his hometown has convulsed into near daily protests across the city. Summoned by a Facebook post or cellphone alert, New Yorkers have taken to the streets to object to his policies, appointments and executive orders.All this, however, could merely be a prelude to the moment yet to come \u2014 Mr. Trump has still not set foot in New York City as president, puzzling and emboldening some protesters who see his weekend visits to his Florida estate as something of a retreat to friendlier ground. But whenever he does settle into his penthouse home atop Trump Tower, seething New Yorkers will finally be able to train their ire directly at Mr. Trump on his doorstep.\u201cThe visual of Trump coming back to New York would be the Fifth Avenue of Manhattan flooded with people angrily protesting just about everything that Donald Trump has done \u2014 I don\u2019t think he wants to create that visual,\u201d said Carl Dix, whose anti-Trump group, Refuse Fascism, has been plastering the city with stickers that say \u201cNO!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants the world to see that.\u201dCity officials would not discuss details of security plans that will be used when Mr. Trump returns to the city or how much protecting him will cost. Between his election in November and his inauguration in January, the city spent $37 million for the more than 200 police officers on patrol each day in and around Trump Tower. The federal government has reimbursed the city about $7 million. Large protests would most likely require a bigger police presence.\u201cDemonstrations do have an impact on operations because we have to get those cops from somewhere,\u201d the police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, told reporters at a news conference in response to questions about how the city would manage Mr. Trump\u2019s return. \u201cShort term, we can handle it, but if it continues to go on, it could have an impact on our operations.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a query about whether or when Mr. Trump would return to his Manhattan home.Allies of Mr. Trump scoff at the notion that the president is leery of coming back to New York, in part because his wife, Melania, decided to stay here to allow their son, Barron, to finish out the school year.\u201cDonald Trump will never be chased out of his hometown,\u201d said Roger Stone, a Republican operative who has worked on and off for Mr. Trump for 40 years. Mr. Trump, he added, has long tended to prefer spending winters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.Besides, protests, no matter their size or level of vitriol, may satisfy people who will never embrace Mr. Trump, but do nothing to chip away at his ardent base, Mr. Stone said. \u201cPolitically, the demonstrations against you in New York probably help you in flyover country.\u201dIn Mr. Trump\u2019s absence, New York has become something of a proving ground for organized displays of anti-Trump sentiment. From the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, to the mayor, Bill de Blasio, to an intersectional grass-roots movement that includes Muslims, gays, Latinos and immigrants, among others, New York has been a caldron of unrest.There have been student walkouts, disruptions at Trump-linked businesses, mass same-sex kiss-ins in front of Trump Tower and Muslim prayer vigils in airport arrival halls. For some the protests have served as beta tests for the main event: Mr. Trump\u2019s homecoming.\u201cIn the event that President Trump does come to New York, we are very much holding him accountable for what he has already done to the immigrant community,\u201d said Thanu Yakupitiyage, a spokeswoman for the New York Immigration Coalition.Since the election, immigrant groups like the coalition and Make the Road New York have been organizing via text messaging app, blasting participants with calls to action straight to their phones. It helped the coalition attract thousands of people to Kennedy Airport hours after the travel ban went into effect. Events that used to take weeks to launch now take hours, organizers said, foreshadowing what may happen when word filters out that Mr. Trump is on his way.\u201cBecause people are paying attention, we are able to mobilize people with very little notice,\u201d Ms. Yakupitiyage said.Melissa Byrne, who describes herself as a professional community organizer, helped coordinate a protest a few weeks ago led by the actor Mark Ruffalo outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Columbus Circle next to Central Park. Ms. Byrne has been conducting walk-throughs for marches past Trump Tower for other clients. She devises routes with an eye to navigating the tower\u2019s substantial security zone and to avoid the fate of most people who wave signs there: penned behind barricades across the street, where photo opportunities and television angles are subpar.\u201cGood protests always have to think about how they look,\u201d Ms. Byrne said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the meme.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, who has positioned himself as a national leader of the opposition to Mr. Trump, said it wasn\u2019t the mayor\u2019s place \u201cto dictate to the president where he should and should not spend his time.\u201d Still, the spokesman, Austin Finan, added that \u201cthe mayor supports every individual\u2019s right to protest peacefully and make their voice heard.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump canceled a recent appearance in Milwaukee, activists claimed it was as a result of planned demonstrations. But the White House said it was because of a scheduling conflict.Some organizers and leaders of advocacy groups believe something more than just another protest with the usual signs and slogans is needed whenever Mr. Trump returns.\u201cAnother march on the street with signs isn\u2019t going to get anyone to pay attention,\u201d said Mark Milano, an organizer with Rise and Resist, a group dedicated to demonstrating against Mr. Trump that formed after his election. \u201cIt has to be something that is going to raise people\u2019s eyebrows.\u201dIn January, members of his group made their way into the Jean-Georges restaurant inside Trump International Hotel and began coughing, feigning dying in the restaurant in response to the president\u2019s plans to do away with the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWe will be looking for his travel plans, and we are keeping all our ears open for when he is coming back,\u201d Mr. Milano said. He added that they were devising creative ways to attract attention, including perhaps another \u201cdie-in.\u201dWhile he was president-elect, Mr. Trump spent most of his time in New York, yet rarely left his triplex penthouse. When he comes back he may choose again to stay inside and avoid watching whatever unfolds 58 floors below.That possibility does not discourage organizers like Ms. Byrne, who say they will be out there, no matter what. \u201cHe is addicted to Twitter,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you have to do is make sure that the events have really good pictures, and people are talking about it. Because he knows.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the amount the federal government has reimbursed the city. It is about $7 million, not about $30 million.Advertisement"}

But the bogus claims just keep coming.Germans are fleeing their country, fearful of Muslim refugees. The Swedish government supports the Islamic State. The European Union has drafted rules to regulate the ethnicity of snowmen.In a year when the French, Germans and Dutch will elect leaders, the European authorities are scrambling to counter a rising tide of fake news and anti-European Union propaganda aimed at destabilizing people\u2019s trust in institutions.As officials play catch-up in the fight against sophisticated hacking and fake news operations, they fear Europe and its elections remain vulnerable at a critical moment: The region\u2019s decades-old project of unity hangs in the balance, challenged by populist forces within the bloc and pressures from Russia and beyond.\u201cIf you look at how European media, and even big American media, are covering the issue now, I would say that it is those few people on that team who have been able to raise awareness,\u201d said Jakub Janda, a deputy director with European Values, a think tank based in Prague, who has worked with East Stratcom.Many false claims target politicians who present the biggest obstacles to Moscow\u2019s goal of undermining the European Union. Others seek to portray refugees from the Middle East as terrorists or rapists, fomenting populist anger.In France, the head of the En Marche! party said last week that Russian news channels had targeted the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, who belongs to the party and is running on a pro-European Union platform. Richard Ferrand, the party\u2019s secretary-general, said the campaign\u2019s databases and websites had been hit by \u201chundreds, if not thousands,\u201d of attacks from inside Russia.But its list of 2,500 fake reports is small compared with the daily churn across social media. Catching every fake news story would be nearly impossible, and the fake reports the team does combat routinely get a lot more viewers than its myth-busting efforts.One of the biggest problems policy makers across Europe say they face is a lack of tech specialists. Germany recently passed a cybersecurity law that called for a rapid response team to combat hacking attacks. Officials quietly acknowledged, though, that they would need three teams, if they could only find people to staff them.Despite the regionwide push to counter false reports, experts question whether such fact-checking efforts by governments and publishers will have a meaningful effect. Fake reports can easily be shared through social media with few, if any, checks for accuracy.Officials are also anxious about hackers\u2019 attempts to infiltrate the email accounts of candidates and politicians to steal compromising information.Much like their American counterparts, security experts warn, European politicians remain highly vulnerable, though national intelligence agencies are now strengthening lawmakers\u2019 security protocols.In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing tough competition ahead of elections in September, the country\u2019s domestic intelligence service already has reported a sharp rise in so-called phishing attacks in recent months aimed at political parties and members of the country\u2019s Parliament.The German government is weighing potential hefty fines for tech giants like Google and Facebook, whose platforms allow false stories to be quickly circulated. The companies insist that they cannot be held responsible because they do not generate the stories.Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service, said that although there was no \u201csmoking gun,\u201d Russia was likely to be involved in the increase in online misinformation aimed at destabilizing German politics.American tech giants also have stepped in after they were accused of not doing enough to counter false reports on their platforms, accusations that Facebook, Google and other companies deny. They are now funding initiatives in the United States, France and elsewhere to flag fake news online and remove posts if they are found to violate companies\u2019 terms of use or local laws.Such efforts across Europe have gained momentum since the United States\u2019 presidential election.Soon after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in November, David Alandete gathered his team in the El Pa\u00eds newsroom in downtown Madrid with one goal in mind: to respond to fake news.Like many journalists, Mr. Alandete, the Spanish newspaper\u2019s managing editor and a former United States correspondent, had seen waves of false reports during the presidential campaign, many directed at Mexico \u2014 a country that accounts for roughly half of El Pa\u00eds\u2019 online readership.\u201cTrump winning was a major turning point for us,\u201d Mr. Alandete said. \u201cMany of our readers were asking whether they could even travel to the States.\u201dNot all of El Pa\u00eds\u2019s myth-busting targets, though, have been about politics.\u201cMany people don\u2019t trust institutions anymore,\u201d Mr. Alandete said. \u201cWe see fake news coming from everywhere.\u201dBeno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

Remember when he achieved gender parity with his cabinet appointments? Swoon.The stereotype, inside and outside of Canada, is that Canadians are so polite and accepting that nothing like the bitter populism of Donald J. Trump could ever flourish here. Canadians say \u201csorry\u201d all the time, but we say it \u201csoary,\u201d and we are happy to pay for our neighbor\u2019s health insurance through higher taxes. We even add an extra \u201cu\u201d in neighbor. Canadians just are that generous.At least Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency will rip that falsehood open.

True, everything the United States does is louder than in Canada: America\u2019s food is radioactive, its television is more aggressive (and, well, objectively better), so it makes sense that America\u2019s politics are more overtly noxious. But that hardly makes Canada a refuge.It\u2019s like being considered the gentler, kinder sibling. In reality, we\u2019re just more passive-aggressive, too frightened to acknowledge how we fail our citizens day after day.There is no Canadian exceptionalism.

REFUGEES WELCOME, KEEP YOUR LAWS OUT OF MY VAGINA, BLACK LIVES MATTER, SCIENCE IS REAL, FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER, NOBODY LIKES YOU. The handmade pink \u201cpussyhats\u201d that many marchers wore \u2014 a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s caught-on-tape boasts about grabbing unsuspecting women by the genitals \u2014 had been sneered at in the days before the march. They were called corny, girlie, a waste of time. Seen from above, though, on thousands of marchers, their wave of color created a powerful image.It was, somewhat unexpectedly, one of the largest mass demonstrations in American history. Millions of protesters \u2014 estimates range from three to five million \u2014 took to the streets of Washington, Los Angeles, New York, Palm Beach, Fla., Boise, Idaho, even Fargo, N.D. Sister demonstrations were held in Thailand, in Malawi, in Antarctica. The energy of almost every group alarmed or incensed by Trump\u2019s election seemed to have poured into a single demonstration. That it happened on the day after his inauguration was not surprising. What was striking was that all these people had come together under the auspices of a march for women.Just two months earlier, the left did not appear to be a unified front. The polls had barely closed before the infighting began. Some blamed Hillary Clinton for ignoring Wisconsin, or the Democratic National Committee for boxing other candidates out of the primary field. Some blamed identity politics, which made working-class white voters \u201cfeel excluded,\u201d according to Prof. Mark Lilla of Columbia. Others blamed white people, particularly the coastal ones who couldn\u2019t get their heartland relatives on their side.The opposite turned out to be true: Women led the resistance, and everyone followed. A march for women managed to crowd a broad opposition force onto its platform. In the weeks since the march, that energy has only spread. After Trump\u2019s executive order halting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, the march\u2019s striking proof of concept \u2014 hit the streets, and a surprising number of others will join you \u2014 fueled more spontaneous actions in unexpected places: outside courthouses, Trump hotels, airport terminals, the offices of Senator Mitch McConnell. At each protest, you were likely to see a few pink cat ears poking out of the crowd, a reminder of the opposition\u2019s first gathering. It seems unlikely that any other kind of march would have turned out quite this way. In this moment, it happened that \u201cwomen\u201d was the one tent large enough to contain almost every major strain of protest against Trump.Those who know their feminist history might see a paradox here. The women\u2019s movement has not always been a site for unity. It has been marked just as deeply by its fractures, failures and tensions. But more than a century of internal turmoil has also forced the movement to reckon with its divisions. Now, the question is whether it can bring even more Americans into the fold.But Clinton has always been a wary avatar of feminism. In 2008, she didn\u2019t run for president as a \u201cwomen\u2019s candidate\u201d; if anything, she campaigned with her sex in the closet and the strategist Mark Penn advising her to harden her image into an American Iron Lady. \u201cThey do not want someone who would be the first mama,\u201d he wrote in one memo. Years later, HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d would satirize that posture through its own fictional politician. \u201cI can\u2019t identify myself as a woman!\u201d she tells her staff. \u201cPeople can\u2019t know that. Men hate that. And women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women.\u201dIn the eight years between Clinton\u2019s first and second presidential campaigns, though, something shifted: Feminism became fashionable. By the start of the Obama era, incisive women\u2019s blogs like Jezebel and Feministing had already hit the web and started throwing popcorn at the big screen of American culture, covering the same topics that women\u2019s magazines did \u2014 fashion, movies, sex \u2014 but taking on the women\u2019s magazines too. By Obama\u2019s second term, this model had thrived and multiplied so many times over that even a co-founder of the sports website Bleacher Report started his own women\u2019s site, Bustle. Soon enough, no corner of culture was safe from a feminist critique, from Christmas songs to \u201cmanspreading.\u201d Pop stars \u2014 people like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift \u2014 were asked if they were feminists, and if they shied away from the label, outrage would greet them online.It\u2019s not that women\u2019s activist groups vanished or political organizing stalled. But it did become possible for an American woman to cultivate a relationship to feminism that was primarily consumerist: There were feminist TV shows to watch, feminist celebrities to follow, feminist clothes to buy. Unlike many other major social movements, women\u2019s liberation dovetails neatly with an important advertising demographic, a lesson capitalism absorbed more than a century ago. In 1908, the advertiser J.Walter Thompson hired suffragists to address the growing women\u2019s market. Over the next decades, the industry would slip women\u2019s rights messaging into ad copy. Old Dutch Cleanser offered \u201cfreedom from household drudgery\u201d; Shredded Wheat promised a \u201cdeclaration of independence\u201d from cooking. These days, even our bath products have achieved empowerment. Ads for Secret deodorant nudge us to ask for a raise, and those for Always prompt us to challenge stereotypes about girls. Dove wants us to feel beautiful at any size.It\u2019s telling which strand of feminism these brands have deemed marketable: the one that doubles as self-help. This is a vision of feminism in which the primary thing that needs to change is a woman\u2019s frame of mind. Something similar happened to the pop stars who once hesitated to call themselves feminists \u2014 they came around to feminism by redefining feminism around themselves. To Lady Gaga, feminism was about protecting \u201cthe integrity of women who are ambitious.\u201d Taylor Swift realized, she said, that she had \u201cbeen taking a feminist stance without actually saying so.\u201d Feminism was being defined down to its most benign interpretation. It was less a political platform than a brand identity.In 2013, \u201cLean In,\u201d by Sheryl Sandberg, raised this pop-cultural subtext to the level of text. Sandberg called the book \u201csort of a feminist manifesto,\u201d but it preached individual solutions to systemic problems, encouraging women to focus on \u201cinternal obstacles\u201d and \u201cdismantle the hurdles in ourselves.\u201d This feminist mode, where personal success becomes synonymous with social progress, can be plugged into any number of political orientations. The latest model for the corporate-celebrity feminist brand is Ivanka Trump, who has built a lifestyle company under the hashtag #WomenWhoWork. A recent pitch neatly weds activist language with shoppable solutions: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to solving problems. If we can\u2019t find a solution, we\u2019ll make it ourselves (case in point: the Soho Tote, the ultimate work bag).\u201dBy the time the 2016 campaign rolled around, Clinton wasn\u2019t just permitted to run as a feminist \u2014 she was practically obligated to. Her messaging shifted accordingly. Years of women\u2019s debating the right way to be a feminist had the side effect of forcing the first female major-party candidate to the left. In 2008, she argued that she wanted abortion to be \u201csafe, legal and rare \u2014 and by rare I mean rare.\u201d In last year\u2019s debates, she stopped qualifying her support. \u201cI will defend Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said in one. \u201cI will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women\u2019s rights to make their own health care decisions.\u201dWhen Clinton lost, pop feminism suffered a crisis. As everyone pored over exit polls, some of the long-simmering fractures between different groups of women exploded into view. Ninety-four percent of black women voted for Clinton, but 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, perhaps more likely to see themselves in his vision of the world than in the pop feminism that fed Clinton\u2019s campaign. Despite Trump\u2019s palpable, eminently bloggable disrespect for women \u2014 and that infamous tape \u2014 he had successfully courted a faction of female voters. His win suggested that Americans were more comfortable with misogyny than many had thought, but it also burst the bubble of cheery pop feminism, which had achieved its huge popularity at the expense of class consciousness and racial solidarity.In some places, you could watch the mood turn in a matter of days. The Pantsuit Nation Facebook group ceased its celebrations and became a site for sharing stories of pain and resilience. But when the group\u2019s founder, a Maine educator named Libby Chamberlain, announced a plan to channel the power of the group in real life, it wasn\u2019t exactly a call to activism \u2014 it was a coffee-table book. \u201cYou are a force, Pantsuit Nation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can harness that force within the pages of a book and see it on night stands and coffee tables all around the world.\u201d The idea brought on a revolt. \u201cThe N.R.A. with its five million members has a stranglehold on Congress,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cPantsuit Nation has four million members and decides its main mission is \u2018storytelling\u2019 and now, selling books. What a colossal waste.\u201dDisparate organizers convened around a Facebook event announcing a Million Women March. There was one major problem with this: In 1997, activists organized a Million Woman March in Philadelphia to address the particular concerns of black women. When this new march on Washington unwittingly chose a very similar name, it crystallized the idea that the nascent movement was being run by a handful of white women with no organizing history. Comments began pouring in from all sides.The organizers had stumbled into a conflict that has dogged women\u2019s organizing from the very beginning: Of all the tensions that have coursed through the women\u2019s movement, none has ever been quite so pronounced as the one between white and black women. Consider what happened when Sojourner Truth showed up at a women\u2019s rights convention in Ohio in 1851. Frances Gage, the woman running the show, recalled the scene 12 years later: \u201cThe leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with the air of a queen up the aisle and take her seat upon the pulpit steps.\u201d A \u201cbuzz of disapprobation\u201d spread through the church. White women in attendance complained that a black woman\u2019s testimony would distract from the convention\u2019s focus. \u201cDon\u2019t let her speak, Mrs. Gage \u2014 it will ruin us,\u201d one said. \u201cEvery newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced.\u201dThroughout the convention, men arrived to speak out against women\u2019s suffrage. Women, they said, were too weak and helpless to be trusted with the power of the vote. Because \u201cthere were very few women in those days who dared to \u2018speak in meeting,\u2019\u2009\u201d as Gage put it, their points went unchallenged until Truth stepped forward. White women hissed, but Truth\u2019s very identity nullified the arguments coming from both men and women in attendance. \u201cThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place. And ain\u2019t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm!\u201d She rolled up her sleeve to the shoulder. \u201cI have plowed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me. And ain\u2019t I a woman?\u201dIn that moment, Truth shattered an idea of white femininity that had been used to both underpin and undermine the cause of suffrage. As a slave, she had worked in the fields like a man; as a free black woman, she could not rely on the offerings of white male gentility. Gage wrote that Truth\u2019s testimony compelled the white women in attendance to embrace her \u201cwith streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude.\u201dBut two years later, Truth still drew jeers from white crowds when she attended women\u2019s meetings. A vision of whiteness was ingrained in the leaders and the arguments of the mainstream movement. Even the suffragists\u2019 signature white clothes were deliberately chosen to signal purity. This ideal of feminine virtue did not extend to black women, or working-class ones. Some suffragists made their racism and classism explicit. In 1894, a white woman at a meeting of the Brooklyn Woman Suffrage Association complained that New York had become an \u201casylum for the trash of all nations,\u201d arguing that women\u2019s suffrage ought to be restricted. \u201cThink what it means to give it to all women,\u201d she said. \u201cOur criminal and pauper men have wives; there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor; there are probably two million Negro women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of animals.\u201dOne curious point of this history is that so many suffragists came from the antislavery movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, whose partnership would come to define the suffrage movement in the United States, started their activist careers as abolitionists. But after the Civil War, as black men and all women agitated for the right to vote, a political battle broke out over who would be enfranchised first. (Either way, black women would be last.) In 1865, Stanton lamented having to \u201cstand aside to see \u2018Sambo\u2019 walk into the kingdom first,\u201d as she put it in The National Anti-Slavery Standard.Over time, these racial contours would harden into lasting institutions. When women\u2019s social clubs spread across the United States at the turn of the century, two models emerged. Whites-only clubs leveraged middle-class women\u2019s leisure time to campaign for social reforms. Black women, who largely worked outside the home, came together around urgent needs. One of the first actions of the black Chicago Women\u2019s Club was to raise money to prosecute a police officer who killed a black man. The main distinction between clubs, the black activist Fannie Barrier Williams wrote, was that for black women, \u201cit is not a fad.\u201dBlack women distinguished themselves not only as suffragists but also as vocal critics of a movement that pushed one kind of justice aside in pursuit of another. In 1913, when thousands of suffragists marched on Washington to agitate for the vote, black women were instructed to march in the back. Ida B. Wells defied the order and marched with the delegation from Illinois, her home state. She wasn\u2019t just protesting for her right to vote. She was protesting the protest too.This dynamic is not only a thing of distant history: In the thick of feminism\u2019s second wave, women were often still divided along lines of identity. In 1967, as the best-selling author Betty Friedan called the first meeting of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, she found herself at odds with a black activist and lawyer named Flo Kennedy, who pushed the women around her to make common cause with the antiwar and Black Power movements. Friedan and the meeting\u2019s host \u2014 Muriel Fox, the highest-ranking female executive at the world\u2019s largest public-relations agency \u2014 were not pleased. As Kennedy put it in her memoirs, they \u201cwent bonkers.\u201dFriedan\u2019s 1963 book, \u201cThe Feminine Mystique,\u201d had been an awakening for a class of white, married, middle-class women, and she pictured herself as the leader of what she called a \u201cmainstream\u201d feminist movement. When women at one 1970 march offered her a lavender armband to wear in solidarity with a NOW member recently attacked for her bisexuality, Friedan dropped it on the ground, furious at the attempt to add gay rights to her program.Kennedy continually pushed in the opposite direction, trying to build bridges between feminist groups and other movements. At one point, Friedan admonished her to leave the feminist movement alone and \u201cfocus her attention on matters of Black Power.\u201d As the second wave matured, black women found themselves continually calling on it to consider a new approach, one that acknowledged the different needs of different women. As the black feminist and leftist Barbara Smith told the National Women\u2019s Studies Association in 1979, any feminism that didn\u2019t account for the specific concerns of black women, poor women, disabled women, lesbians and others was not really feminism \u2014 it was \u201cmerely female self-aggrandizement.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to me now to say it, but I didn\u2019t know the term \u2018intersectionality\u2019 when we started,\u201d Bob Bland, the Women\u2019s March co-chairwoman, told me. Now she deployed it often to emphasize the growing diversity of the march. She told various reporters that she had met women working \u201cin so many different intersectionalities\u201d and hoped to reach a \u201ca wide intersectionality of people\u201d in a march that reflected \u201call of the different intersections of human rights.\u201dThat magic word comes from a 1989 paper by the legal scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw that was published in The University of Chicago Legal Forum. Crenshaw had studied cases in which black women sued their employers for what appeared to be \u201ccompound discrimination\u201d \u2014 both racial and gender biases. But they were often told they lacked legal standing: Laws protected them from discrimination as African-Americans or as women, but not specifically as black women. Crenshaw used a traffic metaphor to describe the interlocking forms of oppression a person might face. Cars flowed through an intersection in all directions; when an accident happened, it could be caused by cars from any number of sides, or even all sides.That metaphor would be plucked from Crenshaw\u2019s paper and grow in resonance over the next two decades, until \u201cintersectionality\u201d became a rallying cry \u2014 the main point of rhetorical resistance against the tide of single-issue feminist conversation. Even beneath the shiny surface of Obama-era pop feminism, dissenters took countless shots at its racial cluelessness, its lack of class-consciousness, its sometimes shallow concerns. Women of color convened on Twitter under hashtags like #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen to detail their experiences of being sidelined in feminist conversations, and many on the left criticized the way a trickle-down, professional-oriented feminism was becoming popular just as income inequality between women was ballooning. (It\u2019s hard to \u201clean in\u201d to a job cleaning hotel rooms.) In recent years, intersectionality even popped up in People.com, on Bustle and in a tweet from Clinton.Often the criticism that lies behind this word is brushed off, met with defensiveness, taken personally. (As the founder of Pantsuit Nation wrote to critics of her book deal: \u201cThis is not the place for divisiveness.\u201d) Women turn to feminism because they want to stand up and say something; it can be jarring for them be told to sit down and listen to someone else. But the concept became a useful tool for the march on Washington, which set about the task of uniting feminism\u2019s mainstream, popular arm and its dissenting factions \u2014 all in the space of two months.Soon after the suggestion to march raced across the web, Vanessa Wruble \u2014 a white producer and co-founder of the media company OkayAfrica \u2014 made a pivotal intervention in its planning. \u201cI thought the stakes were so high,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt needed to be an inclusive movement, or it was going to be a total disaster. I felt that it could damage the country.\u201d At this critical moment, with the march quickly ballooning into something bigger than the initial organizers could handle on their own, Wruble reached out and urged them to drop the name Million Women March. Then she linked them up with her network, and soon three seasoned activists \u2014 Carmen Perez, Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory \u2014 got on board. These women hadn\u2019t necessarily supported Clinton, and they didn\u2019t necessarily identify as feminists. But they had experience organizing in communities of color and saw the march as an opportunity to reach a large new audience. When Sarsour got the call, she had just posted a comment on the march\u2019s Facebook page: \u201cCan you include Muslim women and Muslim communities in the list?\u201dThe three women \u2014 one Chicana Latina, one Palestinian-American, one black \u2014 met through their involvement in Justice League NYC, a juvenile-justice initiative. In 2015, they organized a nine-day march from New York to Washington, ending in a rally at the Capitol that drew a small crowd. Now hundreds of thousands of women whose previous interest in justice may have been abstract at best were turning to them for leadership. The question, Perez told me, was \u201cHow do we get them to understand that their liberation is bound with ours?\u201dMeanwhile, the three had some catching up to do with the mainstream feminist perspective. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of what I would consider to be deep, transformative relationships with white women,\u201d Sarsour told me. \u201cI\u2019ve been learning a lot,\u201d she said, and working toward becoming \u201cmore comfortable around this movement of feminism that I always felt didn\u2019t particularly include Muslim women.\u201d The organizers appeared on the hip-hop radio morning show \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d and loaded their Instagram page with black feminist heroes. But they also posed for windswept photos in Vogue, and some dropped by the Wing, a private Manhattan women\u2019s club with a $2,250 annual membership fee. Their rally put Angela Davis on the same stage as Scarlett Johansson.When I called Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw in January, she had just returned home to Los Angeles from the march on Washington, where she walked with a group of women from the African American Policy Forum. Her group was so far back in the crowd that they couldn\u2019t hear the rally, and \u201cI\u2019m kind of glad about it,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe were in this sea of humanity.\u201d Wading through the crowd, she said, \u201cI saw all the different issues and people that had found their way under the banner of the Women\u2019s March. It was the embodiment of the intersectional sensibilities that a lot of us have been working on for a very long time.\u201dThe women\u2019s movement\u2019s tendency toward a singular perspective is \u201cnot an exceptional problem for feminism,\u201d Crenshaw told me. \u201cPatriarchy works in such a way that these critiques never even surface in a lot of movements led by men. This conversation isn\u2019t always happening in other spaces. And if the conversation leads to more robust ways of thinking about women, feminism and social justice, it can be a very good thing.\u201d\u201cThe million-dollar question is: Can these feminisms live together under an anti-Trump banner?\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cIt happened for 24 hours all across the world.\u201dIn the first weeks of the Trump administration, the factions that split over his election are deepening along the same lines. Each side seems oddly confident in its political position. Trump supporters call themselves \u201cthe silent majority,\u201d while his critics identify as the \u201cpopular vote.\u201d When I called Eleanor Smeal, a co-founder of the Feminist Majority Foundation, and asked her whether the organization had any plans to reach out to the 53 percent of white women who voted for Trump, her response was to question the margin of error in the polls. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if we lost the majority or not, and I believe that we did not,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think they\u2019re with us.\u201dFor now, the factions of the left seem to have found an accord. But to regain any power in Washington, they will need to sway the center too \u2014 including some of those women who voted for Trump. The white women of the left, many of whom are just now finding their footing as activists, have been eager to dissociate from that group. Mention the 53 percent, and they\u2019re quick to tell you that they\u2019re of the 47. But of all the people who marched on Washington last month, they may be among the best positioned to reach across that aisle. \u201cI know of no other time when it would be more important,\u201d Barbara Smith, the black feminist and leftist, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not my work to do, but somebody ought to do it.\u201dAn article on Feb. 12 about feminism misstated the month of a speech by Hillary Clinton in which she mentioned the Seneca Falls convention of 1848. The speech was made in June 2016, when she clinched the Democratic nomination for president. It was not made in July, when she formally accepted the nomination.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kim Jong-nam Evidence Being Fabricated by Malaysia, North Korea Says", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea denied responsibility on Thursday for Kim Jong-nam\u2019s death, accusing the Malaysian authorities of fabricating evidence of Pyongyang\u2019s involvement under the influence of the North\u2019s archrival, South Korea.Meanwhile, relatives and acquaintances of the two women Malaysia has accused of carrying out the killing \u2014 by applying poison to Mr. Kim\u2019s face as North Korean agents looked on \u2014 insisted that they must have been duped into doing so, though the Malaysian authorities say otherwise.\u201cI don\u2019t believe Huong did such a thing,\u201d said Doan Van Thanh, father of Doan Thi Huong, a 28-year-old Vietnamese woman being held in Malaysia. \u201cShe was a very timid girl. When she saw a rat or frog, she would scream.\u201dMr. Thanh, a 63-year-old veteran who was wounded in 1972 during the war with the United States, said he had seen little of his daughter in recent years. He said she left the family\u2019s home, in a small farming village south of Hanoi, at 17 to attend community college, where she studied to be a pharmacist.She later left Vietnam to work in Malaysia without telling her family, Mr. Thanh said. He said she rarely visited. When she returned home in January for the Tet holiday, he said, she had little money for the customary gifts and stayed only a few days.North Korea has called for the release of Ms. Huong, an Indonesian woman and a North Korean man who are being held by Malaysia in connection with the death of Mr. Kim.The statement on Thursday from the Jurists Committee was cited by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, in the first comment on the killing from the North\u2019s official news media. The statement accused the Malaysian authorities of pursuing a case \u201cfull of loopholes and contradictions\u201d that proved that its investigators \u201cintended to frame us.\u201d It said Malaysia had done so under South Korean influence.According to the statement, the Malaysian Foreign Ministry and the local hospital first told the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur that Mr. Kim had died of \u201cheart stroke,\u201d asking North Korea to take the body and cremate it.But Malaysian officials\u2019 attitude began changing after the South Korean news media, citing anonymous sources, reported that Mr. Kim had been poisoned, according to the North Korean statement.\u201cThe Malaysian secret police got involved in the case and recklessly made it an established fact\u201d that the death had been a poisoning, according to the North Korean statement, which did not refer to Mr. Kim by name.The statement questioned how Ms. Huong and the Indonesian woman accused in the killing, Siti Aisyah, 25, could have survived if, as Malaysian officials said, they used their hands to administer a deadly poison to Mr. Kim.Ms. Siti grew up in Indonesia in similar circumstances to Ms. Huong\u2019s, in a small farming village called Sindangsari, about four hours east of Jakarta. She went to school through sixth grade, married at 16 and divorced at 20, according to family members and official documents.Family members and Indonesian officials have said they believe she was tricked into thinking that the attack on Mr. Kim was part of a comedy video, involving spraying liquid on unwitting victims in public. The Malaysian authorities have said that both women were aware that the liquid was toxic.Rahmat Yusri, the head of the Jakarta neighborhood where Ms. Siti lived while she was married, said she was an unlikely assassin. He recalled that she did not have close friends.\u201cShe is village girl, a na\u00efve girl with a low education,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can I believe that she\u2019s a murderer? Particularly that she killed a famous person?\u201dThe Malaysian authorities have said that four North Koreans were believed to have directed the attack and that they fled to their homeland after it was carried out. On Wednesday, the Malaysian police said they were seeking to question an official at the North Korean Embassy, Hyon Kwang Song, in the case.Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and Richard C. Paddock from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Chau Doan contributed reporting from Nghia Binh, Vietnam, Fira Abdurachman from Jakarta, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hipster Cop Retires. The Nickname Still Applies.", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe is Detective Rick Lee, 51, who became an internet sensation as the nattily attired plainclothes detective assigned to patrol the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations in Manhattan in 2011.On Friday, the Hipster Cop became a hipster civilian, as Detective Lee officially retired from the department after a 25-year career.But while he may become plain old Mr. Lee, he expects that his nickname will not be retired along with him. Even after his fame subsided after the 2011 protests ended, Mr. Lee has been regularly recognized, usually by younger people who tend to follow social media. He does not expect this to change.\u201cI still get \u2018hipster cop\u2019 yelled at me in the street,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the Twitter, Facebook crowd, people who live their lives online.\u201dMr. Lee gained the hipster moniker on blogs and social media for his debonair style in the middle of the chaotic weeks of protests, mostly around a makeshift camp set up in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan.With his cool demeanor, he became an instant celebrity, an internet meme, and one of the few recognizable figures in the protests.\u201cI found the whole thing funny,\u201d he said. \u201cIt kind of generated its own life.\u201dThat life included scores of profiles and interviews, including one in GQ magazine about his fashion sense, which began when he was a teenager and that eventually developed into more of \u201can English country look\u201d with a penchant for vintage clothing.A slim man with a shaggy-chic hairstyle and cool-nerd eyeglasses, Mr. Lee stood out at Zuccotti Park, which was then dominated by demonstrators in casual or rumpled clothing and police officers in blue uniforms.The detective would pad around chatting with cops and demonstrators alike, and used his sudden style popularity to become a crucial liaison between the department and protesters.\u201cHow I dressed knocked a lot of walls down, and people found me more approachable,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who as a plainclothes detective followed a longstanding department tradition of sharply dressed detectives but \u201cupdated it\u201d with certain twists, he said. He wore tweed suits in the winter and seersucker or linen in the summer.On more casual days, he favored cardigan sweaters, glasses and skinny ties to go along with his skinny trousers.He said he always found the term hipster, in its contemporary meaning, imprecisely applied to him, as if lumping him in with \u201cbearded dudes in Williamsburg with flannel shirts and construction boots.\u201dBut in the classic sense of the term, it did apply because \u201ca hipster in its purest form is someone who dresses out of the norm,\u201d added Mr. Lee, who lives on Staten Island.He joined the Police Department at age 25 and worked as a patrolman, mostly in the First Precinct, in Lower Manhattan, for eight years before getting assigned to the precinct\u2019s Community Affairs division, which helps mediate with the public.That command includes SoHo and TriBeCa, and over the years, Mr. Lee met many celebrities, like Robert De Niro and David Bowie, a fashion favorite. At the annual Tribeca Film Festival, he routinely helped coordinate city permits and security.In the weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Mr. Lee worked at ground zero with officials from the city\u2019s Office of the Medical Examiner identifying and processing recovered human remains. He said that he still got coughing fits from breathing in debris at the time.But it was at Zuccotti Park where he rose to prominence, as an affable but firm intermediary between protesters and police officials.Regarding the demonstrators, Mr. Lee said, \u201cI became friends with a lot of them, just seeing them every day.\u201dOften his message was \u201cLet\u2019s work this out before the guys with the hats and bats come in,\u201d he recalled.And he has never stopped being known as the Hipster Cop. Take, for example, a New Year\u2019s Eve party a couple of years back.\u201cThere was a guy looking at me and he said, \u2018You\u2019re him,\u2019 and I just said, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s true,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe worked in I.T., and he said, \u2018You have no idea how huge you are in this field.\u2019\u201dMr. Lee said he was disappointed that the department never approved a recommendation made by his commanding officer that he be promoted from third-grade to second-grade detective before he retired.\u201cI\u2019m kind of upset about that,\u201d he said, adding that the promotion would have motivated him to delay his retirement for another two years to help him increase his pension.Nevertheless, Mr. Lee, who is single, said he would use his retirement to enjoy his Shetland sheepdog, his two nieces and a nephew. He hopes to finally enjoy the Tribeca Film Festival as an attendee, as well as visit far-flung places that work kept him from.\u201cI\u2019ve never been to California,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Takes Steps to Improve Advertising Data After Criticism", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook said on Friday that it would agree to an audit of information it provides to marketers and provide them with new, more precise measurement data, less than two weeks after Procter & Gamble, America\u2019s biggest advertiser, criticized the lack of transparency provided by digital ad platforms.For example, marketers might pay only if an ad was viewed to completion or if the sound was on. The nonprofit Media Rating Council will conduct an audit to \u201cverify the accuracy of the information\u201d Facebook gives marketers, the company said in a blog post, adding that it was also working with 24 third-party measurement companies.Facebook announced the changes after Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble, demanded that the digital ad industry \u201cgrow up,\u201d criticizing the different ways platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, define whether an ad has been viewed and the lack of accredited outside sources used to measure digital ad performance.While technology has let advertisers \u201cventure where no creative has been before at lightning speed,\u201d it has too often led to bad advertising accompanied by even worse viewing experiences, Mr. Pritchard said on Jan. 29 at a conference held by the Interactive Advertising Bureau.\u201cWe spend enormous amounts of time trying to understand, analyze and explain the differences between Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, Pandora, YouTube and the dozens of different viewability standards claimed to be right metric for each platform,\u201d Mr. Pritchard said, according to a copy of his remarks given to The New York Times. \u201cThink about that for a moment. It would be like each N.F.L. football team having a different standard of yards needed for a first down.\u201dThe mistake, followed by several other disclosures of erroneous measurements, spurred an industrywide reassessment of the metrics used by digital advertising platforms, which are drawing more marketing dollars every year. Facebook\u2019s revenue last year, for instance, soared by more than 50 percent.The social network, in its post on Friday, said that it would provide marketers with new data on display ads, including the milliseconds they appear on a screen. Its new video ad buying options will include \u201ctwo-second buying,\u201d where at least half of an ad\u2019s pixels are in view for two seconds or longer, which Facebook noted complies with the Media Rating Council\u2019s video standard.\u201cFacebook\u2019s actions on media transparency are a positive step forward, particularly coming from one of the largest media players in the industry,\u201d Mr. Pritchard said in an emailed statement. Procter & Gamble was \u201cencouraged by the responsiveness and leadership Facebook is demonstrating, and we hope it builds more momentum to create a clean and productive digital media supply chain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Trump\u2019s Volleys, Echoes of Alex Jones\u2019s Conspiracy Theories", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorAlex Jones.Mr. Jones, 43, has been around for a while. Like every media outfit in the Trump era, his platforms have gotten record traffic and, he told me last week, seen increases in revenue, with ads for water purification systems and for supplements to enhance \u201cbrain force\u201d and virility.But he is apparently taking on a new role as occasional information source and validator for the president of the United States, with whom, Mr. Jones says, he sometimes speaks on the phone.Millions of listeners and viewers tune in to Mr. Jones on his websites (Infowars chief among them), on Facebook and through old-fashioned radio, and their loyalty partly explains how Mr. Trump maintains a hard-core faithful who don\u2019t believe a word they read about him in a newspaper like this one.His audience, Mr. Jones told me, is \u201cthe teeth of the Trump organization on the ground \u2014 the information-warfare, organic internal resistance.\u201d Sure enough, on Saturday the journalist McKay Coppins of The Atlantic tweeted from Florida, \u201cSpotted at Trump rally: More than one InfoWars t-shirt.\u201dWhere Mr. Jones\u2019s content fits in Mr. Trump\u2019s broad media diet isn\u2019t clear. White House officials declined to talk about it in detail. (Hey, Mr. President, I\u2019m trying.) But as Mr. Trump pushes full steam ahead on his effort to delegitimize American journalism, he is lending credence to a number of out-there Jonesisms, adding yet another \u201cpinch yourself, this is happening\u201d element to our national journey into the upside-down.Mr. Jones demurred when it came to his influence on Mr. Trump, which he said the \u201cMSM\u201d (mainstream media) overstated to undermine the president. \u201cMSM tries to say Alex Jones is an eight-headed kook with all these warts and Trump\u2019s copying everything he says,\u201d Mr. Jones told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true.\u201dFor instance, he said, when he urged Mr. Trump to address illegal voting allegations during one phone conversation, \u201che said, \u2018I already know, I\u2019m making a speech in two days.\u2019\u201d (Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cwas an Infowarrior before I was born.\u201d)Either way, Mr. Jones is hoping his organization will qualify for a coveted White House press credential. He says it\u2019s not something he\u2019s pining for or needs, but he doesn\u2019t see why Infowars shouldn\u2019t get one when \u201cTrump\u2019s calling CNN fake.\u201dThe White House said it had yet to receive a proper application from Infowars and therefore could not comment on whether it would get one. Mr. Jones said the delay might be related to a bureaucratic snag. \u201cThey say it\u2019s going to get rectified,\u201d he said.Mr. Stone said in an interview, \u201cThey are reaching millions of people, and these people are steadfast and loyal Trump supporters.\u201dMr. Jones\u2019s growth has astounded those who have followed a progression that began on cable access in Austin, Tex., in the early 1990s, moved to radio and then to the bigger national footprint he began building online.It\u2019s the sort of message that resonates with his segment of Trump voters because, Mr. Jones said, \u201cthe public doesn\u2019t have any trust in the system.\u201d\u201cThey believe the social contract is broken,\u201d he continued, \u201cand they\u2019re able to interact with the new diverse pantheon of the internet-based media.\u201d In other words, with people like him.It makes you wonder: If Watergate had broken in this media environment, would President Richard Nixon have had to resign? Would enough people have believed it?I put the question to Bob Woodward, who broke that scandal for The Washington Post with Carl Bernstein. He said it would have turned out the same. \u201cThe evidence was so strong, because of the tapes \u2014 these things turn on the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be: Can you get information and sources and testimony from witnesses and documents that show what happened.\u201dGiven that no alternative reality was strong enough to save Mr. Flynn\u2019s job, for instance, I\u2019d have to agree. That said, if you live in Mr. Jones\u2019s world, Mr. Flynn\u2019s ouster would seem to be the height of injustice, delivered by the news media on behalf of those \u201ccriminal, corporate elements inside the C.I.A.\u201d So, yes, you would see the press as the enemy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Big Red Stamp, Russia Singles Out What It Calls \u2018Fake\u2019 News", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry got into the fake news business in a splashy way on Wednesday.No, not by creating it. That dark art seems to emanate from other, even more opaque branches of the Russian government.Russia actually announced something of a fake news double whammy, since the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, told Parliament on Wednesday that the military had created a special task force assigned to wage information warfare, although he did not provide any details.It was hard for some critics to take the ministry\u2019s fake news detector seriously, and some suggested that inclusion there was something of a badge of honor, an indication that the article had hit close to home.The Foreign Ministry has become a propaganda wing serving the Kremlin rather than a diplomatic service that establishes foreign policy, said Alexei A. Venediktov, the longtime editor of the respected Echo of Moscow radio station.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry at all,\u201d he said, but should instead consider being singled out by the Foreign Ministry to be an honor \u201clike a medal.\u201dMs. Zakharova introduced the fake news section during her weekly, nationally televised briefing. \u201cWe will publish examples of propaganda hoaxes from various media outlets and give links to sources,\u201d she said. \u201cThe aim is to demonstrate the main trends in fake news publications about our country and do everything to stop their dissemination.\u201dIt was not immediately clear what criteria the ministry would apply in its effort to identify what it considered to be fake news, and Ms. Zakharova declined to answer questions beyond what she said at her briefing.The spokeswoman emphasized that the Foreign Ministry would consider the news fake when it failed to include Russian reaction or the Russian position on the issue. News published from unidentified sources that constituted opinion or unverified fact also qualified, according to Ms. Zakharova.The initiative appeared to be a reaction to widespread reporting over the past year focused on fake news emanating from Russia. Ms. Zakharova outlined an appeal process, noting that news organizations could ask to have their work removed.\u201cRussia is being accused of doing this, but how can you accuse us of disseminating untrue information by government agencies and the media while you are doing the same against Russia?\u201d Ms. Zakharova said. \u201cWhile publishing information about Russia, the world media is doing the same thing \u2014 they never cite concrete facts \u2014 this is a sad paradox.\u201dThere is a rather distinct gap between what Russia is accused of disseminating and what it labeled \u201cfake news.\u201dAfter Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 from Amsterdam was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 civilians on board, for example, local rebel commanders at first bragged about shooting down an aircraft at the very spot.A Dutch-led investigation concluded that the powerful surface-to-air missile system that took down the airliner had been trucked in from Russia at the request of Russian-backed separatists and returned over the border the same night.As tensions with Europe escalated over the past several years, all sorts of false news stories emerged. State news media and Russian officials falsely claimed that a 13-year-old Russian immigrant in Germany had been kidnapped and raped, for example, and websites linked to Russia spread rumors, like one that Sweden had been approached to sell weapons to female fighters for the Islamic State.The stories that Russia labeled \u201cfake news\u201d were certainly more mainstream fare.The initial offerings included five articles from various large organizations including The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Daily Telegraph and NBC News. Indicating that its reach would be wide, however, one article was included from the Santa Monica Observer in California, about the sudden deaths of a number of Russian diplomats in recent months.Seemingly borrowing a practice from President Trump, Russia appears to be labeling as fake any articles it dislikes. The one from Bloomberg, for example, quoted Richard Ferrand, the chief of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s presidential campaign in France, as accusing Russia of carrying out cyberattacks against the campaign. It quoted Dmitri S. Peskov, Russia\u2019s presidential spokesman, as denying any link.The New York Times article, by a veteran national security reporter and former Moscow correspondent, Michael R. Gordon, detailed concerns in the American administration about Russian violations of a nuclear arms treaty. The story quoted unidentified officials as well as experts in the field, and it noted Russian criticism of some aspects of the treaty.A spokeswoman for The Times strongly defended the article and criticized the practice of simply labeling news reports fake without any substantiating evidence.\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous and troubling situation for governments or individuals to simply assign the label of fake news to a story they don\u2019t like, instead of challenging specific facts or offering counter evidence,\u201d said Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman. \u201cWe stand by our reporting.\u201dRussian social media erupted with a certain amount of derision about the whole enterprise, particularly since the link in Russian to the page translated as \u201cpublications and refutations.\u201d\u201cSo to slap a red stamp and grandly say that something is \u2018fake\u2019 \u2014 this is what they call refutation these days?\u201d wrote one Russian man on Facebook. A reporter for the English-language Moscow Times asked via Twitter whether he could borrow the big red stamp.Ms. Zakharova said that the ministry would not be assessing Russian news media for fake news.

{"Headline": "New Jersey Alters Its Bail System and Upends Legal Landscape", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPATERSON, N.J. \u2014 Jamie Contrano squirmed at the defendant\u2019s table inside the Passaic County Court House here. She had been charged with possessing four envelopes of heroin, and, having failed to show up for more than a dozen court appearances over the years, she was a perfect candidate for a high bail \u2014 and a lengthy jail stay.But under an overhaul of New Jersey\u2019s bail system, which went into effect Jan. 1, judges are now considering defendants\u2019 flight risk and threat to public safety in deciding whether to detain them while they await trial. Otherwise, they are to be released, usually with certain conditions.Judge Ernest M. Caposela, who oversees Passaic County, noted that Ms. Contrano, 39, had a job at a carwash and was seeing a doctor specializing in addiction. He decided to let her out. \u201cWill she fall off the wagon?\u201d Judge Caposela said in an interview after the hearing. \u201cShe might. But sitting in jail is only going to hurt her. She has a disease, so is that a person I want to keep in jail for five to six weeks?\u201dNew Jersey\u2019s changes, which were backed by Gov. Chris Christie, closely mirror those adopted by the federal judicial system and the District of Columbia, which have long shunned monetary bail in criminal proceedings. While a handful of other states like Kentucky and Colorado have pursued bail changes, New Jersey stands apart as having the most far-reaching overhaul.Bail is still an option, but the reality is that judges have nearly done away with it. In the 3,382 cases statewide that were processed in the first four weeks of January, judges set bail only three times. An additional 283 defendants were held without bail because they were accused of a serious crime or were a significant flight risk, or both.\u201cA year ago, a defendant who appeared in court would have been forced to post bail in a majority of cases,\u201d said the state\u2019s chief justice, Stuart Rabner. \u201cAnd one in eight inmates were being held because they couldn\u2019t post bail of up to $2,500.\u201d That is the typical amount for a minor offense, and bail bond agents would usually seek 10 percent, or $250 in cash. Some defendants cannot afford even that.The new approach, perhaps not surprisingly, has provoked protest from the bail bond industry, which says the system is allowing dangerous criminals out on the streets. \u201cThe system is just overloaded,\u201d said Richard Blender, a lawyer in New Jersey who represents several bail bond agents. \u201cThey can\u2019t process these defendants fast enough. They are just pushing people out the door. You\u2019re talking about child pornography, carjacking and aggravated sexual assault.\u201dBut experts argue that a system relying on bail does not guarantee public safety. \u201cThere is nothing that says you can\u2019t be a serial killer and a millionaire,\u201d said Joseph E. Krakora, the state\u2019s public defender.E. Rely Vilcica, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Temple University, pointed out that drug dealers often had the means to post high bails and continued plying their trade. \u201cBasically people who have money can buy their freedom,\u201d Professor Vilcica said. \u201cSo cash bail doesn\u2019t address the danger.\u201dThough not having to hold defendants in jails reduces spending, judicial officials said that cost savings did not motivate the changes to the system. (In some jurisdictions, like a county in North Carolina, jails have closed as pretrial detentions plummet.) Instead, they said, the overhaul was driven by a desire to address one of the ways in which the nation\u2019s criminal justice system tends to fall hardest on poor and minority defendants.\u201cLarge numbers of people were in our jails for weeks or months for low-level offenses,\u201d said Roseanne Scotti, the New Jersey state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cThey are innocent until proven guilty, but their whole lives are derailed. While they are in there, they lose homes and jobs and contact with their families. But if you have money, you can walk.\u201dThe new system assigns defendants scores of one to six, with one being the least risky. They receive a risk assessment within 48 hours of their arrests, though some judges, like Mr. Caposela, are striving to complete assessments within 24 hours.Ms. Contrano, who was charged with heroin possession, had the worst score, both because of her 17 failures to appear in previous court cases and because of an outstanding assault charge. \u201cI made a bad judgment call,\u201d she said to the judge, referring to her recent arrest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dJudge Caposela said the computer-generated scores did not tell the whole story and were a guide, not a directive. He ordered her to stay out of Paterson, which he said had the \u201cpurest and cheapest\u201d heroin on the East Coast; to check in with the court officials; and to report for drug testing. \u201cIf I just let the computer make this call, she\u2019s out of luck,\u201d he said after Ms. Contrano\u2019s detention hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of careful consideration and contemplation.\u201dThey have highlighted cases like burglaries and sexual assaults. In one, a 20-year-old sex offender in Ocean County, Christopher Wilson, was charged with attempted sexual assault after he offered a gaming console to a 12-year-old girl in exchange for sex. He was placed under house arrest with an electronic monitoring bracelet pending trial. The local police chief, Richard J. Buzby Jr., then issued an emotional warning to parents, saying he \u201ccould not sleep tonight\u201d if he remained silent.Kirk Shaw, whose grandfather started Shaw Bail Bonds Agency in Hackensack in 1969, said the system had driven a stake through a four-generation business that now included his son. \u201cWe\u2019re basically out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re expected to monitor the defendants we do have out on bail, but we have no money coming in. This is all I\u2019ve done since I was 18.\u201dJudicial officials reject the idea that dangerous criminals are flooding communities. \u201cThere is no system that eliminates all risk,\u201d Chief Justice Rabner said. \u201cLast year, there was a risk that anyone released on bail could go out and commit a serious crime pending trial. What we are attempting to do is evaluate the level of risk with objective measures.\u201dStill, he acknowledged: \u201cThere will be a crisis one day, where a single defendant will violate conditions and does something that grabs the public\u2019s attention. But that\u2019s no different than before.\u201dDaniel Palazzo, a public defender in Passaic County and the lawyer for Ms. Contrano, points to recent cases as examples of how he believes the new system is more effective. A client charged with murder was detained pending trial. Under the old system, Mr. Palazzo said, the defendant, 20, who is accused in a fatal shooting in Paterson in September, could have theoretically posted a $500,000 to $1 million bail to win his release, because judges were obligated to set bail no matter the crime.But another client charged with attempted murder was released under certain conditions. Before Jan. 1, the defendant, who is accused of a stabbing, would have faced bail of about $200,000 and most likely would have spent a year and a half in jail awaiting trial. \u201cBut there was a viable self-defense argument to be made,\u201d Mr. Palazzo said, \u201cbecause the victim had been the aggressor in the past.\u201dSome elected officials complain that a bail overhaul amounts to an unfunded mandate for counties, which have had to spend tens of millions of dollars on new sheriffs\u2019 officers and prosecutorial investigators to escort defendants to court and to weigh seeking a motion to detain them.But judicial reform advocates lauded New Jersey\u2019s willingness to pursue a wholesale revision, rather than take baby steps. \u201cIt certainly is ambitious to take on a whole state at once,\u201d said Cherise Fanno Burdeen, chief executive of the Pretrial Justice Institute, a nonprofit in Maryland. \u201cWe are incredibly proud of the seemingly successful arrival at a system that has moved away from money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She had been one of the first lawyers on the scene and later began organizing the crush of volunteer attorneys.Within days, the group had set up servers, Google spreadsheets and a steering committee. Sprawled across crowded tables and the terminal\u2019s polished floors, they used their laptops and cellphones to write manuals on how to help travelers.And things moved quickly at Terminal 4.Chris Hennessy, 24, a volunteer from Harlem, stumbled upon the group and began picking up trash and getting coffee for the lawyers.

{"Headline": "Even When White Men Can Jump ...", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySUPPOSE an N.B.A. player is looking to build a large fan base. Is it an advantage to be of a certain racial or ethnic background? Are players judged exclusively by their achievements and the logos on their uniforms? Or does the color of their skin come into play as well?This is a long-debated question. For years, owners were accused of padding their benches with white players to increase a team\u2019s fan base. The implicit assumption: If you are white, you will have more fans.It has been difficult, if not impossible, to test the role race plays in fandom because we have had limited data on how popular different players are. But we now have probably the best data set ever accumulated on the fandom of N.B.A. players: Facebook likes.I downloaded information on the likes of 215 N.B.A. players who have fan pages on Facebook.Before we compare whether individual black or white players have more fans, we should ask whether black or white players in general tend to be cheered on more by people who share their skin color. Do white players have whiter fan bases and black players blacker fan bases?Indeed, they do.While Facebook does not ask users to denote their race, it uses a variety of information to identify someone\u2019s ethnic affinity, which can be useful for targeting ads. My research suggests that this ethnic affinity measure correlates strongly with race.Overall, I estimate that the average white player in the N.B.A. has a fan base that is 56.7 percent white and 22.7 percent black. The average black player has a fan base that is 46.7 percent white and 32 percent black, a significant difference.Is there another explanation for this that has nothing to do with skin color?Perhaps black and white Americans, on average, root for different teams, and the teams they root for happen to have more players that share their skin color.Nope. The differences are the same if we limit the analysis to players on the same team.Perhaps black and white Americans show different preferences for foreign players, who are twice as likely as American-born players to be white.Nope. The differences are the same if we just limit the analysis to American-born players.Perhaps black and white Americans, for whatever reason, like different types of players. Black Americans may like point guards who dish out lots of assists. Such players are more likely to be black. White Americans may like centers who collect lots of rebounds. Such players are more likely to be white.Nope. Adding these factors does not change the fact that the race of a player influences the racial breakdown of his fans.Perhaps less surprisingly, Asian-Americans make up a much larger portion of the fan base of Asian players than non-Asian players. This is driven almost entirely by the advent of Jeremy Lin, the Harvard-educated point guard born to Taiwanese immigrants who has proved a hero for Asian-Americans.The popularity of Mr. Lin among Asian-Americans is so great that many of Mr. Lin\u2019s largest fan bases are in cities in which he has never played, but which have large Asian populations, like Honolulu.Clearly, a player\u2019s skin color affects the demographic breakdown of his fan base. But how does it affect the size of his fan base? Do white fans give an edge to white players or black fans give an edge to black players?To test this, we can utilize a social science tool called multi-variable regression, which allows us to model the factors that affect the size of a player\u2019s fan base \u2014 his statistics, what team he plays for, his age, how many All-Star games he has participated in, the position he plays, whether he was born in America and, yes, his race.When we do this, we find that there is a clear edge to being of a certain race. But it goes against what many white owners and journalists have long thought.If a white and a black player are similar on paper, it is the black player who will have more fans.Among black Americans, black players are roughly twice as popular as comparable white players. But black players get a slight boost from fans of every racial group. Compared with white players who are similar to them in all ways I could think to measure, black players have more fans among white Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian-Americans.Honestly, I was blown away by the overall size of this advantage. Roughly speaking, I estimate that a white player would have to score 10 more points per game to have as big a fan base on Facebook as he would have if he were black.Asian-Americans also have a huge advantage in building a fan base, although this is driven almost entirely by Mr. Lin, who is the 27th most popular player despite being the 80th most prolific scorer. Of the 30 most popular players, he is one of only two men who has never played in an N.B.A. All-Star game. The other is Tristan Thompson of the Cleveland Cavaliers. This initially made no sense to me: Mr. Thompson averages fewer than 10 points per game. But then a friend explained the likely reason to me: Mr. Thompson is dating Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.What should we make of the edge in support that black players get? It is of course possible that someone will find an alternative explanation for this correlation, but let\u2019s assume that my analysis of the data holds up and that being black is a large advantage today for N.B.A. players trying to build a fan base. How should we interpret these results? Is it a bad thing or a good thing or nothing?But African-Americans getting a boost in support? What should we make of that? I view this phenomenon as good news in at least two ways. I think it\u2019s great that members of minority groups who face discrimination in many aspects of their lives show strong support for other members of the group. And it is also encouraging that many white fans will give some extra support to the country\u2019s most successful minority athletes.Advertisement"}

No one died. No one even stubbed a toe. But there\u2019s a good chance you know that by now: that the supposed terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Ky., that Ms. Conway, a top presidential adviser, invoked on MSNBC last week to justify President Trump\u2019s contentious travel ban never happened. (And, no, the reason you had never heard of it was not because the Dishonest Media ignored the alleged carnage at the time of its non-happening, as Ms. Conway alleged.)The very fact that you probably know all this means that the \u201cBowling Green Massacre\u201d may go down in the record of the Trump presidency as the first break in the \u201cfake news\u201d clouds that have cast such gloom over our fair and once (relatively) true republic.The same internet that enabled false stories to run unchecked through news feeds during the election year dispatched new white blood cells that attacked Ms. Conway\u2019s \u201calternate facts\u201d with \u201ctrue facts\u201d (a redundant term that I guess we\u2019re stuck with for now). Their most effective attack was traditional reporting, in many cases from news organizations that have doubled down on fact-checking, joined by newfangled memes that accentuate the truth.It\u2019s early. Vigilance, and continuing improvements throughout the news business, remain necessary. But the tale of the \u201cmassacre\u201d could be the start of something new.Ms. Conway\u2019s mention of the supposed attack \u2014 she was trying to justify Mr. Trump\u2019s order that closed the border to citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries \u2014 slipped past the MSNBC host interviewing her, Chris Matthews. The corrective story broke the way stories have broken since God invented newspapers: A guy walked into a bar.The authorities never charged the men \u2014 one of whose fingerprints turned up on a roadside bomb in Iraq \u2014 with planning an attack on American soil.It made like a Trump tweet and roared through the broader news media sphere.\u201cThat tweet got 2.4 million impressions,\u201d Mr. Sonka said. \u201cPretty crazy.\u201dIn the end, social media and journalistic scrutiny aligned with comedy to right a wrong pretty definitively. That it happened so organically showed that false \u201cfacts\u201d might not always be the stubborn things so many people fear they are becoming.Then there are the regular Trump Tweets calling CNN or The Times \u201cfake news.\u201dThe Bowling Green episode made such a splash because it played directly into concerns that the Trump administration would use untrue assertions to rally support for its agenda while denigrating as \u201cdishonest\u201d all the valid reporting pointing out the falsehoods.But even before the Bowling Green story fell apart so spectacularly, there were signs that what had worked well during the presidential campaign last year might not succeed when it comes to the real-world work of government.All the accusations of \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cdishonest media\u201d couldn\u2019t erase images of crying relatives stranded at airports \u2014 or the reporting on the legal questions surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order that led a judge to temporarily suspend it.Ditto for the blowback over the whole Bowling Green yarn. Ms. Conway went on to admit her error, first on Twitter (where else?) and later in an interview with Howard Kurtz of Fox News, saying it was overblown because \u201cI misspoke one word.\u201d (By that, she meant, apparently, that she should have said \u201cBowling Green terrorists\u201d rather than \u201cBowling Green massacre.\u201d)It would be a positive development if Ms. Conway embraced the idea that the term \u201chonest mistakes\u201d can apply to reporters, too, as it would be if everybody \u2014 including journalists \u2014 doubly committed to getting the facts right, without hysteria or misfires. Too optimistic?Well, if you had asked me a few days ago what I was planning to write about, I wouldn\u2019t have said it would involve praising Twitter for keeping the national debate reality-based \u2014 and fun.Eventually, the Bowling Green memes led to mock street memorials with signs like \u201cNever Remember.\u201d They had made it IRL, or \u201cIn Real Life,\u201d which, the new administration is learning, has a way of sneaking up on you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "3 Playwrights on How Mass Shootings Forced Them to Write", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMass shootings happen in public spaces and private offices. They happen at places of worship and study, work and play. And increasingly, they happen onstage \u2014 in fictional tragedies and verbatim dramas that explore the psychology of the shooters and the consequences for the affected individuals and communities.The New York Times spoke to these writers about representing gun violence onstage and their own experiences with firearms. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.What inspired your play?I was tired of my own complacency whenever something horrific happens that I can\u2019t understand, this being a traumatic one because it was 6- and 7-year old children. I was tired of doing Facebook posts with my personal comments about how angry I am and sending it into the void. I wanted to see if I could offer anything as a writer.Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence?I was not raised in a gun house. My dad owned a gun because he was a night-shift manager. I\u2019m pretty common sense on gun control: I believe that people have the right to own a personal handgun for safety if they feel the need to. I don\u2019t feel the need to. There\u2019s a good police force out there that will do it for me.How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage? We use a very theatrical conceit; when the moment happens, it\u2019s an actual giant shattering of glass. I promised every person I interviewed that I would never try to make this a piece of sensationalism. I don\u2019t want to see that. We\u2019re dealing with children, and that\u2019s some touchy ground. That\u2019s not the story I\u2019m trying to tell.Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era? I would never thank him for anything. But I\u2019ve got to thank him because the climate he\u2019s created in this country has made this piece relevant. I had students on opening weekend saying, \u201cIt made me realize that I want to become an activist.\u201d This 35-year-old liberal heart was in heaven.What inspired your play?I knew that nothing legislative was going to happen after Sandy Hook; it filled me with such boiling rage. I really just couldn\u2019t imagine how furious you would be if you lost a child like that. That was the seed. Also, I\u2019ve been long-term fascinated with the contradictions over what it means to operate a weapon, that in order to do it effectively you need to be calm, almost meditative.Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence?I\u2019ve shot a rifle \u2014 a bolt-action rifle at Boy Scout camp. I have never encountered any gun violence personally in Chicago, where I live. But I have read articles about someone living in my neighborhood, driving a route that I drive all the time and seeing someone get shot in the head.How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage? I have yet to see realistic violence rendered onstage that didn\u2019t take me out of the experience: I\u2019m so aware that what I\u2019m watching is not real. We do ourselves a disservice when we try to make theater a literal space. It\u2019s always way more effective to enlist an audience\u2019s imagination.When you see weapons onstage, your eyes just go to them. It\u2019s troubling, but they\u2019re really fascinating, seductive, complex machines. If we put them onstage, you\u2019re just going to be waiting for that thing to discharge, waiting for that sound.Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era?I don\u2019t know if this is still true in the age of Trump, but I would say that pre-election, gun control was the issue about which I felt the greatest despair.These objects are so seductive it\u2019s almost impossible to control ourselves around them. Once you have access to this really powerful machine that gives you the illusion of power, it becomes really difficult to imagine yourself separated from it. You have to acknowledge that clearly there is some emotional connection going on, some deep fears and deep longings and deep love.What inspired your play?When Sandy Hook happened, my daughter had just turned 7. I think it woke me up. I grew up in a political family and my dad was very, very wrapped up in politics, but I had never taken on anything on my own. The only way I know how to write is the smallest, most microcosmic way. I had attempted to write something more overtly political, more of a polemic, and it didn\u2019t feel true to me.Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence?I grew up in Dallas. It wasn\u2019t odd to see gun racks in trucks. I shot rifles at summer camp just like everybody else did. Many of the families in the neighborhood I grew up in had guns. We didn\u2019t think, like, \u201cOh, there are weapons of murder in our homes.\u201d They were kind of casually for protection.When I was in college, my girlfriend and I were like, \u201cWell, what happens at a gun show?\u201d So we went to one. And it was kind of spectacular. First of all, there was a bar. And there were guns for ladies, which was the craziest thing to me \u2014 little, pretty guns specifically for ladies. And the ladies were lined up.How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage? Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era? I think it has to do with personal culpability as a member of society. In light of the election, whatever one\u2019s political bent is, we have to take on social responsibility. I don\u2019t think we should carry the bag of guilt in the heaviest way, but we are culpable. You cannot live in a vacuum. So you have to examine what\u2019s important to you and what you can do about it.Advertisement"}

About 400 died.By Tuesday morning, officials had finished removing all the decomposing carcasses they could reach. Overnight, 200 whales had been transported more than a mile to the dunes by two large excavators and two dump trucks, each capable of carrying 15 whales at a time.Other whales in inaccessible areas that the vehicles could not reach were left where they were, Mr. Lamason said. The trucks finished delivering their loads around 3 a.m. Tuesday, he said.Mr. Lamason said that leaving the carcasses in the water would have helped them decompose faster, but that might have posed a danger to people visiting the coast.\u201cThere is nothing attractive about these whales after they have been on the beach for a few days,\u201d he said. \u201cAll their internal organs have exploded.

Dozens of police officers were brought in from U.C. campuses across the state.Numerous crowd-control measures were put in place. But we could not plan for the unexpected. On Wednesday night, the Berkeley campus was invaded by more than 100 armed people in masks and dark uniforms who used paramilitary tactics to engage in violent destructive behavior intended to shut the event down.At that point the University of California Police Department concluded that the speaker had to be evacuated from campus for his own safety, bringing the event to an end.We deeply regret that the violence unleashed by this group undermined the First Amendment rights of the speaker as well as those who came to lawfully assemble and protest his presence.The violence was an attack on the fundamental values of the university, which stands for and helps maintain and nurture open inquiry and an inclusive civil society, the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation. NICHOLAS DIRKSChancellor, U.C. BerkeleyBerkeley, Calif.To the Editor:As a college student in the early 1960s, I watched in 1964 with great admiration Mario Savio and the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. How tragic it was to read that half a century later at that same university, Milo Yiannopoulos, a controversial Breitbart News editor whose views are on the far right of the political spectrum, was denied the right to speak.The Berkeley students, faculty, administration and protesters need to understand that denying Mr. Yiannopoulos the right to speak is antithetical to free speech. Free speech is about allowing all to say what they want regardless of their views. We can question, challenge and even disagree with the speaker. But we should not silence the speaker. In light of the violence, a less drastic alternative would have been to reschedule the speech.Free speech is one of America\u2019s lasting treasures. Any deviation from that practice, especially at our colleges and universities, should be rejected as fundamentally inconsistent with one of America\u2019s basic freedoms.

{"Headline": "Anger and Mistrust Fuel Unabated Protests in Romania", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 Exactly one week after the largest protests in a quarter of a century rocked Romania, an estimated 70,000 demonstrators filled the square outside the main government building in Bucharest on Sunday evening, determined to show those in power that the crisis was far from over.In the face of the large-scale backlash, the emergency ordinance was repealed a week ago, but that has not stopped protesters from demonstrating their anger.Many in the square on Sunday continued to call for the resignation of Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu, as well as the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, among the highest political offices in the country.\u201cWe don\u2019t trust this government. They lied to us. We want this government to resign,\u201d said Maria Stoica, 38, an information-technology business analyst standing in the square. For her, it was the 10th night of protesting.The Romanian government had hoped that it had weathered the worst of the crisis. On Wednesday it easily survived a no-confidence motion brought about by the parliamentary opposition. One day later, the prime minister accepted the resignation of Florin Iordache, the minister of justice and one of the architects of the emergency ordinance that was the catalyst for the protests.However, Mr. Iordache\u2019s resignation appears to have done little to appease those on the street.\u201cThey promised one thing, but did another,\u201d said Vlad Puiu, 41, a retail manager. \u201cWe are here to make sure what happened won\u2019t happen again.\u201dAfter several days where it seemed as if the protests may have been waning, with nightly crowds diminishing to a few thousand in the face of falling temperatures, the turnout on Sunday was a strong signal that the government may have miscalculated.At exactly 9 p.m. local time, tens of thousands of Romanians, using pieces of colored paper and the lights from their cellphones, created a vast Romanian flag across the square. Temperatures hovered around 20 degrees Fahrenheit.According to Florin Badita, 28, an activist who has helped rally people through a Facebook group he created after a deadly nightclub fire in 2015 \u2014 a disaster partly blamed on corruption \u2014 the protests are far from over.\u201cThis won\u2019t be the last night. We haven\u2019t won anything yet. If we don\u2019t go out now we\u2019ll need to in six months, when there\u2019s the next big thing,\u201d he said.Mr. Badita, who took unpaid leave from his job in the northern city of Cluj to participate in the Bucharest protests, said he also believed the momentum would grow.\u201cI think the main thing is that now people know that there are a lot of people wanting change,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want to do is build this in a sustainable way, and also to train citizens in things like the Freedom of Information Act. We can go out all the time to protest, but we need to do more.\u201dOthers also said that they saw the potential for these protests to develop into a more long-term movement.\u201cThe success of these protests, resulting in the withdrawal of the ordinance, has boosted the most active of the protesters in their commitment to a more sustained and permanent kind of organization,\u201d said Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj.\u201cThis involves maybe only a quarter or even a tenth of last Sunday\u2019s demonstrators, but it will be enough to put pressure on the government,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Still, it\u2019s got to be just a little bit embarrassing for Facebook, which has been at the forefront of the social game for so long, to have completely run out of original ideas.As a columnist, I know that feeling well.Anyway, I\u2019m used to social media giants cloning each other\u2019s features, but I don\u2019t think WhatsApp should have gone in this direction.People loved WhatsApp partly because it is a zero-nonsense, intuitive chatting app. So now WhatsApp\u2019s new feature, called Status, basically lets people share images, GIFs or videos before they self-destruct in 24 hours. But do you know anyone who uses WhatsApp and desires features like these?I mostly see people using WhatsApp to keep in touch with others overseas. I\u2019m not sure this will stick with consumers or help Facebook lure people away from Snapchat. All it does is add a layer of complexity to what was otherwise a perfectly solid messaging app that everyone knew how to use.Uber has pledged an investigation on the sexism charges, but it\u2019s not at all clear that will be enough to quell the mounting anger against the company both internally and externally.So, where do you think this goes next?Mike\u2019s reporting on this fiasco was truly stunning, and Uber\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cWe are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone\u201d \u2014 is remarkable in that there is no denial or justification whatsoever of the aggressive, chauvinistic work culture.

{"Headline": "\u2018Look, They Are Dying\u2019: Video Appears to Show Massacre by Congolese Soldiers", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The video opens with a squad of soldiers walking down a sandy, sunlit road toward a group of people who are chanting.They start firing.One by one, the figures in the road drop. Oddly, several of the people do not make any attempt to run from the advancing soldiers.The soldiers then saunter up to the wounded, blasting them in the head with assault rifles from a few feet away. Many of the victims look young; several are women.None carry guns.These images are part of a battlefield video that was shared with The New York Times on Friday and that, thanks to Congolese human rights activists, has begun to make the rounds on Facebook and other social media.Several analysts said that the footage revealed a government-sponsored massacre of civilians and that the video could be used as evidence of war crimes.Human Rights Watch, Western diplomats and United Nations officials said they were investigating the video, which was consistent with United Nations reports this week of Congolese government soldiers ruthlessly crushing a local militia in the Kasa\u00ef-Central Province.\u201cThe video shows shocking footage of killings and executions of civilians by uniformed personnel,\u201d said a statement by the United Nations peacekeeping department. Peacekeeping officials said they were trying to verify the source of the video and whether it was linked to the recent clashes in the Kasa\u00ef area.Congo has a sordid history of government-led atrocities, including gang rapes and the slaughtering of civilians. The country is nearly lawless, and the government forces are known to be brutal, underpaid and among the most dreaded.But it is rare to have such powerful, graphic evidence of the blas\u00e9 taking of human life.\u201cLook, they are dying,\u201d the soldiers said in Lingala, the language of central Congo, as they blasted the civilians. \u201cWatch how they get killed like animals.\u201dHuman rights activists said that the video was filmed by a Congolese government soldier who was part of the execution squad and that the soldier may have felt bad about what happened and leaked it to assuage his conscience. The camera was right behind the soldiers as they raised their rifles.The soldiers did not even take cover when they opened fire. Analysts said it was clear that the soldiers knew that their targets posed no threat. At least 13 bodies could be seen in the video.A rebel army called the M23 is agitating again in the east, along with several dozen other rebel groups.The commodities-based economy continues to nose-dive.Just this week, the government announced that it did not have the money to hold an election in 2017, after the ruling party agreed a few weeks ago to do just that. Under Congo\u2019s Constitution, Mr. Kabila should not even be in office now. His second and final term was over in December. He is deeply unpopular, increasingly isolated and suspected of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through fraudulent mining deals.\u201cNone of these conflicts are directly related to each other, but they are proliferating around the country because the government is weak and contested,\u201d said Jason Stearns, the director of the Congo Research Group, a research project based at New York University.\u201cThe government is also paranoid, which is why it feels it needs to take a hard line toward any movements,\u201d he added.The video appears to have been filmed within the past 10 days, analysts said, during the government\u2019s military operations to quash the Kamuina Nsapu militia. The militia is an offshoot of a local movement in Kasa\u00ef whose followers have challenged the government over local autonomy. Some of the group\u2019s followers believe in traditional magic.It seems the video was filmed as the government soldiers were approaching about a dozen Kamuina Nsapu followers who were standing together in a rural road, chanting.\u201cThey are not scared to die, so we will show them,\u201d one of the soldiers says.Several of the victims were wearing garlands of leaves. Analysts said they might have believed the leaves \u2014 or the chanting \u2014 would protect them from bullets. That may be one reason the people did not run or dive into the bushes when the first gunshots rang out.\u201cWe are deeply concerned at the reported high number of deaths, which if confirmed would suggest excessive and disproportionate use of force by the soldiers,\u201d the statement said.Lambert Mende, Congo\u2019s information minister, said the video was not filmed in Congo, but possibly another African country, and that it was an attempt by nongovernmental organizations \u201cto destroy the image of the D.R.C.\u201dSteve Wembi contributed reporting from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.Advertisement"}

Hundreds of thousands of workers from the delta and other regions have emigrated to Japan, Malaysia, South Korean and Taiwan in recent years.Malaysia hosted nearly 2.5 million international migrants in 2013, according to the United Nations data, making it the largest destination for migrant workers after Thailand in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a group of 10 countries with a combined population of more than 600 million.Many migrants, including tens of thousands of Vietnamese, travel to Malaysia through formal labor contracts that are governed by state quotas and arranged through accredited labor brokerages.But that process can be corrupt, exploitative and expensive, requiring workers to pay thousands of dollars to brokers, experts say. One result is that some immigrants leave their jobs to work in the shadow economy, or bypass formal contracts altogether.Because Vietnamese are permitted to travel without visas in Singapore and Malaysia for 30 days at a time, many Vietnamese escorts and prostitutes travel in a constant loop through the three countries, said Nicolas Lainez, an anthropologist in Singapore with the Paris-based School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences.The lifestyle appeals to them, Mr. Lainez said, because the working schedules offer flexibility as well as a higher income \u2014 from about $700 to $7,000 per month, compared with just a few hundred dollars for a job on a factory assembly line.Ms. Huong\u2019s Facebook photographs and the attached location information indicated that she had visited Malaysia twice this year \u2014 first in early January and again in early February, days before Kim Jong-nam was killed.Her Facebook page, which appears to have been shut down, had shown no sign of Nghia Binh, her hometown. But her father, Doan Van Thanh, said that she visited the village during the Tet holiday that began in late January.Mr. Thanh said that when Ms. Huong arrived, she was short of money and came bearing only one gift: a bonsai plant worth 100,000 Vietnamese dong, or about $5. She also asked her stepmother, Mr. Thanh\u2019s wife, for a loan of 50,000 dong. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me anything about going abroad,\u201d he said.Her brother, Mr. Binh, said that he was still struggling to digest the news that Ms. Huong, who had never been a quarrelsome sibling, was now a murder suspect.\u201cShe loves everyone,\u201d he said, \u201cand everyone loves her.\u201dChau Doan reported from Nghia Binh, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

They are both billionaires. But that may be one of the few characteristics they share.Billionaires may have enormous spending potential, but they certainly exercise that power differently. Some live lavishly and enjoy being in the headlines, while others live frugally, if not anonymously. There are big spenders and those who give it away.His fellow billionaire Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, bought 74-acre Necker Island in the Caribbean in 1979. It operates as a private luxury resort, with room for 34 adults and six children at about $2,300 each per night. He also bought nearby Mosquito Island in 2007, the site of former President Barack Obama\u2019s recent vacation. Mr. Branson is a serial blogger and Twitter user, sending out inspirational messages about entrepreneurship, conservation, music and travel.Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, is unmistakable on the high seas in his $250 million superyacht, Octopus, which has two helicopter pads, a submarine, a glass-bottom swimming pool and a recording studio, not to mention room for 26 guests. Recently, he has been known to host a celebrity-studded party on Octopus during the Cannes Film Festival. But he has a serious side, too. Mr. Allen last year gave $295 million to brain and cell science, wildlife conservation, global health and climate change.But not all billionaires like to be so obvious. Chuck Feeney, who built an empire of duty-free shops and a multibillion-dollar fortune along the way, has worked since the 1980s to give all that money away, as quietly as possible.Forbes magazine once called him the \u201cJames Bond of philanthropy\u201d for his work through his charity, the Atlantic Philanthropies. The foundation has given away $8 billion to education, science, health care and human rights projects around the world and made its final grant last year. It plans to close for good in 2020.The fact is, most \u201cordinary\u201d billionaires live quietly. \u201cUnlike what the public thinks, the majority of these people come out of the middle class or even poverty,\u201d said Jim Grubman, a clinical psychologist who wrote \u201cStrangers in Paradise,\u201d a book about how people adjust to becoming wealthy.\u201cThe billionaire lifestyle makes for good TV, but below the surface is a much bigger portion of people who are salt-of-the-earth families just concentrating on raising their kids and running their businesses,\u201d said Mr. Grubman, who is a consultant at Cambridge Family Enterprise Group, an adviser to wealthy families.Asia is an active area of billionaire creation, with one person reaching that threshold every three days, according to a study released in October by UBS and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.Asia\u2019s two richest men are Jack Ma, founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, with a $26 billion net worth, and Wang Jianlin, a real estate mogul with $29 billion to his name who also holds stakes in a Spanish soccer club and the Hollywood film production company Legendary Entertainment.In 2015, The Economist reported on the party Mr. Wang held to celebrate his deal to buy Infront Sports & Media, which has marketing rights to World Cup soccer. The magazine said that Mr. Wang favored \u201cprivate jets and flashy yachts (he owns Sunseeker, the British maker of the sleek craft seen in James Bond films),\u201d and that the party featured strobe lights, disco music and leggy beauties.In the winter, many flock to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland; the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah; and New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations on St. Barts, where people can rent their own eight-bedroom beachfront villa for $420,000 a week.In the summer, some of the richest flock to Britain for the Henley Royal Regatta, the Royal Ascot horse races, and Wimbledon, where a center-court season ticket at the men\u2019s championship final this year has a market value of $3,300.So far, 156 billionaires and their families have committed to the cause, according to the profiles listed on the pledge\u2019s website. The group also includes the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, his wife, Priscilla Chan, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk and the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.Advertisement"}

The Kremlin\u2019s interest in the outcome is evident \u2014 all the more so given upcoming elections this year in the Netherlands and Germany, where right-wing populist parties are also on the rise.On Wednesday, France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, came out swinging.

{"Headline": "How an Interoffice Spat Erupted Into a Climate-Change Furor", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few weeks ago, on an obscure climate-change blog, a retired government scientist named John Bates blasted his former boss on an esoteric point having to do with archiving temperature data.It was little more than lingering workplace bad blood, said Dr. Bates\u2019s former co-workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Dr. Bates had felt he deserved his boss\u2019s job at NOAA, they said, not the demotion he received.\u201cHe\u2019s retaliating. It\u2019s like grade school,\u201d said Glenn Rutledge, a former physical scientist at NOAA who worked with Dr. Bates.But in what seems like a remarkable example of office politics gone horribly wrong, within days the accusations were amplified and sensationalized \u2014 in the pages of the British tabloid The Mail on Sunday \u2014 inciting a global furor among climate-change deniers.NOAA itself is now bringing in independent investigators to review Dr. Bates\u2019s claims. \u201cNOAA takes seriously any accusations that its policies and procedures have not been followed,\u201d a spokesman, Scott Smullen, said in a statement.Dr. Bates did not respond to repeated requests for comment nor to detailed questions about the incident and his former co-workers\u2019 characterizations.Interviews with six of his former colleagues at NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, including two former bosses, painted a picture of a room filled with brilliant scientists, and \u2014 like many workplaces \u2014 its fair share of mundane professional spats and jealousies.Dr. Bates was demoted from a managerial role in 2012 under Thomas Karl \u2014 the lead author of the study Dr. Bates has questioned \u2014 after complaints over Dr. Bates\u2019s professional conduct, according to the former colleagues and supervisors. He also became frustrated that his efforts to enforce strict procedures in the archiving of climate data were not getting as much attention as he had hoped.\u201cHe was often heard saying that he, not Karl, should be running the center,\u201d said Marjorie McGuirk, former chief of staff at the data center.At the heart of the furor is a study led by Dr. Karl, the former director of NOAA\u2019s data center. The NOAA center handles the nation\u2019s trove of climate and weather data. Dr. Karl\u2019s study had refuted earlier work suggesting that global warming had slowed earlier in this century.According to the article in The Mail, Dr. Bates claimed that the study relied on problematic data. The researchers threw out good data on sea temperatures recorded on buoys, and \u201ccorrected\u201d it with what he said was bad data from ships, Dr. Bates said, according to The Mail.David Rose, the author of The Mail on Sunday article, said in a Twitter correspondence that he stood by his reporting.Breitbart and Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cI think there\u2019s already been enormous damage,\u201d said Bob Ward, a researcher at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is to slow the pace of action on climate change.\u201dThe paper\u2019s authors disputed that strict archiving of the calculations was necessary, because all of the original data used in the report was properly archived. And the data was subsequently made available to other researchers, said Tom Peterson, a research meteorologist who is a co-author of the study with Dr. Karl.Former colleagues said that, in aiming at his former boss, Dr. Bates was motivated by more than scientific zeal.Ms. McGuirk said that one of her responsibilities had been to manage what she described as frequent complaints about Dr. Bates\u2019s behavior in the workplace. Those complaints led to his demotion in 2012 from his post as head of the data center\u2019s satellite and remote sensing division, where he supervised a dozen or so employees, to a position as principal scientist, which involved no managerial duties, she said.\u201cThis episode is consistent with his history of outbursts,\u201d she said.Ms. McGuirk said that she herself had filed a complaint against Dr. Bates, based on his conduct at a staff meeting in 2009. At that meeting, Dr. Bates shouted that Ms. McGuirk was not trustworthy and belonged in jail, according to an internal log detailing complaints against the scientist that was viewed by The New York Times.Dr. Karl, the lead author of the report that Dr. Bates criticized, said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by Dr. Bates\u2019s accusations. \u201cBut the science has been validated and verified. I leave it to others to figure out what motivated him,\u201d he said in an interview.Dr. Peterson said that he had last seen Dr. Bates on Saturday \u2014 the day before The Mail article appeared \u2014 at a play in Asheville, N.C., where the NOAA center is headquartered, and where many of these scientists still live. \u201cI asked him how retirement was going,\u201d Dr. Peterson said.\u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s going to get interesting,\u2019\u201d Dr. Peterson said. And when he asked Dr. Bates what he meant, \u201cHe smiled and gave me a thumbs up,\u201d Dr. Peterson said.Then the two men turned to the evening\u2019s play, Dr. Peterson said.

{"Headline": "Verizon Will Pay $350 Million Less for Yahoo", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Verizon store in Chicago. Verizon will pay $4.48 billion for Yahoo, about $350 million less than it initially offered after security breaches that were disclosed last year.The revised agreement, now valued at $4.48 billion, paves the way for the deal to proceed to a shareholder vote as early as April, although securities regulators are still assessing how Yahoo disclosed information about the breaches to investors. Yahoo, which is winding down its own investigation of the breaches, will share more details about the incidents and their impact in the next few weeks when it makes required regulatory filings.Consummation of the sale to Verizon would bring closure to a negotiation that has stretched on for nearly three years as Yahoo\u2019s board and its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, considered various plans to separate the company\u2019s fading internet businesses from its much more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group.Verizon and Yahoo, whose internet advertising businesses are tiny compared with juggernauts like Google and Facebook, are eager to move forward on integrating their internet operations.\u201cWe have always believed this acquisition makes strategic sense,\u201d Marni M. Walden, the Verizon executive vice president who oversees product innovation and new businesses, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to moving ahead expeditiously so that we can quickly welcome Yahoo\u2019s tremendous talent and assets into our expanding portfolio in the digital advertising space.\u201dVerizon intends to keep the Yahoo brand separate from AOL, another internet pioneer that it acquired in 2015. But executives hope to use digital advertising technology and a unified sales force to court advertisers who want to reach the companies\u2019 combined audience of well over one billion active internet users.Yahoo still attracts large audiences to its sports, news and financial sites, and its email service retains a loyal audience. Although Yahoo and AOL do not carry the clout they had during the early days of the web, marketers do want to preserve alternatives to Google and Facebook, which increasingly dominate digital advertising.It\u2019s unclear whether Ms. Mayer, a former Google executive who was hired as Yahoo\u2019s chief in 2012, will remain with Verizon after the deal closes. Ms. Mayer failed to turn around Yahoo\u2019s struggling internet businesses and was forced to write off much of the value of Tumblr, her biggest acquisition.After the sale, Yahoo\u2019s Asian investments will remain in a stub company, called Altaba, which will study how to extract the maximum value from them. The Alibaba stake has a face value of about $39 billion and the Yahoo Japan stake is worth about $9 billion, but any transactions to dispose of the shares are likely to incur multibillion-dollar tax bills.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Global Expansion, Netflix Makes Friends With Carriers", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs he sat in his office in central Paris, Christian Bombrun, an executive at Orange, the French cellphone and cable operator, got an unexpected call. It was Netflix, the American streaming giant, proposing a deal.Netflix was looking to offer its stable of movies and television programming to the 10 million Orange customers across France. What followed were six months of often tense negotiations, as both companies wrestled over the details.\u201cThere were some difficult discussions,\u201d said Mr. Bombrun, director of entertainment and digital services for Orange in France. At certain points, both sides thought the talks would fail. But in the end, he said, \u201cwe got a deal done.\u201dThe company\u2019s partnerships with cable and cellphone operators worldwide give it almost instantaneous access to potential new users without having to spend a fortune on advertising and distribution deals in markets where its brand and content are often still relatively unknown.This growing symbiotic relationship will take center stage on Monday when Reed Hastings, the company\u2019s chief executive, gives the keynote address on the first day of the Mobile World Congress. The conference is an annual trade show in Barcelona, Spain, where executives from across the telecom, media and technology worlds gather to meet and, potentially, sign new deals.Mr. Hastings\u2019s headline act \u2014 part sales pitch, part industry update \u2014 comes as Netflix\u2019s attention has increasingly turned to its overseas subscribers.The Orange deal, one of Netflix\u2019s first international partnerships, is a case in point.But the talks were not all smooth sailing.Along with the typical back-and-forth about how much revenue each side would receive from the deal, Orange was concerned that Netflix, whose European headquarters are in Amsterdam, had not signed on to French rules requiring online video distributors to fund local-language content.St\u00e9phane Richard, the company\u2019s chief executive, also had said he would not work with Netflix, fearful that Orange would become a \u201cTrojan horse,\u201d potentially helping the streaming service gain a global following, only to then cast Orange aside.But for cable and cellphone companies from Bulgaria to Bolivia, the calculation is simple. Though many of them initially resisted such deals with online content providers, gaining access to Netflix\u2019s exclusive programming helps set them apart from local rivals, just as customers\u2019 online habits have shifted toward video, particularly on their smartphones and other mobile devices.\u201cNetflix wants to be exposed to as many people as it can,\u201d said Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders Analysis, a media and telecom industry research company in London. \u201cTelecom operators want to keep people inside their walls, so they are willing to let Netflix in.\u201dNetflix\u2019s American revenue, $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, still constitutes a majority of its sales. But after a somewhat stuttering start to its global expansion, its international revenue is quickly catching up, hitting almost a billion dollars in the three months through December.Even Netflix\u2019s senior executives equate much of that growth to the company\u2019s strengthened ties with cable and cellphone operators around the globe.Such bonhomie between Netflix and carriers is a relatively recent phenomenon, and there are still teething pains whenever the company wades into international markets.Overseas, Sky, the British content and cable provider, has refused to include Netflix on its own set-top box, primarily because it views the streaming service as a direct competitor to its own original programming.Analysts say many operators, even those that have signed partnership deals, still fret that Netflix \u2014 alongside other American tech giants like Google and Facebook \u2014 will benefit more from these relationships than they will. Avid television watchers, for instance, have invested emotional capital into popular Netflix shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cNarcos,\u201d and often view their cable provider as a mere conduit to watching such digital content.\u201cNetflix\u2019s exclusive shows are dominating people\u2019s water cooler moments,\u201d said Tony Gunnarsson, a senior analyst at Ovum, a technology research firm, in London. \u201cConsumers are already watching Netflix, so it\u2019s better for operators to add Netflix to their services or people will go elsewhere.\u201dFor Bob Greene, managing director of online entertainment at Liberty Global, a cable giant controlled by the billionaire John C. Malone, his relationship with Netflix is rooted in the new realities of how people watch content online.At first, Mr. Greene said, Liberty Global limited the partnership to Britain, including the Netflix app on its cable service but keeping billing separate. (It takes an undisclosed of percentage of revenue from its subscribers signing up to Netflix.)Yet as Liberty Global crunched the numbers, it realized that its British customers who watched Netflix were less likely to jump to rival products and showed more loyalty to its own services.\u201cIf our customers want Netflix and we don\u2019t offer it, they\u2019ll find another way to get it,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cWe\u2019re better off if they don\u2019t have to go elsewhere to find what they want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Opposition to Trump Propelled by Employees, Not Executives", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late September, a group of tech leaders started a well-publicized effort to raise $100,000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324.For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent.No longer.Nearly 100 technology companies said that President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries would violate both immigration law and the United States Constitution.\u201cSilicon Valley is stepping up,\u201d said Sam Altman, who runs the valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, Y Combinator. \u201cThe companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don\u2019t support.\u201dIt is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable \u2014 not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.\u201cPeople voted with their feet, and Travis listened,\u201d said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. \u201cWe need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.\u201dResistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a voice with the president if you didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.\u201dWhen President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, he upended the fates of people who had waited for years to get into the U.S. Here are portraits of those affected by the ban.Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,\u201d said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey all have the same leanings.\u201dMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google\u2019s former slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is the most forceful expression of this.\u201cIf you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,\u201d Mr. Shotts said.Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order \u201cmisguided and a fundamental step backwards,\u201d and saying it would create \u201cmuch collateral damage to the country\u2019s reputation and values.\u201dThe immigration battle is in Microsoft\u2019s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\u201cIn 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,\u201d said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. \u201cThe most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.\u201dMr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous \u201cfor the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren\u2019t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can\u2019t fix the monetization of fake news.\u201dPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.\u201cI\u2019ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,\u201d said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.He talked about Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which asks women, \u201cWhat would you do if you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201d Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women\u2019s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.\u201cWe have to protest in public,\u201d he said. The event raised $30,000 for the legal aid groups.\u201cIt looked like two-thirds of the room were newcomers,\u201d Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement.\u201cI want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re pushing at least as hard as Trump is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Chief Taps Into the \u2018Right Now\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were undergraduates at Stanford University, they made an unconventional observation about what makes a social network valuable.Thanks to the rise of Facebook, most everyone believed that networks became exponentially more valuable by amassing more users. But Mr. Spiegel noticed that in real life, even people with thousands of acquaintances spent most of their time with just a few friends whose value outweighed a large number of looser ties.While online identity previously emphasized everything anyone has ever done, with Snapchat \u201cmy identity is who I am right now,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said in a 2015 video to describe the app.Along with financial information, Mr. Spiegel is expected to include remarks about Snap\u2019s mission that will showcase his zag-while-zigging philosophy.\u201cIf you want to understand Snap, look at Evan Spiegel,\u201d said Todd Chaffee, a partner at IVP, one of Snap\u2019s three largest venture capital investors. \u201cHe is the visionary who drives that company.\u201dMary Ritti, a spokeswoman for Snap, declined to comment for this story.Mr. Spiegel grew up in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy Los Angeles suburb, and attended Crossroads, a prep school in Santa Monica that counts Jonah Hill, Kate Hudson and Jack Black as alumni.He lived a privileged life, with expensive cars, exclusive club memberships and fancy vacations, according to records from his parents\u2019 divorce proceedings. His father, John Spiegel, a securities lawyer who helped overhaul the Los Angeles Police Department after the Rodney King beating in 1991, also had his children volunteer and build homes in poor areas of Mexico.While many techies talk about how the industry is a meritocracy, Mr. Spiegel has not shied from his wealthy roots. In public comments, he has said he is \u201ca young, white, educated male who got really, really lucky. And life isn\u2019t fair.\u201dAt Stanford, also his father\u2019s alma mater, Mr. Spiegel majored in product design and started a handful of companies with Mr. Murphy, a fellow Kappa Sigma fraternity brother. (Their early start-ups flopped.) There, Mr. Spiegel also met some of the men who would become his mentors, including Scott Cook, then the chief executive of Intuit, and Eric Schmidt, the Google chairman, who taught an M.B.A. class that he attended.Mr. Spiegel \u201creally is the next Gates or Zuckerberg,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said in an interview, comparing the Snap chief to Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, Bill Gates, and Facebook\u2019s chief, Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cHe has superb manners, which he says he got from his mother. He credits his father\u2019s long legal calls, which he overheard, to giving him perspective on business and structure as a very young man.\u201dWhen Snapchat started taking off, Mr. Spiegel did not wait to graduate from Stanford. He moved the company to the Venice Beach boardwalk, away from what he perceived as Silicon Valley\u2019s too-narrow focus on technology.When Mr. Spiegel met Institutional Venture Partners to discuss possible fund-raising, for example, he told IVP\u2019s partner, Dennis Phelps, that he was unwilling to accept the firm\u2019s standard investment terms.\u201cHe\u2019s different from most tech people because he knows what\u2019s cool and what\u2019s next,\u201d said Ryan Wilson, an artist in Los Angeles who goes by the name ThankYouX. He worked with Mr. Spiegel on a piece of art for one of Snapchat\u2019s offices. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like things because a dealer says he should. He just likes what he likes, whether it\u2019s made by a high school friend or a famous artist.\u201dMr. Spiegel has also involved himself in some political conversations. In 2015, he met with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, as a member of the 21st Century Council at the Berggruen Institute. Its founder, Nicolas Berggruen, said he impressed a group that includes Mohamed El-Erian, the economist, and former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with his \u201cthoughtful and mature approach to people.\u201d Last fall, Mr. Spiegel also attended a private dinner with John O. Brennan, then the director of the C.I.A. According to multiple attendees, Mr. Spiegel listened more than he spoke and had the ear of Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles.Mr. Spiegel\u2019s unconventional streak may be most evident in how he has steered Snap. He has long said that a public offering was what was best for the company and its investors, even as other tech start-ups chose to stay private as long as possible.Since Snapchat\u2019s debut, the app and the company have also undergone dozens of changes that were criticized for being too different from other consumer internet companies.Mr. Spiegel rejected the idea of a newsfeed in Snapchat\u2019s app, for example, because he said people prefer stories chronologically. In Facebook\u2019s News Feed, posts are reverse chronological, meaning the newest posts are at the top.Unlike other social networks, Snapchat also does not use algorithms to push people to see certain content. Snapchat users swipe their screens to navigate and view video vertically, rather than tap on menus or turn their phones to watch videos horizontally.\u201cFrom what I can figure out, he thinks differently about the way to monetize and develop a social network,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said of Mr. Spiegel.Investors who buy into Snap\u2019s initial public offering will soon be getting a piece of that approach.Allowing \u201courselves to be pulled in another direction\u201d is what makes us human, Mr. Spiegel said in a commencement speech at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business in 2015. Quoting John F. Kennedy, he added, \u201cConformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

From past experience I know that they have most likely been picked up by one of the secret agencies. I also know that when they return they\u2019ll be changed people.When they disappear, they are opinionated and noisy; they believe their 800-word op-ed or their Facebook post or the poem that went viral will change the world. When they return, they have become the sort of people who will say, it was nice knowing you, why don\u2019t you shut up and go away?It\u2019s as if they weren\u2019t abducted by the state and kept in a dungeon or a safe house, probably interrogated, in some cases tortured, and always threatened. It\u2019s like they went to some rehab program from which they have come back fully reformed and compliant.Pakistan\u2019s interior minister went on record to discourage such accusations against the five missing activists. But these charges have built-in momentum. Once accused of blasphemy you can\u2019t really ward that off: How do you defend yourself against a charge that can\u2019t be repeated in public? What exactly is it that you didn\u2019t do?Imagine getting released after a few weeks in a dungeon and re-entering the world only to see people on national television demanding your head and religious parties on street corners waiting to lynch you. First, you were disappeared by the state; then when you are released, you feel forced to disappear from public life.It\u2019s not just that the state is stifling dissent; it\u2019s also making everyone wonder: Have I crossed the line? Where was that line? How come that other person crossed every line of decency and still has a TV show?And it\u2019s not only the state and its intelligence agencies waging war on common sense; the media and other civil institutions are as well.Never mind that when one journalist accuses another of blasphemy, he only exposes himself more to being targeted for the same thing.A journalist friend recently told me about being picked up and taken to a safe house for a so-called debrief about his work. Three good, patriotic men from an intelligence agency told him they knew everything about his children\u2019s school, his wife\u2019s job, his father\u2019s career. He was told that there were two kinds of troublemakers in this country: foreign agents and fools.\u201cWe have seen your bank accounts and you are nobody\u2019s agent. You appear to be a mere fool,\u201d they told him. The message was clear: Stop being a fool. We know which school your kids go to.I submitted an Urdu translation of one of my novels to a leading publisher a while ago. Through a mutual friend I was asked to change a few things, just to be on the safe side. Nothing was specified. I respectfully inquired what bits I should change. You are intelligent enough, I was told; you live here, you should know.That\u2019s the scary part, I don\u2019t really know if I am intelligent or a fool.Mohammed Hanif is the author of the novels \u201cA Case of Exploding Mangoes\u201d and \u201cOur Lady of Alice Bhatti,\u201d and the librettist for the opera \u201cBhutto.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap as a Camera Company? I.P.O Raises Comparisons to GoPro", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsSnap Inc., the purveyor of disappearing messages, has some big things going for it that GoPro didn\u2019t have. Social media networks have a tendency to be winner-take-all propositions, and Snapchat is one of the winners. It is growing, too: Revenue, at just over $400 million in 2016, was nearly seven times what it was in 2015.That kind of statistic helps justify huge technology sector valuations. There\u2019s plenty of room for growth in revenue per user, if Snap gets it right. At just over $1 per user per quarter right now, it\u2019s in the same ballpark as Facebook when it went public in 2012. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $385 billion giant, has pushed that up to nearly $5 in the most recent quarter.That said, Snapchat\u2019s growth in average daily users is slowing, with only a 3 percent increase, to 158 million globally, from the third to the fourth quarter of last year. And unlike the profitable but admittedly slower-growing GoPro at its 2014 I.P.O., Snap\u2019s cash is disappearing faster than its messages. Nearly $1 billion evaporated in the last two years.Investor concern could be amplified by Snap\u2019s insistence that it is a camera company. Executives like its co-founders, Evan Spiegel, 26, and Robert Murphy, may not really think that, but it still jars that they say so.Having no say at all when executives may be living in a bubble is a significant investment risk. Allowing founders control disproportionate to their economic interest paid off at Facebook but not at the struggling GoPro, where the shares are trading at less than half the I.P.O. price. Smart investors might consider taking Snap at its word and valuing it a bit more like an actual camera company than they otherwise would.Advertisement"}

But a few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and saw a new shot of my mom, grim of face and wet of hair, wrapped in a silvery warming blanket, in front of a row full of gym lockers. \u201cHad to take refuge outside from pool during call-in threat that caused J.C.C. evacuation,\u201d she\u2019d written. \u201cPool and nursery school evacuated.\u201dI went to my Facebook page to share Fran\u2019s post and asked if anyone had more information.People did, but not just from Connecticut, where my mom was swimming at the Jewish community center in West Hartford.\u201cSecond time in two weeks down here at the J.C.C. in Delaware. My kids go to the preschool and have been evacuated both times,\u201d one friend wrote. Another said: \u201cI just got an alert that the J.C.C. in Marin, Calif., was evacuated due to a threat. The hate seems to be spreading like wildfire.\u201d And another: \u201cAt 11:45 they evacuated our J.C.C. in West Bloomfield, Mich. I live directly across the street, and all seems quiet there.\u201dOn the day my mom was forced to get out of the pool, Jan. 18, 26 J.C.C.s in 17 states were the targets of bomb threats. Even if my mom hadn\u2019t posted her wet-faced selfie, it would have felt personal.I\u2019ve probably spent an entire year of my life in the J.C.C. in West Hartford. When I was 3 years old, I went to preschool there. When I was 15, I spent six weeks in Israel on a trip run by the J. When my first book was published, one of the first places to invite me to speak was my Jewish community center. I\u2019ve now spoken in J.C.C.s from San Diego and San Francisco to St. Louis to Atlanta. My nanna spent the last months of her life in the Meer Apartments, on the campus of the J.C.C. in West Bloomfield. Every time I visit my mom, we drive to West Hartford to work out and swim.If synagogue is where Jews feel the most Jewish \u2014 praying in a foreign language, celebrating holidays that aren\u2019t always on the office calendar \u2014 the J.C.C. is where many of the nation\u2019s estimated 5.3 million Jews feel the most Jewish American. It\u2019s the place they go to do all kinds of nonreligious stuff.It\u2019s where parents drop kids off at preschool, or pick them up from summer camp. It\u2019s where moms take yoga or Pilates, or dads relive their glory days on the basketball courts, or retirees attend lectures or cooking classes or have high-school students tell them how to work iPads.Newspapers published articles on the recent incidents. Jewish leaders requested that the president condemn the threats. Reporters asked about his silence. Still, it wasn\u2019t until Tuesday that President Trump spoke directly about the bomb scares.\u201cThe anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible, and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,\u201d he told reporters at the National Museum of African American History and Culture.What took him so long? If Mr. Trump finds the time to go after department stores and television networks and Mark Cuban and Meryl Streep, why was he so reluctant to offer the kind of boilerplate reassurance that would have slipped effortlessly from the lips of any politician on either side of the aisle?Around the time Jewish community centers were being threatened, when parents were receiving terrifying come-get-your-kid phone calls, when water aerobic class participants were sent outside to huddle in the cold, our president was twisting himself into rhetorical pretzels to avoid a simple condemnation. He was shouting down reporters, reframing the issue, celebrating himself as \u201cthe least anti-Semitic person you\u2019ve ever seen in your entire life,\u201d offering variations on the theme of \u201csome of my best friends are Jewish,\u201d and reminding us all of his Electoral College victory.Of course, full-throated rejections tend to stick in Mr. Trump\u2019s craw. Think back to the campaign, and his response to David Duke\u2019s endorsement, which included a sullen \u201cO.K., all right, I disavow, O.K.?\u201d that made him sound more like a teenager promising to stay out of the liquor cabinet than a presidential contender telling the one-time Grand Wizard of the K.K.K. to take his support and shove it.Recall the time his administration\u2019s Holocaust Day Remembrance statement failed to mention the six million Jews who perished. When Jewish groups found fault, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, blasted the press as \u201cnit-picking.\u201dMaybe Mr. Trump\u2019s foot-dragging is the behavior of a man who\u2019s so thin-skinned that any criticism must be answered with an attack.Maybe he\u2019s recoiled instinctively because part of the J.C.C.s\u2019 original mission was to help Jewish immigrants assimilate.Or maybe it\u2019s a case of dancing with them that brung you, of giving a permissive wink to the alt-righties and the nationalists who were some of the first passengers on the Trump Train.The president\u2019s silence, and his day-late and dollar-short declaration, made their own statement. They said that American Jews did not deserve his reassurance, that the threats against places where we lift weights and send our kids to finger-paint weren\u2019t important enough to require his swift condemnation, like Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s poor ratings, or that time the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d addressed Mike Pence during a curtain call.During his Inaugural Address, Mr. Trump said that \u201cwhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\u201d If he believes the words he reads off a teleprompter as much as the ones he says off the cuff, he cannot let bomb threats become business as usual.The J.C.C.s are true community centers where all are welcomed, microcosms of the America that the president claims to want. They are worth protecting.Jennifer Weiner is the author, most recently, of the memoir \u201cHungry Heart\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tattoo Ink: How It Got Under New York\u2019s Skin", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewTattooing is a global phenomenon, and an old one. It\u2019s found on pre-Dynastic Egyptian mummies and on living bodies in Africa, Asia and the Americas throughout the centuries. Europeans caught on to it, in a big way, during the Age of Exploration. (The word \u201ctattoo\u201d has origins in Polynesia; Capt. James Cook is often credited with introducing it to the West.)What\u2019s the longtime allure of a cosmetic modification that, even after the invention of modern tools, can hurt like hell to acquire? In some cultures, tattoos are considered healing or protective. In others, they\u2019re marks of social affiliation, certificates of adulthood. Like Facebook pages, they can be public statements of personal interests, political or amorous. They can function as professional calling cards \u2014 sample displays \u2014 for tattooists promoting their skills.In the exhibition, they\u2019re very much about the art of self-presentation, an aesthetic that can enhance certain physical features, and disguise others. At its most extreme, in examples of unhideable, full-body, multi-image ink jobs, tattooing is a grand existential gesture, one that says, loud and clear: I\u2019m here.The show, organized by Cristian Petru Panaite, an assistant curator at the New-York Historical Society, begins with evidence, which is scant and secondhand, of tattooing among Native Americans in 18th-century New York State. The clearest images are in a set of 1710 mezzotints, \u201cThe Four Indian Kings,\u201d by the British printmaker John Simon. The set depicts a delegation of tribal leaders, three Mohawk, one Mohican, shipped by the British military to London to request more troops to fight the French in North America.If the web of interests they represented was a tangled one, nobody cared. Queen Anne fussed over the exotic visitors. Londoners gave them the equivalent of ticker-tape parades.From that point the story moves forward, at first somewhat confusingly, into the 19th century, when tattooing was largely associated with life at sea. In a label we\u2019re told that Rowland Hussey Macy Sr. (1822-1877), the founder of Macy\u2019s department store, was tattooed with a red star when he worked, as a youth, aboard a Nantucket whaler. And \u2014 this says something about the jumpy organization of the show\u2019s first section \u2014 we learn from the same label that Dorothy Parker, the renowned Gotham wit, acquired a very similar tattoo in the 1930s, presumably under nonmarine circumstances, and under more humane conditions, as old-style poke-and-scratch methods had been softened by machines.By then tattooing had become a complex art form, and a thriving business. Ink and watercolor designs, known as flash, grew ever more wide-ranging, running from standard stars-and-stripes motifs to soft-core pornography to elevated symbolic fare (Rock of Ages; Helios, the Greek sun god), with degrees of fanciness determining price.At the same time, tattoos could have purely practical uses. When Social Security numbers were first issued in the 1930s, people who had difficulty remembering them had their numbers inked onto their skin, like permanent Post-it notes. (A tattooist known as Apache Harry made numbers his specialty.) And in the 19th century, during the Civil War, a New Yorker named Martin Hildebrandt tattooed thousands of soldiers with just their names, so that, should they die in battle, as many would, their bodies could be identified.Hildebrandt was the first in a long line of revered Gotham tattoo artists, which includes Samuel O\u2019Reilly, Ed Smith, Charlie Wagner (the \u201cMichelangelo of Tattooing\u201d), Jack Redcloud, Bill Jones, Frederico Gregio (self-styled as both Brooklyn Blackie and the Electric Rembrandt) and Jack Dracula (born Jack Baker), whose ambition was to be \u201cthe world\u2019s youngest most tattooed man.\u201d Whether he achieved his goal I don\u2019t know, but Diane Arbus photographed him, and that\u2019s fame enough.Hildebrandt came to a sad end; he died in a New York insane asylum in 1890. But in earlier days his shop did well, and he had a notable asset in the presence of a young woman who used the name Nora Hildebrandt. The personal nature of their relationship is a mystery, but their professional alliance is clear: He tattooed her multiple times, and he was not the only artist who did. By the 1890s, she was adorned with more than 300 designs and had become an attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus.Like many self-inventing New Yorkers, she provided herself with a colorful past: She said she\u2019d been forcibly inked by Indians when captured as a girl. Variations on this story served other tattooed women of the era well, at least three of whom \u2014 Trixie Richardson, Ethel Martin Vangi and the lavishly self-ornamented ex-burlesque star Mildred Hull \u2014 worked \u201cboth sides of the needle,\u201d as one of the exhibition\u2019s witty label puts it, by becoming tattooists themselves.The show\u2019s more coherent second half gives a fascinating account of these women, who form a kind of tattoo royalty. One, Betty Broadbent, actually came close to earning a crown. While appearing in New York\u2019s 1939 World\u2019s Fair, she also took part in a beauty pageant, the first ever broadcast on television. Although she didn\u2019t end up as queen, her tattoos, which included a Madonna and Child on her back and portraits of Charles Lindbergh and Pancho Villa on either leg, were noticed.But despite such brushes with mainstream fame, tattooing was in trouble. Most New York storefront establishments were on the Bowery, which had long since became a skid row, with a reputation for crime. In 1961, in what was rumored to be an effort to clean up the city before the 1964 World\u2019s Fair, the Health Department claimed that tattooing was responsible for a hepatitis outbreak and made it illegal.That drove the trade underground, where it continued to flourish, often by night, in basements and apartments. A new generation of artists emerged, among them Thom DeVita, Ed Hardy and Tony Polito. Another of the group, Tony D\u2019Annessa, drew his ink-and-marker designs on a vinyl window shade \u2014 it\u2019s in the show \u2014 which could be quickly rolled up in the event of a police raid.As the 1960s proceeded, tattooing gained fresh cachet precisely because of its anti-establishment status, and that continued into the punk wave of the 1980s, which reclaimed the Bowery as rebel territory. By the globalist 1990s, when the tattoo ban ended, the non-Western sources of much of this art, particularly Japanese, was attracting attention. So was the vivid work, much of it reflecting Latin American culture, coming out of prisons.The former underground gained high visibility. Artists like Spider Webb (Joseph O\u2019Sullivan) and Thomas Woodruff, who came up through the tattoo world, made a transition to commercial galleries. New work by several young artists in the show \u2014 Mario Desa, Flo Nutall, Chris Paez, Johan Svahn, William Yoneyama and Xiaodong Zhou \u2014 seems pitched as much to the wall as to skin. And the gradual entry of tattoos into museums began the process of mainstreaming that has made the genre widely popular, but also watered down.Not completely watered down, though. Native American artists are again making the form their own. And, as was true a century ago, the participation of women is a crucial spur to this art. Ruth Marten began tattooing in the early 1970s for a largely punk and gay clientele \u2014 she inked both the musician Judy Nylon and the drag star Ethyl Eichelberger \u2014 and merged live tattooing with performance art, an idea the exhibition will explore with tattooing demonstrations in the gallery.The nonprofit organization P.Ink (Personal Ink) periodically organizes workshops that specialize in tattoo sessions for breast cancer survivors who have had mastectomies but reject reconstructive surgery. Photographs of scar-ornamenting and covering designs by Miranda Lorberer, Ashley Love, Joy Rumore and Pat Sinatra are in the show, along with testimonials from grateful clients.

{"Headline": "Five Key Moments From Snap\u2019s I.P.O. Roadshow Video", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe more than 35-minute video walks viewers through Snap\u2019s history, audience, products, revenue sources and expansion plans. The main message: Snap is a company where people have genuine, intimate and fun conversations.Snap has called itself a camera company for years now, even though it is largely known as an app maker. Mr. Spiegel explains to viewers that this idea stems from the evolution of cameras.What started out as hardware devices have become software products that connect to the internet. Cameras now augment the way a person communicates, he says, rather than a person\u2019s memory.\u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of what cameras can do,\u201d Mr. Spiegel tells viewers.\u201cOur dream had always been to have an office on the beach,\u201d Mr. Spiegel says, pointing to where he and Mr. Murphy envisioned the company\u2019s future.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty surreal being here,\u201d Mr. Murphy says. \u201cWe thought it was pretty big for what we needed at the time.\u201dFrom beginning to end, the pitch video is filled with sunny shots of Venice Beach and framed photos of Snap\u2019s early days.\u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019ve encountered over time is explaining to people why bigger isn\u2019t better,\u201d Mr. Spiegel says.He argues that what users have actually wanted is \u201ca better way to communicate with the people they really cared about\u201d rather than \u201cmore people to communicate with.\u201dSnap\u2019s ability to provide that intimacy is used throughout the video to argue that its users are more engaged \u2014 and therefore a more valuable audience for marketers.What makes Snap different is \u201cthe support and love that we show towards each other,\u201d says Mary Ritti, the company\u2019s head of communications.But that kindness isn\u2019t saccharine, Mr. Spiegel tells viewers. \u201cWhen I say \u2018kind,\u2019 I mean the kind of kind that compels someone to tell someone they have something stuck in their teeth,\u201d he says.Near the end of the presentation, Mr. Spiegel describes how people from across the company gather every other week, sit in a circle on the floor and talk about their feelings. He says it\u2019s \u201cabout empathy and listening.\u201dThat moment caps the video\u2019s message that being good listeners led Snap to take new approaches to social networking. Snapchat tells users\u2019 stories in chronological order, rather than presenting the latest update first as Facebook and Twitter do, and forgoes the likes, shares and hearts users find elsewhere to foster a less competitive experience.A key value of Snap, Mr. Murphy says, is \u201cempathy with people here and empathy with our user.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Free Speech Battle at the Birthplace of a Movement at Berkeley", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Fires burned in the cradle of free speech. Furious at a lecture organized on campus, demonstrators wearing ninja-like outfits smashed windows, threw rocks at the police and stormed a building. The speech? The university called it off.Protest has been synonymous with the University of California, Berkeley, from the earliest days of the free speech movement, when students fought to expand political expression on campus beginning in 1964. Those protests would set off student activism movements that roiled campuses across the country throughout the 1960s. Since then, countless demonstrators have flocked to Sproul Plaza each day to have their voices heard on issues from civil rights and apartheid to Israel, tuition costs and more.But now the university is under siege for canceling a speech by the incendiary right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos and words like intolerance, long used by the left, are being used by critics to condemn the protests on Wednesday night that ultimately prevented Mr. Yiannopoulos from speaking.Naweed Tahmas, a junior who is a member of the Berkeley College Republicans, the group that invited Mr. Yiannopoulos to campus, said the cancellation had made him more determined to fight for freedom of speech on campus.\u201cI\u2019m tired of getting silenced, as many conservative students are,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we support freedom of speech, we should support all speech including what they consider hate speech.\u201dWhen the event was canceled, the Republican student group reacted by writing on their Facebook page, \u201cthe Free Speech Movement is dead.\u201dMore than 100 faculty members signed a letter opposing the visit by Mr. Yiannopoulos in recent weeks. \u201cWe support robust debate, but we cannot abide by harassment, slander, defamation, and hate speech,\u201d they wrote.On Thursday, heated arguments broke out at Sproul Plaza between students who said Mr. Yiannopoulos \u2014 a provocateur editor at Breitbart News who is known for his attacks on political correctness and offensive, racially-charged writing \u2014 was too inflammatory to be invited to campus and those who argued that he should have been allowed to speak.The university made it clear they believed the people who resorted to violence on Wednesday night \u2014 a group, clad in black clothing and carrying sticks \u2014 had come from outside the campus. The university estimated on Thursday that the rioting had caused around $100,000 in damage.Whatever the origins of the violent mob, the university was and remains divided over the meaning of free speech at a time of national political tumult.\u201cI think we need to have a serious conversation about protests. This is going to be a big part of our lives for the next four years,\u201d said Kirsten Pickering, a graduate student at the university. She and others described the violence as a \u201cpotential teachable moment.\u201d\u201cWe need to sit down and talk about what is acceptable,\u201d she added.Troy Worden, a third-year student and a member of the College Republicans, said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d invite Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak on campus again, and Mr. Tahmas added that the Republican student group is a racially diverse group that does not consider Mr. Yiannopoulos to be a white nationalist.He was to cap his tour this week at Berkeley. In the weeks leading up to the event, campus administrators faced tremendous pressure from student groups and faculty members to cancel it.In a video of himself posted on Facebook after the cancellation on Wednesday night, Mr. Yiannopoulos criticized the \u201chard left, which has become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years.\u201d\u201cThey simply will not allow any speaker on campus, even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me to have their voice heard,\u201d he added.One group that has been outspoken in favor of allowing Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak is the veterans of the university\u2019s free speech movement.\u201cI\u2019m really a little fatigued with all of this, \u2018Oh my goodness, cover my ears, someone will say something that will upset me, I can\u2019t tolerate that,\u2019 \u201d said Jack Radey, who was a 17-year-old activist during the original free speech movement at Berkeley.\u201cThere are racists, sexists, piggery of various kinds who will say really terrible things. And that is part of the world,\u201d Mr. Radey said by telephone from Oregon, where he is retired. \u201cLearn how to fight back. Don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, no. We can\u2019t allow someone to speak because someone might be offended.\u2019 \u201dIn a letter to The Daily Californian, Berkeley\u2019s student newspaper, Mr. Radey and other members of the Free Speech Movement Archive board of directors, a grouping of some of the movement\u2019s activists, said Mr. Yiannopoulos was \u201ca bigot who comes to campus spouting vitriol so as to attract attention to himself.\u201dBut they said free speech was paramount.\u201cBerkeley\u2019s free speech tradition, won through struggle \u2014 suspension, arrest, fines, jail time \u2014 by Free Speech Movement activists is far more important than Yiannopoulos, and it is that tradition\u2019s endurance that concerns us,\u201d they wrote.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "With Snap\u2019s I.P.O., Los Angeles Prepares to Embrace New Tech Millionaires", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Blaine Lourd has long helped the movie stars, professional athletes and heiresses in Los Angeles manage their wealth. Over the past few years, he has also noticed millionaires who made their money in technology begin to dot the west side of the city.\u201cWhat we have not had is our Google moment,\u201d Mr. Lourd said, referring to Google\u2019s initial public offering in 2004, which produced a horde of new millionaires in Silicon Valley.That prospect has Angeleno real estate agents, money managers and luxury goods purveyors excited for a potential business windfall, akin to what their Silicon Valley brethren 375 miles to the north have seen time and again with tech I.P.O.s.\u201cWhen it comes to tech companies, for the wealth managers and real estate guys, no one has really rung the register like the Snap thing that\u2019s about to happen\u201d to Los Angeles, said Mr. Lourd, whose wealth management firm, LourdMurray, is based in Beverly Hills. \u201cMy theme is that Snapchat is the moment.\u201dTo capture some of these soon-to-be wealthy techies, Los Angeles real estate agents, lawyers and wealth managers have bought targeted search and Facebook ads, they said. Others are trying to spread word of their services through their networks of contacts. Tech employees are feeling the effects \u2014 some said they had been bombarded with LinkedIn messages from companies that find clients for these service providers.\u201cIt will be amazing to see the tech industry take off,\u201d said Lee LeGrande, a residential real estate agent at LeGrande Beach Homes, which sells property in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach. In anticipation of new money from Snap workers and Silicon Valley techies, he said, he is building some luxury beach homes.\u201cWhen Snap goes public, I hope people see these towns are hard to beat for proximity to LAX and the clean beach,\u201d he said.Snap is trying to help its 1,900 employees prepare for the scrum for their money. One Snap employee, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential, said the company had discussed bringing in academics from Stanford University to explain the impact that the I.P.O. could have on their lives. Google used a similar strategy for its employees when it went public.A spokeswoman for Snap declined to comment.In the meantime, wealth managers and others are preparing their advice. Howard Rowen, a financial adviser at Bank of America in Los Angeles who manages money for entrepreneurs and tech workers, said techies who made fortunes at a start-up might think they would hit the jackpot again. Instead, he said, that often doesn\u2019t happen and coders, engineers and others should regard the I.P.O. as a once-in-a-lifetime event.They should also diversify their assets, Mr. Rowen said. \u201cEntrepreneurs have strong emotional ties to their companies and their stock, but things don\u2019t always go right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince them that they need to invest in something other than their own company.\u201dSnap has already changed the face of Venice, a once bohemian beachside section of Greater Los Angeles. When Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy moved Snap to the area in 2013, they put the company in a single beach bungalow near the Venice Beach boardwalk. Now Snap\u2019s employees have more than tripled from 600 people at the end of 2015, and the company owns and leases several buildings tucked discreetly amid shops and homes.Venice, once home to mom-and-pop shops and dive bars, is now home to $9 juice bottles from Kreation Kafe and a $7 slice of toast with ricotta and jam at Superba Food & Bread. Upscale clothing and home goods stores dot the main commercial drag.Property values have risen 13 percent over the past year, according to the property website Trulia, with the average price per square foot for a home at $1,257 \u2014 higher than San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, also a tech enclave, and comparable to Palo Alto in Silicon Valley.Venture capitalists from Silicon Valley firms like Institutional Venture Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners are regularly spotted with entrepreneurs around Venice. Google and Facebook have moved in, turning industrial lots into campuses in nearby Playa del Rey.\u201cSouthern California now has more venture capital and angel investors than it has ever had before,\u201d said Mr. Rowen, the financial adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s not Northern California, but there is a real phenomenon.\u201dThe Snap public offering portends future wealth for venture investors in Los Angeles as well.\u201cThe next three to five years will be an absolute renaissance,\u201d said Mark Suster, the founder of Upfront Ventures, a venture capital firm in Santa Monica.Given events like Snap\u2019s I.P.O., \u201cwe\u2019ll see those employees recycle their capital back into the ecosystem,\u201d he added. \u201cThere will be an explosion of start-ups.\u201dNoting that Silicon Valley venture investors have long held Los Angeles in low regard, Mr. Suster said more were coming south. \u201cThere is a lot of money flowing into the community,\u201d he said.Not everyone is happy with the changes. Gentrification has pushed artists and working families out of Venice. Some restaurants have shut down because they can no longer pay soaring rents. In response, some politicians and residents in Venice have pushed for density restrictions, said Emil Schneeman, a real estate agent at Berkshire Hathaway Home Services.How much the wealth from a Snap I.P.O. will trickle out across broader Los Angeles is harder to ascertain. The city has long been a destination for the rich and famous and is flush with cash from the entertainment and banking industries.But it is still an exciting time for the people who can help Snap employees spend and invest.\u201cThe real estate guys are pumped because the first thing people usually buy is a house, or a dream home,\u201d Mr. Lourd said. \u201cThis is a good environment to be working in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rehabilitation of \u2018Pitbull,\u2019 a Former Wrestler and Neo-Nazi", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuke Schneider is an aging professional wrestler known as Pitbull and a retired Rikers Island guard. And for eight years, he was a member of the National Socialist Movement. His devotion was first to Adolf Hitler and second to the cadre of neo-Nazis he commanded from his Brooklyn home.He gave speeches at Nazi rallies around the country. A small militia that operated along the Arizona border wearing Nazi insignia would call him constantly for guidance.But a few years ago when he paused to take stock of his life, he found himself missing a friend, Catherine Boone, a health care aide and minor cable television personality. Mr. Schneider had met her years ago at an autograph convention. They now saw less of each other, partly because he was so busy being a neo-Nazi and partly because his comrades would have disapproved.Ms. Boone is black.\u201cI had to keep a stiff upper lip and follow \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019,\u201d Mr. Schneider, 66, explained recently as he and Ms. Boone sat at their usual table in the back of the Floridian Diner on Flatbush Avenue.Today they are happily married in what is surely one of Brooklyn\u2019s most unusual love stories. \u201cWe don\u2019t argue about one thing,\u201d Ms. Boone said.\u201cI did not drink or break the law, but I was one of the most evil men that ever lived,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cI was not serving God. I was serving Satan by serving Hitler.\u201d\u201cYou got that right,\u201d his wife chimed in.Mr. Schneider\u2019s story is one of the more unlikely tales of transformation. These days, Mr. Schneider said, he works as a guard for Orthodox Jews, standing post outside synagogues, which he considers an honor.To understand how he became a neo-Nazi, Mr. Schneider said it helps to know that as a child he felt unwanted. \u201cI grew up warped,\u201d he said. His father was absent, his mother \u201chated me for reminding her of him,\u201d and an older relative beat him mercilessly.As a boy, his back sometimes sore from being whipped with a dog leash, he would watch documentaries. Nothing rivaled his fascination with shows about the Third Reich. The imposing uniforms and talk of a superior race enthralled him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be as tough as they were?\u201d he wondered.And through the years, Mr. Schneider harbored a not-so-secret Nazi obsession.Mr. Schneider was a security guard and Ms. Boone was in need of protection. She told him she feared a violent man from a former relationship. Mr. Schneider became her protector. He would accompany her shopping and would stop by to check on her. She eventually moved into his home. And then he became a neo-Nazi.Mr. Schneider\u2019s motives were a bit muddled. In his telling, he intended to infiltrate the white supremacist movement in an undercover capacity. The reason, he said, was that Ms. Boone had been harassed by skinheads on a city bus. Distressed at her mistreatment, he began researching white supremacists online.Most Americans know of the organization, if they know of it at all, because of the group\u2019s marches. The gatherings often devolve into brawls. When Mr. Schneider would be off marching, in South Carolina, California, New Jersey and elsewhere, Ms. Boone would often stay up late, spreading pictures of Mr. Schneider across her bed, and gaze at them until she started crying.\u201cI would pray that he gets back safe and I would pray that he gets out of this movement,\u201d she remembered.Mr. Schneider became one of the group\u2019s public faces, giving speeches at rallies and quotes to the media. He compared undocumented immigrants to cockroaches, and when asked about the Holocaust would talk about how the Germans, too, had suffered.But Mr. Schneider was also blinded, he said, by his rapid rise. \u201cI\u2019ve had 100 men under my power ready to do what I say,\u201d he said. Not even after the violent deaths of two men he considered comrades did Mr. Schneider rethink things.Also in 2012, doctors found what appeared to be a cancerous tumor in Mr. Schneider\u2019s throat. The prognosis was grim.For years, Mr. Schneider had felt a growing distance between him and Ms. Boone, but he suddenly realized she \"was the only one who made me feel there was any hope.\u201d With her encouragement, he spoke with her pastor. At a Sunday service, he appeared before the congregation and \u201cconfessed everything and repented,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cI figured I was about to die.\u201dMr. Schneider\u2019s tumor turned out to be benign \u2014 God\u2019s doing, Mr. Schneider said. From his hospital bed, he told Ms. Boone, \u201cAs soon as I get my strength back \u2014 we are getting married.\u201d Weeks later, they did.The news reached the National Socialist Movement when the pastor\u2019s wife posted wedding photos of the couple on Facebook. Neo-Nazis across the country lashed out. Mr. Schneider was relieved. \u201cI wanted to let my former comrades know this black woman is my wife. Yes, I\u2019ll love this woman forever, and I\u2019m renouncing National Socialism,\u201d he said.Mr. Schneider called his commander to resign. From now on, Mr. Schneider told Mr. Schoep, he would live by the Bible, not \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d\u201cHe was doing something we don\u2019t agree with \u2014 race mixing,\u201d Mr. Schoep said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a nice way to put it, but we really don\u2019t believe in that.\u201dAt the Floridian Diner, many customers know Mr. Schneider as the former pro wrestler. When they visit his table, Ms. Boone pulls out a stack of pictures of a younger, fiercer Mr. Schneider, which she presses upon each visitor after her husband has scrawled his autograph.They have been married four years now, a period that brought \u201ca lot of happy changes,\u201d he said. One of them, he said, was his current assignment guarding yeshivas and synagogues. He has been touched by the kindness of the rabbis\u2019 relatives, who bring him soup on a cold day. \u201cI have come to love and respect these people,\u201d he said.He voiced anxiety that they would discover his past and cast him out. \u201cI pray to God they never find out,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shopping Becomes a Political Act in the Trump Era", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA couple of weeks ago, people boycotted Nordstrom for one reason: The department store sold Ivanka Trump products.Now people are boycotting Nordstrom for another reason: The store said it would not sell her products.These days, a shirt is not always just a shirt, and a store is not always just a store. Handbags, dresses and other ordinary items \u2014 and where they are bought \u2014 have become politicized, turning shopping decisions into acts of protest for the millions of people in pro- and anti-President Trump camps. Under Armour, L.L. Bean, T.J. Maxx and many other companies have already been pulled into a sort of ideological tug of war.But perhaps no retailer has been in the hot seat like Nordstrom.The sharp reaction before and after Nordstrom\u2019s decision \u2014 made quietly, with no announcement \u2014 highlights the tightrope companies must walk in this hyper-politicized environment.\u201cCompanies are nervous,\u201d said Andrew Gilman, chief executive of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group. \u201cI know several companies that have war rooms set up.\u201d\u201cThey have playbooks on what to do if there is a product recall or if the C.E.O. has a heart attack,\u201d he added. \u201cNow they have a different chapter on how to deal with a tweet from the president.\u201dMany retailers and brands would clearly prefer to fly below the political radar and stay away from the outrage on Twitter and Facebook.Calls or emails sent to a half-dozen of the country\u2019s largest department stores about how they are handling Ms. Trump\u2019s products, for example, resulted in either no comment or carefully neutral statements. None of the stores agreed to discuss how they made decisions around Ms. Trump\u2019s merchandise or details about sales of the products.But many of these companies \u2014 like L.L. Bean and Macy\u2019s \u2014 still find themselves in the eye of a social media storm. So, too, does the Ivanka Trump brand.\u201cIn recent days, we\u2019ve seen our brand swept into the political fray, becoming collateral damage in others\u2019 efforts to advance agendas unrelated to what we do, which is produce accessible, solution-oriented products for our loyal customers,\u201d the brand said in a statement.The athletic-gear maker Under Armour also encountered the perils this week, when its chief executive, Kevin Plank, called Mr. Trump a \u201creal asset\u201d for the country. Within hours, the hashtag #boycottunderarmour emerged on social media.Under Armour moved quickly to contain the damage, clarifying Mr. Plank\u2019s remarks by saying he supported Mr. Trump\u2019s business policies, not his social viewpoints.The Ivanka Trump brand said it had experienced \u201cdouble-digit growth\u201d in revenue last year, and planned to continue expanding its offerings and distribution in 2017.Consumer companies, more broadly, have long faced campaigns against their products for political, social or environmental reasons. There have been boycotts over the use of sweatshop labor, dangerous chemicals and even microbeads.But now, companies are dealing with even more intense pressure, as they have become targets in a politically charged environment fueled by social media.After Nordstrom pulled Ms. Trump\u2019s products, many people opposed to Mr. Trump cheered the decision.But Josh Cornett, a 37-year-old Trump supporter in Cleveland, was quick to tell his 25,000 followers not to shop at the department store.\u201cAll you have to do is write out a sentence, and you\u2019re done,\u201d he said.\u201cAnything that helps him, I try to promote,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd anyone who attacks him, I try to defend.\u201dNordstrom said that Ms. Trump\u2019s products were simply not selling well, and that remaining inventory would still be available in some physical stores. But that has not stopped people like Mr. Cornett from viewing the decision through a political lens, and asserting that the company took a stand.\u201cCompanies are now being swept up into this political consumer activism in a way that they have not been in the past,\u201d said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.Nordstrom is one of more than a dozen other retailers that have found themselves in the cross hairs of Grab Your Wallet, an online campaign to boycott companies associated with the Trump brand. The movement has also protested brands that donated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or advertised on \u201cThe New Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d on which he is credited as an executive producer.Some major companies, including Macy\u2019s, the country\u2019s largest department store, still sell Ms. Trump\u2019s shoes, handbags and clothes. Those companies remain on Grab Your Wallet\u2019s list.Macy\u2019s did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But many companies that are on the anti-Trump list argue they have not picked a side and should not be there.For instance, in the days before his inauguration, Mr. Trump tweeted his thanks for the support of an L.L. Bean heir and encouraged consumers to buy products from the merchandiser. Soon, the company, based in Maine, was the focus of the Grab Your Wallet campaign.In a statement also posted on social media and elsewhere, L.L. Bean urged the campaign to reverse its position, explaining that the Trump supporter, Linda Bean, was one of more than 50 family members involved in the business. It added that L.L. Bean did not endorse political candidates or take positions on political matters. \u201cSimply put,\u201d the statement read, \u201cwe stay out of politics.\u201dStill, other business leaders appear eager to dash into the political fray. After Mr. Trump signed an executive order in late January that suspended the country\u2019s refugee program and barred individuals from certain countries from entering the United States, Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, announced plans to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years.Like with Nordstrom, the response was largely split down the political divide.\u201cThere\u2019s a real difference in styles emerging here. L.L. Bean wants to stay low, saying, \u2018We\u2019re not political. We don\u2019t want to pick sides,\u2019\u201d said Professor Schweitzer, of the Wharton School.\u201cBut Howard Schultz is positioning Starbucks as a more liberal-friendly place,\u201d Professor Schweitzer continued. \u201cHe\u2019s aligning the company with the employees and most of the customers in taking that stance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That equates to more than 600 million devices, from smartphones to traditional computers.By using software to block digital advertising, critics say, users are breaking an unwritten pact with websites and digital publishers, many of which generate the bulk of their revenue from these ads.Yet industry watchers say such ad-blocking digital tools have garnered a mainstream following, particularly across the developing world where their use in countries like Indonesia has already reached roughly two-thirds of the internet population.\u201cThere\u2019s been a massive surge of mobile ad-blockers in these countries that no one anticipated,\u201d said Sean Blanchfield, chief executive of PageFair. \u201cIn the West, I expect the same trend to blindside us in the very near future.\u201dThis rise of ad blockers has not gone unnoticed by the advertising industry.\u201cAd blocking is a detriment to the entire advertising ecosystem,\u201d Paul Verna, an analyst at the research firm eMarketer, said in a statement. \u201cThe best way for the industry to tackle this problem is to deliver compelling ad experiences that consumers won\u2019t want to block.\u201dAcross the developing world, ad-blocking software is primarily used by people to save on often costly data packages by removing video and other data-hungry advertisements from mobile websites.More than 90 percent of all ad-blocking on mobile devices worldwide still takes place in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the PageFair report. And last year, such software was used on 380 million smartphones and tablets around the globe, a 39 percent yearly increase.In contrast, the vast majority of ad-blocking on traditional computers, whose use similarly jumped 17 percent last year, to 236 million devices, is still restricted mainly to the United States and Europe. In those regions, people\u2019s efforts to block malware disguised as online advertising has been the main motivation for downloading ad blockers.\u201cIn the U.S., ad-blocking on mobile is slightly immature,\u201d Mr. Blanchfield said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt that people\u2019s use of it will skyrocket.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nikki Haskell Learns the Social Cost of Supporting Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocietyNikki Haskell has packed many lives into her 75 years. She has been a real estate broker, a party planner, a pioneering stockbroker, a cult talk-show host, a Studio 54 regular, a diet and fitness guru, and a socialite. Through it all, she has depended on her brains, her enthusiasm and her skill as a social connector to power her through the tough times.But now she is facing what may be the most difficult challenge of her life: maintaining her position in the social hierarchies of liberal New York and Los Angeles while serving as a cheerleader for one of her oldest friends, Donald J. Trump, whom she first encountered in 1974 at Le Club, a defunct members-only nightspot on East 55th Street in Manhattan.Ms. Haskell said she had a wonderful time at the black-tie, pre-inauguration dinner held for Mr. Trump at Union Station in Washington on Jan. 19. But over the weekend, in a three-bedroom suite at the Mandarin Oriental, she seemed to be wavering a little.\u201cYou see what\u2019s going on in the streets, all these people rioting, all these women?\u201d she said in a phone conversation. \u201cNothing ever happened like this. They never had these riots \u2014 every street, every city, all across the world. When there\u2019s crowds and craziness like this, you never know what\u2019ll happen. It\u2019s horrifying.\u201dGiven what she was seeing on television and in her social media feeds, she was worried that her vocal support for the new president would make her a pariah.\u201cI can\u2019t be the only person in the whole world defending Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be walking down the street, they\u2019ll attack me. I don\u2019t want to be attacked. This is totally out of control. I\u2019m afraid to walk down the streets in New York or L.A. I\u2019m trying to get a television show on the air, which will never happen in this environment. I\u2019ll never have another friend. Nobody\u2019s going to speak to me.\u201dWhen Ms. Haskell was a girl growing up on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, her father bought her six horses, and she wore custom riding suits, with white wing collars and high silk hats, in shows across the Midwest. At night, her parents took her to the Chicago nightclub Chez Paris, where she became besotted with show business while taking in performances by Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante, Carmen Miranda and Mae West.Not long after the family moved to Beverly Hills, Calif., when Ms. Haskell was 13, her father died of a heart attack and her mother went to work. Ms. Haskell soldiered on. At Beverly Hills High School, she was head cheerleader and was voted \u201cBiggest Flirt\u201d in her senior year.In the Los Angeles of the 1960s, she won a twist contest judged by Bob Hope and Joan Collins. She dated Tony Bennett and hung out with Frankie Avalon, Fabian and George Hamilton.She married a real estate developer, Jack Haskell. After divorcing him, she said, she parlayed the $18,000 settlement into a small fortune on the stock market.She remarried Mr. Haskell in 1966, moved with him to 470 Park Avenue in New York and divorced him again in 1968. She got her apartment in Manhattan, took classes in investing and was hired at Burnham and Company (which would later become Drexel Burnham).For 10 years, she was a stockbroker by day (and one of the few women working on Wall Street) and a constant presence at Manhattan restaurants and clubs by night. She was equally at ease dining at Elaine\u2019s or judging a Blueboy magazine beauty pageant in the meatpacking district. She joked that she lived at Studio 54. She made friends with Rick James, Imelda Marcos, Andy Warhol and the Village People.She hit her stride with \u201cThe Nikki Haskell Show,\u201d a charmingly low-budget program on the New York public-access stations Channel J and Channel 10. In the 1980s, she was the forerunner of a YouTube star, and her guests included Michael Caine, Divine, Timothy Leary, Sophia Loren, Diana Ross, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Sellers and Peter Ustinov. And Mr. Trump.New York magazine called her the \u201cQueen of Comp\u201d for her habit of scoring freebies in exchange for positive publicity. Spy magazine, less charmed by her social climbing, likened her to Pia Zadora.A longtime Democrat, she faced a dilemma last year when Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination began to take off.\u201cI\u2019m sort of in a quandary,\u201d she said in her Upper East Side apartment last April, \u201cbecause nothing would make me happier in the whole world than to see Hillary Clinton as president. I never thought that in my lifetime we would have a woman president, and I\u2019ve always been very supportive of the Clintons. I\u2019m a registered Democrat, but I vote across party lines and would never have voted for anyone else except for Hillary, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Donald\u2019s running.\u201dOne reason she was leaning toward Mr. Trump was her belief that people were not ready for a female president. \u201cThe way things are throughout the world, men just don\u2019t respect women enough,\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cAt this time a president being a woman might be detrimental. I hate to say that, but we live in a very, very antiwoman society.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s when it all started,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a disaster.\u201dOn election night, she went to a dinner in New York hosted by an entertainment mogul and was the only person there who admitted to voting for Mr. Trump, she said. Around 3 a.m., Ms. Haskell logged on to Facebook and posted: \u201cHow great, America wins. We love President Donald J. Trump.\u201d\u201cYou must be senile,\u201d one of her followers replied.\u201cU ought to be ashamed,\u201d another wrote.On Nov. 10, she made a selfie video in the back of a New York City taxi and posted it on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to do our part to make America great,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether you like Donald Trump or not, now is the time to become a better America.\u201d Before signing off with her customary goodbye (\u201ctoodle-oo!\u201d), she reminded everyone to watch her old public access shows \u2014 now available on Amazon Prime \u2014 a few of which showed her interviewing Mr. Trump when he was a mogul on the rise.Friends distanced themselves from Ms. Haskell, she said, and one bestie dropped her after 25 years of friendship. \u201cI was actually in tears when someone told me they didn\u2019t want to be my friend anymore because I supported Donald Trump,\u201d she said.But Ms. Haskell refused to stop cheerleading. She made another video of herself while riding in a car down Park Avenue during the time of the frequent demonstrations near Trump Tower and the Trump International Hotel and Tower on Columbus Circle.After expressing frustration with the marches and protests (\u201cstupid,\u201d she called them), she said into her iPhone: \u201cDonald Trump is not going away, and people are going to have to smack their kids around and sit them down and tell them to stop acting like jerks. And to be Americans and get with the program. See you later. Toodle-oo!\u201dIn December, the writer Kevin Sessums was fed up with her pro-Trump posts on Facebook. The last straw was Ms. Haskell\u2019s posting her 1982 public access interview with Roy Cohn, the mentor to Mr. Trump who served as Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s counsel during the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954.\u201cAs if that were a glamorous, wonderful bit of footage,\u201d Mr. Sessums posted.A later thread taking aim at Ms. Haskell grew to more than 100 comments.Over the holidays, she visited the California home of the movie producer Robert Evans, who wrote about Ms. Haskell in his 2013 memoir, \u201cThe Fat Lady Sang.\u201d He said he had no sympathy for those who have dropped her because of her support for the president. \u201cI love her for it,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cBy losing Nikki\u2019s friendship, they\u2019re the losers. But she is a winner.\u201dOn the afternoon of Jan. 19 at the Mandarin Oriental suite, which she was sharing with her friend, the fund-raiser and philanthropist Kelly Day, Ms. Haskell started getting ready for the black-tie dinner at Union Station for Mr. Trump\u2019s donors and family members.\u201cDonald always had big ideas, big dreams, and I was always fascinated with that,\u201d she said while doing her eyelashes.She recalled first seeing him at Le Club. \u201cHe was really handsome, a hot guy, and he caught my eye immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very captivating, even in a discoth\u00e8que at night.\u201d Several months later, Mr. Cohn invited her to dinner at \u201c21\u201d and seated her next to Mr. Trump. \u201cWe clicked right away,\u201d she said.The first night he took a Czech fashion model named Ivana Zelnickova out on the town, Ms. Haskell, along with her date, met up with them at Elaine\u2019s. \u201cIvana and I became friends like that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when Studio 54 opened in 1977, I went with Donald and Ivana.\u201dAs Ms Haskell and Ms. Day left the suite, Ms. Haskell spoke of her increasing number of ex-friends. \u201cIt takes a lot to make me cry,\u201d she said, putting on a golden sable coat. \u201cI have no children. I have a fabulous brother, nieces and nephews, but I\u2019m a woman alone of 75 years old, and I find it just so disheartening.\u201dAt Union Station, once through the metal detectors, Ms. Haskell smiled for the paparazzi. Her table was next to those occupied by Trump family members. After a speech by the president-elect, Ms. Haskell chatted a while with Melania, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump.\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here,\u201d Tiffany told her.As waiters cleared away the main course (roasted branzino), she got up. \u201cI supported Donald when no one supported him,\u201d Ms. Haskell said on her way to the powder room. \u201cOne of the family just said to me, \u2018It wouldn\u2019t have happened if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessarily true. But I really believe in Donald.\u201dShe walked by Jose Fanjul, the sugar baron, and Christine Hearst Schwarzman, the wife of the billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman. \u201cYou know why it\u2019s a great party?\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cBecause everybody here loves Donald.\u201dAfter dessert (vanilla meringue cake), she seemed to feel better about those ex-friends of hers. \u201cThey\u2019ll get over it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t.\u201dA protester was scowling at guests leaving the party. \u201cHe makes America ashamed!\u201d the woman said.\u201cListen, Donald has more respect for women than anyone I know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not a guy. Guys talk about girls. They talk about getting them into bed. But it\u2019s just guy talk.\u201d She remembered the interviews she did with him. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re all on Amazon Prime,\u201d she said. \u201cThe history of what I\u2019ve done will live on forever.\u201dBack in the suite, Ms. Haskell and Ms. Day ordered room service and didn\u2019t call it quits until around 4:30 a.m. Later, they watched the inauguration together in their bathrobes. On Sunday, while watching the women\u2019s protests on television, Ms. Haskell said she might ease up on the cheerleading until things settled down. \u201cI\u2019m just one little person,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not Kellyanne Conway.\u201dShe got dressed and made it to Reagan National Airport. \u201cI\u2019m never going to march,\u201d she said on the phone, after clearing through security. \u201cYes, it worked in the Vietnam War and things like that, but that was a different time. I would have no problem going to Congress, and because I have this close friendship with the Trump family, I will use this opportunity to better all the things for women. Because that\u2019s exactly how I feel.\u201dWhile still counting herself a Trump supporter, Ms. Haskell has indeed eased up with the Facebook posts in favor of the president since the inauguration weekend.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m running out of friends and I got tired of all the negativity,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cPeople were busting my chops and I lost a couple of very close friends, which I think is actually quite insane and pathetic, to think that people who are these lifelong friends are not speaking to me because I voted for Donald Trump.\u201dBut lately she has taken pains to post nonincendiary material. \u201cJust to show you how things have changed,\u201d Ms. Haskell said, \u201cthe other day I posted myself going to the grocery store. That was a first.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Growth Can Be Measured in Trash Bags", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMark Patton has never had so many neighbors in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He should know because it is his job to pick up after them.As a New York City sanitation worker, he drives a mechanical street sweeper past a small forest of new residential buildings, crowded subway stations and block after block of stores, restaurants and bars. He finds so many more water bottles, soiled napkins, newspapers, cigarette butts and nastier discards than when he started nine years ago that he has to circle back and make a second pass.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more litter for me to pick up,\u201d said Mr. Patton, 32. \u201cI can\u2019t slack off at all.\u201dEven the city\u2019s least populous borough, Staten Island, is confronting growing heaps of garbage. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had litter, but it\u2019s at a level that\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said James S. Oddo, the Staten Island borough president, who now keeps a private cleaning company on hand for emergency spot cleanings and is shopping for a \u201cmini-mechanical sweeper\u201d \u2014 a vacuum truck \u2014 to add to his arsenal.\u201cI\u2019m the only person who\u2019d like to see it rain on Sunday to see less traffic,\u201d said Kathryn Garcia, the city\u2019s sanitation commissioner.It is not only sanitation workers who are busier. An \u201cadopt-a-basket\u201d program that recruits businesses and others to empty street baskets currently has 3,276 volunteers, up from 1,880 a year ago. Community organizations have sent out hundreds of cleaning crews to pick up litter as part of a city-financed program, NYC Cleanup, which has been expanded every year since the City Council started it in 2014.Times Square, which draws as many as 445,000 people daily, requires a full-time cleaning staff of 68, up from 41 in 2012, including one worker whose only job is picking up chewing gum, some 400 pieces a day, according to Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance. The organization has invested $1.5 million on 385 waste-compacting bins, which have made a dent in what Mr. Tompkins calls the \u201cMount Everest of trash bags.\u201dBut even with all the extra cleaning, trash continues to accumulate in corners of the city. In Lower Manhattan, trash bags are stacked up to 10 feet high in front of shiny new residential towers, blocking narrow sidewalks and attracting rats. Across the river in Brooklyn, enough residents have complained about garbage that a local councilman, Stephen Levin, is organizing a town hall meeting.In the South Bronx, Councilman Rafael Salamanca Jr. said he sees overwhelmed trash baskets every day. \u201cI\u2019m here advocating that the South Bronx is changing, and we\u2019re moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then across the street from my office, you have an overflowing garbage can. It just gets under my skin.\u201dNew York City\u2019s trash problems go back to its early days as a Dutch settlement, said Robin Nagle, an anthropology professor at New York University and the author of \u201cPicking Up: On the Streets and Behind the Trucks with the Sanitation Workers of New York City.\u201d In 1657, Peter Stuyvesant decreed that residents could only dispose of trash in five designated spots along the East River in an attempt to clean filthy streets. \u201cIt was ignored, pretty much,\u201d Ms. Nagle said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been the challenge.\u201dThen as now, trash can take on a life of its own. In the same way that a few broken windows in a community can encourage more crime \u2014 the \u201cbroken windows theory\u201d \u2014 even a small amount of trash on the streets can attract more trash, Ms. Nagle said. \u201cIt\u2019s like an invitation to add more litter,\u201d she said.In Flushing, a neighborhood in Queens that has seen a huge influx of new residents and visitors, a pedestrian triangle became known as \u201ctrash triangle\u201d after someone tossed trash bags there and other residents followed, according to a councilman, Peter Koo, who has pushed to get it cleaned up. Another magnet for trash has been a densely packed stretch of 40th Road, where there is an entrance for the Long Island Rail Road, along with restaurants, stores and a playground.City sanitation officials do not track the volume of litter and debris collected by mechanical street sweepers, or emptied from street baskets in specific neighborhoods. The department\u2019s total trash collection, which includes pickups from residential buildings, has declined to 3.2 million tons in 2016 from 3.5 million tons the decade before, in part as recycling and composting have increased and manufacturers have used less packaging, Ms. Garcia, the sanitation commissioner, said.A major headache for sanitation workers, she added, has been trying to clean around the increasing number of cars that flout street cleaning rules. The department issued 263,421 violations to drivers for failing to move their cars in 2016, up from 218,976 in 2010.Sitting behind the wheel of a street sweeper on a recent morning, Mr. Patton was forced to zigzag around parked cars as other drivers sped by him. As he crawled up to a crowded intersection at 10 miles per hour, he braked for a woman on a cellphone who darted in front of him. \u201cEven though I\u2019m loud, it seems like they don\u2019t notice me,\u201d he said.In Williamsburg and other neighborhoods, residents say that many newcomers put out their household trash bags at the wrong times, sometimes cluttering curbs for days. Some also fail to securely tie the trash or use flimsy plastic bags that break open, contributing to street litter.Homer Hill, a spokesman for the Grand Street Business Improvement District, which maintains six blocks in Williamsburg with 200 buildings, said his group has stepped up efforts to work with residents and new property owners to teach collection schedules, especially in smaller buildings where there is no full-time superintendent. The district also employs a seven-day-a-week cleaner to tidy up the streets.In many cases, combating growing litter piles has required some creativity. The Parks Department is testing a new trash management program at Crotona Park in the Bronx, in which trash and recycling baskets are strategically placed in high-traffic areas and weighed down with concrete so they cannot be blown away or moved by park users.NYC Cleanup doubles as a job training program, with community organizations employing people on cleaning crews who have been homeless or in prison. One of the City Council\u2019s most popular initiatives, it received $7.8 million in funding last year, up from $3.5 million in 2014.David Greenfield, a Brooklyn councilman, said he proposed the program because he could not walk down the street without stepping over pizza boxes and coffee cups.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have more people, you\u2019re going to have more trash,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a common sense way to deal with a nuisance that was frustrating many New Yorkers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

David Britton, a vice president in the fraud and identity department of Experian, the credit reporting agency, said people should be curious about whether companies themselves were a threat to user privacy.\u201cWhat are they capturing about you?\u201d he said. \u201cIs the data leaving the device? Is it being sent back to the mother ship?\u201dConsider the smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Amazon said its Alexa smart assistant, which is used in its Echo speakers, automatically downloads software updates to defend against new security threats. Data from the Echo is also uploaded to Amazon\u2019s servers only after people utter the wake word \u201cAlexa,\u201d the company said. That minimizes the likelihood that the device will record conversations unrelated to requests intended for Alexa.Google said its Home speaker similarly issued regular software updates and employed advanced security features, like a technique that disables the device if its software is tampered with. The company added that the speaker processed speech only after the words \u201cO.K. Google\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d were detected.Your Wi-Fi network is the pulse of your smart home, thus it is a vulnerable attack point. Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene suggest connecting all your smart home accessories \u2014 for example, your Amazon Echo, Nest thermostat, Samsung smart refrigerator and Philips Hue smart lights \u2014 onto a Wi-Fi network that is separate from the one connected to your computing devices, like your smartphone, tablet and computer.With two distinct Wi-Fi networks, it will be harder for a hacker to jump from infiltrating your smart accessory on one network to a personal computer on the other network, Mr. Arsene said.If you are paranoid about your Wi-Fi network being hacked, you can also change the Wi-Fi router\u2019s network settings to disable broadcasting the network name entirely, Mr. Britton said. That would make it difficult for a hacker driving by to detect and compromise your network, though it would also require house guests to manually type in your network name and password when they log on to your Wi-Fi.The same security principles for websites apply to the so-called internet of things. You should set strong, unique passwords for logging into each device you own. If you recycle your passwords and one device is compromised, the others can be, too.A strong password can be a random string of characters or a nonsensical phrase with numbers and special characters. (Examples: My favorite number is Green4782# or The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%.)While reputable manufacturers of smart home accessories offer software updates to patch security vulnerabilities, it is often up to the consumer to stay on top of updates. Because it lacks a screen, a smart light bulb or an internet-connected power socket is going to have a tough time informing you that it needs a software update.Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene recommend that consumers regularly log into the mobile apps or websites for their smart home accessories to check if they need software updates. If updates are available, install them immediately.With smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, there is an equivalent: a mute button to disable the device microphone so it can no longer listen. In the unlikely event that a device is hijacked, muting the microphone could help prevent hackers from listening to your conversations, Mr. Britton said.Or you could go the safest route and opt out of having these devices at all. That was the method chosen by Mr. Tien, the lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who previously studied the privacy risks of smart meters, the devices that utility companies use to monitor energy consumption.He said he accepted the privacy implications of owning a smartphone, but a smart home accessory?\u201cI think it\u2019s sort of asking to have your privacy invaded to have something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the value of it is really all that great.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Killing: \u2018I Only Wanted to Scare Them\u2019", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMurder in the 4-0The sun had yet to rise on a summer Sunday when Selena Tomas, 17, stepped out of a livery cab in the South Bronx. The dress she had worn to her baby shower squeezed her swollen belly, and her feet ached in her high heels.Her boyfriend, Maurilio Ju\u00e1rez, 21, was talking happily with his brother and sister, all of them in various states of drunkenness. The four had just returned from a hall in Manhattan, and the trunk of the cab was crammed with leftover food and beer and gifts for the baby.Ms. Tomas got out and hurried up the block to the walk-up where she and Mr. Ju\u00e1rez lived, at the corner of 154th Street and Courtlandt Avenue.Behind her, Mr. Ju\u00e1rez and his brother hauled some of the beer and gifts down the block and propped open the building\u2019s door with them, Mr. Ju\u00e1rez said in an interview. As they headed back to the spot where their sister was keeping an eye on the rest, Maurilio Ju\u00e1rez heard a commotion behind him and turned to see his brother quarreling with at least three men.He rushed into his apartment, grabbed a plastic bag and returned to the street, recalled Ms. Tomas, who had already changed out of her party clothes. \u201cHe sounded scared,\u201d she said.Ms. Tomas followed him. Some men who had been drinking across the street were fighting with Mr. Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s brother, she said. She saw her boyfriend take a gun from the plastic bag and wave it toward the men. She pulled on his sleeve, begging him to come back inside. \u201cI was trying to protect him and he was trying to protect me because I had a big belly,\u201d she said. She heard the gun click, then she heard a shot.Gunsmoke snaked up in the air. The .22-caliber bullet hit Rafael Guzman in the back, punctured a lung and nicked his aorta. The police found Mr. Guzman, 39, face down on the sidewalk in front of a high-rise at 681 Courtlandt Avenue, across the street from the building where Ms. Tomas and Mr. Ju\u00e1rez lived. He was pronounced dead at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center at 5:16 a.m. on Sunday, Aug. 14.The couple retreated into their ground-floor apartment. When the police arrived, Ms. Tomas went outside to speak to them, telling them Mr. Ju\u00e1rez was inside, \u201cdrunk and scared.\u201d Then Mr. Ju\u00e1rez came out. By midmorning, both had provided accounts to detectives at the police station.Mr. Guzman lived in an apartment on East 154th Street, separated from Mr. Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s place by a small lot with six parking spaces. He worked as a file clerk at a law firm in the suburb of White Plains, but he still dreamed of making it as a rapper, and he held tight to the streets where he had grown up. Mr. Ju\u00e1rez, new to the neighborhood, was fearful of its violence. He urged his girlfriend to stay inside and hoped they would be able to move soon to a safer neighborhood in Queens.The death of Mr. Guzman was the 12th of 14 killings recorded last year in the 40th Precinct, where The New York Times has been documenting every murder in 2016 in an effort to understand why violence persists in some parts of the New York City even as crime is near an all-time low. In the 40th Precinct, which includes Melrose and Mott Haven, serious crime has risen sharply over the past two years, and in 2016, it recorded more murders than all but four of the city\u2019s 77 police precincts. Earlier this month, it logged its first two homicides of 2017.Mr. Guzman\u2019s role in the encounter that ended his life remains unclear. The fight began when the group of men across the street tried to take some of the beer the Ju\u00e1rez brothers had used to prop open the door, the police said. Mr. Guzman\u2019s family believes he was trying to defuse the argument between the Ju\u00e1rez brothers and the other men. But detectives say he may have been among the people who tried to abscond with the beer. An autopsy showed his blood-alcohol content was high when he died.Surveillance video shows Mr. Ju\u00e1rez entering his apartment at 4:36 a.m. and leaving a minute later with the gun in hand, the police said. Another camera shows him on a sidewalk in front of the building waving the gun, Ms. Tomas behind him. Two spent shell casings were found inside the revolver, which officers executing a search warrant discovered under Mr. Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s bed.The morning of the shooting, Mr. Ju\u00e1rez told investigators in a videotaped statement he had fired a gun twice in the air, but he later acknowledged he might have fired lower, the police said. He was charged with murder, manslaughter and criminal weapons possession, and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Edward Dudley Jr., said he would argue that the brothers were defending themselves from a robbery.In an interview, Mr. Ju\u00e1rez, now 22, maintained that he was so drunk that night that his memory was fuzzy. He recalled he had \u201cfired a bullet upward.\u201d\u201cI only wanted to scare them,\u201d he said in Spanish. Asked how many times he had fired, he said, \u201cTwice.\u201d Mr. Ju\u00e1rez added he did not know his bullet had killed someone until the police arrived.\u201cI never thought about taking someone\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret it. I feel bad.\u201dSgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, said a call to the police might have changed the outcome. \u201cNo one needed to die here, you know what I mean?\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cYou got assaulted? They are trying to steal your beer? Call the police.\u201dMr. Ju\u00e1rez, who has a ninth-grade education and grew up in a poor mountain city in Mexico, came to the United States illegally four years ago, his family paying smugglers $4,000 to help him cross the Sonoran Desert and elude the Border Patrol. He made his way to New York City, where his sister already lived, and found work as a busboy at a Manhattan restaurant.Violent crime by undocumented immigrants sometimes ignites political passions and has become a hot-button issue in Washington since the election. But Mr. Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s arrest drew little attention in the Bronx, where tens of thousands of immigrants, documented and undocumented, live and work.Mr. Ju\u00e1rez hardly fits the profile of a criminal alien. He had no arrest record, and was working two restaurant jobs to support his pregnant girlfriend.Indeed, his girlfriend said Mr. Ju\u00e1rez was afraid of becoming a victim himself in the gang-plagued neighborhood, where shootings are not uncommon. Last year there were two other fatal shootings within a block of the couple\u2019s apartment, and over all the 40th Precinct logged 31 shootings, more than most areas of the city.\u201cThe whole neighborhood was really scary,\u201d Ms. Tomas, now 18, said.Mexican street gangs have grown in influence in the South Bronx in recent years with an influx of Mexican immigrants. Mr. Ju\u00e1rez, however, did not belong to a gang, nor was he involved in the drug trade, the police said. How he obtained the gun that he used to kill Mr. Guzman is a question that vexes Mr. Guzman\u2019s loved ones.\u201cHow do you wake up on Courtlandt Avenue and have such easy access to a firearm?\u201d asked Mr. Guzman\u2019s friend Rafael Torres, 38. \u201cHow are there so many firearms on Courtlandt Avenue?\u201dMr. Guzman was the middle child of a Puerto Rican family whose life was anchored on East 154th Street in the Melrose section of the South Bronx. After his parents split, his mother lived in the East Bronx and later in Pennsylvania, but it was Melrose, where his father, Pascual Guzman Sr., stayed put, that remained Mr. Guzman\u2019s touchstone and the inspiration for his songwriting.His father said Mr. Guzman, whom he calls Rafa, had come of age when the neighborhood around the Melrose Houses was wracked with crack dealing and gun violence. Yet while Mr. Guzman had many friends embroiled in that dangerous trade, he managed to avoid being lured into the gangster lifestyle himself.\u201cRafa was never into that,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe knew all the thugs. Don\u2019t get me wrong. But that wasn\u2019t his cup of tea.\u201dMr. Guzman met Rafael Torres, his best friend, in elementary school, and the two bonded over their first name and a love of socially conscious hip-hop and new jack swing.They both dropped out of high school and worked as nightclub busboys in Chelsea, but as they got older, they realized they needed their diplomas. So Mr. Guzman obtained a G.E.D., and later landed jobs with the city\u2019s Housing Authority and Family Court in the Bronx.As his friends peeled off to the suburbs to start families, Mr. Guzman remained a bachelor bound to the block. With the help of his brother, he found work in 2008 as a law firm file clerk at Malapero & Prisco in Manhattan and, later, White Plains.But the suburbs held no magic for him. He felt most at home on the streets where he had grown up playing youth baseball and rooting for the Yankees. He was often seen walking outside, striking up conversations with acquaintances on the street corners, or relaxing and enjoying a beer on a bench in the courtyards of the Melrose Houses, his neighbor Ray Soriano said.\u201cHe never had to worry; everybody knew him,\u201d Mr. Soriano said. \u201cEverybody was like his family.\u201dWhile Mr. Guzman chased his artistic dream, Mr. Ju\u00e1rez was laboring long hours to provide for the family he was expecting to have. He told his girlfriend\u2019s family he wanted a better life for his baby than the poverty he had endured in southwestern Mexico.He was born in June 1994 in El Platanar, a small, indigenous village in Guerrero State, where most people speak a Mixtecan dialect. When he was 6, his parents moved the family to a nearby city, Tlapa de Comonfort, so that their eight children could learn Spanish and get educations.Mr. Ju\u00e1rez dropped out in ninth grade, after his family ran out of money to pay for school. At 15, he was resigned to working on their farm growing corn and pumpkins.He heard it was easier to make money in the United States, where an older sister lived, so on Jan. 15, 2012, he set out to make the perilous trek across the American border.It took Mr. Ju\u00e1rez two weeks to make his way to New York from Tlapa, traveling by car, by plane and by foot. He hiked with other migrants through the desert and crossed the border at Nogales.Three years later, in August 2015, he said, he met Ms. Tomas at a get-together at a friend\u2019s apartment on the Grand Concourse near East 167th Street. She was an American high school student from New England, visiting friends in the city. That night, he found her on Facebook. A month later, he said, he moved to be with her, supporting himself with jobs in a restaurant and then in a vineyard harvesting grapes. They soon got tattoos with each other\u2019s names.When December arrived, she learned she was pregnant. Her mother, Tara Simmon, wept at the news, fearing Mr. Ju\u00e1rez would abandon her daughter. But he assured her that he was eager to take on the responsibility.Mr. Ju\u00e1rez, seeking better money, returned to the Bronx last February with Ms. Tomas, who dropped out of school. After a few months of living with his siblings, they saved enough to rent a $1,000 room just up the block, at 688 Courtlandt Avenue.He held down two jobs as a busboy at expensive restaurants in Manhattan, going to work in a dress shirt and a bow tie. \u201cHe would leave one job and \u2014 sometimes he couldn\u2019t even change \u2014 go right to another,\u201d Ms. Simmon said.All the while, he was saving money to get married after the baby was born and move to a safer neighborhood.The baby shower was intended to be another demonstration of his commitment to Ms. Tomas and the child. But the future they imagined has been shattered.On Aug. 31, Ms. Tomas gave birth to a daughter, Evelyn Martina. Mr. Ju\u00e1rez met his firstborn in a city jail on a barge in the Bronx.\u201cI was very happy and emotional, but at the same time, sad,\u201d he said in prison, dressed in a gray inmates\u2019 jumpsuit, a tattoo of Ms. Tomas\u2019s first name visible on his left forearm. \u201cThis is not how I expected it to be.\u201dIf convicted of murder at trial, he faces a minimum of 15 years to life in prison. Even if he pleads to a lesser charge and receives a lighter sentence, he would spend his daughter\u2019s childhood in prison and would most likely be deported after his release.Reporting was contributed by Al Baker, Sandra E.

{"Headline": "How a Refugee\u2019s Selfie With Merkel Led to a Facebook Lawsuit", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byW\u00dcRZBURG, Germany \u2014 Anas Modamani\u2019s 2015 selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel came to symbolize her decision to allow hundreds of thousands of unscreened migrants into Germany. But Mr. Modamani, a refugee from Syria, sought on Monday to prevent Facebook from allowing users to repost the image, or any altered version of it, after it repeatedly showed up in fake news reports linking him to terrorism.The trial, one of several notable cases against Facebook in Germany, highlights several basic legal questions, such as who is responsible for content posted by anonymous sources and whether people who repost text they did not write, or an image that someone else altered, can be held responsible for defamation. Concern over nationalist and populist propaganda, as well as fake news, is growing in the country ahead of a general election scheduled for September.Mr. Modamani, now 19, fled Syria for Germany in 2015 and was living in a Berlin shelter when Ms. Merkel came to visit in September of that year.The selfie that he took with the chancellor and posted to his Facebook page was widely shared on social media, and became an emblem of her immigration policy. But Ms. Merkel\u2019s stance on refugees has shaken her support and has helped propel the rise of the populist, far-right Alternative for Germany party.Mr. Modamani has filed for an injunction in a court in W\u00fcrzburg, in the southern German state of Bavaria, that would require Facebook to remove any content linking him to terrorism.Mr. Modamani\u2019s lawyer argued that his client would continue to be a victim of libel until Facebook used its algorithms to prevent the image from being reproduced.\u201cI want peace in my life,\u201d the teenager told reporters after the hearing. \u201cNot everyone believes that. Many people hate me, but all I did was take a selfie with Ms. Merkel.\u201dAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The social media giant says it is committed \u201cto meeting our obligations under German law in relation to content which is shared by people on our platform,\u201d and has removed images reported to the company by Mr. Modamani\u2019s lawyer.In opening remarks to the court, Mr. Jun argued that Facebook had the technical ability to delete the image and prevent any copies from being posted. Lawyers for the social network insisted that it had removed any images flagged as defamatory, and that it was up to users to inform them of such material.After nearly two hours of arguments, during which Mr. Jun called Facebook\u2019s argument that it could not find and remove every copy of the image \u201cridiculous,\u201d both sides rejected a suggestion by the judge that they settle the matter with Facebook paying damages without any further proceedings.Judge Volkmar Seipel said that the case raised questions about personal rights in the digital sphere that the law has not kept up with and that the court may not be in a position to answer. A ruling is expected on March 7.Critics say those efforts do not go far enough.This is far from the only legal challenge the social network faces in Europe.On Tuesday, an Irish court is set to decide whether Facebook misused Europeans\u2019 digital data by transferring it to the United States.Privacy advocates say Facebook broke European data protection rules by moving users\u2019 information across the Atlantic. The company denies the allegation. Legal experts say the case will eventually be sent to the European Court of Justice.An article on Tuesday about a Syrian refugee\u2019s efforts to block Facebook from allowing users to repost the image of him with Germany\u2019s chancellor misstated the date that a ruling in the case is expected from a German court. It is March 7, not March 3.Mark Scott contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2018The New Brooklyn\u2019To the Editor:A recent study on homelessness in the Department of Education\u2019s school districts revealed that District 16 (Bed-Stuy) had the highest number of students living in temporary housing in Brooklyn (and the third-highest in the entire city). Many students and their families who do not end up homeless move to Brownsville or East New York.And contrary to Ehrenhalt and Hymowitz\u2019s claim that gentrifiers improve the neighborhoods they move into, gentrifiers in Bed-Stuy often opt to send their children to charter schools or schools outside the district. This has led to a host of damaging consequences for the public schools of District 16. The callousness with which Ehrenhalt dismisses the \u201closers\u201d in the gentrification process speaks volumes about his ignorance and/or indifference to the costs of gentrification for poor African-Americans.BRENDA LEEBROOKLYN\u2b25To the Editor:In the first paragraph of his review Alan Ehrenhalt writes: \u201cNot too long ago,\u201d gentrification was \u201cpretty much a value-neutral term for the process by which communities exchange one set of residents for another.\u201d The cluelessness of this statement is twofold.First, it suggests that whenever the socio-economic, racial and/or ethnic composition of a neighborhood changes, it is called gentrification. One obvious counterexample is the influx of African- Americans and Latinos into many parts of Brooklyn that started in the mid-20th century, both literally and figuratively changing its complexion. It was not called gentrification at the time or at any time in the succeeding years.Second, the notion that the term \u201cgentrification\u201d was ever value-neutral is belied by the root of the word itself. \u201cGentry\u201d refers to people of good breeding and high social position. By definition, gentrification is the exact opposite of \u201cvalue neutral.\u201dRICHARD COBEENBERKELEY, CALIF.\u2b25American EmpireTo the Editor:But that connection was very much part of Lodge\u2019s thinking, independent of any \u201cexport lobbies.\u201d Four days after Commodore George Dewey\u2019s overwhelming victory at Manila Bay in May 1898, Lodge wrote to a friend: \u201cWe must on no account let the islands go. .\u2008.\u2008. We hold the other side of the Pacific, and the value to this country is almost beyond imagination.\u201dA month later he reiterated this point in a lengthy memorandum to the secretary of state marked \u201cPersonal.\u201d Noting that the country had outgrown its domestic markets for manufactured goods, and expressing concern about the possibility of wage declines and social disturbances, he strongly urged that the United States keep the Philippines as \u201ca foothold\u201d to assure access to \u201cthe vast markets furnished by the millions of people in the East.\u201dRICHARD HUME WERKINGLOUISVILLE, KY. The writer is a retired librarian and historian.\u2b25To the Editor:I was surprised that neither Stephen Kinzer nor Michael Lind mentioned the American conquest of Mexico (1846-48) as the nation\u2019s earlier foray into imperialism. The acquisition of nearly half of Mexico devastated our southern neighbor and brought untold riches to the United States.Many of the foreign policy debates and economic demands by the captains of industry discussed by Kinzer also occurred as policy makers wrestled with taking \u201call of Mexico\u201d after the war. With slavery at stake and concerns about the incorporation of nonwhite Mexican citizens and indigenous peoples, all on the eve of the gold rush, it seems that the \u201cAmerican Empire\u201d mentioned in Kinzer\u2019s subtitle arrived a half-century earlier.DAVID HERN\u00c1NDEZNORTHAMPTON, MASS.The writer is an assistant professor of Latina/o studies at Mount Holyoke College.\u2b25\u2018They Can\u2019t Talk That Way\u2019To the Editor:When I was an English teacher of mostly rural white students, I found it crucial for them to know the distinction between their home dialect, necessary in their community, and standard English, necessary for the vast majority of white-collar jobs. Teachers must not disparage community speech, but they must teach standard English, the language of the marketplace.JAMES P. LENFESTEYMINNEAPOLIS\u2b25Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

{"Headline": "Texas Democrats Angered by Trump\u2019s Remark on Destroying Senator\u2019s Career", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 A comment President Trump made on Tuesday in which he spoke of destroying the career of a Texas state senator has angered Democratic lawmakers in the state and cast a spotlight on the issue that set off the remark \u2014 the seizing of suspects\u2019 property by law enforcement before those suspects have been convicted of a crime.Mr. Trump\u2019s remark came during a meeting at the White House with sheriffs from around the country. At one point, the president asked the sheriffs seated at a table around him if there were any pressing law enforcement issues they wanted to talk about.A Texas sheriff, Harold Eavenson of Rockwall County, spoke up.\u201cCan you believe that?\u201d Mr. Trump responded, then added, \u201cWho\u2019s the state senator?\u201dSheriff Eavenson did not reply. \u201cDo you want to give his name?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll destroy his career.\u201d Laughter then broke out.It remained unclear which Texas state senator Sheriff Eavenson was talking about. The sheriff, one of the top officials in a county about 25 miles east of Dallas, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.The state senator who represents Rockwall County, Bob Hall, a Republican, also did not respond to requests for comment. According to The Texas Tribune, Mr. Hall told reporters on Tuesday at the state Capitol in Austin that he had \u201cno idea\u201d if he was the senator the sheriff was referring to, but said he had a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with the sheriff.Mr. Hall is a member of the Senate committee on veteran affairs and border security, and is a decorated Air Force veteran who worked as an engineer on the Minuteman missile-defense system during the Cold War.Texas state senators and representatives reacted to Mr. Trump\u2019s remark along party lines. Republicans, who control both chambers of the State Legislature, described Mr. Trump\u2019s comment as a joke. Democrats, however, said they were shocked that the president of the United States would speak so flippantly about destroying a lawmaker\u2019s career.\u201cDo not be mistaken or misled: This is not strictly a law enforcement issue,\u201d Ms. Burton said in a statement. \u201cThis is a property rights issue. Property rights are one of the foundational rights in any free society, and the taking of property by government is no small matter.\u2019\u2019\u201cRequiring the government to secure a criminal conviction before permanently taking property from citizens is simply common sense,\u201d she said.The effort to overhaul and tighten the state\u2019s laws that allow law enforcement to seize suspects\u2019 cash or property has won support from Democrats and Republicans. Critics of the practice say it has led to widespread violations of property rights in several states, while law enforcement groups say it remains an effective tool to hurt drug cartels.Ms. Burton said that in Texas, \u201cmany cases of asset forfeiture end without the state securing a criminal conviction, but the state still successfully keeps most, if not all, of the property.\u201d\u201cMy personal opinion is that such a bill, if it were to pass, would benefit the cartels and damage law enforcement,\u201d he said.Texas has long taken threats against state senators and other elected officials seriously.Michael McCrum, a San Antonio lawyer and former federal prosecutor who served as the special prosecutor in the Perry case, said he believed Mr. Trump\u2019s comment came close to crossing the line from a joke to a criminal act.\u201cDid he knowingly threaten to harm another?\u201d Mr. McCrum said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly up close to the line. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over the line.\u201dSusan R. Klein, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and a former federal prosecutor who helped prepare Mr. Perry\u2019s legal team for oral arguments, said Mr. Trump\u2019s remark was clearly a joke and did not violate state or federal law.\u201cI am a liberal Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, but I really think we should let up on Trump now and accept he is our president and wish him well,\u201d Professor Klein said in a statement. \u201cTrying to obstruct him at every turn and even criminally charge him for what was clearly a joke is not helping this country one bit.\u201dManny Fernandez reported from Houston, and David Montgomery from Austin, Tex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Popularity of Sony\u2019s PlayStation VR Surprises Even the Company", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN MATEO, Calif. \u2014 There are plenty of people who are skeptical about virtual reality, a technology some have heralded as the biggest thing to come along in years in games and entertainment.Even Andrew House, global chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment, the video game division of the Japanese electronics giant, had doubts about how quickly virtual reality would be embraced by the mass market. So when Sony needed to decide how many of its virtual reality headsets to manufacture, Mr. House was among those inside the company advising that Sony make fewer of them.\u201cIt\u2019s the classic case in any organization \u2014 the guys who are on the front end in sales are getting very excited, very hyped up,\u201d Mr. House said. \u201cYou have to temper that with other voices inside the company, myself among them, saying let\u2019s just be a little bit careful.\u201dSony\u2019s internal goal was to sell one million of the headsets in its first six months, by mid-April. The company will almost certainly surpass that forecast. \u201cYou literally have people lining up outside stores when they know stock is being replenished,\u201d said Mr. House, describing the scene in Japan, one of the largest games markets.Mr. House said the supply of PlayStation VR headsets will improve by April. By fall, Sony expects to begin selling them in Latin America.The sales figure is a positive sign for virtual reality and probably establishes Sony as the leader in the premium side of the market \u2014 headsets connected to PCs and game consoles that provide more immersive experiences than are currently possible through inexpensive headsets that use smartphones for visuals.Sony\u2019s primary competitors, Oculus from Facebook and HTC, have not disclosed sales of their premium headsets. One research firm, SuperData Research, estimates there were 243,000 Oculus Rift headsets and 420,000 HTC Vive headsets sold by the end of last year.In contrast, during the iPhone\u2019s first three months on the market in 2007, nearly 1.4 million units were sold, and it is considered to be among the most successful technology products of all time.The current generation of virtual reality headsets arrived on the market last year with a flurry of hype. Demonstrations thrilled people throughout the industry \u2014 many have been waiting for virtual reality to jump out of the pages of science fiction. Facebook's $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014 set off a wave of investment in the sector.Among the other challenges facing the technology: high prices for virtual reality equipment, limited high-quality content and thorny side effects like motion sickness.Sony enjoyed advantages as it entered the market because its headset is sold as an add-on to its game console, PlayStation 4, more than 53 million of which had been sold by the start of January. The headset sells for $400 \u2014 or $500 with a set of virtual reality hand controllers and a required camera \u2014 hundreds of dollars less than other premium products, which also require powerful PCs.Mr. House said he would be \u201cvery happy\u201d if the product ends up being purchased by a high single-digit percentage of all PlayStation 4 owners. For newer generations of headsets to reach a bigger audience, they will have to be lighter, cheaper and unencumbered by cables, analysts believe.More creators of content will also have to step up their investments. Many virtual reality games are currently shorter experiences made by small, independent game studios. A number of large publishers are sitting on the sidelines until more headsets are sold.Masachika Kawata, series producer for the game, said in an email that \u201cwe\u2019re really just getting started on what kind of experiences we can create for players.\u201dWhile Oculus has made a big splash in the industry, Sony began officially working on its headset in 2011, before Oculus announced its efforts, said Richard Marks, a Sony research fellow. Dr. Marks said Sony did not anticipate the technology would get as much as attention as it has.\u201cWe were expecting it to be a lot smaller than it has turned out to be,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

I am a handsome 68-year-old male who looks and feels far younger than my years and I\u2019m desperate \u2014 the illegal immigrants have been snapping up all the hot 26-year-old women. I feel so hopeless. How can I compete? I understand. I have personally come across countless illegal immigrants, often on highly sought-after 12-hour-a-day, off-the-books heavy-construction jobs, and invariably they greet me with such comments as \u201cGood morning\u201d or \u201cCareful, we just painted that.\u201d What woman can resist such blandishments? And with that $8-an-hour salary and not one cent going for taxes you better believe they can show a woman a great time. But take heart: The president has just announced plans to start building that wall at the Mexican border, so soon your troubles will be over. Adios, big spenders!I am a successful businessman, but when I found myself alone with a gorgeous stranger at a friend\u2019s firm and started kissing and grabbing her, I was arrested. Where did I go wrong?You forgot the key part of what President Trump said to Billy Bush: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\u201d Your error was in grabbing a woman you did not know at another firm, where you were not a star. After you post bail, try it at your own company. The women there have probably all been flirting with you, even if it\u2019s been unconscious on their part. I admire the fact that the president, all his life, has refused to bow to political correctness. He came right out and said he didn\u2019t think Heidi Klum was a 10 anymore and rated women on Howard Stern\u2019s show. But when I went on OkCupid and said women should not reply if they were less than a 7 or had a mug like Rosie O\u2019Donnell, several women attacked me as \u201csexist.\u201d Do you have the chiseled good looks of the president or Howard Stern? Their buff bodies? I have to be frank here: If you are going to rate women, you\u2019d better maintain yourself as well as these guys.I don\u2019t think anyone should be looking to the president as an example of romantic success. The web has been buzzing with comments about how when the president and Melania arrived at the White House on Inauguration Day he didn\u2019t wait for his wife, but raced up the steps without her. Where\u2019s the gallantry in that?Bad, bad idea. Don\u2019t you remember what Mr. Trump, then just an ordinary (if richer and smarter and handsomer than anybody else) developer, told Vanity Fair when he was married to his first wife: \u201cI would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?\u201dJust keep on doing what any loving man would do \u2014 noticing what kind of shape your wife is in and taking her to the gym if she starts looking like Miss Piggy \u2014 and you\u2019ll be doing more than enough. I\u2019m a healthy red-blooded American man who has been out of work for a while. I\u2019ve recently fallen in love with a single mother of three who is also having a hard time making ends meet. We came close to spending our first night together last weekend, but she was concerned about protection. Our local Planned Parenthood has closed for lack of funds. How do we proceed?Are you really an American? I\u2019m not so sure. Let me see your birth certificate. In the conversation with Billy Bush you mentioned the president referred to using breath mints before kissing. If, as he said, he was such a big star that he could get away with anything, why are mints so important?One wouldn\u2019t want to give offense.I Was Misinformed is a humor column about survival in New York City.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Tried to Upend Banks. Now It Works With Them.", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2011, Brett King was promoting his book, \u201cBreaking Banks,\u201d and creating a start-up that he hoped would do to the banks what Amazon did to the retail industry and Facebook did to media.\u201cWe had grand ideas of being the Facebook of banking, and being a new form of bank account,\u201d Mr. King said recently.Six years later, his company, Moven, has opened only 60,000 of those new bank accounts. Mr. King has now transitioned to selling his software to the banks he once scorned, who use it as a component of their mobile apps.\u201cWe realized that if you want millions of users as a bank, it is a very different proposition than building a social media network,\u201d he said.Silicon Valley has upended a growing number of industries, and it had seemed not too long ago that Wall Street would soon be next. A flurry of financial start-ups rose quickly and grabbed billions of dollars in investments.Mr. King is just one of the many technology entrepreneurs who have since recently run into the enormous moats that surround and protect the existing financial industry.The venture capitalists who have invested billions of dollars in this wave of new financial technology \u2014 think Venmo and Bitcoin \u2014 have been left waiting for a breakout star that actually looks like a threat to even a part of the big banks\u2019 business.\u201cA lot of people set out saying, \u2018We are going to displace the banks,\u2019\u201d said Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist at 500 Startups who focuses on financial technology. \u201cWe realized along the way that you really have no choice but to work with the banks.\u201dAnd the difficulty of denting the influence and power of the big banks is only likely to get harder under the Trump administration.President Trump has said he wants to encourage innovation and new business by cutting back on regulations of all sorts, including financial regulations.Yet it was the regulations passed after the financial crisis that forced the big banks to reduce their risks in many areas and provided an opening for start-ups like Moven, which were willing to take more risks.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle those post-crisis regulations is widely expected to give the big banks more free rein and close the window of opportunity for newcomers.\u201cThe degree to which banks have been caught under the yoke of regulatory obligations is very likely to lighten up under Trump,\u201d said Arjan Sch\u00fctte, the founder of the venture capital firm Core Innovation Capital, which focuses on financial technology.Mr. Sch\u00fctte has been moving his firm\u2019s investments away from bank disrupters and toward start-ups that are set up to partner with existing financial institutions.Even if there has not been a disruption of the big banks, basic financial services available to consumers are changing rapidly, nonetheless.Americans are now able to send each other money instantly from their phones, thanks to Venmo, and can get approved for a loan in minutes, also from their phone.The consulting firm McKinsey estimated in a report last month that digital disruption could put $90 billion, or 25 percent of bank profits, at risk over the next three years as services become more automated and more tellers are replaced by chatbots.Much of this change, however, is now expected to come from the banks themselves as they absorb new ideas from the technology world and shrink their own operations, without necessarily losing significant numbers of customers to start-ups.Venmo, for, instance, has captured the wallets of many young Americans, but the largest banks have all begun their own versions of the service and some of them say that they already process, as single banks, more instant personal payments than Venmo.The large banks are also teaming up to start a cross-industry mobile phone application, Zelle, that will take Venmo head-on in 2017.Venmo, which was acquired by PayPal, is still trying to find a way to make money from the business, which is currently offered primarily as a free service.Financial start-ups are not facing the same challenges everywhere in the world. In China, the technology company Ant Financial has grown to 450 million users since spinning off from the e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Ant Financial now processes a majority of online payments in China.Ant Financial has used its position as an electronic, phone-based wallet to grab lots of other financial business from Chinese consumers, offering online loans, insurance and investment advice to its hundreds of millions of customers.China has four of the five most valuable financial technology start-ups in the world, according to CB Insights, with Ant Financial leading the way at $60 billion. And investments in financial technology rose 64 percent in China last year, while they were falling 29 percent in the United States, according to CB Insights.In Africa, the financial industry has been shaken up by the rise of new forms of mobile phone-based payment systems like M-Pesa, in Kenya, which was started by the local mobile phone operator rather than a bank, and has risen to become the dominant form of payment in the country.The obvious reason that financial start-ups have not achieved the same level of growth in the United States is that most Americans already have access to a relatively functional set of financial products, unlike in Africa and China.Some start-ups looked at becoming banks, so they could offer deposit insurance \u2014 among other things \u2014 but they generally found that getting a bank charter required more time and money than is available to even the most successful start-ups. This left most start-ups reliant on banks to hold and move any money they collected from customers.\u201cOperating in America, you needed to get a gatekeeper to approve your access to the networks,\u201d said Josh Reich, who sold his banking start-up, Simple, to the Spanish banking giant BBVA. \u201cIf we wanted to touch their money, we needed to be part of the banking system.\u201dOnline lenders were particularly ambitious in trying to take on the banks from outside the system. Lending Club, which makes personal loans, and OnDeck, which focuses on small business loans, initially grew swiftly and went public, but both companies have run up against the limits of how fast a lending business can grow without being a bank.The online lenders have struggled with the high cost of acquiring new customers through marketing, which is not as necessary in other industries that have been disrupted by technology.At a more fundamental level, online lenders realized how hard it was to fund the new loans they wanted to give out without having access to cheap deposits, as the banks do.The shares of both Lending Club and OnDeck are now trading far below where they were on the day they went public.One notable success among the new lenders has been SoFi, or Social Finance, but even it has captured only about 250,000 customers, as compared to the 160 million users of Snapchat, the social network that was founded the same year.Start-ups focused on improving payments have had more success \u2014 the most valuable recent American technology start-up is Stripe, which helps new companies accept online payments.But Stripe and other payment start-ups like Square are all built on top of the existing credit card and banking infrastructure and have not posed any type of fundamental threat or challenge to the existing giants.\u201cWe are explicitly not a threat to the banks,\u201d Tim Drinan, a spokesman for Stripe, said. \u201cFrom our perspective the banks and card networks have built something pretty good and pretty hard to replicate.\u201dPerhaps the most ambitious recent project aimed at upending the banks was Bitcoin, which promised a new way to hold and move money, totally outside the existing banking system.The virtual currency has not taken off as a way to hold and spend money on a day-to-day basis, as many of its enthusiasts had predicted.At the same time, in a pattern that has been repeated elsewhere in the financial industry, the big banks have been making big investments aimed at harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin \u2014 known as the blockchain \u2014 for their own purposes.Tim Swanson, an early Bitcoin follower and analyst who now works with the blockchain consulting firm R3, said that Bitcoin wasn\u2019t able to fulfill the marketing promises that were made for it back in 2012.\u201cIt may take some time, but if there is anyone that has the capital base and the developer base to see this through, it\u2019s the banks for sure,\u201d Mr. Swanson said.An article on Thursday about technology start-ups\u2019 efforts to take on the financial industry misstated the year that PayPal acquired Venmo. It was 2013, not 2009.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Plan Is Most Unfriendly to Outsiders", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorSnap Inc. is aiming to adopt the most shareholder-unfriendly governance in an initial public offering, ever.It is different from its predecessors, Facebook and Google, which went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. In recent years, Facebook and Google have revised this structure to add a nonvoting third class of shares to preserve founder control, yet shareholders have had at least some vote even if they couldn\u2019t sway the results.Snap has followed the natural evolution of this disenfranchisement, simply eliminating shareholder rights from the get-go. And this is not just about replicating the venture capital model, where founders get control but investors get board seats and veto rights over significant transactions. Here, Snap is not even giving crumbs.For gurus of good corporate governance, this is bad enough, but once you dig into the details of how this nonvoting stock works, it gets much worse for shareholders.Snap has set up three share classes. Class A will be offered to the public. These shares have no voting rights and no hope of ever having voting rights.Class B shares have one vote each and are convertible into Class A stock. These are shares held by prior investors and employees.Then there are the Class C shares, with 10 votes each, which are convertible into Class B stock. These shares are held in equal number by the two Snap co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy. Specifically, each of them holds 107,943,924 Class C shares. These shares will give the two men complete voting control over Snap.The two founders have a proxy arrangement that transfers voting control to the other if one dies, but it doesn\u2019t cover whether they vote their shares together while alive, so presumably they could deadlock. Snap has solved this problem by granting a performance stock award to Mr. Spiegel that will be 3 percent of the company\u2019s post-I.P.O. value.This award will be paid out in equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in the third full quarter after the offering. After this, Mr. Spiegel will have total control over Snap and Mr. Murphy will simply be a close second.Snap, which looks a lot like Twitter did at its I.P.O. stage, could also experience bumps in the road as Twitter did. In its prospectus, Snap calls itself a camera company, but it really has just one product, Snapchat, which is beloved by the younger crowd for its disappearing photos and texts.Facebook, Google and Microsoft as well as Amazon have survived because of the ability to provide multiple successful offerings. Twitter has struggled with just one product \u2014 the platform on which people the world over, including the American president, send 140-character messages called tweets.If things are going well, no one is going to question Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy\u2019s control. But if things are bad, then shareholder complaints may be valid, a spur to action. Indeed, control makes sense only if shareholders and the two executives disagree about whether things are going well. But that assumes that shareholders will be irrational or wrong or not know as much as the two men at the helm. The last point may have some validity \u2014 but is it worth complete disenfranchisement, again given that Snap is a very early-stage company and Mr. Spiegel is so young?I suppose it all might be palatable for most diversified investors in exchange for the huge potential upside, except for the last two parts of this scheme. First, in October Snap issued a dividend of one Class A share for each Class C share the two men owned. The result was to allow Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy to sell half their shares without worry of losing control. The company could reload this at any point, issuing out another dividend of Class A shares if the two need more money.So, barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die. This raises some interesting possibilities.Hypothetical Scenario 1: Mr. Spiegel is hit by a bus and dies. Mr. Murphy would now have complete control of the company. Yet Mr. Spiegel is supposed to be the visionary executive who justified this voting structure. Or is Mr. Murphy, 28, equally visionary? (Or perhaps it is more likely they are just executing well on the \u201cdisappearing pictures\u201d concept just as Mark Cuban executed well on \u201cinternet radio\u201d before selling broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for billions of dollars.)Hypothetical Scenario 2: At age 30, Mr. Spiegel decides that life as a billionaire married to a supermodel (he\u2019s engaged to Miranda Kerr) is more fun spent on an island in the Pacific. He quits his job but still holds Class C shares and wields his power to elect directors and run the company part time.Hypothetical Scenario 3: Mr. Spiegel continues to hold the shares and keep his day job and at age 50 is head of a middling internet company with great potential, but he refuses to give up control, or starts behaving erratically.Potential investors, particularly the big money managers like the BlackRocks of the world, should likely be asking themselves: Is it all worth it, given the risks? I\u2019d note here that Google has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Mr. Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook nonvoting stock. Does Mr. Spiegel deserve better than that? And remember the other tech titans, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, all have one share, one vote.In its prospectus, Snap says its team is \u201ckind, smart and creative,\u201d which is kind of like Whitney Houston singing, \u201cI believe that children are the future.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot of other stuff about growth and big ideas. Snap may be right, and Evan Spiegel truly is the second coming, but this just does not justify the extreme governance given the risk. Instead, it just seems silly, but not in the fun Snapchat sort of way.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "36 Hours in Trinidad", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementCompared with its Caribbean neighbors, Trinidad gets few tourists except during its vibrant February carnival. This means that this tiny melting pot of a country \u2014 which shares nationhood with neighboring Tobago, and has a rich Indian-Creole-African-Chinese-British heritage \u2014 feels welcoming and authentic. Skyscrapers don\u2019t exist; instead there are captivating gingerbread-style houses with fanciful latticework. The local cuisine, which reflects its hodgepodge of cultures, is intriguing and delicious but not fancy: The best meals are eaten on the street and at cafeteria-style counters, not in high-end restaurants, which tend to be Europeanized. Spend Friday in the capital, Port of Spain, then use Saturday for excursions north to the beach and south to explore the calm waterways and wild birds of the Caroni Swamp.\nExplore street view, find things to do in Trinidad and sign in to your Google account to save your map.\nThe sprawling Queen\u2019s Park Savannah is the heart of the city, with amateur cricketers playing on the park\u2019s green lawns on weekends, and food stalls serving up some of the best casual dining in town after dusk. Head for the cluster of white tents, bright lights and music and stroll through, picking up corn soup flavored with vinegar and studded with chunks of carrots and corn on the cob, pholourie (dumplings, lightly fried and served with a sweet dipping sauce), chicken feet and cow heels pickled with slices of cucumber (called souse). Then finish with a bag of the sweet and savory \u201cchow\u201d: slices of peeled fruit, often underripe mango, salted and doused with a peppery garlic sauce. Dinner for two, around 100 Trinidad/Tobago dollars, or about $15. Vendors on the perimeter of the park will open a fresh coconut for 10 dollars. Drive north from the Green Market to Maracas Bay, along a narrow road of hairpin turns with gorgeous views from the cliffs\u2019 edge down to the water. Maracas Bay is the most popular beach within reach of the capital, and on Saturdays it can get crowded with people swimming in the clean, warm sea backed by lush green hills. One reason locals come here is for the \u201cshark n\u2019 bake\u201d that\u2019s sold at seaside food stands: a portion of shark (although skeptics say it\u2019s just \u201cfish\u201d) battered and fried, then tucked into the \u201cbake,\u201d a folded-over circle of fried bread (35 dollars). Try it at Vilma\u2019s, where the sauces are homemade, and add a cold Carib beer. Lined with Chinese restaurants, bars and stores that stay open late, Western Main Road in the St. James neighborhood is the place to come for an evening of partying (called \u201climing\u201d). Take a long, slow stroll starting at Cawnpore Street, and head west, stopping for the occasional cold, local Carib or Stag at a bar blasting soca music. Have a heavy street snack of Indian roti stuffed with chicken, beef or goat curry topped with potatoes, pumpkin and spiced mango (ask for \u201cslight\u201d pepper to avoid too much heat, around 25 dollars). Or pick up a \u201cpunch\u201d (the Trini word for juice); vendors sell shakes of soursop, passionfruit or sea moss, blended with ice and condensed milk. Sunday midday dinner is a Trini tradition. Head to Creole Kitchen, a cafeteria-style restaurant that looks out of place among the newer businesses that have sprung up around it. Locals pop in to pick up hearty takeaway containers of stewed chicken, macaroni pie topped with toasted cheese, and callaloo, a West African-influenced dish of taro leaves and coconut milk, but there are also tables for eating in.

{"Headline": "Cadillac Ad Tries to Bridge Nation\u2019s Chasm, Without Falling In", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseCan a luxury auto ad help bridge the deep political chasm in America \u2014 and, while it\u2019s at it, sell cars?General Motors\u2019 Cadillac division is about to find out.In an effort to distinguish the company from its German and Japanese rivals in the luxury car segment, Cadillac\u2019s advertising slogan for the past three years has been \u201cDare Greatly.\u201d In the opening line of its new 60-second ad, that\u2019s just what Cadillac seems to be doing. Over footage of a street demonstration, the narrator says bluntly, \u201cWe are a nation divided.\u201d\u201cWe had to get the elephant out of the room,\u201d Uwe Ellinghaus, Cadillac\u2019s chief marketing officer, told me this week when I visited Cadillac\u2019s sleek headquarters in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood for a preview of the ads. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny this. At the same time, you hear this, and you stop immediately. It gets your attention.\u201dThe opening line ends with a subtle but important qualifier: \u201cThat\u2019s what they tell us, right? This chasm between us.\u201d It then moves swiftly to a far more positive and inclusive message: What \u201cthey don\u2019t tell us\u201d is that \u201cwe carry each other forward, no matter who we are, or what we believe, or where we come from.\u201dMr. Ellinghaus told me emphatically that he was trying to avoid any partisan stand. \u201cWe can have a point of view without adding fuel to any controversial political debate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did a lot of soul searching. What has happened to the American dream? We wanted to celebrate what America is capable of.\u201dWhile that may not be impossible in the age of President Trump, it has become far more difficult \u2014 as some advertisers learned at their peril during this month\u2019s Super Bowl. Mr. Trump\u2019s election has caused a tectonic shift in advertising \u2014 just as it has in media more generally \u2014 and themes that might have once seemed innocuous or patriotic have suddenly become politically charged, controversial and divisive.Yet the ad prompted an anti-Budweiser boycott campaign on social media by Trump supporters.With Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women an issue, a Cadillac rival, Audi, ran an overtly issue-oriented Super Bowl ad, showing a man\u2019s daughter winning a downhill cart race against an all-boys lineup.\u201cAudi of America is committed to equal pay for equal work,\u201d the ad intoned. \u201cProgress is for everyone.\u201dBut critics quickly charged that such progress apparently stops at Audi headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany: Audi\u2019s board of management has no women on it. The ad attracted thousands of \u201cdislikes\u201d on Facebook, and a social media campaign accused Audi of liberal bias. (Audi has defended the ad and said it was working \u201caggressively\u201d to promote women in management.)When it comes to Mr. Trump, Cadillac faces a more delicate task than most. The president and his wife, Melania, arrived at the inauguration in a heavily armored custom Cadillac known as the \u201cBeast,\u201d and the Cadillac brand is indelibly linked to the White House. Cadillacs have been used by every president since Woodrow Wilson.Like most major national ads, work on Cadillac\u2019s Oscars campaign began nearly a year ago, when Mr. Ellinghaus had dinner with Arthur Sadoun, chief executive of the advertising agency Publicis Communications (and now chairman and chief executive of Publicis Groupe), to discuss this year\u2019s campaign.Cadillac was in the third year of an ambitious effort to reposition itself as a distinctive global brand. The first iteration of the \u201cDare Greatly\u201d campaign featured the chanteuse \u00c9dith Piaf and iconoclastic personalities like the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.Both Mr. Sadoun and Mr. Ellinghaus thought the campaign needed to evolve, while remaining true to its origins. Still, \u201cit didn\u2019t take the results of an election\u201d to know the American public was polarized, Mr. Sadoun said.Mr. Ellinghaus was adamant that the ad not be overtly political. On the other hand, \u201cI didn\u2019t see how we could shy away from the division in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to enter the political debate. We wanted to transcend it.\u201dPerhaps it took two non-Americans \u2014 Mr. Sadoun is French, Mr. Ellinghaus is German \u2014 to suggest that by acknowledging the divide, an ad campaign might actually help heal it. After all, America had been divided before in its history \u2014 at times far more than now. (Hence the image of a civil rights demonstration.) The nation had overcome the divisions, moved forward and prospered, the American dream intact.For many years (though not in recent decades), the Cadillac brand embodied that dream. Perhaps Cadillac\u2019s ad could remind Americans of the nation\u2019s resilience and inherent optimism, and \u201ccelebrate what America is capable of,\u201d Mr. Ellinghaus said.So the ad moves from images of civil strife to scenes of Americans helping one another and overcoming adversity: police officers embracing; American soldiers returning from battle in Afghanistan; a father running behind his paraplegic son in the last Olympics triathlon; a Hurricane Katrina rescue mission. \u201cWe may not be the same, but we can be one,\u201d the narrator concludes. \u201cAll it takes is a willingness to dare.\u201dCadillac executives didn\u2019t do any formal market testing of the ad, but they did preview it for a few audiences, including a group of Texas Cadillac dealers, who gathered in Dallas a few weeks ago for a meeting with their division leaders. If the ad was likely to cause a backlash from pro-Trump factions, dealers from Texas were as likely as anyone to anticipate it.\u201cUsually they walk us through the concept, the strategy, what they were hoping to achieve,\u201d said Jacquelin Sewell, who manages Cadillac dealerships in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio as part of the family-owned Sewell Automotive. \u201cThis time they just showed it and said the work should speak for itself.\u201dThe reaction, she said, was overwhelmingly enthusiastic.\u201cWe\u2019re all a part of a national conversation that in many ways is very negative,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I talk to our customers on an individual level, there\u2019s a lot of hope. People still believe in the potential of this country. I feel this taps into that in a very powerful way.\u201dCadillac has struggled in recent years to translate higher quality and praise from the automotive press for its new models into higher sales in the United States. Last year, Cadillac\u2019s sales in the United States dropped 3 percent to 170,000 units even as overall automotive sales hit a record 17.55 million. (Global sales, however, rose 11 percent, making it Cadillac\u2019s best year for sales in three decades.)So I had one major question: With only a few glimpses of actual Cadillacs in the ad, and all of those vintage models, will it actually sell cars?That, everyone involved with the campaign told me, isn\u2019t the main goal of this particular ad. (It will be followed during the awards ceremony with other Cadillac ads spotlighting specific models.) This is a long-term investment that will \u201celevate the brand,\u201d in Mr. Sadoun\u2019s view.\u201cCadillac realizes that it needs to connect with buyers emotionally,\u201d Ms. Sewell said. \u201cThat\u2019s never been more true than now in the luxury space.\u201d In the ad, Cadillac is identified with \u201cunity, optimism, courage \u2014 the great American values,\u201d she said. \u201cI think dealers and customers, too, are hungry to hear something positive like this.\u201dWhether Cadillac has managed to transcend the nation\u2019s bitter political divide is ultimately for \u201cthe audience to decide,\u201d Mr. Ellinghaus acknowledged. \u201cIf you have to explain it afterwards, you\u2019ve failed.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about Cadillac\u2019s new advertising campaign, described the opening scene from a commercial incorrectly. The footage was of a recent street protest and was made to look archival, not of a civil rights demonstration from the 1960s. The column also misstated, at one point, the given name of a founder of the company that makes Budweiser beer, which was the subject of an ad campaign that recently became politically charged. He was Adolphus Busch, not Augustus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "London Gallery LD50\u2019s Alt-Right Show Should Be Its Last, Critics Say", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic controversy did not boil over, however, until this month, when the London artist Sophie Jung shared on Facebook a message from the gallery\u2019s founder, Lucia Diego, expressing sympathy with what she called President Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d The interaction quickly got noticed in London\u2019s large but cliquish art world, and the controversy attracted attention in the tabloids. An expletive along with a hammer-and-sickle symbol and a pink swastika was scrawled outside the gallery, which sits above an architecture firm in a neighborhood dotted with Turkish restaurants and Afro-Caribbean markets.When Phil Jones, 37, a resident of East London for 10 years, tried to enter his apartment near the gallery, some protesters accused him of not supporting the anti-fascist cause. After an argument, the police, who were on hand throughout the protest, separated him from the crowd.\u201cI think it is counterproductive to graffiti people\u2019s doors, people who have nothing to do with it,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit extreme. I had seen exhibitions there. It was just a normal gallery. It\u2019s pretty hostile here now and people may need to get their facts straight first.\u201dOne protester, Jenny Graham, 44, who said she\u2019d lived in the neighborhood for 30 years, described the area as \u201ca diverse borough in terms of race, class, ethnicity; everyone here lives happily side by side: Jews, Muslims, everyone.\u201d But the gallery, she said, was out of line. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t set foot in that place unless I had a bomb with me. No platform for the right, for fascism.\u201dIn a phone interview, Ms. Diego, the gallery founder, a Spaniard who has lived in Britain for about 12 years, said she was no conservative firebrand, and was getting slammed simply for not being politically correct.\u201cIf I had an agenda that I just wanted to push this ideology, I would have just done that from the beginning,\u201d Ms. Diego said, adding. \u201cI\u2019m happy to represent artists on the right and on the left.\u201d\u201cIt actually diminishes Western culture and tradition,\u201d Ms. Diego wrote, saying that she had been shocked by the art world\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s election. She added, \u201cThe left in my eyes is behaving more like a fascist organization than the real fascists.\u201dMs. Diego said she started the gallery in 2015 to examine \u201cthe impact of the internet and technology in society and the world.\u201d She described the exhibition on the alt-right as \u201ca study of what is happening online and how these ideologies are emerging.\u201dOf her own politics, Ms. Diego said: \u201cI would position myself in a center position,\u201d explaining that she was neither liberal nor right-wing. She said that though she did not support anti-Semitism, homophobia or misogyny, she felt that liberals were often doctrinaire in their defense of Jews, gays and women and had taken identity politics too far.The gallery\u2019s Facebook page seemed to espouse apocalyptic visions. \u201ccan\u2019t wait for the whole art market system \u2014 as we know it, to collapse,\u201d the page stated on Jan. 19, the day before Mr. Trump took office.\u201cAmerica has really become a mental asylum (thanks for the spectacle \u2026),\u201d it posted on Jan. 26.Mr. Osborne said that at first the gallery\u2019s provocations were read as irony, but that anger at the gallery and at Ms. Diego mounted after Ms. Jung shared the Facebook message. He allowed that the art world can also be an insular one where people are afraid of speaking out for fear of recrimination, or of sullying their reputation.Mr. Osborne said he favored shutting the gallery. Asked if that would amount to censorship, he replied, \u201cHate speech isn\u2019t free speech, and it in fact undermines free speech.\u201dMs. Diego said that she had planned to open her next show in early March, but now is unsure whether she can continue to keep the gallery operating. Her landlord, she said, was disturbed by the developments. She noted that the police had advised her to stay indoors, and she said that she had not left her house in several days, after receiving threats online.\u201cThe whole world seems to be in a kind of turmoil,\u201d she said.Iliana Magra contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

More often than not, the administration\u2019s actions have been both highly unusual and highly consequential, The Upshot\u2019s 15 survey panelists said.We asked our panelists: Was the event normal, like the veto of a bill in a prior administration?

Also, was it unimportant, with limited or no consequences for federal policy, like the menu for a state dinner?

{"Headline": "Yahoo and Verizon Are Said to Be Near a Cheaper Deal", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Soon after Yahoo disclosed the first of two enormous data breaches that threatened to upend a $4.8 billion deal it had reached with Verizon Communications, the embattled company began to confront an unpleasant potential future.Yahoo could have battled Verizon to preserve the original price tag, a campaign that could have ended up in a Delaware courtroom \u2014 and led to months of bitter legal wrangling. Moreover, that strategy would have run the risk of allowing Verizon to walk away from the purchase altogether.Instead, Yahoo is close to renegotiating its original deal, choosing to take close to $300 million off the price to preserve the sale, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.Under the revised terms, the two companies are expected to share legal responsibility and costs for the data breaches, the person with knowledge of the matter said.The new deal is expected to be announced within days, this person added.Representatives for both companies declined to comment on the discussions.On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed additional information stemming from the breaches, notifying some users that it had found evidence of attempts to log in to their accounts without a password. Those attempts were made using data stolen in the 2014 hacking.Yahoo did not ask the users to change their passwords but urged them to use account key, an optional feature that uses a smartphone to validate all attempted logins on a Yahoo account.Verizon executives had earlier mused publicly about the severity of the Yahoo breaches and whether they had a material effect on the companies\u2019 deal, announced in July.Analysts, however, said Verizon, a telecommunications giant, had plenty of reasons to complete the transaction quickly, particularly to build up its digital media business.Verizon\u2019s core business, wireless phone service, is being hurt by stiffened competition from AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. Verizon was recently forced to bring back unlimited data plans to match its rivals\u2019 offerings.For Yahoo, salvaging the deal was even more vital.In putting its core internet business \u2014 including its still-popular email service, Yahoo Finance and sports arms \u2014 up for sale last year, the company sought to end years of questions about its declining business and whether it could effect a turnaround. A succession of chief executives, most recently Marissa Mayer, tried but failed, and investor discontent was high.After a highly public sales process, Verizon emerged the winner.Verizon sought Yahoo as part of its effort to build a digital media empire anchored by its earlier purchase of AOL, another aging internet property. AOL could not achieve the scale necessary to challenge Google and Facebook on its own, and Yahoo\u2019s business was meant to play a crucial role, bringing in more than a billion users.Verizon\u2019s archrival, AT&T, is also building a new business line in media. But in seeking to acquire Time Warner for $85 billion, it is aiming for a much greater scale more quickly.Still, the hacking disclosures appeared to rattle Verizon\u2019s plans.In September, Yahoo revealed that intruders it believed were backed by a foreign government had stolen the data, including encrypted passwords, of 500 million user accounts in 2014.Two months ago, Yahoo announced that an even larger breach, involving a billion accounts, had occurred in 2013. That breach compromised additional data, including security questions used to reset passwords. Yahoo forced all of the affected users to change their passwords.In both cases, there is evidence that Yahoo knew about the intrusions for some time before they were publicly disclosed.Yahoo has shared few additional details in recent months, citing continuing investigations by outside security firms, its board of directors and law enforcement authorities.Its reticence drew the ire last week of the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who sent a letter to Ms. Mayer demanding more information about the breaches and what Yahoo had done to protect its users since then.Yahoo said last month that it was confident its deal with Verizon would close by the end of June.The long delay has taken a toll on Yahoo\u2019s business. The company has continued to lose market share in digital advertising as Facebook and Google expand their dominance and shiny newcomers like Snapchat attract the attention of marketers.While waiting for the deal, Yahoo\u2019s management has focused on cutting costs, eliminating more than 2,100 jobs in the last year.Yahoo stockholders are eager to see the deal close so that Yahoo can focus on finding ways to extract the value of its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, and its 36 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group.Those investments, which are supposed to remain in a stub company called Altaba, are worth about $48 billion combined.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Howard Frank Mosher, Whose Novels Evoked Hardscrabble Vermont, Dies at 74", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis wife, Phillis, said that the cause was lung cancer.\u201cWell, the best-laid plans, as they say,\u201d he wrote, adding that he had thought he had an \u201cupper respiratory bug\u201d but that it was ultimately diagnosed as cancer. \u201cI am happy to leave you all with the gift of what may be my best book in \u2018Points North.\u2019\u201dHis awareness in December that something was wrong with his lungs pushed him to finish the stories in \u201cPoints North\u201d in eight days, writing in pen on legal pads at his dining room table, his wife said. Then, as usual, he sent the manuscript off to be typed.Mr. Mosher\u2019s fictional Kingdom County, Vt., became his New England version of Faulkner\u2019s Yoknapatawpha County \u2014 a fertile setting for place-based fiction in works like \u201cGod\u2019s Kingdom\u201d (2015) and \u201cNorthern Borders\u201d (1994).On his website, Mr. Mosher described the Northeast Kingdom, an area comprising three counties, as a \u201cregion of jumbled mountains, deep forests, glacial lakes and scattered hill farms,\u201d where \u201cpeople still live close to the world of nature we were all once part of.\u201d It became the fictional home to the Kinnesons, familiar characters in his novels and stories, whom Mr. Mosher based on his own family.Mr. Mosher was born on June 2, 1942, in the Hudson River city of Kingston, N.Y. His father, Howard Hudson Mosher, was a school administrator, and his mother, the former Helen Emily Trapp, who had a degree in French, was a homemaker. The younger Mr. Mosher earned a bachelor\u2019s degree at Syracuse University and a master\u2019s at the University of Vermont.Settling in the Northeast Kingdom in 1964 as a high school English teacher, Mr. Mosher, who arrived with his wife \u2014 the former Phillis Claycomb, who taught science \u2014 quickly found that they had stumbled upon a lode of stories that writers had barely mined.For instance, the landlady at their first Vermont home, in the town of Orleans, told them how she had persuaded a federal revenue agent not to arrest her for moonshining during the Depression by telling him that if she lost the illicit income it produced, she and her husband would lose their farm. Decades later, after she was widowed \u2014 and no longer moonshining \u2014 she met the agent again and married him.Recalling his and his wife\u2019s reaction to the landlady\u2019s tale, Mr. Mosher told Vermont Public Radio, \u201cBoth of us knew, without saying a word, that I would write the stories of the Northeast Kingdom, come hell or high water.\u201dThe gist of the landlady\u2019s story found its way into Mr. Mosher\u2019s 1978 book, \u201cWhere the Rivers Flow North,\u201d a novella and stories.Jay Craven, who has made five films based on the author\u2019s books \u2014 including \u201cNorthern Borders\u201d (2015), with Bruce Dern and Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold, and \u201cDisappearances\u201d (2006), with Kris Kristofferson \u2014 likened Mr. Mosher\u2019s work to investigating a fading civilization.\u201cHoward arrived at the last minute to observe the culture of a Vermont that was still rooted in the late 19th century,\u201d Mr. Craven said in a phone interview. \u201cSo he approached it as an archaeologist or anthropologist; he dug deeply into the natural world and came away with an intense motivation to collect everything he could.\u201dIn addition to his wife, Mr. Mosher is survived by his daughter, Annie; his son, Jake; two grandchildren; and a brother, Terry. His mother died on Jan. 23, six days before he did, at 102.Mr. Mosher was known for his unflagging support of fellow authors and independent bookstores. His publicity tours usually started at the Galaxy Bookshop in Hardwick, Vt., where he would read from his newest book or give a slide show, which sometimes featured a picture of Mr. Mosher blasting a negative newspaper review with his shotgun. His last appearance at the store, in 2015, attracted such a crowd that it had to be moved to a nearby opera house.\u201cThe real drama and the real entertainment came when he talked about what inspired his books,\u201d Sandy Scott, a co-owner of the bookstore, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s when his personality came out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Close a Gender Gap: Let Employees Control Their Schedules", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen\u2019s WorkThe main reason for the gender gaps at work \u2014 why women are paid less, why they\u2019re less likely to reach the top levels of companies, and why they\u2019re more likely to stop working after having children \u2014 is employers\u2019 expectation that people spend long hours at their desks, research has shown.It\u2019s especially difficult for women because they have disproportionate responsibility for caregiving.A new job search company, Werk, is trying to address the problem by negotiating for flexibility with employers before posting jobs, so employees don\u2019t have to.Another option gives workers the freedom to adjust their schedules, no questions asked, because of unpredictable obligations, like a sleepless night with a toddler or a trip to the emergency room with an older parent.\u201cNobody wants to be the female in the department who says, \u2018My kid threw up on me this morning; I can\u2019t come in,\u2019 \u201d said Annie Dean, who worked as a lawyer before starting Werk with Anna Auerbach, a former consultant. \u201cEighty percent of companies say they offer flexibility, but it\u2019s a black market topic. You raise it and you\u2019re not taken seriously.\u201dFor now, Werk is a limited experiment. Most of the employers are small companies, and it is aimed at an elite group of women \u2014 highly educated and on a leadership track. But it could provide lessons for how to improve work and make it more equal for a broader group.Women who have less education or are paid hourly wages have significantly less flexibility than professional women to begin with. It makes working and caregiving that much harder.Gerard Masci, founder and chief executive of Lowercase, a start-up eyeglass maker in Brooklyn, just hired a vice president for communications on Werk. She works part-time and remotely, except for monthly in-person meetings. \u201cI don\u2019t care if this week you work less if in a month you work more, and whether they work in the space or not is irrelevant,\u201d Mr. Masci said. \u201cAll I care about is the productivity in the end.\u201d\u201cThe happier she is in her flexibility,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more engaged she\u2019s going to be in her work.\u201dErin Fahs turned to Werk after her husband was transferred to Fort Myers, Fla., and she needed to find a new job. She wanted to work part time and from home because she was pregnant and the primary caregiver for their 2-year-old daughter. She found three jobs on Werk that would let her do that, and took one as the business manager for the Collective Good, which does consulting for nonprofits.\u201cGetting to have those direct conversations with the C.E.O. about what matters made it so much different from when I was applying for jobs earlier in my career,\u201d Ms. Fahs, 33, said.She has a baby sitter 10 hours a week and works the other 10 hours when her daughter is sleeping. She has a few set meetings, which she attends via Google Hangouts \u2014 and gives her daughter an iPad for a diversion if there is a work emergency. She plans to expand to full-time work after maternity leave.\u201cThere are a vast number of jobs that could be handled in an own-your-schedule way, but it\u2019s just easier to measure performance by presence,\u201d said Anne-Marie Slaughter, the chief executive of the think tank New America, who has written about gender and work and advises Werk. \u201cSo it is a real adjustment for managers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But he said it had accredited news operations in Cambodia, where it has 25 reporters, as well as in Hong Kong and in Myanmar.In a speech on Monday in Phnom Penh, the capital, Mr. Hun Sen appeared to liken his views on the news media to those of Mr. Trump.In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Phay Siphan said that Cambodia had not taken any specific retaliatory actions against foreign news organizations. \u201cWe have no intention to expel anyone,\u201d he said.But he also urged the organizations to stay on the \u201cright track\u201d and said that he planned to monitor their reports to ensure that they did not violate Cambodia\u2019s criminal code.Jay R. Raman, a public affairs officer at the United States Embassy in Phnom Penh, referred a request for comment on Mr. Phay Siphan\u2019s Facebook post to the Cambodian government.\u201cThe United States has long supported freedom of the press and considers it to be fundamental to any democracy,\u201d Mr. Raman said.Son Chhay, the parliamentary whip for the Cambodia National Rescue Party, said he saw Mr. Phay Siphan\u2019s warning to the news media as part of that broader effort. \u201cThe public is on the opposition\u2019s side, and it worries the government a lot,\u201d he said.\u201cThey could be jailed or worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a time in the 1990s when reporters ended up dead with alarming regularity.\u201dNara Lon contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Was Informed 17 Days Ago That Flynn Had Not Been Truthful on Russia", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst 100 Days Briefing\u25a0 Michael T. Flynn\u2019s resignation as national security adviser prompts calls to redouble investigations of Russia contacts.\u25a0 President Trump names Lt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg Jr., a retired Vietnam War veteran, as interim security adviser.\u25a0 The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told the news media that Mr. Trump demanded Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation.Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump was informed 17 days ago by Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, that his national security adviser had not been truthful when he told Vice President Mike Pence that he had not discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador.Mr. Spicer said the president asked Mr. McGahn to then determine whether Mr. Flynn had violated the law. In the end, he said, there was \u201ca violation of trust,\u201d not \u201ca violation of law.\u201d\u201cIt was an evolving and eroding process,\u201d Mr. Spicer said when asked why Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, could say that Mr. Flynn had the president\u2019s full trust on Monday afternoon.Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was the first elected Republican to hit hard on the turmoil in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House, and the continuing questions about Russian influence.\u201cGeneral Flynn\u2019s resignation is a troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus,\u201d said Mr. McCain, who has emerged as one of the few Republican antagonists that Mr. Trump has not silenced.\u201cGeneral Flynn\u2019s resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration\u2019s intentions toward Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies and attempted interference in American elections,\u201d he continued.A day after Facebook posts came to light showing deliberations over North Korea in the public dining hall of the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump is up in arms about loose national security controls.Illegal leaks are, of course, a growing concern for Mr. Trump, since they portray him as running a White House that from the outside at least appears to be spinning out of control. For Mr. Trump, however, the imperative is to focus attention on anything but Russia.As scandal swirled around Mr. Trump\u2019s new White House, Republicans in Congress beyond Mr. McCain were almost silent on the resignation of Mr. Flynn and its implications.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin chose to focus on Mr. Flynn\u2019s decision to mislead Mr. Pence on the contents of his conversations with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak.\u201cYou cannot have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday.But Mr. Ryan deflected when asked about calls for congressional inquiries into the episode. \u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudge circumstances surrounding this,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the administration will explain the circumstances that led to this.\u201dHe again praised Mr. Trump, without identifying Mr. Flynn by name. \u201cAs soon as this person lost the president\u2019s trust, the president asked for his resignation,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201cand that was the right thing to do.\u201dIn fact, the Justice Department informed the White House a month ago that Mr. Flynn had not been truthful about his conversations with the ambassador.The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes of California, a Trump loyalist, released one of the few statements from the Republican side of the aisle, and it offered no criticism:\u201cMichael Flynn served in the U.S. military for more than three decades. Washington, D.C., can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn \u2014 who has always been a soldier, not a politician \u2014 deserves America\u2019s gratitude and respect for dedicating so much of his life to strengthening our national security. I thank him for his many years of distinguished service.\u201dSenator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, was no more forthcoming. \u201cMike Flynn served his country with distinction,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe president needs a national security adviser whom he can trust, and I defer to him to decide who best fills that role.\u201dOne exception, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, who threw his not-very-heavy weight behind a bipartisan commission.Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military\u2019s Special Operations Command, told a military conference on Tuesday that the upheavals in Washington are rippling through the American military.\u201cOur government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they sort it out soon because we\u2019re a nation at war.\u201dGeneral Thomas insisted Special Operations forces are \u201cstaying focused\u201d despite all the controversy in Washington.Asked about his comments later, General Thomas said in a brief interview, \u201cAs a commander, I\u2019m concerned our government be as stable as possible.\u201dHave feedback for the White House on Mr. Flynn or really any other matter? No need to hold your tongue.Almost two months after the Obama administration temporarily closed it, Mr. Trump\u2019s staff resuscitated the White House comment line on Monday, and volunteers will now take comments for the president on a routine basis.The line\u2019s closing, during a time of drastic change in the government, spawned consternation among those already wary about the new administration and its commitment to public accountability. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a spokeswoman for the White House, said the closing had been merely a matter of staffing the office that maintains the line.Give it a call at 202-456-1111.Although the White House was warned a month ago that Mr. Flynn had been untruthful about the nature of his contacts with Moscow, he was allowed into security briefings as recently as Monday, Ms. Conway said on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Tuesday.The Justice Department had warned the White House weeks ago that Mr. Flynn\u2019s dissembling put him at risk of blackmail from Russian intelligence, but he was kept by the president\u2019s side.\u201cThat\u2019s one characterization,\u201d Ms. Conway said when confronted with those circumstances.Mr. Flynn\u2019s contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States are not in question, nor is his trip to Moscow to celebrate the Russian propaganda network RT \u2014 sitting next to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 but Moscow said on Tuesday that his resignation was a domestic matter unconnected to the Kremlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With No Frills and No Commissions, Robinhood App Takes On Big Brokerages", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the app\u2019s hype and surging popularity, some industry experts question if the free-trades business model can survive, or if it will wind up joining other start-ups that have crashed and burned. The company currently makes money primarily from interest on customer cash balances.At Robinhood, there is no minimum deposit to register an account, and there are no trading fees for customers who buy and sell United States-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. To keep costs down, the company, in Palo Alto, Calif., takes a no-frills approach. It has no storefront offices. It does not provide research reports, analytical tools, stock screening gizmos or options trading on its platform.\u201cUber opened our eyes that if you could hail a car off your phone and watch movies, why can\u2019t I trade 10 shares of Facebook or a thousand shares?\u201d said Howard Lindzon, a general partner of the Social Leverage Fund and a founder of StockTwits, a financial communications platform. His fund holds an equity stake in Robinhood.Chase Kaye, a 21-year-old Manhattan resident, signed up for Robinhood over a year ago after he grew tired of paying the $7 commission on trades at the Vanguard Group.\u201cThe interface on the phone app is way better,\u201d said Mr. Kaye, a marketing management student at Baruch College. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, not as intimidating and very intuitive.\u201d Today about 70 percent of his assets are with Robinhood, Mr. Kaye said.Still, nothing is truly free in the world of finance.Even the name conjures up images of a firm helping the poor, when it may actually be doing the opposite, he contends.Robinhood\u2019s founders dispute these concerns. Their goal is to make investing accessible to everyone, not just the superwealthy, which is why the name Robinhood was chosen, said Vladimir Tenev, 30, a founder.\u201cWe have active investors who are moving their trading over from other brokerages where they have paid thousands to tens of thousands of dollars in trading commissions,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. \u201cWe also have younger customers who are accumulating stocks and building mini diversified portfolios over time.\u201dA customer could buy one share in a stock or ETF today and five more shares next month to slowly build a portfolio. The fees at larger firms would make such a strategy cost prohibitive. Big brokerage firms like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, Fidelity and E-Trade typically charge $7 to $10 a trade.Robinhood\u2019s bare-bones business model has led to complaints about its customer service, with long waiting times by phone and emails that are not answered. Internet blogs are also filled with complaints about lengthy waits \u2014 up to eight days \u2014 to transfer money from a Robinhood account to a bank or vice versa. Mr. Tenev said the company was looking to solve these problems.And some customers are frustrated that the company doesn\u2019t offer options trading, a website trading platform or automated transfers from other brokerage accounts. Mr. Tenev said that would change. \u201cIf you look down several years, we\u2019ll offer all of these things,\u201d he said.Robinhood is the brainchild of Mr. Tenev and Baiju Prafulkumar Bhatt, Stanford graduates who shared a passion for math and physics. In 2009 they moved to New York, where they began Celeris and Chronos Research, which made high-frequency trading software for hedge funds and banks.Inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, they rethought their priorities. \u201cThe financial services industry should serve all people, regardless of net worth,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. In 2012, they moved back to California, hired engineers and spent the next 18 months building Robinhood.In late 2013, Robinhood set up a beta version and invited people to test the app. When the sign-up page was posted on Hacker News and Reddit, the site was flooded with requests.\u201cWe had almost 50,000 people that signed up that first weekend,\u201d Mr. Bhatt, 32, recalled. By the time the app began in the App Store in late 2014, it had a wait-list of a million people, most under the age of 30.The company has raised $66 million in start-up cash from such high-flying investors as Andreessen Horowitz, GV, Index Ventures and New Enterprise Associates, as well as entertainers like Jared Leto, Snoop Dogg and Nas.In addition to cash balances, the company makes money from \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d which refers to the money it receives for selling its orders to market makers to be executed.\u201cThese revenue streams alone are not enough to sustain an online broker providing $0 trades \u2014 not even close,\u201d said Blain Reinkensmeyer, the head of broker research at StockBrokers.com.Recently, Robinhood introduced a Gold program, which offers margin accounts and after-hours trading, for a fee.\u201cRobinhood Gold is where we anticipate the bulk of the revenues to come from in the future,\u201d Mr. Tenev said. Robinhood charges Gold accounts a fixed monthly fee that works out to 5 to 6 percent interest on margin accounts, whether the customer uses the credit line or not. At larger firms, like Schwab, customers are charged interest only on the margin amount that\u2019s used.\u201cI got the email to sign up for a free month trial of their new Gold account, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in,\u201d Mr. Kaye said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably stay with Vanguard for margin accounts.\u201dAnother firm, Zecco, attempted a similar \u201cfree trades\u201d model in 2006. Despite raising more than $35 million in financing, the company struggled to get off the ground, and eventually merged with TradeKing in 2012. It now charges $4.95 a trade.\u201cZecco couldn\u2019t find a path to profitability without charging for commissions and evolving into a traditional online broker,\u201d Mr. Reinkensmeyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly history is forgotten.\u201dMr. Lindzon, the Robinhood equity investor, noted that Zecco operated when smartphone use was in its infancy.\u201cWith a couple billion people now on smartphones, it\u2019s a very different market today,\u201d said Aaron Levie, a founder of the cloud company Box, and another of Robinhood\u2019s equity investors.Other start-ups have entered the territory to challenge Robinhood. They include Ustocktrade, which charges a $1-a-month membership fee and offers $1 trades, and Loyal3, which offers no-fee trades on a limited number of stocks, partial shares and initial public offerings. There\u2019s also Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Edge, which offers 30 free stock and ETF trades each month for customers with a balance of at least $50,000 and 100 free trades a month on balances of at least $100,000.So far, the big brokerage firms do not appear concerned about Robinhood. Kim Hillyer, a spokesman for TDAmeritrade, said investors value a full-service firm that offers free education, webinars, research tools and investment consultants in addition to a full trading platform that includes futures and options. She noted that TDAmeritrade accounts have continued to grow since Robinhood\u2019s introduction, rising to seven million in fiscal 2016 from 6.3 million in 2014. \u201cThe growth in new accounts is a validation for the value proposition that we have,\u201d she said.Erin Montgomery, a spokeswoman for Schwab, agreed. \u201cWe know that investors and traders alike are looking for value from their brokerage firms, and our clients find that here,\u201d she said. The firm\u2019s investment services and products include financial planning and research as well as a full trading platform and commission-free ETFs.Still, the two firms said they are always looking for ways to stay competitive, and sometimes offer low-fee and no-fee trading promotions.Advertisement"}

Melania Trump Wouldn\u2019t Be the First to Claim That Title", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeing first lady is technically a job without any official responsibilities, if you don\u2019t count the expectations of the president, his staff, American voters and a few thousand journalists.But, like her husband, Melania Trump has shown that she is willing to defy what is expected of her.This week, Mrs. Trump returned to Washington from New York City for the first time since her husband\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, and has indicated that she and the couple\u2019s son, Barron, will not move into the White House until the end of the school year (at the earliest).That Mrs. Trump may have a somewhat skeptical view of life in Washington doesn\u2019t come as a total surprise to professors, writers and museum curators who study first ladies, with some saying she is in the company of several predecessors who took time to find their footing.The elder Mrs. Adams \u201cthought that the new Mrs. Adams might be a little too fine a lady to be an American politician\u2019s wife,\u201d Ms. Graddy, the curator, said. \u201cLouisa had to prove her mettle to her mother-in-law.\u201dMrs. Truman\u2019s theory was that \u201cshe was not the one that had been elected,\u201d Ms. Graddy said. \u201cTherefore the public only had a certain amount of time that they could expect from her.\u201d\u201cEven people who can recall the Nixon presidency probably can\u2019t remember the sound of her voice,\u201d Ms. Jellison said. \u201cShe would have preferred a very different kind of life.\u201dWhen it comes to Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Kennedy, the comparisons don\u2019t stop at fashion. Ms. Jellison said that Mrs. Kennedy embraced the role of first lady but tended to be fiercely protective of her and her children\u2019s privacy.\u201cI think that she wanted some of the celebrity that went along with being first lady,\u201d Ms. Jellison said. \u201cBut she wanted it on her own terms, and wanted to be able to control her public image to a greater extent than what was possible.\u201d\u201cThere really is a driving, persistent narrative that is just going to shoehorn Melania Trump as the new Jackie Kennedy,\u201d Mr. Sferrazza Anthony said. \u201cJackie Kennedy was a student of history.\u201dMr. Sferrazza Anthony also summed up Mrs. Trump\u2019s credentials: \u201cShe is a very beautiful and, I think, intelligent mother of a 10-year-old-son.\u201dFirst ladies have always struggled with the demands of the president\u2019s office, though some early examples were women who dealt with illness and death rather than the media glare that accompanies a modern presidency.\u201cShe remained in mourning throughout her husband\u2019s presidency and really would have wanted to be anywhere other than the White House,\u201d Ms. Jellison said.Less than a decade later, Eliza Johnson, the wife of President Andrew Johnson, became first lady after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.\u201cShe suffered through tuberculosis,\u201d Ms. Jellison said, \u201cand made exactly two public appearances during her husband\u2019s presidency.\u201dMrs. Trump has shown signs that she is interested in hiring East Wing staff members who can connect her with the Washington establishment, but her life, at the moment, remains firmly planted in New York.\u201cRegardless of what her husband says or has done and regardless of how he perceives women\u2019s roles, she\u2019s making an unspoken statement of her own feminism,\u201d Mr. Sferrazza Anthony said.\u201cIt\u2019s just an impossible position,\u201d Ms. Andersen Brower said. \u201cIn some ways, maybe Melania is redefining it so that expectations are kind of less unfair.\u201d\u201cShe was a very private person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was always the highest quality that you\u2019ll ever find, and the things they say are so unfair.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The garment industry itself was built by immigrants, Ms. Mallis noted of a business that continues to be one of the city\u2019s top economic drivers.36 PhotosWearing dazed expressions that made some look as though they had forgotten to take their meds, an array of street-cast models paraded around a Chelsea showroom. The coats they wore were adapted from utility blankets slung over multiple layers. One model wore a denim jacket pulled over a woolen coat squeezed atop a nubby Aran Island fisherman\u2019s sweater that was tucked into a pair of the baggy pants that have been all the rage in Tokyo for a while now and that are slowly making inroads in the West. Still another jacket was knotted at the neck like a scarf.Editorial writers, homeless advocates and moralists in general seized on that show as proof that fashion and its narcissistic practitioners are hopelessly disconnected from the real world. Yet what those who are quick to deride it often forget is that the glass of fashion is mostly a reflective device.The N. Hoolywood collection could also be judged insensitive. Yet it served as a reminder of an often invisible population \u2014 one that, in light of recent studies showing that in almost no place in the United States can a person working a 40-hour week at minimum wage afford a one-bedroom apartment at fair market rent, seems destined to increase.The moody, elliptical O\u2019Hara poem was recited at the show by the Tony Award-winning actor Alex Sharp to a room full of guests eager to welcome Mr. Reid on his return to the New York fashion fold. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be here,\u201d the designer said to the crowd, referring to a period when he sat out the show cycle.And if it is good, indeed, to have the genial Southerner around again, that has less to do with the largely generic designs he presented in a collection inspired, he said, by the Beats (though some elements were more reminiscent of the stuff he used to design for the golfer Greg Norman) than because of his steady and grounding presence in a sometimes shaky industry.Also, he gives a good party. For the last eight summers, Mr. Reid has staged a festival of music, food, drinks and fashion in Florence, Ala., and on Monday, he gathered around him friends from many realms, including the musicians Winston Marshall and the Watson Twins. \u201cConceptually, it\u2019s about people sharing their talents and inspiring each other,\u201d Mr. Reid said.He also brought in the blues musician Cedric Burnside to offer his rendition of \u201cLove Her \u2019Til I Die,\u201d along with Karen Elson, the luminous British model turned Nashville singer, who took to a microphone with a tune from her new album, \u201cDouble Roses,\u201d as models of both sexes ambled through the crowd.Even without the abundant bourbon, Mr. Reid\u2019s show would surely have had the loose, homey quality of a party you hope will keep going. In this case it did. When it ended, the subterranean space at the Beekman became the \u201cSpeakeasy,\u201d and those who didn\u2019t have an early call the next morning stayed on, dancing to the music of a jazz band, Billy and the Rock Bottoms, and a D.J. set by Mr. Marshall.\u201cI wanted to embody the roots of what all that came from,\u201d Mr. Aoki said in an interview Monday morning at the Roxy Hotel, referring to the punk music he listened to during his college days at the University of California, Santa Barbara.By Mr. Aoki\u2019s reckoning, the lineage of the punk musicians he worshiped (\u201cI almost fell to my knees when I met Jello Biafra,\u201d he said of the Dead Kennedys singer) began with an \u201cupstart hippie movement\u201d that had its counterculture origins in the Beats.20 Photos\u201cMusic is my breadwinner, but fashion is my creative outlet,\u201d said Mr. Aoki, who, in an attempt to be disruptive (though \u201cnot obvious\u201d), used quotes from and images of William S.

{"Headline": "Uber C.E.O. to Leave Trump Advisory Council After Criticism", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Travis Kalanick needed everyone to take a deep breath.The chief executive of Uber was holding a regularly scheduled all-hands meeting on Tuesday at the ride-hailing company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters when he faced an onslaught of questions from upset employees.\u201cWhat would it take for you to quit the economic council?\u201d at least two employees asked at the Tuesday meeting.On Thursday, Mr. Kalanick gave his answer, stepping down from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory council. \u201cThere are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,\u201d Mr. Kalanick wrote in an email to employees obtained by The New York Times.Outside of the internal pressure, Uber faced other fallout from Mr. Kalanick\u2019s stance. More than 200,000 customers had deleted their accounts.In addition, Uber rivals had seized the moment to attack the company and bolster their own businesses. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance sent emails to the news media calling attention to Uber\u2019s ties to Mr. Trump, and organized a protest at Uber\u2019s New York office for Thursday. Lyft, another ride-hailing service, pledged to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union and has seen its app shoot toward the top of the download charts.Uber drivers, many of them immigrants who work for the ride-hailing company on a freelance basis, were also upset.Email from Travis Kalanick, chief of Uber, announcing that he was stepping down from President Trump\u2019s economic advisory council.Uber has set aside $3 million for a legal-defense fund to support drivers, offering help with translation services and round-the-clock telephone access to legal aid.For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was especially fraught. Other corporate chiefs, including Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX, and Mary Barra of General Motors, are also on the president\u2019s economic advisory team. Mr. Musk said on Twitter this week that the group of economic advisers planned to come to some sort of \u201cconsensus\u201d on immigration, and to influence Mr. Trump by engaging directly with him rather than cutting off ties completely.Internally, Uber staff members also began piling on the pressure. According to nearly a dozen current and former Uber engineers and product managers who attended or were briefed on the Tuesday all-hands meeting, employees said they were concerned that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s willingness to work with Mr. Trump after the immigration order would color Uber as a soulless company that cared only about its bottom line.Some told Mr. Kalanick that they had suffered a personal cost \u2014 a stigma, they said \u2014 of working at Uber. One staff member asked him to present the benefits of working at Uber that could outweigh that personal cost.Mr. Kalanick replied that he believed that change could be best effected through engagement, and through the work they did every single day.Many employees were not satisfied with his answer. On Wednesday, Uber staff members followed up by circulating a 25-page Google document titled \u201cLetters to Travis\u201d to tell the chief executive how and why his willingness to engage with the administration had affected them.By Thursday morning, Mr. Kalanick had reversed his position on engaging with Mr. Trump. His participation in the economic advisory council had created what he called a \u201cperception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are.\u201dIn his email to employees, he said his participation was being interpreted as a sign that he had endorsed the president and the administration\u2019s agenda. In fact, Mr. Kalanick said, the immigration order was hurting many people across America.\u201cImmigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country\u2019s success and quite honestly to Uber\u2019s,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Kalanick said he had spoken briefly with Mr. Trump to let him know he was withdrawing from the advisory council.\u201cPlease know, your questions and stories on Tuesday, along with what I heard from drivers, have kept me resilient and reminded me of one of our most essential cultural values, Be Yourself,\u201d Mr. Kalanick wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren Persists", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a dark and dismal time for American liberals. Except for the part where the opposition keeps shooting itself in the foot.We will now pause to contemplate the fact that this week the Senate Republicans attempted to forward their agenda by silencing Elizabeth Warren while she was reading a letter from Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s widow.In explanation, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell basically called Warren a pushy girl.Talk about the gift that keeps on giving. Never has a political party reached such a pinnacle of success, and then instantly begun using it to inspire the opposition.We\u2019re less than three weeks into the Trump administration, and almost every day the people in power stop delivering the message of the day and veer off into a Strange Tale.Which do you think the Democrats found most empowering \u2014 Trump\u2019s first full day in the White House, when he marched off to the C.I.A. to deliver a rambling tirade about the inauguration crowd size? The Holocaust Remembrance Day proclamation that eliminated any reference to the Jews? Or the new Supreme Court nominee saying the president who named him was being \u201cdemoralizing\u201d and \u201cdisheartening\u201d?Or this Senate-silencing moment? The subject at hand was the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general. The debate was going to be endless. It was evening and nobody was listening. Warren was taking her turn and reading a letter Coretta Scott King wrote about Sessions in 1986.That was when Sessions was rejected for a federal judgeship on the basis of an impressive record of racial insensitivity as a U.S. attorney in Alabama. The charges included referring to a black assistant U.S. attorney as \u201cboy,\u201d joking about the Ku Klux Klan and referring to the N.A.A.C.P. as \u201cun-American.\u201dHis supporters say he\u2019s changed. Indeed, Sessions has evolved into a senator who is well liked by his peers and obsessed with illegal immigrants. Totally different person.Mrs. King\u2019s letter was not flattering. (\u201c\u2026has used the awesome power of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.\u201d) Neither were the quotes Warren read from the late Senator Edward Kennedy (\u201ca disgrace\u201d). But none of it was exactly a surprise, and all of Washington knew the nomination was eventually going to pass. Yet McConnell decided to shut down Warren, claiming she had \u201cimpugned the motives and conduct\u201d of a fellow senator.McConnell cited Rule 19, which is more than a century old. It comes up about once a generation, when somebody calls a colleague an idiot or a liar. But this was totally different. The other senators were startled \u2014 or would have been if most of them had not been napping or back in their offices, dialing up donors.\u201cShe was warned,\u201d McConnell said later. \u201cShe was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\u201dWow, nothing worse than a woman who won\u2019t stop talking.\u201cThey were waiting to Rule 19 someone and they specifically targeted Elizabeth,\u201d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. \u201cI think because she\u2019s effective.\u201dThe social media exploded. You have to admit we live in wondrous times, people. There was a day when people only took to Facebook to post pictures of their vacation. On Wednesday they were pouring in to watch Elizabeth Warren read her forbidden letter.Dark and extremely conspiratorial minds suggested the whole thing was a Republican plot to promote Warren as a presidential candidate, since they believe Trump could defeat her in 2020. This presumes that McConnell is suffering from a pathological case of advance planning.More likely he\u2019s simply exhausted from dealing with a White House occupant who\u2019s managed, just this week, to accuse the media of not covering terrorism, to suggest that George W. Bush was more of a killer than Vladimir Putin, and to use the official presidential account to tweet an attack on Nordstrom\u2019s for discontinuing his daughter\u2019s fashion line.And the Republicans in Congress can\u2019t figure out how to work around him. The other day the House majority refused to approve a Democratic resolution affirming \u201cthat the Nazi regime targeted the Jewish people in its perpetuation of the Holocaust.\u201d It obviously was an attempt to remind people of that Holocaust Memorial Week debacle. But still.\u201cThey\u2019re definitely squirming,\u201d said Representative Joe Crowley, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus, in a phone interview. Crowley was on his way to Baltimore for a party strategy conference. I believe I speak for a great many Americans when I say a strategy would be a very good thing.The Democrats are immersed in an ongoing battle between centrists and progressives and a long way from coming up with a united message. \u201cThere\u2019s still anger and a bit of depression, but \u2026 they\u2019re giving us incredible fodder to use against them,\u201d Crowley said.It\u2019s true. Always look for a silver lining. Or at least a little fodder. Keep talking, Elizabeth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 21 Questions You\u2019re Going to Need to Ask About Investment Fees", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneySo much hand-wringing over such a simple proposition: When a financial professional gives you advice about the life savings in your retirement account, that person ought to act in your best interest.But let\u2019s put the focus back where it belongs: not on politics or the law, but on you. The best way to understand what the fiduciary debate is about \u2014 and to protect yourself \u2014 is to view this discussion through the lens of fees.Every time you do business with people in the financial services industry, ask them this: How much money are you making, and what are the different ways you are making it?If only there were a simple answer to this question all of the time. All of this fiduciary wrangling got started in large part because there has rarely been a simple answer in many parts of the industry.When seeking advice on your life savings, presumably you would want to speak to the nutritionists and not the butchers. But the butchers of the financial world are in a pretty good spot right now. After all, we have just seen eight years of stock market gains. With an unpredictable new president in the White House, people have reason to be wary.So enter the annuity peddlers, and others touting safety, protections from downside risk, guarantees and the possibility of participating in future market gains, too. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? The way these salespeople sold those products during the last downturn was a big part of what pushed the proponents of the fiduciary rule to act.You will be seeing these pitches soon enough, and when you do, there is a long list of questions you must ask. In fact, anytime anyone is trying to sell you an actively managed mutual fund, a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that you don\u2019t understand or anything else even remotely confusing, hit them with each and every one of the following questions:How much money will you personally make in cash commission, now, if I select this product? And how much will you make later, in any sort of ongoing or trailing commission?Is there a bonus you are eligible for that comes as a result of your recruitment to this firm? Is it in jeopardy if you don\u2019t make this sale?Are you earning more from selling me this product than you might from putting me in a similar product from a different company? Are you earning more than you might if you put me in a different vehicle from the same company?The annuity provider, Allianz, told me that a thorough search of its records did not yield information that confirmed Mr. Dunston\u2019s story, but Mr. Dunston said that it may have been a third party that ran the incentive program, and that he is certain he earned those points and that spiffy ring through Allianz. \u201cYou can see why advisers might be conflicted about offering something like this versus a low-cost index fund,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I really thought I was doing the right thing at the time.\u201dMore questions! Do you get to eat lots of free food? Mr. Rush, the Greensboro planner, well remembers all of the so-called plate-licker seminars he once attended at Ruth\u2019s Chris, the steak house chain, courtesy of various financial services companies.How about hoops tickets in basketball-mad parts of the country? \u201cThere were certainly people who could provide Carolina or Duke seats,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew who to call. They weren\u2019t going to be putting you up in the nosebleed seats either.\u201dThen, there is some nitty-gritty. You will be offered all sorts of product features and extras, and you will need to ask the following questions:How much extra will I pay in fees (or how much might I sacrifice in returns or payouts) if I elect to receive a sign-up bonus on my annuity? Or for a guaranteed minimum income or benefit if I elect to take my money in monthly payments starting at some later date? What if I want a death benefit for my heirs? Are there specific charges for the insurance component of the product? Are there any penalties for pulling my money out early?As for any subaccounts in my annuity, are there expense ratios or fees for the money there? A separate management fee? Trading fees? A record-keeping or other administrative fee? Please provide me an itemized list for any and all fees, thank you!Finally, does your firm stand to collect any fees that you yourself will not share in as part of your commission because they have favored one product or another or limited their platform to certain products and locked out others?Whatever happens, however, so much will hinge on squishy terms like suitability, best interests, the reasonableness of fees, legal exceptions to any and all standards and whoever is adjudicating any disputes.Rather than get caught up in all of that, it\u2019s probably best to protect yourself from the outset. And in an industry that makes a game of hiding lots and lots of fees every which way, the best possible response is to ask lots and lots of questions.Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

They may get tax credits for child care costs, their companies may be allowed to repatriate foreign profits, and their coming income tax cuts might fund a luxury vacation or two.\u201cSilicon Valley is unlikely, as a phenomenon \u2014 it is not the default state of the world,\u201d said John Collison, an immigrant from Ireland who is a co-founder of Stripe, a six-year-old payments start-up based in San Francisco.One important reason Silicon Valley can exist at all, he said, is that it is welcoming to people from far outside its borders. \u201cI go all across the world, and every other place is asking, \u2018How do we replicate Silicon Valley where we are \u2014 in London, in Paris, in Singapore, in Australia?\u2019\u201dThe reason those places have so far failed to create their own indomitable tech hubs is that everyone there wants to come here.\u201cThe U.S. is sucking up all the talent from all across the world,\u201d Mr. Collison said. \u201cLook at all the leading technology companies globally, and look at how overrepresented the United States is. That\u2019s not a normal state of affairs. That\u2019s because we have managed to create this engine where the best and the brightest from around the world are coming to Silicon Valley.\u201dBut, Mr. Collison added, \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of fragile.\u201d Under Mr. Trump, the immigrant-friendly dynamic could change \u2014 and it could bring about the ruin of American tech.And yet even a casual trip through most histories of the technology industry reveals an outsize role played by immigrants.Collectively, these companies, which include householdish names like Uber, Tesla and Palantir, had created thousands of jobs and added billions of dollars to the American economy. Their founders came from all over the world \u2014 India, Britain, Canada, Israel and China, among lots and lots of other points around the globe.That should come as no surprise if you are familiar with the origins of the most iconic companies of the last few decades. One of Google\u2019s founders is an immigrant from Russia, and its current chief executive is an immigrant from India. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive is also from India. EBay and Yahoo were started by immigrants. Facebook\u2019s largest subsidiaries, Instagram and WhatsApp, were both co-founded by immigrants. Apple was started by a child of immigrants.But if that criticism rings true in some parts of the tech industry, it misses the picture among Silicon Valley\u2019s top companies. One common misperception of Silicon Valley is that it operates like a factory; in that view, tech companies can hire just about anyone from anywhere in the world to fill a particular role.But today\u2019s most ambitious tech companies are not like factories. They\u2019re more like athletic teams. They\u2019re looking for the LeBrons and Bradys \u2014 the best people in the world to come up with some brand-new, never-before-seen widget, to completely reimagine what widgets should do in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s not about adding tens or hundreds of thousands of people into manufacturing plants,\u201d said Aaron Levie, the co-founder and chief executive of the cloud-storage company Box. \u201cIt\u2019s about the couple ideas that are going to be invented that are going to change everything.\u201dIf you look at some of the most consequential ideas in tech, you find an unusual number that were developed by immigrants. For instance, Google\u2019s entire advertising business \u2014 that is, the basis for the vast majority of its revenues and profits, the engine that allows it to hire thousands of people in the United States \u2014 was created by three immigrants: Salar Kamangar and Omid Kordestani, who came to the United States from Iran, and Eric Veach, from Canada.But it\u2019s not just a numbers thing. Another reason immigrants do so well in tech is that people from outside bring new perspectives that lead to new ideas.Mike Krieger, an immigrant from Brazil who is a co-founder of Instagram, the photo-based social network app, said one reason it found instant, international success was that he purposely eliminated most text from the app. He knew from growing up in Brazil that English would hinder adoption in most parts of the world.\u201cEvery step of the way while we were creating it,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were thinking, can you create something with international appeal?\u201dMr. Collison, of Stripe, said he could not imagine creating a company without immigrants. \u201cIn the early stages of a start-up you usually have a very specific set of things you need to do, and there\u2019s a very short list of people who are able to do them,\u201d he said.In its early years, Stripe needed engineers and executives to build its system for moving money around the world; it needed to create a novel machine-learning system to detect fraud; and it had to convince regulators and other businesses that it was safe and legal to process payments through Stripe. The people it found for all these roles happened to be immigrants.\u201cThe fact that we can do that in Silicon Valley \u2014 the fact that the talent is here or that we can bring the talent here, that\u2019s what makes the whole thing work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Since When Is Being a Woman a Liberal Cause?", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWho gets to define what it means to be pro-women? The left has staked its claim. The public face of resistance to President Trump began with a \u201cwomen\u2019s march.\u201d An estimated three to five million turned out worldwide, brandishing signs like \u201cWomen\u2019s Rights Are Not Up for Grabs\u201d to deliver the message that to be a woman was to be against this president.Now the same groups that organized the march are proposing a general strike \u2014 \u201ca day without a woman\u201d \u2014 to show that women continue to oppose him and that the world would be lost without them.The leaders of these protests argue that women\u2019s causes \u2014 abortion, contraception, economic equality, immigration, criminal justice \u2014 essentially demand liberal solutions.That leaves conservative women \u2014 those who support the president and those who don\u2019t \u2014 out. Their opponents claim to represent the best interests of an entire gender, one that happens to be theirs.Cleta Mitchell, a partner at the law firm Foley & Lardner who has long been active in conservative politics, finds nothing but hypocrisy on the part of women who claim to speak on her behalf.\u201cThis women\u2019s march, I kept thinking, so what are we? Chopped liver?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re invisible when it comes to talking about women. These women don\u2019t represent me or anyone I know. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say his comments hurt the Republican Party image any more than Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior tarnished the Democratic Party.\u201dThe early days of the Trump administration have provided ammunition to Democrats who have long tried to brand Republicans as anti-women. Mr. Trump immediately reinstated the \u201cgag rule\u201d denying federal funds to overseas organizations that include abortion as part of family planning services. His cabinet has the highest number of white men since Ronald Reagan\u2019s. And the now infamous silencing of Elizabeth Warren coined a new rallying cry: \u201cShe Persisted.\u201dMary Matalin, the veteran Republican strategist who switched her party affiliation to Libertarian last spring, believes any attempt to brand the Republican Party as anti-women will fail. Hillary Clinton\u2019s repeated attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s misogyny did not sway independents and moderate Republicans to reject him, for example. Of women who voted for him, 78 percent said they were bothered to some extent by his treatment of women.\u201cThe critical fallacy in the liberal logic of identity politics is that \u2014 demonstrably \u2014 \u2018groups\u2019 don\u2019t think homogeneously; they don\u2019t behave homogeneously,\u201d Ms. Matalin wrote in an email.Republicans, championing individualism, are philosophically wary of allying themselves with identity groups as Democrats have done \u2014 even if critics charge they have sent coded messages to groups such as Southern whites and the white working class.\u201cI guess I would say I\u2019m not someone who thinks in terms of gender,\u201d said Sharon Fraser Toborg, 48. She is raising four children in Barre, Vt., and resents that her choice to stay home despite Ivy League and graduate degrees still draws condescension from many women. She did not back Mr. Trump in the primaries, but preferred him in the end to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m someone who thinks in terms of capabilities, so to me how many men or women are in a particular president\u2019s cabinet, I don\u2019t keep score. I don\u2019t believe only women can understand so-called women\u2019s issues.\u201dThat unease with gender as a unifier exists for those on the right who support Mr. Trump and those who declared themselves Never Trump.Kori Schake, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, joined a group of Republican national security officials in a public letter pledging not to vote for him.\u201cIf you are going to make a sweeping claim of gender opposition to the president, you have to account for those women who voted for him and continue to support him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me a better broader argument to make against the president is to join forces across gender lines, across all manner of lines, and argue for the respect of human dignity.\u201dFor years, conservative women have wrestled with the very idea of feminism. Many refused the label because they saw it as tarnished by association with the left, even as they pursued careers or won prominence in public life.\u201cConservative women say \u2018don\u2019t put me in the feminism bloc\u2019 because somehow it\u2019s emblematic of a whole set of liberal issues that may have nothing to do with promoting women,\u201d Mrs. Mitchell said.Lani Candelora, 39, wrote to The Times in response to a question about who was, or was not, attending the marches. \u201cIt might be a shock to The New York Times, but many American women are feeling hope and joy in the change of administration,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe believe our families will have financial relief, that we\u2019ll have a better chance of everyone finding gainful employment, that we\u2019ll have affordable health insurance again for our families, that our religion will no longer be shunned and persecuted by the presidential administration, that the phony selfish feminism promoted by this women\u2019s march is not continuously projected onto millions of other women who strongly disagree.\u201dYet for some conservative women \u2014 a minority, election results show \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior was a breaking point.\u201cI didn\u2019t see men on the right standing up to men like that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a wake-up call for me. I think women should be taking away the message from the Republican Party that they\u2019re not going to stand with women.\u201dShe now considers herself an independent and does not rule out voting Democratic in the next election. \u201cI hope they reach back and speak to us as well,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us are politically homeless right now.\u201dAbortion is, for many, a key sticking point, dividing women who might otherwise find common ground. There are issues that have unified women across the aisle \u2014 sex trafficking is one; some aspects of criminal justice have the potential to be another.Sabrina Schaeffer, executive director of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, which advocates conservative approaches to policies that affect women, said there is bipartisan concern that mass incarceration policies destroy families and communities. And Ms. Schaeffer, without directly mentioning his name, seemed to echo liberal women\u2019s discomfort with this president when she said: \u201cMost of us would like to see people in public office who speak well of women and who treat women well. Unfortunately, there are people are both sides of the aisle who don\u2019t do that, and that\u2019s a shame.\u201dThe conservative vision of pro-women policies emphasizes free-market solutions and small government. That means the women\u2019s forum opposes mandatory paid maternity leave \u2014 a policy Ivanka Trump pushed for during her father\u2019s campaign \u2014 because it believes that will result in fewer jobs and lower take-home pay.Mrs. Mitchell, like other conservatives, rejects what she sees as feminism\u2019s emphasis on women as victims. \u201cWhat is the right they don\u2019t think we have?\u201d she said. \u201cI remember when we were fighting to change statutes, when women couldn\u2019t serve on juries. It\u2019s almost as if we are not allowed to claim victory.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese-Indonesian Governor\u2019s Struggles Worry Some in His Ethnic Group", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 It was Chinese New Year, which at Ryan Gozali\u2019s household usually involves eating an elaborate banquet while younger relatives are nagged about when they\u2019re getting married.But Mr. Gozali, 33 years old and unmarried, was off the hook this year. The family instead spent New Year\u2019s glued to the television, watching Basuki Purnama, Jakarta\u2019s ethnically Chinese governor, debating his opponents ahead of the election on Wednesday.When Mr. Basuki landed a jab at an opponent who had accused him of disrespecting Islam, the family let out a cheer.The race for governor of Jakarta has consumed Indonesia\u2019s ethnic Chinese, who are divided about whether Mr. Basuki, known universally by his Hakka Chinese nickname, Ahok, is good or bad for them. Chinese-Indonesians make up between 1 and 4 percent of the population of Indonesia, a majority Muslim nation.Despite that small number, the minority is resented because of its perceived economic success; many of the nation\u2019s wealthiest tycoons are ethnically Chinese.Mr. Basuki, 50, has risen higher than any other Chinese-Indonesian politician since the nation began transitioning to democracy in 1998. He received nationwide attention for exposing corrupt bureaucrats and pushing back against the rise of conservative Islam, including by prohibiting Jakarta public schools from requiring female Muslim students to wear a head scarf.Head scarves worn by some public school children \u201clook like napkins,\u201d Mr. Basuki said last year when announcing this policy, using language that opponents considered inflammatory.\u201cProbably the napkins in my kitchen are better,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moment they leave school and hop on their dad\u2019s motorbike, they tear them off right away.\u201dMr. Gozali, like many younger Chinese-Indonesians, wholeheartedly supports Mr. Basuki.\u201cThere will always be danger for the Chinese community here anyway,\u201d Mr. Gozali said. \u201cWe may as well have our knight in shining armor.\u201d He argued that Islamist politicians were simply looking for an excuse to bring down an effective minority politician.Mr. Gozali acknowledged that some Chinese-Indonesians, especially in the older generation, felt differently. \u201cMy mom\u2019s friend isn\u2019t voting for Ahok because she\u2019s scared Chinese will be made scapegoats again,\u201d he said.Indonesia\u2019s Chinese population has a long history of being persecuted. For three decades during the Suharto years, Chinese-Indonesians were accused of being in league with the Chinese government and forbidden to study at Chinese-language schools or publicly celebrate Chinese holidays.After Suharto, the authoritarian president, fell in 1998, anti-Chinese riots swept cities throughout Sumatra and Java Island, after provocateurs blamed Chinese business interests for Indonesia\u2019s economic crisis.Then a teenager, Mr. Gozali fled to Singapore in the middle of the night, returning to Indonesia in 2011. \u201cI still have an emotional connection to Indonesia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my home no matter what. It\u2019s Ahok who made me believe that again.\u201dBut some Chinese-Indonesians worry that Mr. Basuki\u2019s combative political style is disastrous for their community. Jaya Suprana, 68, a pianist and cultural figure whose father was killed in Indonesia\u2019s 1965 anti-Communist purge, which targeted Chinese-Indonesians, wrote an open letter to Mr. Basuki pleading with him to behave more courteously.\u201cHatred toward Indonesia\u2019s ethnic Chinese hasn\u2019t disappeared,\u201d he wrote, suggesting that Mr. Basuki\u2019s behavior was fanning the flames.In typical fashion, Mr. Basuki denounced Mr. Jaya as having a \u201csecond-class brain,\u201d when the letter was published in 2015.In an email interview, Mr. Jaya joked that he appreciated that the governor had at least \u201cacknowledged that I have a brain even if it\u2019s only a second-class one.\u201d Mr. Jaya wrote that the governor\u2019s \u201ccrude behavior\u201d had the potential \u201cto spark hatred toward everyone who shares Ahok\u2019s ethnicity and religion.\u201dTobias Basuki, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, said one reason that Jakarta\u2019s governor was polarizing was that he freely expressed his Chinese cultural identity, whereas most other Chinese-Indonesian politicians were more discreet.\u201cAhok seems to be trailblazing for younger Chinese-Indonesians,\u201d Mr. Tobias said. \u201cHe\u2019s nationalist while also being Chinese.\u201dIn previous campaigns, Mr. Basuki wore traditional Chinese dress and even referred to ethnic Chinese as being \u201cpork lard-faced\u201d to make light of ethnic differences. \u201cNow, with all the politicking, I\u2019m wondering if that really is the wisest thing,\u201d he added.Complicating things for Chinese-Indonesians here, the governor\u2019s rise has overlapped with China\u2019s growing assertiveness as a Pacific power.Christine Susanna Tjhin, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the fake news might be intended to target Chinese-Indonesians even though a majority \u201care actually quite disconnected from mainland Chinese,\u201d in part because of decades of Suharto government assimilation policies.On the other hand, China\u2019s rise may serve to bolster the security of Chinese-Indonesians. Southeast Asian leaders \u201call need good relations with China for various projects in the region, so they, I would assume, understand the importance of protecting their ethnic Chinese communities,\u201d said Charlotte Setijadi, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.Nonetheless, the drama for Indonesia\u2019s Chinese population appears far from over. Mr. Basuki remains popular with middle-class Jakartans of all ethnicities and has rebounded in the polls since being charged with blasphemy in November. He is facing two charismatic opponents whose camps have fanned Islamist sentiment against him.If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote on Wednesday, a runoff will be held, which could lead to more demonstrations if Mr. Basuki advances. A decision on his blasphemy case isn\u2019t expected until March. If he is convicted he will most likely be required to resign from the governorship and potentially spend years in prison.Mr. Basuki was promoted to governor two years ago after Mr. Joko was elected president, so this is his first time facing election for governor.\u201cI do not want to be compared with Ahok,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI just want to move forward.\u201dBut Mr. Gozali, the entrepreneur whose family supports Mr. Basuki, said the racism unleashed during the campaign would make it difficult to move on if Mr. Basuki lost.A photo of Mr. Gozali showing his support for the governor was recently plucked from his personal Facebook page and spread on the web, with the leading comment saying: \u201cTypical rotten Chinese brain. Bunch of shady immigrants from China with false IDs.\u201d\u201cIts not about Ahok anymore,\u201d Mr. Gozali said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ideological war now. Are we going to be treated as second-class citizens?\u201dAdvertisement"}

What new ones would they add?As the essay reminds us, the specifics are only those as of Jan. 26, when the piece was published \u2014 and \u201cof course, all of these developments are being constantly updated, with regular flurries of news and denials and counterdenials \u2014 a confusing state of affairs that itself would not have surprised Orwell, since he knew the value of such confusion to those in power.\u201dIf President Trump\u2019s first tumultuous weeks have done nothing else, at least they have again made us a nation of readers.As Americans grapple with the unreality of the new administration, George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d has enjoyed a resurgence of interest, becoming a surprise best seller and an invaluable guide to our post-factual world.On his first full day in office Mr. Trump insisted that his inaugural crowd was the largest ever, a baseless boast that will likely set a pattern for his relationship both to the media and to the truth.Mr. Sykes writes that \u201cAll administrations lie, but what we are seeing here is an attack on credibility itself.\u201d Do your students agree with his analysis, and his worry that, in the Orwellian age of Donald Trump, \u201cthe battle over truth is now central to our politics\u201d?__________________Ask Essential Questions Essential questions, as most teachers know, are questions that can be applied far beyond one novel or historical period. The best of them, in fact, are questions with which the world is still grappling.What is power, and how is it gained and used? What constitutes an abuse of power?Can individuals change a society?What are the dangers of government-controlled media?What can citizens do if power is abused by a ruling group or government?How is technology changing our understanding of privacy?What Is more important: our privacy or national security?How do governments balance the rights of individuals with the common good?Why do some individuals take a stand against oppression while others choose to participate in it?_________Apply Quotes from \u201c1984\u201d to the News TodayChallenge your students to choose one or more of the lines below and apply them to life in 2017 in as many ways as they can \u2014 starting, of course, by finding Times articles with which they resonate. (Even if, or maybe especially because, Orwell also once wrote, \u201cEarly in life I had noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper.\u201d)Big Brother is watching you.Double-think means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one\u2019s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.Don\u2019t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed \u2014 if all records told the same tale \u2014 then the lie passed into history and became truth.Until they became conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable \u2014 what then?Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power.The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink.One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.Understand the World of 1944:What was happening when Orwell was writing \u201c1984\u201d?What would it have been like to be read the daily newspaper as the world was at war? What \u201csinister symptoms\u201d that \u201cbring totalitarianism nearer,\u201d as Orwell phrased it in his letter, are hinted at in the headlines? And which headlines from the era are especially resonant in light of things happening in 2017?_________Create Something New to Show the Novel\u2019s Relevance TodayUse ideas from that lesson plan, such as pairing up to write and record podcasts in which one plays an interviewer and the other George Orwell, who answers questions about the novel and reacts to the modern world.Or, consider a few more:_________Debate How Widely This Book Should Be TaughtI have a responsibility \u2014 not to transform every liberal parent\u2019s progeny into a slightly sharper copy or radicalize future voters skeptical of politics, but to shore up their critical faculties, to make them more skilled readers, writers, and thinkers. And to also make them decent, compassionate, alert, engaged truth-seekers, neither callous, fearful Party enablers nor complacent, dead-eyed Proles who poke their iPhones and scoff at memes and chirp their discontent in brief blips of coherence. Bravery is something that people can be taught. Books may be the best teachers for what to do when the fireworks veer too close.Do your students agree?

{"Headline": "20th Century Fox Gives Real Apology for a Fake News Campaign", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the term fake news entered the national lexicon, the advertising world has grappled with its role in inadvertently fueling the spread online of made-up stories about controversial topics.Many of the articles on the sites, which were apparently produced in collaboration with a fake news creator the company declined to identify, were shared by people on Facebook who apparently did not know they were part of a stunt meant to publicize the film \u201cA Cure for Wellness.\u201d\u201cFake news is not a cute or silly subject,\u201d said Susan Credle, global chief creative officer of the ad agency FCB. \u201cWhen you start to tear down media and question what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real, our democracy is threatened.\u201d\u201cI think this is a hot enough subject that most marketers would understand that taking advantage of a vulnerable public is dangerous,\u201d she added.On Thursday, however, 20th Century Fox said, \u201cthe digital campaign was inappropriate on every level, especially given the trust we work to build every day with our consumers.\u201d\u201cIn raising awareness for our films, we do our best to push the boundaries of traditional marketing in order to creatively express our message to consumers,\u201d Dan Berger, a spokesman for the 20th Century Fox movie studio, said in an email to The New York Times. \u201cIn this case, we got it wrong.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe have reviewed our internal approval process and made appropriate changes to ensure that every part of a campaign is elevated to and vetted by management in order to avoid this type of mistake in the future.\u201dThe web addresses for the fake news sites, which previously displayed ads for the movie and cited its plot in articles, now redirect people to the film\u2019s website.\u201cIt\u2019s a very kind of perverse use of a genre that is really counterproductive,\u201d said Richard Edelman, chief executive of the public relations company Edelman. \u201cI don\u2019t think fake news is funny in the least. If people want to have stunts, fine, but one of the great dangers it seems to me at the moment is people can\u2019t differentiate between that which is real and that which is a fake story.\u201dAs of Thursday, it was still possible to copy and paste links to the fake news articles created for the campaign into the search bar on Facebook and to find evidence of people publicly posting them as if they were true. The made-up headlines and publication titles still appear like any other news story in the feed. Others were reposted on partisan websites like Red State Watcher.One woman shared a fake article from the imaginary Houston Leader on Feb. 8, which alleged that President Trump had signed an executive order banning children from vaccines for 90 days. \u201cAt least an acknowledgment that vaccines cause harm,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cThe only safe vaccine is the one not taken.\u201dWhile the Lady Gaga article attributed its false information to \u201can unnamed source, in no way affiliated with the singer\u201d \u2014 a clear red flag \u2014 it also contained real comments the singer made before the performance.Andrew Essex, chief executive of Tribeca Enterprises and a former chief executive of the creative agency Droga5, likened the movie studio\u2019s effort to Orson Welles\u2019s radio broadcast of \u201cThe War of the Worlds,\u201d which was largely told through simulated news bulletins. He praised it as clever, saying it was \u201cnice to see such inventiveness coming from Hollywood rather than Macedonia.\u201d\u201cThe best advertising has to rub up against something; they\u2019re tapping into something happening in the culture right now,\u201d he said. \"There is no moral quandary here because they are not purporting to deceive people with actual news. Anyone with a pulse can see this is actual parody.\u201dOthers in the marketing industry mainly viewed the strategy as ineffective, particularly with consumers who have been fatigued by partisan news.\u201cI\u2019m sure people working on it were thinking, hey, we\u2019ll be super relevant, ride this wave of fake news,\u201d said Rob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York. \u201cThere\u2019s so much drama out of this administration, and between the manufacturing of fake news and the alternative news, I\u2019m tired of it.\u201dDespite the stunt, \u201cA Cure for Wellness,\u201d which cost roughly $40 million to make, is expected to fall flat at the box office, with projected weekend ticket sales of less than $8 million.Liam Stack and Brooks Barnes contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Something Rotten in East Egg? After Historic House Burns, Locals Wonder", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd there was a house that had quartered Hessian soldiers fighting for the British during the Revolutionary War \u2014 a house owned by an enterprising farmer and weaver who served under George Washington.That house is now a blackened wreck, the casualty of a fire early Sunday that some local preservationists speculate was deliberately set. Fire officials said the blaze was under investigation and the cause had not been determined. No one was injured.\u201cIt was really a great house,\u201d said Mike Scotto, who started the Facebook page. \u201cIt\u2019s something people think about when they think about Port Washington. It\u2019s our heritage for the entire town. Back in the Revolution, most of Long Island was Tories, but this town seceded nine months before the Declaration of Independence. Those guys were out there fighting for our liberties and freedoms.\u201dBut lately the house had been allowed to deteriorate, preservationists said. It had sat empty since 2014, when it was cited for violations that included at least two illegal apartments, a chimney in \u201cdangerous disrepair\u201d and dead trees on the lawn that an inspector described as \u201can eyesore.\u201dVillage records show that Ms. Wu first sought permission to demolish the house and build a replica that Mr. Bain described as \u201ca McMansion.\u201d\u201cThat was turned down because the house was landmarked,\u201d he said.Later, she filed plans to build a second house in the back yard. (Port Washington includes several villages. The one in which the house is situated is Baxter Estates, named for the family that owned the house for more than 150 years.)The village clerk and treasurer, Chrissy Kiernan, said by email on Monday that Ms. Wu and Mr. Levin indicated last week that she had changed her mind about what she wanted to do with the property.\u201cWe were advised to expect an amended proposal to restore and alter, rather than demolish and replace, the structure,\u201d Ms. Kiernan said in the email, adding that before the fire, Ms. Wu\u2019s architect and the village building inspector had made plans to inspect the house on Wednesday. Ms. Wu\u2019s revised application would have then been reviewed by the village Landmark and Preservation Commission. The village mayor, Nora Haagenson, did not return a phone call.The fire broke out after 3 a.m. Sunday. A next-door neighbor, Laura Stulbaum, said she had been awake with a child who had a bad dream. She said she heard something outside. She saw smoke and, worried that a fire could spread to their house, awakened her husband and piled into the car.\u201cMy husband called 911 as we pulled away,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked back through the rearview mirror and the whole house was in flames.\u201dShe said she had watched two men go into the house several nights earlier and had called the police. But Mr. Bain, of the historical society, said he doubted that intruders had started the fire, because it began in the basement. \u201cIf they were going to build a fire to stay warm, they\u2019d build it in one of the three fireplaces,\u201d Mr. Bain said. \u201cYou don\u2019t build it in the basement, because that would kill you.\u201dThe Village of Baxter Estates gave the house landmark status more than 10 years ago, not long after Ms. Wu bought it. It had several claims to fame. One room served as the first local library in the 1890s, and in the 20th century the house was home to such famous residents as the actress Tallulah Bankhead and the architect Addison Mizner, who recast Boca Raton, Fla., with whitewashed stucco and red barrel-tile roofs.But its landmark designation was anchored in an earlier time. The oldest section of the house took shape in the 18th century for an owner who sold it to a man named Oliver Baxter, the first in the long line of a family that farmed the surrounding land until his descendants sold it. Oliver\u2019s son Israel added a large section that became the main part of the house.But Hessians loyal to Britain soon descended on the Baxter house.Lately, the house had become a puzzling stop on walking tours led by the historical society \u2014 it looked so dilapidated, neighbors said. And after the fire, someone left a bouquet of flowers by the front wall and a sign that said, \u201cShame, shame, shame.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a village and the namesake of your village is a homestead with a very rich history going back to the founding of the country,\u201d Mr. Bain said, \u201cthat should be a house that is taken care of, that is looked after. It\u2019s not just an old house. It\u2019s a house with great importance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Small Ohio Town Clamors to Curb Aggressive Policing", "Date": "2017-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio \u2014 The scene was an all-too-familiar one on the streets of America\u2019s cities: a black suspect on the ground, roughed up by white police officers as an angry crowd looked on.But Yellow Springs is a tiny, predominantly white village, and the arrest at the annual New Year\u2019s street celebration was an awakening to many who live here.Dozens of residents criticized the police force on Facebook, accusing officers of carrying an \u201cus versus them\u201d attitude. Hundreds packed a gym for a special Village Council meeting to denounce the episode for, among other things, the psychological damage it had on their children. When the police chief, unused to such fury, offered his resignation, the audience cheered.But in the consensus over the need for less aggressive policing, there were subtle differences in perspective: White residents were complaining largely about the officers\u2019 violation of social norms in a laid-back town, while black residents focused on what they saw as a racially biased force that targets them regularly.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would call it a coincidence that out of a majority white crowd, a black man would be the one to get tackled to the ground and Tased,\u201d Mr. Walker said.One challenge, several black residents of Yellow Springs said, is that residents are so extremely liberal-minded that it is hard for them to believe that racism exists here. Village leaders said that complaints about the police had been coming from people of all races and that they were analyzing data to determine whether police stops showed racial bias.\u201cI personally don\u2019t believe that there was racial profiling or anything in town,\u201d said Brian Housh, a councilman who is white and has strongly advocated a police overhaul, citing Black Lives Matter as an influence.Yellow Springs, with about 3,500 residents, is a blue speck in the conservative sea of southwest Ohio. Anchored by Antioch College, a liberal arts school with Unitarian roots, the village long has attracted an intellectual, activist populace. This is one of the few places in the region where black people were allowed to own homes in the mid-20th century, but still, Coretta Scott King, who studied music and education at Antioch, could not find a student teaching position in Yellow Springs because she was black.Its reputation is reflected in the rainbow flags flying along the main street, the fruity incense wafting onto the sidewalk from the local smoke shop and the people perched at sidewalk tables reading titles from a used-book store. While President Trump won the county, Greene, with 60 percent of the vote, Yellow Springs went for Hillary Clinton.As 2016 came to a close, hundreds of residents crowded the main drag downtown, as they do every year, to ring in the new year by watching a disco ball lowered to the pavement.Usually the police allow them to linger for about 45 minutes before walking through the crowd and asking everyone to call it a night, residents said. But this time, they said, officers began clearing the street just eight minutes into the new year. And they did so by driving their cruisers through the crowd, lights flashing and horns buzzing.Tensions quickly rose, and several villagers approached the police vehicles to ask the officers what they were doing. One of those people was David Carlson, 29. The police say a drunken Mr. Carlson, who is black, had been swearing at the officers, threatening them and striking their car. There was no evidence to suggest that Mr. Carlson was being disruptive like that, one of his lawyers, Jon Paul Rion, said. An officer eventually hopped out of his car and slammed Mr. Carlson to the ground. Chaos ensued.Mr. Carlson got away, and officers chased him. One tried to use a Taser on him, and a crowd of mostly white residents tried to shield him. One councilwoman, Marianne MacQueen, 72, who is white, was not arrested that night, but the authorities later charged her with two misdemeanors, saying she interfered with an arrest and obstructed official business. Ms. MacQueen said she had been trying to calm the situation.The police charged Mr. Carlson with felony obstruction and misdemeanor theft, saying that he took an officer\u2019s Taser \u2014 an allegation his lawyers denied. What the police saw as a justified arrest, many witnesses considered unnecessary police escalation. But the scene, so shocking to many of the city\u2019s white residents, was less jarring to African-American residents, who make up a little more than 13 percent of the population.\u201cA majority of the people of color that I talk to are, like, \u2018Yeah, I experience this everywhere I go,\u2019\u201d said Ayanna Madison, 16, a junior at Yellow Springs High School who is black. \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories of this countless times, and it\u2019s not going to change until it happens to the rich kids, until it happens to the white kids, until it happens to the kids whose families control the power in the town or the city.\u201dVillage leaders in Yellow Springs, which is roughly 81 percent white, said one reason they were so shocked by the New Year\u2019s debacle was that they had been taking complaints against the police seriously and had already been working toward making changes.Village officials last year withdrew the Police Department from a countywide task force after residents raised concerns that its tactics unfairly targeted black people.Leaders have tried various measures to connect officers with the community. At each meeting of the village\u2019s Human Relations Commission, for instance, a different officer (there are 11; 10 are white) showed up to introduce him or herself. But those meetings were poorly attended.\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 how do we get them connected in a meaningful way besides these more symbolic kinds of things?\u201d said Karen Wintrow, the president of the Village Council. \u201cI believe that, when I talk to our officers, they do feel a kinship and an affection and a desire to serve this community. I think that they get overwhelmed with some of the negative rhetoric and don\u2019t understand it.\u201dResidents said they used to be able to talk town gossip with their officers, but not anymore, now that most of the officers commute from conservative surrounding towns.Three years ago, a sergeant was disciplined after taking a camera from a white woman filming police activity in front of her house. Last year, an officer was fired after two aggressive episodes \u2014 he shattered the window of a white woman sitting in a parked car and, days later, forced to the ground and handcuffed a white man who appeared \u201cagitated\u201d while walking down the street.Many here said those approaches were unnecessary in a 2.5-square-mile hamlet with a low crime rate.Since the New Year\u2019s episode, proposals for changing the department have included replacing police officers with social workers, providing subsidies for officers to live in the village, and training officers in crisis intervention, implicit bias and the like. The village has named one of its current officers to serve as interim chief while it searches for a permanent replacement.\u201cWe are stepping things up,\u201d Mr. Housh said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be more vigilant and involved.\u201dThere remains ambivalence, however, over the role that race plays in the town\u2019s policing.Some hoped that what happened on New Year\u2019s Day would make issues of race and policing real to those who did not experience them.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough skin in the game when it was going down with folks who were more disadvantaged,\u201d said Dr. F. Stuart Leeds, who is white. \u201cIt\u2019s time to see ourselves as a united community and to express regret for minimizing pain and suffering caused by this type of activity in the past.\u201dFollow John Eligon on Twitter @jeligon.Advertisement"}

She\u2019d decided she did not want to move there anymore.Once upon a time a bridegroom in the United States, an engineer or a banker, would have been a prize catch. This time his location was a handicap. Parents ask worriedly: \u201cIs it safe? The things we are hearing \u2026\u201d The same friend says his sister in Mumbai was planning to visit him this summer but has decided to put it off. An American friend traveling in the northern Indian city of Amritsar says she keeps meeting people who say they want to visit America \u2014 \u201cbut not right now.\u201dWhen I first arrived from India as a student in the early 1990s, America felt terribly alien. On my first night, I stared at the rows of car dealerships lining the main street of my small university town in Southern Illinois. They were closed yet brightly lit, with red, white and blue balloons drifting lazily above the gleaming cars. It was surreal, but it confirmed my idea of America \u2014 a country that always seemed open for business.America was a confusing place. I did not realize that those friendly white-haired ladies inviting lonely students like me to church dinners were also trying to save my heathen soul. I did not understand how dishwashers worked. I could not drive a car. I could barely change a light bulb. I felt singularly ill equipped, but eager to explore.I saw the exhilarating promise of America in the oddest places \u2014 the friendly drag queen with her Long Island iced tea at Two Hearts, the local gay bar; the dollar classics night at the campus movie theater where I watched \u201cBack to the Future\u201d; my messy attempt at a tandoori marinade to jazz up a Thanksgiving turkey. The American dream was not about striking it rich. It was about savoring the possibility of reinvention.Several years later, I left a career in software engineering to become a writer. I do not think I would have had the courage to do that in India. In America, a profligate waste of an education did not seem so outlandish.America was where I lived alone for the first time, in a little studio apartment with a cracked bathtub. America was a place, far away from the watchful eyes of aunts, uncles and neighbors, where it was possible to indulge in curious passions \u2014 bartending classes, poetry groups, quail hunting, sex. There were slurs and snide comments about smelling like curry, but it never crossed my mind that America needed to be made great again, because I had already been seduced by its own conviction in its greatness. Its projection of greatness had always been its most successful export.Growing up in India, we didn\u2019t question the brain drain of our best and brightest (and even our second- and third-bests) to America. It was the natural order of things. President Trump\u2019s new vision for America is suddenly forcing us to reconsider that assumption.It\u2019s too late for Srinivas Kuchibhotla, but somewhere out there young men like him are wondering if the American dream itself can be outsourced.

{"Headline": "WhatsApp\u2019s New Feature Continues Facebook\u2019s Snapchat Mimicry", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since, Facebook and some of its top apps \u2014 including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 have been trying to tap into the explosively popular photo-sharing features pioneered by Snapchat.The latest sign of that came on Monday as WhatsApp, a mobile messaging application used by 1.2 billion people, unveiled a version of its Status feature that takes a significant number of cues from Snapchat. Similar to Snapchat\u2019s Stories feature, WhatsApp\u2019s Status now lets people share images, GIFs and videos as a status update, all of which last for 24 hours before disappearing.Even if imitation is the highest compliment, WhatsApp executives are not admitting it. \u201cWe build things because we really hope people will want to use them even more,\u201d Randall Sarafa, a product manager at WhatsApp, said in an interview about the new version of Status. Avoiding any direct mention of Snapchat, he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t really think about building things for other reasons.\u201dA WhatsApp spokeswoman declined to comment further.A Snapchat spokeswoman declined to comment on the similarities with WhatsApp, and a press officer for Instagram declined to comment beyond past public statements. But the Facebook Messenger spokeswoman Jennifer Hakes said: \u201cIn some ways, the camera is now replacing the keyboard. As more people use Messenger in their everyday lives, we wanted to make it faster, simpler and more fun to send photos and videos \u2014 so we built the new Messenger camera.\u201dFacebook\u2019s emulation of Snapchat has a broader significance in that the network and its apps are moving toward a more visual and interactive form of communication.For years, applications like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter were primarily text-based. Twitter rose to popularity by capitalizing on SMS short-form texts, and the majority of the more than than 50 billion WhatsApp messages sent on a daily basis are text-based.But in 2011, Mr. Spiegel saw a new possibility when he and Bobby Murphy, his Stanford University fraternity brother, founded Snapchat. Their focus was on making it simple to send photos and videos to friends. Making the camera the focus \u2014 unlike competitors, Snapchat makes it the first thing you see after opening the app \u2014 allows people to send images much faster than with other apps, which often require two or three steps to open the camera.How much coordination there is within Facebook and among WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger over how to grapple with Snapchat is unclear. While executives at the company regularly meet with Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to check in and give updates on long-term product strategy, they have said in past interviews that they maintain a level of workplace autonomy.\u201cWe operate in a largely independent way from Facebook,\u201d Mr. Sarafa, of WhatsApp, said in a recent interview.Still, many of the product executives at these companies acknowledge that some of their updates are not entirely original and give credit to Snapchat for creating a new kind of \u201cformat.\u201dIn an interview in August, Kevin Systrom, a founder and the chief executive of Instagram, did not mention Snapchat by name but acknowledged that \u201cother companies deserve all the credit\u201d for popularizing disappearing photos and videos.\u201cThis format unlocks a new version of creativity for us,\u201d Mr. Systrom said. \u201cI think Instagram will be judged by where we go from here and what we make of it in the future.\u201dInstagram\u2019s Stories product \u2014 the Snapchat look-alike \u2014 has since become a hit: More than 150 million people use it daily. In its initial public offering filing, Snap cited the direction of Instagram as a potential risk factor to its own growth.At WhatsApp, the Status feature was originally conceived as a text-based away message, similar to the one in AOL\u2019s Instant Messenger product of the 1990s, which made it easy to let friends know if you were around to text or if you were too busy.The updated Status feature replaces that text with richer multimedia. Now, as with Snapchat\u2019s Stories, WhatsApp users can post photos, videos and GIFs as their status, which lasts for 24 hours before disappearing. WhatsApp users can also send their status updates as messages to individual or multiple friends at once, much the way Snapchat\u2019s messaging system is structured.WhatsApp recognizes that its latest feature may not be completely original. But it still hopes it will bring the app similar success.\u201cObviously we\u2019re all seeing broad adoption of this format across the industry right now,\u201d Mr. Sarafa said. \u201cOur hope is that with this update, people will find new ways to share and consume media on WhatsApp, too.\u201dKatie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Kogelo, where Obama\u2019s father was born, is just 20 miles from the village, which lies close to the banks of Lake Victoria. Abagi told me about the day his town\u2019s fate changed. It happened during the summer, when field officers from an American nonprofit called GiveDirectly paid a visit, making an unbelievable promise: They wanted to give everyone money, no strings attached. \u201cI asked, \u2018Why this village?\u2019\u2009\u201d Abagi recalled, but he never got a clear answer, or one that made much sense to him.The villagers had seen Western aid groups come through before, sure, but nearly all of them brought stuff, not money. And because many of these organizations were religious, their gifts came with moral impositions; I was told that one declined to help a young mother whose child was born out of wedlock, for example. With little sense of who would get what and how and from whom and why, rumors blossomed. One villager heard that GiveDirectly would kidnap children. Some thought that the organization was aligned with the Illuminati, or that it would blight the village with giant snakes, or that it performed blood magic. Others heard that the money was coming from Obama himself.But the confusion faded that unseasonably cool morning in October, when a GiveDirectly team returned to explain themselves during a town meeting. Nearly all of the village\u2019s 220 people crowded into a blue-and-white tent placed near the school building, watching nervously as 13 strangers, a few of them white, sat on plastic chairs opposite them. Lydia Tala, a Kenyan GiveDirectly staff member, got up to address the group in Dholuo. She spoke at a deliberate pace, awaiting a hum and a nod from the crowd before she moved on: These visitors are from GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a nongovernmental organization that is not affiliated with any political party. GiveDirectly is based in the United States. GiveDirectly works with mobile phones. Each person must have his or her own mobile phone, and they must keep their PIN secret. Nobody must involve themselves in criminal activity or terrorism. This went on for nearly two hours. The children were growing restless.Finally, Tala passed the microphone to her colleague, Brian Ouma. \u201cPeople of the village,\u201d he said, \u201care you happy?\u201d\u201cWe are!\u201d they cried in unison.Then he laid out the particulars. \u201cEvery registered person will receive 2,280 shillings\u201d \u2014 about $22 \u2014 \u201ceach and every month. You hear me?\u201d The audience gasped and burst into wild applause. \u201cEvery person we register here will receive the money, I said \u2014 2,280 shillings! Every month. This money, you will get for the next 12 years. How many years?\u201d\u201cTwelve years!\u201dJust like that, with peals of ululation and children breaking into dance in front of the strangers, the whole village was lifted out of extreme poverty. (I have agreed to withhold its name out of concern for the villagers\u2019 safety.) The nonprofit is in the process of registering roughly 40 more villages with a total of 6,000 adult residents, giving those people a guaranteed, 12-year-long, poverty-ending income. An additional 80 villages, with 11,500 residents all together, will receive a two-year basic income. With this initiative, GiveDirectly \u2014 with an office in New York and funded in no small part by Silicon Valley \u2014 is starting the world\u2019s first true test of a universal basic income. The idea is perhaps most in vogue in chilly, left-leaning places, among them Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. But many economists think it might have the most promise in places with poorer populations, like India and sub-Saharan Africa.GiveDirectly wants to show the world that a basic income is a cheap, scalable way to aid the poorest people on the planet. \u201cWe have the resources to eliminate extreme poverty this year,\u201d Michael Faye, a founder of GiveDirectly, told me. But these resources are often misallocated or wasted. His nonprofit wants to upend incumbent charities, offering major donors a platform to push money to the world\u2019s neediest immediately and practically without cost.What happens in this village has the potential to transform foreign-aid institutions, but its effects might also be felt closer to home. A growing crowd, including many of GiveDirectly\u2019s backers in Silicon Valley, are looking at this pilot project not just as a means of charity but also as the groundwork for an argument that a universal basic income might be right for you, me and everyone else around the world too.Silicon Valley has recently become obsessed with basic income for reasons simultaneously generous and self-interested, as a palliative for the societal turbulence its inventions might unleash. Many technologists believe we are living at the precipice of an artificial-intelligence revolution that could vault humanity into a postwork future. In the past few years, artificially intelligent systems have become proficient at a startling number of tasks, from reading cancer scans to piloting a car to summarizing a sports game to translating prose. Any job that can be broken down into discrete, repeatable tasks \u2014 financial analytics, marketing, legal work \u2014 could be automated out of existence.In this vision of the future, our economy could turn into a funhouse-mirror version of itself: extreme income and wealth inequality, rising poverty, mass unemployment, a shrinking prime-age labor force. It would be more George Saunders than George Jetson. But what does this all have to do with a small village in Kenya?A universal basic income has thus far lacked what tech folks might call a proof of concept. There have been a handful of experiments, including ones in Canada, India and Namibia. Finland is sending money to unemployed people, and the Dutch city Utrecht is doing a trial run, too. But no experiment has been truly complete, studying what happens when you give a whole community money for an extended period of time \u2014 when nobody has to worry where his or her next meal is coming from or fear the loss of a job or the birth of a child.And so, the tech industry is getting behind GiveDirectly and other organizations testing the idea out. Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder and briefly the owner of The New Republic, has started a $10 million, two-year initiative to explore the viability of a basic income. (He has also been a major donor to GiveDirectly.) The research wing of Sam Altman\u2019s start-up incubator, Y Combinator, is planning to pass out money to 1,000 families in California and another yet-to-be-determined state. Then there is GiveDirectly itself, which has attracted $24 million in donations for its basic-income effort, including money from founders of Facebook, Instagram, eBay and a number of other Silicon Valley companies. Many donors I spoke with cited their interest in the project as purely philanthropic. But others saw it as a chance to learn more about a universal basic income, a way to prove that it could work and a chance to show people the human face of a hypothetical policy fix.In December, Altman, the 31-year-old president of Y Combinator, spoke at an anti-poverty event hosted by Stanford, the White House and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable institution the Facebook billionaire founded with his wife, Priscilla. Altman discussed the potential for basic income to alleviate poverty, but his speech veered back to the dark questions that hang over all this philanthropy: Is Silicon Valley about to put the world out of work? And if so, do technologists owe the world a solution?\u201cThere have been these moments where we have had these major technology revolutions \u2014 the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, for example \u2014 that have really changed the world in a big way,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the middle or at least on the cusp of another one.\u201dThe idea for the nonprofit came to Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus, who is now a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, when they were graduate students at Harvard. Both were studying development and doing fieldwork overseas, an experience that underlined an Economics 101 lesson: Cash was more valuable to its recipients than the in-kind gifts commonly distributed by aid groups, like food or bed nets or sports equipment. If you\u2019re hungry, you cannot eat a bed net. If your village is suffering from endemic diarrhea, soccer balls won\u2019t be worth much to you. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve been there, it\u2019s hard to imagine doing anything but cash,\u201d Faye told me. \u201cIt\u2019s so deeply uncomfortable to ask someone if they want cash or something else. They look at you like it\u2019s a trick question.\u201dBut at the time, distributing cash aid in a country with little to no banking infrastructure outside major cities would have required an extraordinary amount of manpower, not to mention introducing the risk of robbery and graft. But dirt-cheap mobile phones with pay-as-you-go minutes began flooding into sub-Saharan African markets in the 2000s. Enterprising Ghanaians, Kenyans and Nigerians started to use their minutes as a kind of currency. In 2007, Vodafone and the British Department for International Development together built a system, called M-Pesa, for Kenyans to transfer actual shillings from cellphone to cellphone. An estimated 96 percent of Kenyan households use the system today.Faye and Niehaus \u2014 along with their friends Rohit Wanchoo and Jeremy Shapiro, also graduate students \u2014 thought about setting up a website to raise cash in the United States and send it directly to poor Kenyans. But they never found a nonprofit that would distribute that cash abroad. They decided to do it themselves in 2008. \u201cBecause it was a start-up, and we started in grad school,\u201d Faye said, \u201cwe were open to the idea of it being wrong or failing.\u201dThe following year, Faye traveled to small Kenyan villages during the summer break, offering cash to whoever seemed poor and would take it. (The money, about $5,000, came out of the foursome\u2019s own pockets.) That, surprisingly, worked well enough to give them the confidence to start a threadbare randomized control trial the year they graduated. It found that the recipients, who received an average of $500, saw excellent outcomes: Their children were 42 percent less likely to go a whole day without eating. Domestic-violence rates dropped, and mental health improved.In time, the nonprofit attracted the attention of Silicon Valley and its deep-pocketed young philanthropists. Two Facebook founders gave six-figure donations. Then, in the spring of 2012, Faye went to a friend\u2019s brunch in Brooklyn and met someone working for Google.org, the tech giant\u2019s giving arm. She liked the sound of GiveDirectly and arranged for Faye and Niehaus to give a presentation at Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company ended up contributing $2.4 million.At first, GiveDirectly handed out large lump sums, generally $1,000 spread into three payments over the course of the year. The nonprofit\u2019s field officers would locate low-income villages in Kenya, then find the poorest families in each individual village using a simple asset test (whether a family had a thatched roof or not). The field officers would introduce themselves to the town elders, explain their purpose and return to provide mobile phones and training to recipient families. Then GiveDirectly would push a button and send the money out.The residents of this village had received money in 2013, and it was visibly better off than the basic-income pilot village. Its clearings were filled with mango plantings, its cows sturdy. A small lake on the outskirts had been lined with nets for catching fish. \u201cCould you imagine sitting in an office in London or New York trying to figure out what this village needs?\u201d Bassin said as he admired a well-fed cow tied up by the lakeside. \u201cIt would just be impossible.\u201dPerhaps, but delivering money by M-Pesa has some downsides, too. We visited an older woman named Anjelina Akoth Ngalo, her joints painful and swollen with advanced malaria. Sitting in her thatched-roof hut, she told us that she had received only one payment, not the three that she was promised. She had given her phone to a woman in a nearby village who transferred the money out of it. Ngalo visited the village elder to try to get her money back, but nothing had come of it. She was now destitute, living on about $5 a week. She had not eaten since the day before, and she had run out of malaria medication. (Bassin said that less than 1 percent of recipients experience theft, crime or conflict.)By giving money to some but not all, the organization had unwittingly strained the social fabric of some of these tight-knit tribal communities. One man we visited in a separate village nearby, Nicolus Owuor Otin, had acted as a liaison between the community and the GiveDirectly staff, showing them where different families\u2019 houses were, for instance. For that reason, he said, the other villagers thought he was determining who would get what and threatened to burn his house down.Still, nearly all the recipients described the money as transformative. Fredrick Omondi Auma \u2014 a Burning Spear devotee wearing a Rasta-style hat and bell bottoms when we visited \u2014 had been impoverished, drinking too much, abandoned by his wife and living in a mud hut when GiveDirectly knocked on his door. He used his money to buy a motorbike to give taxi rides. He also started a small business, selling soap, salt and paraffin in a local town center; he bought two cows, one of which had given birth; and he opened a barbershop in the coastal city Mombasa. His income had gone from 600 shillings a week to 2,500 shillings \u2014 roughly $25, a princely sum for the area. His wife had returned. He had even stopped drinking as much. \u201cI used to go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I\u2019d wake up in the bar with 100 shillings,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I wake up at home with 900.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I would be living in an iron-sheet house,\u201d he said, referring to his roof. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d be wearing nice shoes. I didn\u2019t imagine I would have a business, and earnings from it. I didn\u2019t imagine I would be a man who owns cattle.\u201dAll across the villages of western Kenya, it was clear to me just how much aid money was wasted on unnecessary stuff. The villagers had too many jerrycans and water tanks, because a nongovernmental organization kept bringing them. There was a thriving trade in Toms canvas slip-ons: People received them free from NGO workers and then turned around and sold them in the market centers. And none of the aid groups that had visited the villages managed to help the very poorest families.In the pilot-project village, for example, Faye and I paid a visit to a woman named Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo, who lives in a mud hut on the edge of town with her husband, Jack, a laborer, and her two small children. The most expensive thing she ever bought, she told me, was a chicken for 500 shillings, or about $5. Her family was persistently hungry. She knew of three nonprofit groups that had helped the village before GiveDirectly. One aided families with school fees, but it chose not to help her children. \u201cI do not want to talk about it,\u201d she said.What is worse, Faye told me, walking away from Odhiambo\u2019s hut, was that most nonprofit projects in the region were never subject to anything like an impact assessment, either. There is no way to know how well they are working, or whether that money would be better spent on something else. \u201cThe question should always be: Would we be better off just giving this money away as cash?\u201d Faye said. \u201cThere usually is not a way to answer that question.\u201dA vast majority of aid \u2014 94 percent \u2014 is noncash. Donor resistance is one reason for this; it is not easy to persuade American oligarchs, British inheritors and Japanese industrialists to fork over their money to the extremely poor to use as they see fit. \u201cThere\u2019s the usual worries about welfare dependency, the whole \u2018Give a man a fish\u2019 thing,\u201d said Amanda Glassman, a public health and development expert at the Center for Global Development. \u201cIt\u2019s so powerful. It\u2019s really a basic psychological feature of the landscape. You\u2019ll start drinking. You\u2019ll start lying around at home because you\u2019re getting paid.\u201dCash also seems harder to market. American taxpayers might be perfectly happy to fund education for young women in poor countries or vaccinations for schoolchildren. But they might balk at the idea of showering money on poor, unstable countries. \u201cThe visual of putting a pill in a kid\u2019s mouth is so much more attractive to people,\u201d Glassman said.Institutional inertia is another factor. \u201cThere are a lot of good people working in the system,\u201d Niehaus said. \u201cAnd there are a lot of organizations pushing to do cash transfers. But the way they are structured and incentivized from the top down \u2014 they aren\u2019t structured to do it. They have a specific mandate, like health. Cash transfers give choice of what goal to pursue to the recipients.\u201dMoreover, cash might force aid workers and nongovernmental organizations to confront the fact that they could be doing better by doing things differently \u2014 often by doing less. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to muster evidence that you should be giving cash instead of fertilizer,\u201d said Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development. \u201cThe harder argument is: You should shut down your U.S.A.I.D. program, which is bigger than the education budget of Liberia, and give the money to Liberians. That\u2019s the radical critique.\u201d Faye put it more bluntly, if half-jokingly: If cash transfers flourished, \u201cthe whole aid industry would have to fire itself.\u201dThere is something to that. One estimate, generated by Laurence Chandy and Brina Seidel of the Brookings Institution, recently calculated that the global poverty gap \u2014 meaning how much it would take to get everyone above the poverty line \u2014 was just $66 billion. That is roughly what Americans spend on lottery tickets every year, and it is about half of what the world spends on foreign aid.But here, many villagers were concerned primarily with procuring the sustenance and basic comforts that their penury had denied them. Odhiambo, the woman who had not been offered aid by the school group, planned to buy corrugated iron sheets for her roof; she considered possibly paying off her dowry. Another villager, Pamela Aooko Odero, ran a household that had been suffering from hunger, with all eight of them living on just 500 to 1,000 shillings a week. She took her money as soon as she got it and went to buy food.Many more made plans that were entrepreneurial. Two widowed sister-wives, Margaret Aloma Abagi and Mary Abonyo Abagi, told me they planned to pool their funds together to start a small bank with some friends. Charles Omari Ager, a houseboy for the sister-wives, had his phone turned off and wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket when the first text came in. He was driving the widows\u2019 goats and cattle from one dried-out, bramble-filled meadow to another when he happened upon an aid worker, who prompted him to pull out his phone, turn it on and wait. The text was there. The money was there. \u201cI\u2019m happy! I\u2019m happy! I\u2019m happy!\u201d he said. He bought himself a goat that day.When the nets were done, he told me, he would rent a boat and hire a day laborer to work with him. He anticipated that his income, after costs, might reach as much as 2,000 shillings on a good day. I asked him why he hadn\u2019t saved money for nets beforehand.He shrugged, smiled and said, \u201cI could not.\u201dAnnie Lowrey is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a former economic-policy reporter for The Times.

{"Headline": "Sequoia Capital Reshuffles Leadership", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful venture capital firms, which has backed companies like Apple, PayPal and WhatsApp, has added some younger blood to its top management ranks.Mr. Goetz, 51, is one of the firm\u2019s biggest rainmakers and is perhaps most famous these days for being the only outside investor in WhatsApp by the time the company sold itself to Facebook for $19 billion.In a letter to investors, Mr. Goetz stressed that he was not leaving the firm and would still make investments. Instead, he is stepping back from management responsibilities to help induct a younger generation into the firm\u2019s leadership ranks. It\u2019s a tradition that he said arose from the Sequoia founder Don Valentine\u2019s making way for Doug Leone and Michael Moritz well before retirement age.\u201cI intend to sponsor new investments but I plan to reduce my workload, so that I can start saying yes to some of the other aspects of my life that have been on hold over the past twenty years,\u201d Mr. Goetz wrote in the investor note.Mr. Goetz\u2019s role as a steward will now be filled by Mr. Botha, 43, a former PayPal chief financial officer who led Sequoia\u2019s investments into the likes of YouTube and Instagram. Mr. Botha will serve alongside Mr. Leone and Neil Shen, the head of Sequoia\u2019s China business.Mr. Goetz will also be stepping back as a co-head, with Mr. Botha, of Sequoia\u2019s United States venture business. Replacing him in that role will be Alfred Lin, 44, a former chairman of Zappos, an online clothing retailer, and an investor in Airbnb and Reddit.Sequoia also named Michael Abramson, 39, a new co-head of its United States growth fund, joining Pat Grady, 34.Here is the text of the letter that Mr. Goetz sent to Sequoia\u2019s investors:Subject: Time to pay it forwardDisruption is at the heart of our business. It\u2019s what creates opportunities for Sequoia entrepreneurs, and it\u2019s what helps them produce extraordinary returns for our L.P.s. Ironically, it\u2019s also the force that many venture capital firms resist, often contributing to their own decline.Sequoia is the exception.Over the past 45 years, starting with Don Valentine, Sequoia has embraced change as much within our partnership as outside it. That willingness to renew and reinvent \u2014 often by empowering the less experienced among us \u2014 has been the foundation of our success. I am deeply indebted to Doug and Sir Michael for the trust they placed in me, first as a Sequoia-backed entrepreneur, later as co-lead of the venture business, and more recently as a Sequoia Steward. Implicit in that arc is an obligation to pay it forward to the next generation. That time has come.During the coming week, I plan to step aside from my leadership responsibilities. I do so with great confidence in this next generation of leaders. They represent a gifted cohort who bleed Sequoia, and their fresh ideas will spur the next wave of reinvention. More to come on these well-deserved changes from Doug.To ensure a smooth transition and encourage change, I am going to decamp from the Menlo office for a few months. I will remain a GP in existing funds and continue to represent Sequoia on boards. When I return, I intend to sponsor new investments but I plan to reduce my workload, so that I can start saying \u201cyes\u201d to some of the other aspects of my life that have been on hold over the past twenty years.Forever grateful.JJGAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Are the Richest of the Rich?", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isn\u2019t a lot of money in 1997.Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, \u201cO.K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion.\u201dTwenty years after the movie \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d was released, billions of dollars aren\u2019t what they used to be, either.Bill Gates alone is just $10 billion shy of Dr. Evil\u2019s ransom demand, according to a list of the world\u2019s top 10 billionaires compiled by Wealth-X, a financial research firm. Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, tops the list at $89.3 billion, followed by his friend Warren Buffett at $73.5 billion.The top 10 \u2014 nine from the United States, one from Spain \u2014 have a combined net worth of $582 billion. While their wealth would certainly be enough to save the world from Dr. Evil, what they do with it in real life is the subject of great interest and debate.That is true now more than ever. Issues around money \u2014 like wealth inequality and talk of tax cuts for the rich \u2014 are among the hottest topics of the day. And the richest president in history is sitting in the Oval Office, with billionaires sprinkled throughout his cabinet.To some, today\u2019s billionaires are like Dr. Evil: selfish, rapacious and bent on world domination. To others, billionaires are worthy of respect for having put their names and fortunes behind an array of philanthropic endeavors, many aimed at improving the lives of people at the very base of the wealth pyramid.There were 2,473 billionaires in the world, as of Wealth-X\u2019s last count through 2015. That was a 6.4 percent increase in billionaires from the year before.But who these billionaires are and what they\u2019re like is more difficult to discern. Many may seem as ordinary as the guy sitting next to you on the train \u2014 or in Michael Bloomberg\u2019s case, standing beside you on the subway, when he was mayor of New York. (Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on Wealth-X\u2019s list.)There are certainly billionaires who want to save the world, like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bloomberg, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. Others in the top 10 are also philanthropic, but they are still focusing on their day jobs, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Alphabet (the parent of Google) \u2014 Nos. 4, 5 and 10.Yet many of the billionaires beyond the top 10 or 20 have a much lower profile. Who outside of finance or hockey knew of Vincent Viola, a former oil trader and current owner of the Florida Panthers, before President Trump nominated him to be secretary of the Army? Now that he has withdrawn, he can return to relative anonymity.For that matter, Wilbur L. Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, is the wealthiest of the president\u2019s billionaire cabinet picks. He would pop up in the headlines every few years for a deal he was making but then return to what could be called the quiet opulence of the billionaire class.\u201cThey\u2019re different in how they can invest their assets and what their portfolio may look like,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said. \u201cIn many ways, they face different risks, both personal risks and cyber risks, than the average individual does. They often think about structuring decisions differently from a succession-planning standpoint as well as the structure they create around themselves and their family.\u201dYet for most people, billionaires are just wealthy beyond belief. And these days, they are also much wealthier (and getting even more so) than the broader ultra-high-net-worth population.That group is defined as anyone with more than $30 million. In 2015, there were 212,615 of them. On the lower end, the 155,050 people worth between $30 million and $99 million had a combined $8.4 trillion. At the top, the world\u2019s 2,473 billionaires were worth $7.68 trillion.\u201cThere is growing inequality around the world, but there is also inequality among the ultrawealthy,\u201d said Maya Imberg, director of custom research at Wealth-X.Billionaires also matter because of the outsize influence they have, or believe they can have, on policy and public life. They can give millions to a political campaign, as Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, did with Mr. Trump, or as George Soros, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has done with liberal causes.But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group. How they amassed their billions, and how that pile is growing, tells a lot about the economy today.Just as the best teacher in the country is going to earn less money than a mediocre investment banker, the industries in which future billionaires begin their careers determine the magnitude of their wealth and how quickly it is going to grow.Six of the top 10 billionaires made their money in technology. But in Wealth-X\u2019s research, technology ranks sixth overall for the number of billionaires on the list, with 114 around the world.Finance has created the most billionaires, with 377, or 15 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires. It is followed by industrial conglomerates, with 317, or 13 percent.After that, the concentration in particular industries drops. Real estate is third with 141. The group of people who identify their industry as nonprofits (meaning they made their money some other way or inherited it) is fourth, with 122. Manufacturing, in fifth place, has 120.\u201cGlobalization has been a big trend,\u201d said Benjamin Kinnard, a research analyst at Wealth-X. \u201cThe market is now seven billion people, not just the size of your domestic country.\u201dHe added that finance had a bigger lead in first place several years ago, but it has been losing ground as industries like technology boom.A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other people\u2019s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified.The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance.And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts).While the number of billionaires in China is rising at a fast clip, the pace of growth in billionaires worldwide is slowing. Wealth-X said the number will be 3,250 by 2020, down 16 percent from an earlier prediction of 3,873. This is because economic growth is expected to slow around the world.Across the billionaire spectrum, the biggest proportion of billionaires\u2019 wealth \u2014 about half \u2014 is in the business that created the wealth in the first place, according to Wealth-X\u2019s research. After that, they have about a quarter of their money in public securities and a little less than a quarter in cash. Just 4 percent is in real estate and luxury assets, the research found.There are common strains to how they cross the billionaire line, regardless of industry: 57 percent are self-made, according to Wealth-X, and another 31 percent received an inheritance and grew it into billions.\u201cTiming has a lot to do with it,\u201d said John Mathews, head of private wealth management and the ultra-high-net-worth group at UBS. \u201cIf we looked back 100 years, it would have been a really great time to be in steel, railroad or infrastructure businesses. Today, it\u2019s a good time to be in technology and finance.\u201dBut there is a difference from the bottom of the billionaire ladder to the top: Most are on that first rung.Over half of all billionaires are worth between $1 billion and $2 billion. Go up to $5 billion and there are 2,101.And not all billionaires are household names.Ma Jianrong, executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group Holdings, which is the leading textile company in China and manufactures clothing for Nike, Adidas, Puma and Uniqlo, is worth $4.3 billion.Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, built his wealth through mining in South Africa after starting his career as a lawyer in the United States. He is now worth $2.1 billion.Kevin Systrom, chief executive of Instagram, is surely well known in Silicon Valley \u2014 and among students at Stanford University (his alma mater) who want to emulate his route to a net worth of $1.2 billion by age 33. But he is not as recognizable as Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook.But being a billionaire, as opposed to a very wealthy millionaire, can make a huge difference in the loss of privacy for a family. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to be anonymous,\u201d Ms. Sneddon said.And being known as billionaires opens them up to risks, she said, like cybersecurity breaches and attacks on their families.How single-digit billionaires add additional billions isn\u2019t always up to them.One way to become even wealthier is to have picked the right global industry in which to make your billions and hang on to your stake in your company as it booms \u2014 and avoids busts. Right now, the technology and finance industries are leading the growth. Another way is to make your money in the right region, which is Asia.Then, of course, there are the investment opportunities that only get presented to the wealthiest people, and that only they have the resources to take a chance on. \u201cThey can diversify their holdings to protect themselves,\u201d Mr. Kinnard said.And the big investments that are needed in private equity deals, for example, are a smaller portion of overall wealth for billionaires than for someone with, say, $100 million.\u201cThe common thread with billionaires is the incredibly focused drive these people have in whatever business they go into,\u201d Mr. Mathews said. \u201cIt\u2019s dogged determination. You can say everyone is like that, but with billionaires everything else gets blocked out. You see it today with tech the way you saw it with steel barons 100 years ago.\u201dYet getting across the billionaire line does not mean a person will always be there.\u201cOnce a billionaire doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stay a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Mathews of UBS said. \u201cLast year alone there were 41 new billionaires created in the United States, but 36 also dropped out of billionaire status in the U.S. Our billionaire population is growing but only by a net of five.\u201dIn the United States, Mr. Mathews said, most people fall off the billionaire list because they sell the company that created their wealth. \u201cWhen you sell it, there are tax issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are estate-planning issues.\u201dThe latter results in chunks of money being given to heirs to get it out of the wealth creator\u2019s estate.Selling family firms happens less often in Europe and Asia. People end up holding on to them and creating family holding companies to continue to operate that original business and expand into others.Of course, people who sell their $1 billion company and end up with $500 million after taxes \u2014 or whose wealth tops out at $800 million \u2014 aren\u2019t scraping by. But being a billionaire gives you entry into an exclusive club that being a millionaire does not. After all, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s wealth from his career at Exxon Mobil looks positively modest. He\u2019s worth just a few hundred million.What is expected of people who have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes? It depends on whom you ask.\u201cIt is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when one in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day,\u201d Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam, said in a statement. \u201cInequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty. It is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.\u201dYet the anger against the superrich has abated since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Protesters seem to be more concerned with the actions of Mr. Trump (who is likely a billionaire, although he has provided little proof of his real wealth) than with his cabinet of plutocrats.Philanthropy has become important to many billionaires, and not just through the Giving Pledge, Mr. Buffett\u2019s compact to get the wealthiest to give away at least half of their fortunes. Nor is it confined to the United States, with its tradition of charitable giving.\u201cWhen I explained to him that New York City\u2019s annual school budget was $22 billion a year,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said, \u201cthat was the last time we ever heard from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was believed to be 62.Mr. Morrison was an architect of hits by the Ohio Players and Parliament-Funkadelic, pre-eminent 1970s funk outfits. He also had a prolific career on his own, making albums on which he played and sang all the parts.The high, wriggly Arp Soloist synthesizer line on the Ohio Players\u2019 \u201cFunky Worm,\u201d either directly sampled or imitated, became an essential part of the Los Angeles hip-hop that Dr. Dre turned into a genre, G-funk, in productions for N.W.A, Snoop Dogg and others.Mr. Morrison was born in 1954 in Dayton, Ohio, and took to music as a child. At 5, he played piano in church before his feet reached the floor, and gospel became a foundation for his music. Performing in various ensembles and styles, he learned more instruments: guitar, bass, drums, brasses. At Roosevelt High School in Dayton, he was a student choir director and orchestra conductor.Mr. Morrison was still a teenager when he joined the Ohio Players in the early 1970s, soon after graduating from high school. He became their lead singer, trumpeter and keyboardist, and soon their musical director and producer.The band members nicknamed him Junie, he told the Red Bull Music Academy, because they were older. \u201cIt took quite a while before they let me forget my age and lack of experience in the \u2018ways of the world,\u2019 \u201d he said.\u201cFunky Worm,\u201d with Mr. Morrison on multiple instruments, became the Ohio Players\u2019 first No. 1 R&B hit. (It was also reached No. 15 on the Billboard pop singles chart.) He left the band to make solo albums in 1974, billing himself as Junie. Except for orchestral arrangements, he usually sang, played and produced every part, as another Midwestern prodigy, Prince, would do a few years later on his debut.On his solo albums, Mr. Morrison sang flirtations, dance invitations, philosophy and social commentary in tunes that drew on funk, ballads, jazz, blues, rock, reggae and Latin styles. He was also an early experimenter with technology like synthesizers, vocoders and drum machines. And he had a humorous streak: Quacking duck sounds turn up across his discography.He joined Mr. Clinton\u2019s funk empire in 1978 and worked into the early 1980s with Funkadelic, Parliament and the P-Funk All-Stars as well as on Mr. Clinton\u2019s debut solo album, \u201cComputer Games.\u201dMr. Morrison rejoined Mr. Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars in the 1990s. In 1998 Mr. Morrison shared a major gospel honor, the Dove Award for song of the year, for \u201cStomp,\u201d by Kirk Franklin and the Family.He also collaborated on John Tesh\u2019s \u201cGive Me Forever (I Do),\u201d which became a wedding perennial with James Ingram\u2019s vocal, and went on to produce much of Mr. Ingram\u2019s 1999 album, \u201cForever More (Love Songs, Hits & Duets).\u201dMr. Morrison revitalized his solo career on his own new label, Juniefunk, in the 2000s. He recorded as Junie Morrison for the 2004 album \u201cWhen the City,\u201d and under aliases, including Micronagual, Algorithm and BoyinSea.\u201cMusicians, if they choose to, can drive a tonal wedge through the noisome pestilence; the stench that often accompanies our contemporary societal lifestyles,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to conceptualize an escape from the tensions and atmospheric pollution, even if it\u2019s only a temporary psycho-acoustical one.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They feel that some infernal mechanism has taken hold and is dragging them toward an abyss. The president is a reference point; if he lies, lying seeps deep into the culture.

For decades the world\u2019s security was undergirded by America\u2019s word. The words that issued from the Oval Office were solemn.

{"Headline": "The Economic Growth That Experts Can\u2019t Count", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut what if the economy has already been growing at that rate \u2014 but no one realized it?This isn\u2019t a matter of rigged statistics, political spinning or fanciful alternate realities, but one of measurement.As the economy has shifted from one that primarily produced things \u2014 refrigerators and cars, guns and shoes \u2014 to one that now deals largely in services and information, economists have grown more and more skeptical that the traditional measure of gross domestic product \u2014 the nation\u2019s total output \u2014 is accurately capturing much of the economy\u2019s innovation and improvements.\u201cI think the official data on real growth substantially underestimates the rate of growth,\u201d said Martin Feldstein, an economist at Harvard.These calculations may seem to be the esoteric domain of number crunchers, but the yearly growth figures \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 end up being used to answer several essential questions. Is the country getting richer? Are standards of living rising? Are businesses and workers more productive? Is the economy improving?Indeed, the measure was initially created to back up President Herbert Hoover\u2019s overly buoyant claim in 1930, based solely on sprinkled anecdotes of improvements, that \u201cthe Depression is over.\u201dGross domestic product has always been an imperfect answer to such questions. It is designed to measure production and just production \u2014 not welfare or happiness.Such ho-hum performance has become both an emblem of and explanation for the anxiety that smears the economic outlook like a bathtub ring. And every day, decisions about government policy, investment, regulations, taxes, trade and more are based on such measurements.At its most basic, G.D.P. is calculated by looking at prices \u2014 the price of materials, workers, overhead and so on that it costs to make a product and the price that consumers in turn pay for that product.And while prices can be measured, they don\u2019t necessarily reflect the value of quality and experience. As far as G.D.P. is concerned, a delectable $20 meal that would wow Julia Child is equal to a rubbery, tasteless one that costs the same amount.The growing suspicion, however, is that in a digital world overflowing with free services like Facebook, Google and YouTube, price is an increasingly ill-suited proxy for value.What is the worth of a free software update that protects against a nasty virus? Of the streaming service that enables you to watch shows on your computer instead of on a television? Of the hours and hours saved by looking up a fact on Wikipedia rather than having to go to a library? All have productive value but no price.Kuznets lost that battle, but economists and statisticians have continually struggled to compensate for the measure\u2019s shortcomings \u2014 like qualities not reflected in price and the constant cavalcade of new goods and services.Economists seek to attach values to specific improvements, whether faster internet speed, less pollution or a medical treatment that leaves you healthy enough to water ski instead of stuck in a hospital bed. And they look at ad revenue that free services like Google and Facebook rack up and jobs they create.Still, given how much of people\u2019s time and activity has migrated online, there remains a sizable chunk of \u201cdigital dark matter\u201d that is not counted. At the same time, measuring the increased value to consumers can be even more difficult when it comes to services and experience than it is with goods.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to evaluate consumer preferences,\u201d said Richard Freeman, an economist at Harvard, and it may be even harder to figure for \u201cthings where knowledge is involved and for some kind of qualitative changes.\u201dThe best biology textbook in the 1950s, for example, would still not have the accuracy, depth and complexity of one published in 2017. \u201cA doctor who graduates today knows and learns many more techniques and medicines than someone who graduated years ago,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t really build that in.\u201dMr. Feldstein likes to illustrate his argument about G.D.P. by referring to the widespread use of statins, the cholesterol drugs that have reduced deaths from heart attacks. Between 2000 and 2007, he noted, the death rate from heart disease among those over 65 fell by one-third.\u201cThis was a remarkable contribution to the public\u2019s well-being over a relatively short number of years, and yet this part of the contribution of the new product is not reflected in real output or real growth of G.D.P.,\u201d he said. He estimates \u2014 without hard evidence, he is careful to point out \u2014 that growth is understated by 2 percent or more a year.The critical question, though, is whether growth and productivity figures are being underestimated more than ever before.Mr. Furman said that Americans were feeling a genuine slowdown in growth, but aggravating the impact was that the growth that had occurred \u201cis less equally shared than before.\u201dFor Mr. Feldstein, it is misleading measurements that are contributing to a public perception that real incomes \u2014 particularly for the middle class \u2014 aren\u2019t rising very much. That, he said, \u201creduces people\u2019s faith in the political and economic system.\u201d\u201cI think it creates pessimism and a distrust of government,\u201d leading Americans to worry that \u201ctheir children are going to be stuck and won\u2019t be able to enjoy upward mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand this.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Supreme Court Stand Up to Trump?", "Date": "2017-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRelevance comes at a price.The election of Donald J. Trump promises to restore to the Supreme Court the working conservative majority that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. lost a year ago when Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death left the court deadlocked 4-4 on important issues.But if the pre-election possibility of spending the next years or decades in the minority was scary for the chief justice, he now faces something even more daunting: responsibility.President Trump\u2019s hyperactive first days in office, along with the evidence that the two Republican-controlled houses of Congress will do the president\u2019s bidding with few questions asked, leaves the judiciary as the only branch of government standing between the new administration and constitutional chaos. Consider what would have happened last weekend had half a dozen federal judges not stepped in to prevent the immediate ouster from the country of legal permanent residents and carefully vetted refugees and visa holders.Whether those particular cases will make their way to the Supreme Court is uncertain. But the extraordinary scenes of recent days strongly suggest that the Roberts court will find itself in a national security spotlight. That\u2019s an uncomfortable but hardly unknown place for the court to be: It was during the years after Sept. 11 that the court of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist surprisingly pushed back against the Bush administration\u2019s effort to create a legal black hole at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where the administration had mistakenly calculated that detainees could be hidden away outside the reach of federal judges.To the extent that the presidential campaign focused on the Supreme Court with any specificity, the attention was on abortion, religion, gay rights, guns and other familiar issues on the social agenda. But going forward, the Roberts court may find the most pressing issues on its docket to concern core questions of civil liberties and the separation of powers.When the history of this period is written, the court will be judged by its answers to those questions. When the president, aided by his inner circle and his congressional enablers, pushes through some norm-shattering order, wipes away duly promulgated regulations with the flourish of a pen or drives a truck through the wall between church and state, where will the Roberts court be? (And where will Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, the appeals court judge Neil M. Gorsuch, be?)It\u2019s hard to imagine two figures on the current public stage less alike than the button-down chief justice and the flamboyant president.Watching Chief Justice Roberts administer the oath to Donald Trump, what struck me was the unlikelihood that these two men would even be sharing the same stage \u2014 and not only because during the campaign, Mr. Trump called the chief justice \u201can absolute disaster\u201d for his votes to preserve the Affordable Care Act.If Donald Trump is the in-your-face chief executive, John Roberts has perfected the art of being the nearly invisible chief justice. He can be tough on the bench during arguments and in the justices\u2019 private conference as well, but in public he exudes a self-deprecating diffidence.Here\u2019s an example: In the early 1980s, when John Roberts was a Supreme Court law clerk, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger would travel every year to the American Bar Association\u2019s midwinter convention to give a \u201cstate of the judiciary\u201d speech, unrolled as a grand occasion in the manner of the State of the Union. His successor, William H. Rehnquist, dialed the speech back, issuing it through the press office rather than delivering it in person.At the end of 2009, his fifth year on the job, Chief Justice Roberts boiled it down to one page. He said that \u201cwhen the political branches are faced with so many difficult issues, and when so many of our fellow citizens have been touched by hardship, the public might welcome a year-end report limited to what is essential.\u201d All that people needed to know was that \u201cthe courts are operating soundly, and the nation\u2019s dedicated federal judges are conscientiously discharging their duties.\u201dImagine President Trump stepping back from the stage in such a manner.Will that hands-off attitude define the Roberts court in the Trump era? Is it limited to foreign policy or does it extend to civil liberties and other domestic issues? Because Republicans won\u2019t press Judge Gorsuch on such questions \u2014 or any questions \u2014 Democrats better be prepared to do it themselves. And they shouldn\u2019t accept the formulaic response of \u201cI can\u2019t answer because it might come before the court.\u201d As Tocqueville observed nearly 200 years ago, in this country, everything and anything is likely to come before a court. That answer isn\u2019t good enough.Asking Judge Gorsuch \u2014 or any other nominee \u2014 to describe how he would have approached the Boumediene case does not bind him to any result in a future case. All his answer would do is reveal how he might approach a high stakes, high salience clash of constitutional principles. Is there such a case in the Roberts court\u2019s future?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Internet Didn\u2019t Kill Zines", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyAs a lonely teenager growing up in Virginia, I fed off any pop culture that could show me different ways of being from what I saw on \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d reruns or read about in an Ann M. Martin book. This was the early 2000s, before social platforms had taken off: LiveJournal was still in its infancy; Tumblr had not yet been created. Friendster and Myspace, the most popular of the networks that did exist, were more about sharing perfectly angled photos than having conversations or bouncing ideas off someone. When, in college, a spirited English teaching assistant (who once canceled class for the week to attend a riot-grrrl punk reunion show in Washington) introduced me to zines and the early feminist publishing movement of the 1990s, I felt as if I had been given a lifeline to the outside world. Those self-published, unofficial magazines offered tangible glimpses of radical feminism, social-justice movements, queer history and subcultures that I always knew existed but had little access to. The world seemed to open up for me.In theory, the maturation of the internet should have killed off the desire for zines entirely. The web is a Gutenberg press on steroids, predicated on free software platforms created by companies that invest considerable sums to lure people to their sites and make exactly the kind of content I craved growing up. Millions, maybe hundreds of millions, of posts are published to social-media sites each day. And yet somehow, it can feel impossible to engage with new ideas, even as our compulsive inability to stop scrolling exposes us to an unending stream of new content. Yes, you can catch tweetstorms on Twitter, watch someone\u2019s life unfold on Instagram, do deep dives into hashtags on Tumblr or watch video diaries on YouTube that explore diverse perspectives, but the clutter of everything else happening at the same time online can make it difficult to really digest and absorb the perspective being offered.Which might be part of the reason zines never disappeared \u2014 and are even available in abundance in 2017. A few months ago, I walked into a Laundromat in Brooklyn where a former cellphone kiosk had been transformed into a feminist queer shop called the Troll Hole. I was thrilled to find it stocked with the same kinds of small booklets I consumed in college, though much better designed and produced. They contained nonbinary coming-of-age stories, photo essays featuring gender nonconforming people of Latin-American descent, trans Muslim narratives, first-generation essays, fat-positive imagery. I scooped up as many as I could rationally read in one sitting.Many of the offline zine projects I came across have some online presence, too. Sula Collective, for example, which describes itself as a journal by and for people of color, actually started out on the web as an art magazine for people growing up \u201cin the suburbs and Deep South,\u201d as one of its founders, Kassandra Pi\u00f1ero, put it to me. It was meant for anyone who \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to galleries and events.\u201d Pi\u00f1ero is 21, and the only world she has ever known is one that is also lived partly online. But she found that publishing on the internet often had the unintended and unconscious effect of causing her to cater to the aesthetics of those platforms. \u201cThe internet should be a place with no rules, and freedom, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Pi\u00f1ero said. \u201cThere is a certain pressure to conform to certain aesthetics.\u201d It was something I had noticed myself. Each social-media platform tends to reward certain behaviors and styles of posting, all in the interest of building fans and followers who are invested in the performance of a persona (maybe even more so than the Geppetto-like person orchestrating it all). Instagram is a place for intimate-seeming photos, Twitter for clever quips and collaborative memes. Facebook demands an unmitigated rawness that can be terrifying at times. With all, the works are often made to fit the platform, not the other way around.Karen Gisonny is the periodicals librarian at the New York Public Library and specializes in alternative publications and zines. We\u2019ve spoken over the years about alternative media and the role that it plays among the people who make it and consume it. She noted that zines allow for an \u201celement of freedom that\u2019s not beholden to anyone.\u201d We think of the web as a place for freedom, but with zines, authors control every aspect, from the design to the distribution. When I visited her at the library, she showed me some of her newest acquisitions, which included the first issue of Dr. RAD\u2019s Queer Health Show, a guide for self-exams and checkups for all gendered bodies, and Blue Collar Review, a journal of progressive working-class literature that is made in Virginia. She explained that zines could be seen as a historical record of the current moment. To their creators, zines can feel like necessary means of defiance, even resistance to cultural norms that rarely acknowledge them.Devin N. Morris, who edits and publishes 3 Dot Zine, told me that he sees self-publishing as a political and radical act. He\u2019s a young queer artist from Baltimore, and the zines he creates reflect that experience and create a historical narrative that otherwise would be ignored. For him, the act of creating a zine is more about defining his reality on his terms and legitimizing it than it is about the novelty of making indie media and distributing it. It was a sentiment I heard from almost every zine creator I spoke to. Morris, who recently hosted an indie-press fair at the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts, said that zines have a way of encouraging people to have \u201cinspiring interactions in real life.\u201d He described a hunger to physically interact beyond simple likes or direct messages. Social apps weren\u2019t made to inspire that desire; they were created so that there would be no need.And it perhaps reflects why zines can feel so much more intimate than a Facebook post. The deliberation and care that goes into making them is important. The internet is especially adept at compressing humanity and making it easy to forget there are people behind tweets, posts and memes.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Graham, to whom Jackson had compared Anthony with the reference to spots on a leopard, is a former Georgetown Hoyas player who had a short and troubled professional basketball career that included a stop with a former Jackson team, the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association.Mostly, Anthony said, he took issue with the animal he was compared to.\u201cThey got the animal wrong,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI\u2019m not a cheetah. My favorite animal is a black jaguar.\u201dBut it is clear that Anthony is not fond of these public disputes with Jackson. Focusing on just basketball, he said, has not been easy. He no longer needs any explanations and says he is beyond a point where they bother him.Coach Jeff Hornacek, who has no Twitter or Facebook account, said he was no longer checking on Anthony after such incidents since Anthony responded coolly to the first one. If he sees tension, he said, then he will address it, but for now he is leaving Anthony alone, even as he admitted these issues were distractions for his team.Anthony said he was just tired of spats with a member of the front office playing out in front of all to see.\u201cI think anybody would get tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you went to work every day and you had these spats about you, eventually you will get tired. Unless you\u2019re as strong as I am and know how to deal with it and move on from it. I think any human being would start feeling at some point in time a way about it, but can\u2019t cry over spoiled milk.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Parent Showcases Its Strength in Preparation for I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Snapchat may have been built on disappearing messages. But as the social media darling hovers on the cusp of becoming a public company, its parent is trying to show how durable its business is.In its first public prospectus, Snap Inc. disclosed on Thursday that it had built a nearly $405 million advertising business in just over two years. While the filing does not indicate a price for an initial public offering, Snap is expected to seek a market valuation of more than $20 billion from investors.Within weeks, Snap executives will begin formally meeting with prospective investors, along with the company\u2019s lead underwriters at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The pitch is straightforward: Snap is one of technology\u2019s biggest success stories of late, and it is heading to the public markets amid a relative dearth of noteworthy offerings.Still, company executives are expected to face questions about whether Snap can maintain its enormous growth rate, particularly as Facebook\u2019s Instagram unit copies many of Snapchat\u2019s major features. Potential investors may question the slowing growth rate of daily users, though Snap will probably argue that it will keep adding new products, which will accelerate growth.Others in Snap\u2019s class of popular start-ups \u2014 like Uber, Airbnb and Dropbox \u2014 are not expected to begin selling stock on public markets for months or even years, as they are tied up with legal issues or are overhauling their businesses.The filing on Thursday formally pulls back the curtain on Snap\u2019s meteoric growth. From 2011 to 2012, the number of people using the Snapchat app every day grew to one million from 1,000. By the end of last year, an average of 158 million people were using the app daily.The average user opens the app more than 18 times a day, according to the prospectus, and the service\u2019s users send more than 2.5 billion messages and images each day.Snap demonstrated in the prospectus that its business model is viable. Its annual revenue grew by about seven times in just a year, to $404.5 million last year, from $58.7 million in 2015.Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising conglomerate WPP, recently estimated that his company spent $90 million on Snapchat last year. He called Snap a \u201crogue elephant,\u201d even as WPP deployed $5 billion to Google and $1.7 billion to Facebook in 2016.\u201cI would say Snapchat is the one thing that people look at and say, \u2018Maybe that\u2019s a third force that can counter the domination,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sorrell said last month, speaking at a conference held by Citigroup.Still, Snap lost $514 million last year, compared with nearly $373 million in 2015. One difference between Snap and its rivals Facebook and Twitter makes it hard to compare their financials side by side: Those older social networks own their own server farms, so the expense of operating them does not show up as a line item in the companies\u2019 financial statements. By contrast, Snap rents storage and server space from Google.In its first public prospectus, Snapchat\u2019s parent is trying to show how durable its business is. Snap is expected to seek a market valuation of more than $20 billion from investors.In the prospectus, Snap said that nearly all of its revenue came from advertising, a market that is expected to grow globally to $767 billion in 2020 from $652 billion in 2016. The fastest-growing segment of that market is mobile advertising, the home of Snap\u2019s business. The segment is expected to grow to $196 billion in 2020 from $66 billion last year.The ad market is highly concentrated in 10 countries, according to data from International Data Corporation, and about 60 percent of Snap\u2019s users are in those countries.By the end of 2016, the prospectus says, Snap made $1.05 for each of its users, up from 31 cents in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company made $2.15 per user in North America in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with 67 cents the year before. In Europe, by comparison, the company made 28 cents per user at the end of last year.Started in 2011 in a Stanford dorm room, Snap has grown from a curio for millennials into a broad social phenomenon. The start-up, founded by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, was originally built for users to send self-destructing photographs and messages to their friendsBut Snap\u2019s ambitions have risen over time. It introduced ways for users to compile \u201cstories\u201d about their days and innovative filters that can transform faces to look like dogs or monsters \u2014 or, crucially, branded content like Taco Bell tacos.\u201cWhen we were just getting started, many people didn\u2019t understand what Snapchat was and said it was just for sexting, even when we knew it was being used for so much more,\u201d the company said, employing what is surely one of the few uses of the word \u201csexting\u201d in a regulatory filing.While generally seen as a social media company like Facebook and Twitter, Snap declared in its prospectus that it \u201cis a camera company.\u201dUnlike Facebook or Twitter, Snap has largely avoided many of the standard trappings of Silicon Valley. Its home base in not a Bay Area enclave like Menlo Park or Palo Alto, but off the beach in Venice, a Los Angeles neighborhood. Snap employs 1,859 people \u2014 an extraordinarily small number relative to the $16.5 billion valuation it gave itself as of the end of 2016.Mr. Spiegel\u2019s vision has attracted a number of prominent backers who are expected to reap handsome rewards \u2014 if only on paper \u2014 in the initial public offering.According to the filing, Mr. Spiegel received $4.1 million in compensation, including salary and bonuses, over the last two years. The company\u2019s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, received $151 million in that period, with the bulk of it coming from stock awards he got upon joining the company from the investment bank Credit Suisse.Among the largest current owners of Snap stock are Benchmark Capital, which owns about 12.7 percent of the company\u2019s class A shares, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which owns about 8 percent of that stock class.But the biggest shareholders by far are Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy. More important, they hold nearly 89 percent of the company\u2019s voting power, and will keep it even after the initial offering, since the shares being sold to the public will hold no voting power whatsoever. The men will retain that control even if they should later leave the company.\u201cMr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are entitled to vote their shares, and shares over which they have voting control, in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally,\u201d the company cautioned in the filing. Snap noted that it knew of no other company that had completed an offering of nonvoting stock in the United States.Sapna Maheshwari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mike Piazza Learns How to Be an Owner. Of a Soccer Team. In Italy.", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREGGIO EMILIA, Italy \u2014 Mike Piazza was jet-lagged and hungry, though you wouldn\u2019t have known it from his smile as he navigated the obstacle course of hugs, kisses and handshakes.\u201cHey! Ciao! Good to see you!\u201d he said.It has been 10 years since Piazza, 48, retired from baseball as one of the best-hitting catchers in history. It is common for stars of his stature to try out second careers in broadcasting, or simply to luxuriate in endless rounds of golf. Piazza last year decided he would become the majority owner of a third-division Italian soccer club, Reggiana.And so today, one year after his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the focus of Piazza\u2019s professional life is here in Reggio Emilia, a picturesque city 100 miles south of Milan \u2014 and about 5,000 miles from his home in Miami. Here, most people view the American pastime, if they know it at all, as a faraway curiosity. The locals understood that Piazza was famous when he arrived, but they needed Google to discover the reason. The level of renown he earns here will depend entirely on his ability to execute an ambitious plan to lift his beleaguered club back to the top flight of Italian soccer.So he kept moving on that recent Sunday morning, doling out bilingual small talk around the V.I.P. lounge of Reggiana\u2019s stadium before a recent game against Modena, a nearby rival. Cigarette smoke and the faint echoes of fans\u2019 chants wafted in from the stands. Parmigiano-Reggiano from a local sponsor was carved and shoveled onto plates of pumpkin tortellini. Finally, palms pressed and pleasantries exchanged, Piazza stole away to a modest private box where he could reflect on his professional transformation.\u201cI remember, as a player, complaining if we had a small plane,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018We couldn\u2019t get a 757? We had to get a 737? That\u2019s garbage. The owners are cheap.\u2019\u201d\u201cNow switch to me as the owner. I go: \u2018What the hell? One hundred dollars a room? Where are you guys staying, the Four Seasons?\u2019\u201dAs the game began, Piazza found himself fixated on how the rainy weather had affected ticket sales. While play crackled below him, he timed a rotating advertisement screen near the stands. Soon, Maurizio Franzone, the team\u2019s general manager, joined Piazza and his guests in the outdoor viewing area, and for the next two hours Piazza peppered him with questions about players and tactics.It was Franzone who first made contact with Reggiana\u2019s previous owners on Dec. 10, 2015. Piazza and Franzone have been friends for years, and they had long discussed the idea of investing in soccer. After the initial meeting, Franzone, who had spoken to about 20 other clubs in Italy, excitedly reported back to Piazza that it could be the perfect situation. Reggiana played in a large stadium that could eventually accommodate upper-league crowds. It boasted a training facility with 11 fields. It was geographically close to countless potential sponsors. It possessed a fan base desperate for brighter days.\u201cPut it this way: This is a team that needs to come back,\u201d said Franzone, 47, a former professional goalkeeper who favors three-piece suits and a finely groomed beard. \u201cThe people of Reggio Emilia need it.\u201dIt has not been easy being a Reggiana fan over the last two decades. In the 1990s, the club played in Serie A, the country\u2019s top tier, and in 1995, it opened a new stadium, which hundreds of the team\u2019s fans helped finance through the purchase of multiyear season ticket plans.But things quickly went awry. The team was relegated in 1997, and a few years later, after going bankrupt, it was forced to surrender the title to its stadium, which had been sold at auction. Today, the arena is owned by Giorgio Squinzi, the owner of the nearby Serie A team Sassuolo. The teams share the stadium, with Reggiana paying rent \u2014 an arrangement that causes its fans much embarrassment.But Piazza, for now, has gained the fans\u2019 trust. On June 18, 10 days after he announced a deal in principle to buy a majority stake in the club, thousands of fans greeted him with a rally in the main city square, serenading him with team songs. (He has declined to disclose financial details of the deal, but various local media outlets reported the investment was around $3 million.)And if there was some initial concern that Piazza might be a detached foreign owner, minding his investment from overseas, he has thus far dispelled it. He has made seven trips to Italy since buying the team, embracing a life of redeye flights. He has adopted a holistic approach to player development and pondered which elements of American sports culture could work in Italy. New sponsors have signed on; old ones that had abandoned the club in its lean years have returned. The number of season-ticket holders has doubled to 5,243, up from 2,615 last season.Currently Reggiana (14-5-7) sits in fourth place in the league standings.\u201cWe firmly believe in the Mike Piazza project,\u201d said Stefano Cavazzoni, 46, who lives in Reggio Emilia and began following the team in the early 1980s.\u201cHe made us feel close to him even though he\u2019s a very wealthy man,\u201d Miari said. He shrugged when asked to rate Piazza\u2019s language skills. \u201cHis Italian is like our English,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs practice.\u201dPiazza, who took six months of Italian lessons (and acknowledges that he needs more), has been brushing up on his soccer, too. He grew up near Philadelphia and had only a passing interest in the sport until he retired. He joked that he once thought Reggiana\u2019s favored formation was a 4-4-3, a nonsensical configuration. But Franzone said Piazza\u2019s baseball career had given him credibility with players and fans alike. \u201cThey know you know the smell of a locker room,\u201d he often tells Piazza.Sports ownership has its visceral joys, too, and Piazza was clearly enjoying himself as the game wore on. He yelled toward the field: \u201cDai, dai! Atta boy! Bravo! Get that ball!\u201d He drank an Aperol spritz and a few glasses of ros\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a bad headache,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we pull this game out, it\u2019ll be worth it. It\u2019s two Advil.\u201dThe conversation at halftime turned to the region\u2019s famous gastronomic tradition, or as Piazza called it, \u201cthe other reason I bought the team.\u201d He breathlessly cataloged the area\u2019s cured meats: \u201cThe prosciutto, the bresaola, the coppa, the mortadella \u2014 that\u2019s all here.\u201dNoting that he had met with groups aiming for expansion franchises in Major League Soccer before buying Reggiana, he said: \u201cI\u2019d rather be poor in Italy than based in St. Louis. You can\u2019t get a good meal there!\u201dWhen Reggiana scored its eventual winning goal in the second half, Piazza threw a left-handed uppercut \u2014 balancing the wineglass in his other hand \u2014 and let out a prolonged yell. He cursed when a Reggiana player injured himself and again when the fourth official announced that there would be four minutes of injury time.\u201cYeah!\u201d Piazza said when the final whistle blared, before closing his eyes and touching his chest. \u201cMamma mia.\u201dAfterward, several fans walked over to greet Piazza, addressing him as \u201cPresidente\u201d \u2014 the formality of which always makes his wife, Alicia Rickter, laugh. Piazza shook hands and posed for pictures. \u201cGrazie per essere venuti,\u201d he said. Thank you for coming.As he prepared to duck inside, an elderly man reached over to grab his hand. \u201cYou bring us good luck,\u201d the man said in Italian. \u201cPlease come again.\u201dThe next day, while eating lunch with Franzone in the city, Piazza likened owning a soccer team to harvesting macadamia trees, a process that can take five years to yield nuts. \u201cI wanted to come into a situation where there was something to build,\u201d he said.Piazza has adopted the same approach to life in Italy. He was 34 when he visited Italy for the first time. He had been to Japan seven times at that point in his life, but somehow never to the home country of his paternal grandparents.The trip changed him, he said. Growing up, he had absorbed a bundle of cultural idiosyncrasies \u2014 whether tastes, mannerisms or locutions \u2014 that sometimes manifested themselves explicitly or in other cases merely fizzed beneath his consciousness. In Rome, he found these stray fragments of his identity fitting naturally, exhilaratingly, into his surroundings.The next year, he and his father visited Sciacca, the town on the southwestern coast of Sicily where his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Giuseppe Piazza was born in 1789.\u201cI felt like a duck going back to water,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cI just related. I could just feel it. I just felt Italian.\u201dThese days, Piazza has been renting a home in a village called Quattro Castella, about 10 miles south of Reggio Emilia. He has considered having his children \u2014 Nicoletta, 10; Paulina, 7; and Marco, 3 \u2014 attend Italian schools for a year.In the restaurant, Piazza fiddled with the patterned scarf around his neck, joking that he accessorized like this only in Italy, where he felt sartorially inadequate alongside the locals. Scanning a menu, he made a face when he came across the horse tartare; his children were taking riding lessons, he explained.Piazza is enjoying this cross-cultural learning process. He said the rigors of this new life \u2014 stacking airline miles, struggling with a new language, savoring new foods, connecting to his family\u2019s roots \u2014 had invigorated him in the vacuum left by baseball.\u201cI played baseball for 16 years,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to reconcile the fact that I\u2019ll never again feel the juice of hitting a home run in front of 50,000 people.\u201dTo be sure, baseball still seeped into conversation during the first two days of his trip. Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and Byung-Hyun Kim were the two pitchers he never figured out. He thought the increasing reliance on \u201cMoneyball\u201d principles had precipitated his retirement. He called being booed at Yankee Stadium \u201cthe coolest thing I remember from my career.\u201dBut it is soccer, calcio, that consumes him now. \u201cI like the adventure of this,\u201d he said of the Reggiana project. \u201cI\u2019ll hop on a train. I\u2019ll hop on a plane. I\u2019ll get in the car. I\u2019ll just go. I like the energy.\u201dHe sipped Lambrusco, a sparkling red wine produced in the region. \u201cI could fail,\u201d he said. \u201cI could end up losing some money here. But it was important to me to step outside of my comfort zone.\u201dBrando de Leonardis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Are Your Rights if Border Agents Want to Search Your Phone?", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHaisam Elsharkawi was about to travel from Los Angeles to Saudi Arabia last week when, he says, he was stopped at the airport, questioned, handcuffed, questioned some more and then released without charges three hours after his flight had departed.He said they threatened to seize the phone if he did not comply.\u201cI travel all the time, and I was never asked to unlock my phone,\u201d said Mr. Elsharkawi, an electronics salesman from Anaheim, Calif. \u201cI have personal photos there, which I think is normal for anyone. It\u2019s my right. It\u2019s my phone.\u201dEventually, he relented, and a Homeland Security agent looked through his phone for about 15 minutes, he said.So before you travel, here\u2019s some information on what border agents can and cannot do, along with recommendations from lawyers.American border agents have the legal authority to conduct searches at the United States border that a police officer on the street wouldn\u2019t. Laws that allow agents to search bags without a judge\u2019s approval, for the purposes of immigration or security compliance, have been extended to digital devices.But activists say inspecting a digital device is far more intrusive than inspecting a suitcase. They noted that the device can contain not just personal photos and messages, but could also compromise anyone else the owner may have communicated with.\u201cBefore government agents should be able to go rifling through that trove of private data, they should have a very good reason based on individualized suspicion of illegal activity,\u201d said Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cPeople\u2019s most private details of their lives will be made bare without justification.\u201dA customs agency spokesman said the agency could not comment on individual cases. But he said agents had inspected 4,444 cellphones and 320 other electronic devices in 2015, amounting to 0.0012 percent of the 383 million arrivals. In fiscal year 2016, the searches of electronic devices rose to 23,000.No. But they can ask you to comply voluntarily and make the experience rather uncomfortable if you resist. Travelers must decide how much trouble they\u2019re willing to put up with.Travelers have reported that they\u2019ve been detained for hours and questioned aggressively. Mr. Elsharkawi, whose trip included a pilgrimage to Mecca after an 18-hour layover in Istanbul, said his payment for his Turkish Airlines flight was not refunded after he missed it.Travelers who are not citizens could have further problems, especially if they\u2019re flying into the United States. While citizens are guaranteed re-entry, foreign nationals could be denied entry, and the law isn\u2019t clear on permanent residents, said Sophia Cope, a staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization that defends civil liberties in the digital age.\u201cPeople have to figure out what is their tolerance for risk, and what do they want to accomplish,\u201d Ms. Cope said.No. But those who unlock their phones are most likely giving agents full access to their social media accounts, even if they don\u2019t tell them the passwords.Since most people remain logged into their accounts on their phones, unlocking the phone would allow officers to sift through private Facebook posts, direct messages on Twitter and Instagram photos that are set to be accessible to friends only.Mr. Elsharkawi did not give agents his social media passwords. But when he allowed an officer to look through his phone, he said, she commented on his emails and apps. He doesn\u2019t know if she looked through his social media accounts, he added.While that policy would not apply to citizens, Ms. Cope said, it would be \u201ca very small step for them to start doing that to Americans, as well.\u201dTravel with the least amount of data you need.Hassan Shibly, the chief executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations-Florida, suggested that people buy \u201cburner phones\u201d that they can discard before entering the airport.It\u2019s an individual decision. As a matter of principle, said Robert McCaw, the director of government affairs at CAIR, people should not unlock their devices. And they should request a lawyer.\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no reason why the federal government should be asking you for your password to your computer or your social media without a warrant. Period,\u201d Mr. McCaw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no justification.\u201dBut some activists said it\u2019s understandable why some people comply to such a demand, depending on what they have to lose by resisting.Mr. Elsharkawi, who lives in Anaheim with his wife and three children, said requesting legal assistance appeared to inflame his situation.\u201cI opened the doors of hell when I asked for a lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just started attacking me verbally. \u2018Why do you need a lawyer? Are you a criminal? What are you hiding?\u2019 \u201dAfter allowing the Homeland Security officer to examine his phone, he said, he was immediately released.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Traffic Deaths Rise for a Second Straight Year", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the last decade, new cars have gotten electronic stability control systems to prevent skids, rearview cameras to prevent fender benders and more airbags to protect occupants in collisions. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on campaigns to remind the public of the dangers of drunken driving, failing to buckle up and texting while on the go.Despite all that, more Americans are dying on roads and highways than in years, and the sudden and sharp increase has alarmed safety advocates.If the estimates are confirmed, it will be the first time since 2007 that more than 40,000 people have died in motor vehicle accidents in a single year. The 2016 total comes after a 7 percent rise in 2015 and means the two-year increase \u2014 14 percent \u2014 is the largest in more than a half a century.\u201cWhy are we O.K. with this?\u201d Deborah Hersman, the National Safety Council president and chief executive, said at a news conference. \u201cComplacency is killing us.\u201dPart of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing.They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers\u2019 eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist.\u201cIt\u2019s not just talking on the phone that\u2019s a problem today,\u201d said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. \u201cYou now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones.\u201dGovernment officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures.A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped. Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense \u2014 meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense \u2014 drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations.\u201cIt\u2019s still the same things that are killing drivers \u2014 belts, booze and speed,\u201d Mr. Adkins said.About half of all traffic fatalities involve unbelted occupants, and almost a third involve drivers who were impaired by drugs or alcohol, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal government\u2019s main auto-safety agency.In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the state\u2019s 103,000 miles of highways. David Brown, a research associate at the University of Alabama\u2019s Center for Advanced Public Safety, studied the state\u2019s 2016 traffic fatality reports and found an increase in fatalities involving high-speed crashes.\u201cTotal crashes were up less than 5 percent, but fatalities were up 25 percent,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and there\u2019s no one there to deter it.\u201dIn some states, highway speed limits are rising. In recent years, Texas has increased speed limits to 85 miles per hour in some rural areas. About 1,500 miles of roads have a limit of 75 miles per hour or higher.But others say that more needs to be done now on basic road safety issues. \u201cThe way to bring down the rise in deaths is with a wide range of the nuts-and-bolts measures, not self-driving cars,\u201d the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in an interview in October.Mr. Nader said states could reduce traffic deaths simply by requiring rear-seat occupants to wear seatbelts, installing more cameras to catch speeding drivers without a police presence and tightening regulations on heavy trucking.The council is also advocating mandatory motorcycle helmet laws and ignition locks that prevent repeat drunken drivers from operating their vehicles while impaired.The safety council\u2019s figures typically correspond closely to the fatality totals that the N.H.T.S.A. compiles, but they include accidents off public roads and deaths occurring over a longer period after a crash.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Founders\u2019 Grip Tightened After a Spat With an Early Investor", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLightspeed, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, was the first institution to invest in Snap, the company that popularized disappearing messages, and it is now set to reap more than $1 billion from what began as a mere $485,000 investment.At the heart of that is a Lightspeed venture capitalist, Jeremy Liew, and the terms he embedded in his 2012 investment in what was then known as Snapchat. The terms gave Mr. Liew outsize power over the company\u2019s future financing round. That ended up irking Snapchat\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Spiegel, who took steps to reassert control over the company.Mr. Liew and Mr. Spiegel met in March 2012, when Mr. Liew used Facebook to contact Mr. Spiegel, a Stanford University student who had recently started Snapchat with Mr. Murphy, a fraternity brother. At the meeting that followed, Mr. Spiegel said his father was tired of paying Snapchat\u2019s bills. Mr. Liew offered to help.Mr. Liew offered to invest $485,000 in Snapchat, which Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy accepted. The investment was completed in less than two weeks.What Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy paid less attention to were the exact terms that Mr. Liew embedded in the deal. Those terms gave Lightspeed the right of first refusal to invest in a future round of funding and the ability to increase its share of the company in that round. Lightspeed could also take 50 percent of the future round.Such terms effectively let Lightspeed have veto power over investment at Snap. It also made Snap an unattractive investment for other investors \u2014 who would not be able to take as large a stake as they would like in the company.Mr. Liew\u2019s terms prevented the deal. A General Catalyst spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.\u201cI\u2019ve since learned that standard means either the person who\u2019s walking you through documents doesn\u2019t understand them or you could be getting taken advantage of,\u201d Mr. Spiegel continued. \u201cWhen someone says something is standard, just ask why, and why and why and why, until you really understand intricately, I think, how the deal is structured.\u201dMr. Spiegel embarked on a way to work around Lightspeed and Mr. Liew so that he could get the investors he wanted in the future. To do so, he struck a deal with Mr. Liew: Lightspeed would be able to buy a limited number of Snapchat shares at a discount. In exchange, the venture firm would remove its right-of-first-refusal clause and other terms that the Snapchat founders considered onerous.Mr. Spiegel later added provisions of his own to Snapchat\u2019s corporate charter. He authorized the creation of a class of preferred stock, FP Preferred, which would have 10-to-1 voting rights, allowing its holders to exercise far more voting power than holders of regular, or common, stock.Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy control the FP Preferred shares, which also gives them the power to vote on many things, including the rights of other shareholders. The Snap founders\u2019 overwhelming control of the company is now one of the most talked-about features in its I.P.O. filing.Early institutional investors often take board seats with the companies they nurture and become key advisers. Mr. Liew was not chosen to be an early board member, but other venture investors have joined Snap\u2019s board since. Mitch Lasky, a partner at Benchmark, became a board member in 2013 after his firm led an investment round in Snapchat.Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Lasky are close. According to emails between them that have become public, Mr. Lasky has advised Mr. Spiegel on Snap\u2019s valuation and fund-raising, among other things.Mr. Liew remains special to Snap in one way: He was the first and last investor to get special terms from the company. In subsequent deals, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy retained voting control and did not grant preferential treatment to investors.An article on Friday about the relationship between the creators of Snap and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Lightspeed misstated terms that Lightspeed was granted when it became the first investor in Snap. Lightspeed was granted the right of first refusal to invest and the ability to increase its share of the company in the next round of funding for Snap, not in multiple future rounds of funding.Advertisement"}

Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\u201cI don\u2019t even know if they know what they\u2019re protesting,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it the free speech?

{"Headline": "After Visa Ban, Hints of Hidden Tension on Mississippi Campus", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTARKVILLE, Miss. \u2014 Coming from an Iranian city of around 150,000 people, Amir Rezazadeh felt a little out of place when he arrived at Mississippi State University, more than 100 miles from any metropolitan area and deep in the heart of the Bible Belt.But he soon came to like the quiet surroundings, where there was little to distract him from his horticulture studies, and where there was already a group of Middle Eastern students and professors to make him feel welcome.Ignoring half-serious warnings that he could be converted, he even began spending time at the Baptist Student Union, where he honed his English, discussed Christianity and Islam, played games and watched movies, and forged friendships with some of the Mississippi-born students.\u201cSome people say directly to you that it\u2019s a good order,\u201d he said, \u201cthat our country should have this order to ban terrorists.\u201d He finds their position especially hurtful, he said, in light of his fears of what the order might mean for him and his wife, and roughly 80 other students from the seven countries.An estimated 17,000 students in the United States are touched by the ban, many of them in universities in the Northeast and California, where support for the president\u2019s move has been thin. But there are also sizable numbers in universities like Mississippi State, out-of-the-way pockets in states that voted for Donald J. Trump.The move may be bringing to the surface hidden tensions between ambitious Middle Eastern students who have been welcomed to the United States with scholarships and job opportunities, and fellow students and other residents who believe the threat of terrorism necessitates a second look at who is let into the country.That was a different message from that of the governor, Phil Bryant, who has said there were \u201ca lot of people overreacting\u201d to what he believed was a reasonable pause in immigration from the seven countries.Many students and alumni, on Facebook and in public, have expressed support for Mr. Trump\u2019s move. Zach Cooke, 21, an electrical engineering major from Amory, Miss., said that while the ban\u2019s execution was poor, \u201cWith what\u2019s going on at the moment, I think a limit on who can come into the country is not a bad idea.\u201dAt the same time, a vocal segment of the school and town \u2014 county voters went narrowly for Hillary Clinton in a state that was heavily pro-Trump \u2014 has expressed support for the affected students. At a vigil Wednesday night, about 250 people gathered on an open green near the football stadium, carrying candles and holding signs. \u201cImmigrants make America great,\u201d read one.One organizer, a veterinary medicine student named Anna Walker, said she was inspired by a photograph of a protest at Washington Square Park in New York. \u201cI realized that we needed a show of support in smaller communities,\u201d Ms. Walker, 26, said.Once known solely for its agriculture program \u2014 even today fans ring cowbells at football games, and prized herds of cows graze on campus pastures \u2014 Mississippi State has worked in recent years to excel in technology and engineering, recruited scientists from all over the world to its 21,000-student campus and attracted hundreds of millions in dollars in research money, much of it from the federal government.The foreigners who live and work here include many Muslims; an unprepossessing mosque operates in a converted house on a residential street, and there are regular gatherings for holidays like Nowruz, the Persian New Year.The executive order, signed Friday, barred immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. It halted admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely and that of other refugees for 120 days. Though students from those countries can stay, for now, they fear that they cannot leave the United States because they would not be allowed back in, and they wonder how any new vetting procedures being considered by the Trump administration might affect their future studies and travel.\u201cMost people are distracted from school,\u201d said Erfan Alkamil, 25, a senior who received a scholarship from the Yemeni government. \u201cSome have been watching the news all day long. They are waiting to read something that might change the situation, or at least make them comfortable.\u201dMr. Alkamil, like other Middle Eastern students, said they have generally found Mississippi State to be welcoming, even accommodating. His American friends assumed \u2014 correctly \u2014 that as a Muslim, he did not drink alcohol and now offer him juice instead of wine without even asking.Adjustments are needed, though; there is no halal food market, so Mr. Alkamil has learned to like Subway sandwiches, and group meals are often held in private homes. Several of the students said the hardest acclimation was to Southern accents.Negative interactions are rare, students said, but they happen. Kimia Mortezaei, 29, who just finished her Ph.D. in civil engineering, recalled how at the farmer\u2019s market one day, an older woman stopped her to compliment her on her \u201cbeautiful\u201d dress and asked where she was from. She replied that she was from Iran, and the woman asked what she planned to do after she finished her studies.\u201cI said I prefer to stay here,\u201d Ms. Mortezaei recalled. \u201cShe suddenly told me aggressively, \u2018You have to return to your country because you endanger our safety, because you\u2019re a Muslim and you\u2019re a terrorist like ISIS.\u201dWhat this stranger could not know, she added, was that she had left Iran precisely because she disagreed with Iranian politics. \u201cI left Iran because of those problems, and now we are labeled a terrorist,\u201d Ms. Mortezaei said.Even with his finely threaded statement, Mr. Keenum, the university\u2019s president, has been criticized. This 1983 graduate\u2019s Facebook response was typical: \"President Keenum needs to stand up for the nation\u2019s security.\u201d (Mr. Keenum, through a spokesman, declined an interview request.)Outwardly, the campus remains a picture of idyllic detachment from the nation\u2019s larger tumult. On Wednesday the Baptist Student Union held its weekly $3 lunch and prayer meeting. With dogwood and Japanese magnolia trees already in full bloom, many students were wearing shorts.An exception was one woman who made her way across campus dressed in a niqab \u2014 a head covering with only her eyes showing. The woman, who would not give her name but said she was from Saudi Arabia, a country not covered by the ban, said she was very anxious about her future in the United States and called the president\u2019s move \u201cagainst humanity.\u201dAshkan Khalili, 33, an Iranian about to graduate from his aerospace engineering doctoral program, is also beginning to fret. He will soon graduate from his doctoral program and his permit will expire. But he said he was hoping to stay and work in the United States, and repay the country for its hospitality. \u201cNow the question is, do they want me to pay it back, or go back?\u201d he asked.Vahid Daghigh, 32, a Ph.D. engineering student from Iran, said he suddenly found himself feeling jealous of international students not from the seven countries.\u201cFor sure, I will try to stay here,\u201d Mr. Daghigh said. \u201cBut if not, I will go to Canada.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Praise of Hypocrisy", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEverybody lies. But American politics has long rested on a shared understanding of what it is acceptable to lie about, how and to whom.One of the many norms that Donald J. Trump has assaulted since taking office is this tradition of aspirational hypocrisy, of striving, at least rhetorically, to act in accordance with moral values \u2014 to be better. This tradition has set the standard of behavior for government officials and has shaped Americans\u2019 understanding of what their government and their country represent. Over the last four weeks, Mr. Trump has lashed out against any criticism of his behavior, because, as he never tires of pointing out, \u201cWe won.\u201d In requesting the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, however, Mr. Trump made his first public concession to political expectations. Hypocrisy has scored a minor victory in America. This is a good thing.The word \u201chypocrisy\u201d was thrown around a lot during the 2016 presidential campaign. Both Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders accused their respective parties and the country\u2019s elites of hypocrisy. As the election neared, some journalists tried to turn the accusation around on Mr. Trump, taking him to task, for example, for his stand on immigration. If Mr. Trump favored such a hard line on immigration, the logic went, should he not then favor the deportation of his own wife, Melania, who was alleged to have worked while in the United States on a visitor\u2019s visa?The charge of hypocrisy didn\u2019t stick, not so much because it placed its proponents, unwittingly, in the distasteful position of advocating the deportation of someone for a long-ago and common transgression, but because Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t just breaking the rules of political conduct: He was destroying them. He was openly claiming that he abused the system to benefit himself. If he didn\u2019t pay his taxes and got away with it, this made him a good businessman. If he could force himself on women, that made him more of a man. He acted as though this primitive logic were obvious and shared by all.Fascists the world over have gained popularity by calling forth the idea that the world is rotten to the core. In \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism,\u201d Hannah Arendt described how fascism invites people to \u201cthrow off the mask of hypocrisy\u201d and adopt the worldview that there is no right and wrong, only winners and losers. Hypocrisy can be aspirational: Political actors claim that they are motivated by ideals perhaps to a greater extent than they really are; shedding the mask of hypocrisy asserts that greed, vengeance and gratuitous cruelty aren\u2019t wrong, but are legitimate motivations for political behavior.In the last decade and a half, post-Communist autocrats like Vladimir V. Putin and Viktor Orban have adopted this cynical posture. They seem convinced that the entire world is driven solely by greed and hunger for power, and only the Western democracies continue to insist, hypocritically, that their politics are based on values and principles. This stance has breathed new life into the old Soviet propaganda tool of \u201cwhataboutism,\u201d the trick of turning any argument against the opponent. When accused of falsifying elections, Russians retort that American elections are not unproblematic; when faced with accusations of corruption, they claim that the entire world is corrupt.The following weekend brought a whole new kind of throwing off the masks, in the form of Facebook posts by guests at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. There was a picture of what appeared to be an emergency national-security discussion held at a dinner table in front of other guests. There was a selfie with a man who the photographer claimed was named Rick and served as the guardian of the \u201cnuclear football.\u201d This was government not merely demystified but denuded, trivialized. It was the vulgar opposite of hypocrisy.All of this has proved too much not only for the shocked public but, it appears, for at least some of the members of the new administration. Ms. Conway was \u201ccounseled\u201d after her impromptu commercial for the Trump brand, said the president\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer. This was certainly a hypocritical move, considering that Ms. Conway had been following the president\u2019s lead, but a hypocritical nod to decency is preferable to the blatant trampling of decency that preceded it.Mr. Flynn has finally been fired as national security adviser. At his first solo news conference as president on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t think that Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversation with the Russian ambassador in December was wrong: It was Mr. Flynn\u2019s having misled the vice president that got the national security adviser fired.Hard as this was to discern amid all the lashing out at the news media and all the belated campaigning against Hillary Clinton, this explanation represented a step back from the we-won-and-therefore-we-can-do-anything stance. If Mr. Trump had stuck to the throwing-off-the-masks manner of addressing controversy, he could have argued that at the time of Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversation with the Russian ambassador, Barack Obama was a lame-duck president and everyone knew that Mr. Trump, once inaugurated, could revisit the issue of sanctions. This would have been true. He could have also resorted to his trademark what\u2019s-the-big-deal approach to political reasoning: After all, Mr. Flynn has not been accused of divulging any secrets to the Russian ambassador (unlike a 2010 incident in which he was actually accused of sharing secrets). Instead of making any of these arguments, which would have amounted to asserting, once again, that the world is rotten, Mr. Trump opted for transparent and traditional hypocrisy: He claimed to disapprove of lying.This may be the first time that the new administration has made a concession to norms, or at least appearances, of decency. As with any victory of hypocrisy, this one is bittersweet.Masha Gessen is a contributing opinion writer and the author of \u201cThe Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin,\u201d among other books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Facebook Owes to Journalism", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorUnfortunately, his memo ignored two major points \u2014 the role that Facebook and other technology platforms are playing in inadvertently damaging local news media, and the one way they could actually save journalism: with a massive philanthropic commitment.Local news is weak in large part because the business models have collapsed. The main reason: As advertising spending shifted from print, TV and radio to the internet, the money didn\u2019t mostly go to digital news organizations. Increasingly, it goes to Facebook and Google.To be clear, Facebook and Google are not being malicious. This isn\u2019t like the tobacco industry knowingly trying to addict people to a product that kills them. Quite the contrary; these companies are sucking in the lion\u2019s share of digital advertising because the ad products they offer are so damn good. They are saving local businesses massive amounts of money.But just because the result is unintentional doesn\u2019t mean it is fantasy: Newsrooms have been decimated, with basic accountability reporting slashed as a result.A quick word about two other big players, Verizon and Apple. If Verizon, which owns AOL, succeeds in buying Yahoo, the combined company would become the third biggest recipient of digital advertising dollars, earning about 10 percent.I\u2019m not saying that the good stuff \u2014 the mobile revolution, blocking intrusive ads, better marketing options for small businesses \u2014 doesn\u2019t outweigh the bad. And local news organizations absolutely contributed to the problem with their sluggish and often uncreative reaction to the digital revolution. But we still need to accept that \u201cdisruption\u201d does disrupt, and occasionally some of what gets overturned is extremely important. When that happens \u2014 and if adequate market-based solutions haven\u2019t materialized \u2014 philanthropy must step in, too.In the last ten years or so, there has been a bit of an increase in philanthropic support for journalism. But if you look closely, a few things stand out.The next thing you notice is the four names that are missing from the list of 89 foundations that contributed during those two years: the foundations connected to Facebook, Google, Verizon and Apple. The Tulsa Community Foundation donated more to help investigative journalism than those four combined.If we go back further in time, the pattern persists: $145 million was donated for investigative journalism by 374 foundations from 2009 to 2016. There was one from the big four \u2014 $10,000 in 2011 to the Bronx News Network.As a reminder, these companies have not exactly been financially struggling. In 2016, the four posted a combined net income of $88 billion ($19.4 for Google, $10.2 for Facebook, $13 billion for Verizon and $45 billion for Apple). By contrast, the combined net income for The New York Times, Gannett and McClatchy was $41 million.But while training, technology and innovation are critical, what journalism needs most now is money, and lots of it \u2014 to fund full-time local journalists. What these companies have donated so far is too little given how wealthy they are, how much harm they\u2019re (inadvertently) doing \u2014 and how much good they could do.If the leaders of these companies put the equivalent of just 1 percent of their profits, for five years, to the cause, local American journalism would be transformed for the next century.There\u2019s no doubt that the digital revolution \u2014 built in no small part by these four companies \u2014 has made reporting much easier for the journalists still remaining in local newsrooms. But we urgently need far more of those journalists.These companies are among the biggest beneficiaries of the digital disruption that has, among other things, caused the crisis in American journalism. It\u2019s time for the disrupters to solve these problems. They have the money, the know-how and the obligation.An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a Google co-founder.

{"Headline": "Where the Billionaires Come From", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the early 20th century, a young journalist named Napoleon Hill embarked on the assignment of a lifetime.Mr. Hill set out to study hundreds of the nation\u2019s most successful people and write a book about how they became so accomplished.Mr. Hill spent two decades analyzing the life stories, strategies and personal philosophies of entrepreneurs and industrialists like Henry Ford, William Wrigley and John D. Rockefeller.The resulting book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d was published in 1937 and became a self-help guide for everyday Americans seeking great wealth.Mr. Hill tried to convince his readers \u2014 many of them emotionally and financially battered by the Great Depression \u2014 that with the right attitude they, too, could amass a fortune.\u201cOne must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes first did a certain amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, desiring and planning before they acquired money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Eighty years later, Mr. Hill\u2019s egalitarian notions seem to ring hollow on many levels. There is a troublingly wide gap between the economic fortunes of the rich and the poor \u2014 an inequality that has helped unleash political populism in Europe and the United States. (Ironically, President Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire, rode that resentment to the White House.)The idea that the secret to great wealth comes from a combination of discipline, perseverance and belief in yourself sounds Pollyannaish in an era of widespread disillusionment with how the economy and society actually works.Indeed, the chance of becoming a billionaire remains incredibly slim. Wealth-X, a research firm that tracks global wealth, said there were 2,473 billionaires in 2015, an increase of 148 from the year before and about 0.00003 percent of the world\u2019s 7.3 billion people.Still, an optimist like Mr. Hill, who died in 1970, might take heart in one data point from Wealth-X: More than half of the world\u2019s billionaires are self-made.And that number is increasing. Self-made billionaires represent 57 percent of total billionaire wealth, or more than $4.3 trillion, a figure that was up 7 percent from 2014. Meanwhile, the number of billionaires with inherited wealth \u2014 323, according to Wealth-X \u2014 fell by 29 percent from 2014.The booming technology sector has minted many of the recent self-made titans \u2014 entrepreneurs like Travis Kalanick, a co-founder and the chief executive of Uber, and the co-founders of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk.\u201cMany people have great ideas. But to grow an idea into a huge business is a different matter,\u201d said Maya Imberg, custom research director at Wealth-X. \u201cBillionaires tend to be incredibly focused.\u201dIn his book, Mr. Hill tried to show that qualities like focus and perseverance were within everyone.He told the story of how Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he perfected the incandescent electric light bulb and how Henry Ford pushed his engineers to develop the V-8 motor despite the technical challenges.\u201cA thousand people could be pointed out who have a better education than Ford\u2019s, yet they live in poverty because they do not possess the right plan for the accumulation of money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Wealth-X is the big data equivalent to Mr. Hill\u2019s one-man reporting project. The firm employs about 150 researchers across the world who collect and analyze data about the richest people.Based on that data, you may have a slightly better chance of becoming a billionaire if you went to Harvard, which was the most popular school among billionaires by a wide margin. (Stanford came in second.)Engineering degrees were the most popular among billionaires, followed by business, according to Approved Index, another firm that researches the wealthy. There are some notable billionaires with humanities degrees, like the financier Carl Icahn, who majored in philosophy at Princeton. Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has a teaching degree.It is well known that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft dropped out of Harvard to start their businesses. But they are not alone. About 30 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires never obtain a college degree.\u201cIt is counterintuitive to what you are told growing up,\u201d said Grace Garland, head of research at Approved Index.If the sheer numbers are any guide, your chances of becoming a billionaire as a woman are especially remote. In 2015, 140 of the 148 people who broke into the billionaire ranks were men. All of the top 10 billionaires are men, according to Wealth-X.And yet for all the male-dominated, Ivy League exclusivity of the billionaire\u2019s club, self-help gurus and ordinary people continue to pore over the biographies and public statements of the ultrawealthy, looking for the secret sauce.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, and the investor Warren E. Buffett are said to be avid readers. Mr. Gates once said that \u201creading is still the main way that I both learn new things and test my understanding.\u201dMr. Collins said many of these wealthy men had parents who helped them to succeed.Mr. Gates\u2019 parents arranged for him to take time off from classes during his senior year in high school to work on code for the electrical grid management system at a local power plant.Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of Virgin Group, said his father, a lawyer, taught him the importance of dreaming big and instilled in him a desire for excellence.Mr. Collins said that while he was growing up in Australia, his father made him read \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d and taught him how to think about making money in different ways to accumulate wealth.\u201cThe people who say that entrepreneurs are born, that is ridiculous. They are made,\u201d he said.\u201cYou need grit and unwavering personal confidence. Those are nonnegotiable in a billionaire,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chelsea-Liverpool Match Fails to Live Up to Their Rivalry", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerLIVERPOOL, England \u2014 This time, there would be no knockout blow. There would be no sense that once again, a meeting between Liverpool and Chelsea would decide something, would decide everything. This time there would be only bruising, and bruises heal.By most standards, the rivalry between these two clubs is a young one, a distinctly 21st-century phenomenon, hardly older than Facebook. But since 2003, they have conjured from nothing one of the fiercest feuds that English soccer can offer.The flames have been fueled, in part, by the sense that each team sees in the other its polar opposite. It is telling that the songs Liverpool fans deploy to deride Chelsea focus on Chelsea\u2019s supposed lack of history, and that Chelsea supporters\u2019 rebuttal concentrates on Liverpool\u2019s more recent failings.Just as important as the contrast in self-image, however, is that their meetings have \u2014 at least since 2003, the year the rivalry erupted \u2014 tended to be so high-stakes.They have not always been pretty. Jorge Valdano, at the time a director at Real Madrid, once claimed that Chelsea and Liverpool\u2019s encounters summed up all that was wrong with soccer. But they have rarely been less than significant. With remarkable frequency, these games have defined one or the other team\u2019s season; more than once, they have been decisive for the Premier League as a whole.None, perhaps, have been quite so significant as Chelsea\u2019s victory in 2003 that took it to the Champions League at Liverpool\u2019s expense. That match was a key moment in persuading Abramovich to save the club from financial despair. And none have been quite so raucous as Liverpool\u2019s revenge in 2005, when it knocked Chelsea out of the Champions League at the semifinal stage on the way to its triumph in the final in Istanbul.But those games were just the start. There have been finals in both the F.A. Cup and the League Cup, won by Chelsea. It was Liverpool that ended Chelsea\u2019s 86-match home unbeaten streak in 2008, and Liverpool\u2019s win at Stamford Bridge last season kick-started the run that eventually cost Coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho his job.Twice, the league title itself has been snatched or surrendered: in 2010, when Chelsea won by 2-0 at Anfield to seal a championship for Carlo Ancelotti, and in 2014, when Chelsea effectively crushed Liverpool\u2019s hopes of a first title since 1990 with the same score.Tuesday\u2019s edition seemed ready to attain a similar status. It had the air of a turning point: A Chelsea win would have moved Manager Antonio Conte and his players within realistic touching distance of the Premier League title; a Liverpool victory might have proved the point at which Chelsea\u2019s advantage at the summit of the league standings started to erode.In the event, neither happened; there was no knockout blow, only minor damage in a 1-1 draw. Chelsea\u2019s wounds will, in all probability, heal a little sooner. Conte\u2019s team could have won had Diego Costa converted a late, disputed penalty kick, but Chelsea still managed to extend its Premier League lead. With Arsenal having lost at home to Watford and Tottenham having tied lowly Sunderland on the road, Chelsea sits 9 points ahead of second place.A share of the spoils was less palatable to Liverpool.Manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp was in an ebullient mood afterward, insisting that if most fans had been offered in the summer \u201ca time machine, to take us to this point in the season, in this position, with 15 games to go and a full squad,\u201d they would have gladly accepted it.They would, of course: Liverpool was not expected to mount a title challenge this year. The received wisdom, at the start of the season, was that Klopp\u2019s target in his first full year in England would be to restore Liverpool to the Champions League, once a frequent destination for Liverpool but, since 2009, a most elusive goal. This draw may not have advanced the club\u2019s hope of winning the league, but it has not killed it off entirely, either. There remains a distant glimmer of hope. That represents progress; it just does not feel like that.To some extent, Klopp has only himself to blame. Liverpool is a club predisposed to inflated hope, and a searing start to the season \u2014 victories over Arsenal and Chelsea on the road \u2014 served as license to dream. A free-flowing attack, scorers of more Premier League goals than any other, masked deficiencies on defense and in goal. Klopp\u2019s bullish charisma seemed to have rubbed off on his players, and Liverpool\u2019s absence from other European competitions seemed to negate fears over the holes in the squad.And then, over a bitter January, it all fell apart. Injury, bureaucracy and international commitments deprived Klopp of several key players. Elimination from the two domestic tournaments in the space of a week highlighted just how thin his resources, beyond his top 14 or 15 players, really are. He has been accused of lacking a Plan B, an alternative way of playing to break down stubborn defenses \u2014 a somewhat woolly concept in English soccer still regarded as the hallmark of a great coach.Klopp has sensed that; he made a point Monday night of telling Liverpool \u2014 and he gave the impression of speaking about the fans as much as the players \u2014 not to lose its nerve. Everything is still in play, he said; the season is far from over.He is right. Liverpool may not be able to win the league, not from here, not with Chelsea running out of challenging opponents and far from running out of steam, but then that was only ever a hope. Liverpool and Klopp remain on track \u2014 more or less \u2014 for what they were supposed to achieve this season. That it feels like a disappointment is not a sign that they have lost their way. It indicates, instead, that they have simply traveled faster, and further, than anyone expected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Battle Fake News, Ukrainian Show Features Nothing but Lies", "Date": "2017-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKiev JournalKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The studio lights dim, and the anchor taps a stack of papers on her desk and directs a steely gaze toward the television cameras.What appears to be a nightly newscast is about to begin, only with a very Ukrainian twist: Everything is a lie, from start to finish.In other parts of the world, viewers might suspect the evening news is just a bunch of lies, but watching the weekly broadcast of \u201cStopFake News,\u201d they can be certain of it. The group is highly respected in journalistic circles here in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, for its specialty of debunking fake news.If fact checkers cannot prove that a story published or broadcast by another news media outlet is false, it will not be featured in the weekly airing of \u201cStopFake News.\u201d\u201cWe discuss the stories, and if an editor says, \u2018Can we disprove this? Is this a lie?\u2019 then, yes, we can use it,\u201d Ms. Gontar said of the editorial process. \u201cIt is investigative journalism, with a twist.\u201dThe journalism department at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy oversees the program and provides the basement television studio where, once a week, all the lies are gathered in one place.The studio is on a side street of red brick apartment blocks in an up-and-coming neighborhood of Kiev known as the Podil, or the Skirt, because it flows down a hill.It is a district of warehouses and reclaimed factory spaces, now abounding with coffee shops, where various projects have sprung up as creative responses to the East-West conflict that started in Ukraine three years ago. Not everything can be left to the army.A former shipyard, for example, became home to Izolatsia studio, an art collective displaced from Donetsk in eastern Ukraine that focuses on topics such as architecture and urban development in conflict zones.\u201cStopFake News\u201d is no Onion-style satire, but rather positions itself as serious public service journalism, identifying fake news and debunking it on the air. That is because Kiev, with its running battle with Moscow, was plagued by fake news long before concern over the problem spiked in Western Europe and the United States.During the Ukraine crisis in 2014, manipulative and often outright invented news poured in from Russia on satellite television and websites and into sympathetic local newspapers.Recurring themes emerged, becoming the talk at water coolers around the capital: An Islamic State training camp had opened in Ukraine; President Petro O. Poroshenko was a drunk and sometimes appeared inebriated in public; nationalists had taken to lynching or, in one infamous case, crucifying Russian-speaking children.Ukraine banned some Russian television broadcasts, a practice that raised free speech objections, and yet the fake news still circulates online. \u201cStopFake News\u201d has chosen public debunking, not banning, as the best defense \u2014 and has shown it can become its own form of appealing entertainment.Russia, though, has been such a fountain of fake news inside Ukraine that debunking factual errors in Russian propaganda became the specialty of StopFake.Ukraine has become a testing ground \u201cfor a lot of Russia\u2019s evil strategies,\u201d Oksana Syroyid, a deputy speaker of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, said in an interview. \u201cUnfortunately, we have to put up with this. Ukraine\u2019s experience can be used by Europe and America to understand the real Russian threat.\u201dLest something true accidentally slips into the program\u2019s report and damages the group\u2019s credibility, a crack team of editors and fact checkers combs through all potential stories.\u201cStopFake News\u201d is a peculiar kind of news. For three years, the headlines have declared what did not happen and what was not said, and the heroism or villainy of people who never existed.In story after story \u2014 more than 1,000 have been reported so far \u2014 the journalists reveal laws that were never passed, insults that were never uttered and riots that never happened on quiet town squares. \u201cThe Exclusive Interview That Wasn\u2019t,\u201d reads one headline.Yevhen Fedchenko, a journalism professor at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, helped start StopFake in March 2014 to heighten public awareness of Russian misinformation at the peak of the Ukraine crisis.The group reported some of the biggest nonstories of the war. In 2014, Russia\u2019s state-owned Channel 1 broadcast a now infamous report that Ukrainian nationalists had crucified a Russian child on the central square in Slovyansk after the Ukrainian Army expelled Russian-backed separatists from the town.The report enraged Russian-speaking separatists already taking up arms against Kiev, throwing gasoline on the fire of the uprising in the east.\u201cIt was a good piece of propaganda because it was produced for prime-time television, it was emotional, and it was totally groundless,\u201d Mr. Fedchenko said.German propagandists in World War I first used the story line, claiming that the British were crucifying German soldiers, he said, and it has been a staple of European war propaganda since.\u201cIt touches themes of cultural war and religious, civilizational conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cAs propaganda, it is very effective.\u201dWhat began as a volunteer-run website grew into a news organization with 26 paid employees and researchers in several European countries and the United States, funded by grants. The show airs on about 30 Ukrainian television stations.\u201cThe more outrageous it is, the more likely it is to be on the program,\u201d Ms. Gontar, the anchor, said. Though the stories are \u201cpatently absurd,\u201d she said, she plays it straight on air. \u201cPeople should take it seriously.\u201dRecently, the show debunked a Russian news report that President Poroshenko had, while drunk, thoughtlessly given a soccer ball as a gift to a Ukrainian soldier whose leg had been amputated because of a war injury.Other recurring false themes are that the Ukrainian government planned to put Hitler\u2019s face on its paper money and that western, Ukrainian-speaking regions of the country have declared independence.Ms. Gontar studiously refutes each one, then wraps up her weekly report with a promise of more to come.\u201cWe will keep following the propaganda and catch the lies,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you next week.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He said in a phone interview that his reaction to the graffiti, which he noticed immediately, must have been written on his face, and he soon attracted the attention of another commuter.\u201cThere was a lady sitting across from me under the map, and she said, \u2018Oh that\u2019s absolutely horrible,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Do you think there\u2019s any way we can erase it?\u2019\u201dMr. Nied had many times used a Sharpie when he had meant to use a dry-erase marker, and he knew from experience that alcohol would work to erase the graffiti.\u201cA light bulb went on, and I just asked, \u2018Does anyone have hand sanitizer?\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and Purell,\u201d Mr. Locke wrote. \u201cWithin about two minutes, all the Nazi symbolism was gone.\u201dMr. Nied said that the episode had lasted less than five minutes and that the passengers were able to erase the graffiti before the train reached 96th Street. He returned a bottle of hand sanitizer to one of the riders, apologizing for having used most of it.\u201cWe sat down and glanced around at each other and settled back into the commute,\u201d he said.Both men said they understood that there might be skepticism about their accounts.\u201cI understand the criticism, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t have an answer for it,\u201d Mr. Locke said. \u201cI would probably be suspicious, too, if I didn\u2019t take the pictures.\u201dDetective Ahmed Nasser of the New York Police Department said that while the episode had not been reported on Saturday, other reports of anti-Semitic graffiti had been logged recently: A recycling container downtown was reportedly defaced with the words \u201cJews are a virus\u201d in black ink in January, and swastikas were found etched on a northbound F train this month.A separate episode, in which a passenger on a B train saw that a swastika on an American flag had been transformed into a message of love, drew a comment from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday.On Saturday night, Mr. Nied sent a text to his wife, Jacquline, and to a friend with a photograph of the graffiti, but he did not consider the prospect that someone else might have taken photos.

Regardless of where they enter, these migrants are taking risks because of a loophole in Canadian immigration rules, which many people now want suspended at the least. Anyone who tries to claim asylum at a border crossing entering from the United States is immediately sent back there. But those who enter Canada illegally are granted a hearing on their claim.

{"Headline": "Democrats Set Sights on Blocking Trump\u2019s Labor Secretary Pick", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Thursday, Democrats will have their best chance to topple one of President Trump\u2019s cabinet choices when Andrew F. Puzder testifies before the Senate to become the country\u2019s next labor secretary.\u201cThey ought to withdraw the nomination of Puzder before he further embarrasses this administration and further exposes the hypocrisy of President Trump,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.Signs of the fast-food restaurant executive\u2019s vulnerability have been swirling in recent weeks as his hearing was delayed several times because of the complexity of his vast financial portfolio, including millions of dollars in preferred stock in the parent company of Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr., CKE. Protesters have swarmed those fast-food restaurants across the country to express outrage that the person chosen to look out for America\u2019s wage workers has a record of fighting for owners\u2019 interests. On Thursday, more than a thousand federal contractors are planning to converge on the Capitol to demonstrate in opposition to Mr. Puzder.Mr. Jealous said Republicans should remember that Mr. Trump promised to protect working-class Americans, adding, \u201cIf the G.O.P. in the Senate want to guarantee that he keeps his promise, then Puzder should not be confirmed.\u201dThe proceedings are also likely to get personal. Opponents of Mr. Puzder have made his contentious divorce from nearly three decades ago an issue, surfacing since-recanted allegations from his former wife that he abused her in the 1980s.According to the records, the encounter caused \u201cbruises and contusions to the chest, back, shoulders and neck,\u201d two ruptured disks, two bulging disks and \u201csevere and permanent damage.\u201dGeorge Thompson, a spokesman for Mr. Puzder, said on Tuesday evening that the contents of the filing were not new and that Mr. Puzder and his former wife are now friends. He called the release a smear campaign.\u201cPerpetuating these retracted 30-year-old allegations and an impulsive decision to appear on a talk show is nothing more than a desperate attempt to tarnish Andy Puzder at the expense of Lisa and their family,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.The allegations that Mr. Puzder had assaulted his former wife have been circulating around in Congress, where lawmakers of both parties gathered in the past week for screenings of a 1990 episode of the \u201cOprah Winfrey Show\u201d in which Mr. Puzder\u2019s former spouse appeared in disguise to discuss her story of abuse. The Oprah Winfrey Network has not made the video publicly available \u2014 it provided a special copy for senators \u2014 but discussion of the old footage has been buzzing among senators and congressional staff members ahead of the hearing.\u201cIt really raised some very troubling issues and I think has to be the equation of how we view this candidate,\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in an interview Tuesday.The effect of the tape remains unclear. Four Republican senators on the committee \u2014 Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 have not committed to backing Mr. Puzder.Ms. Collins said on Monday that she was \u201creviewing the other information that has come to light\u201d and that she looked forward to exploring it at the hearing. Mr. Scott said that he wanted to see how Mr. Puzder performed in person before making a decision. However, he acknowledged that he had concerns about Mr. Puzder\u2019s failure to pay taxes on an undocumented housekeeper.Although Mr. Puzder is not the first of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to fail to pay taxes or employ an undocumented immigrant, critics say that the oversights are particularly egregious for a businessman who would lead the Labor Department. Ms. Murray said that the revelation about Mr. Puzder\u2019s housekeeper, which emerged only last week, was ironic considering Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to crack down on illegal immigration.Despite all of the criticism of Mr. Puzder, whose brash personality is sometimes compared to Mr. Trump\u2019s, most Republicans and members of the business world have rallied around him.State restaurant groups in Maine and Alaska have sent letters to Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski to express support for Mr. Puzder, hailing him as an experienced job creator. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to lawmakers arguing that Mr. Puzder\u2019s executive experience would make him less likely to impose onerous regulations.\u201cHe will know better than any other secretary the impact that the department\u2019s actions have on companies and the economy,\u201d wrote Neil Bradley, the group\u2019s chief policy officer.Even Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, emerged from the sidelines this week to urge Republicans to stick with Mr. Puzder. Pointing to the nominee\u2019s humble beginnings, Mr. Romney said he was certain that Mr. Puzder could relate to the plight of regular workers.If Democrats are unsuccessful at blocking Mr. Puzder at the committee on Thursday, it will not be their final opportunity to pick off one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top nominees. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, who has been tapped to be the White House\u2019s budget director, is expected to get a vote on Thursday from the full Senate.Mr. McCain described Mr. Mulvaney as \u201canti-defense\u201d on Tuesday while he lamented his vote to remove troops from Afghanistan. The margin of error for Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s confirmation appeared to have narrowed.\u201cI\u2019m voting against him \u2014 most likely,\u201d Mr. McCain said.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

With food, wine and child care, living rooms are transformed into havens where immigrants can speak freely with lawyers and advocates about their rights and risks.Planning sessions for the group, with about 300 members, take place in one member\u2019s rowhouse and in the basement of a co-op in the neighborhood. Participants bring casseroles, desserts and their children.\u201cYou really do bond over food, it really helps build community,\u201d said Ms. Castillo, 37, whose husband, Victor Pacheco, 38, is a Chilean immigrant. Members have taken Colombian, Mexican and vegan dishes to the gatherings. \u201cEveryone is trying each other\u2019s cultural food. And I think that that is intentional.\u201dPeople have opened their homes to neighbors and strangers in ways they have not done before. Some who have never been politically active and who may not have entertained much at home have found that a living room can be a valuable asset when looking for a place to organize and expand their community. And at a time when many people, particularly immigrants, feel vulnerable, a private home can provide refuge.Attendees wanted to know what would happen if they were deported. Would they have access to their money in banks? Should they set up a power of attorney for their children? They also had questions about how to deal with subway harassment and school bullying. \u201cThe mood was a bit tense at first,\u201d said Ms. Meyer, 32. \u201cIt\u2019s a little awkward to go to a stranger\u2019s house. But as the evening went on, people relaxed.\u201d On the way out, some attendees hugged.The dinners have also helped forge closer bonds among neighbors, like the one that has blossomed between Ms. Meyer and her next-door neighbor, Reba Frankel, 37, after the two hosted a December dinner with their spouses in their Sunset Park co-op. \u201cWe had traded bread recipes and they cat-sat for us when we went out of town,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cNow we are going to protests together and organizing together and email every day.\u201dEven the youngest participants have noticed a change. \u201cOur children are bonding,\u201d said Ms. Castillo, who has two young daughters. \u201cMy daughter said to me, \u2018The only good thing about Trump winning is that you formed Love Trumps Hate and I get to make all these new friends.\u2019\u201dIn late January, Ms. Khan-Cullors, a founder of Black Lives Matter, and about a dozen other activists held an emergency meeting in a two-bedroom house in Santa Monica, after protesting the immigration executive order at Los Angeles International Airport all day. In a gathering that lasted until midnight and grew to 40 people, a legal adviser broke down the implications of the order for the guests. \u201cI need to be with people right now,\u201d Ms. Khan-Cullors, 33, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI need to know that we have each other\u2019s back. We\u2019re not just going to live online in the social media world.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s where we\u2019re producing the next iteration of where the movement is going,\u201d she said.There is also a long history of political organizing in the home. Fledgling groups often do not have the resources to rent office space, so living rooms make viable alternatives. At the consciousness-raising groups of the late 1960s, for example, women gathered in one another\u2019s homes in New York and around the country to discuss feminism.\u201cTo the extent that women have power, it tends to be in the home,\u201d Gloria Steinem, a founder of Ms. magazine, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe goddess of the hearth is a woman, for God\u2019s sake.\u201dConsider Solidarity Sundays. Three mothers in Alameda, Calif., started the Facebook group a year ago, rattled by the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and the shooting in nearby San Bernardino, Calif. For a year, the group, with about 800 members, gathered monthly at two of the organizers\u2019 homes to eat, drink and contact elected officials about specific policy concerns, like police violence. Babysitters would watch the children. Most of the members are women or identify as women.And then the election happened. Three days later, the group held an emergency meeting at the home of Kate Schatz, one of the founders. The gathering, with 100 attendees crammed into a living room, was \u201csuper intense,\u201d said Ms. Schatz, 38, the author of \u201cRad American Women A-Z\u201d (City Lights, 2015). \u201cWe spent the whole time brainstorming.\u201d Now the group has 12,000 members, with about 100 chapters meeting in 27 states. Manhattan has four chapters, Queens one and Brooklyn six.Many of the attendees have never been politically active before, she said. For Ms. Thieme, 36, these monthly gatherings have served as a political awakening, a chance to flex a long-dormant political muscle. As her neighbors made phone calls, she refilled their cocktail glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going to be happening in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what I can count on is that there is going to be a ton of rad women in my house who want to take action.\u201dChapters have also opened in more conservative parts of the country, like at the home of Kathryn Mahaney in Bay Saint Louis, on the Gulf coast of Mississippi. Last Sunday, she hosted her first event, with around a dozen guests drinking bourbon and eating king cake, a traditional Mardi Gras dessert. While other chapters focused on political actions, Ms. Mahaney, 33, saw hers as a way for politically progressive neighbors to find allies in a deeply conservative community.By opening her home, Ms. Mahaney hopes to make liberals feel less isolated. \u201cMany of them feel that they have to hide,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are afraid to signal their political beliefs because of the fear of retribution from friends and family, as well as from strangers.\u201dAnd in Maplewood, N.J., about 20 people gathered at the stately home of Kate McCaffrey on a recent Saturday evening. Mohammed, 35, and his wife, Hamida, 30, refugees from Homs, Syria, who asked to withhold their last names to protect family still in Syria, had spent two days preparing a dozen dishes from their new home in Elizabeth. Guests, mostly from New Jersey and New York City, paid $50 a person to sample the couple\u2019s hummus, tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves and kibbeh. The money collected is donated to the families of the Syrian cooks, who buy the ingredients and prepare the meal. The guests ranged in age from their late 20s through their mid 60s.With a fire blazing in the living room, guests gathered around two large tables for dinner. Mohammed and Hamida sat alongside their friends, Rawda, 30, and Haian, 40, refugees from Homs who also requested that their last names be withheld. Rawda shared pictures on her iPhone of the couple\u2019s three children playing in the snow in front of their Elizabeth home. Without a translator present, guests struggled to communicate using translation apps they loaded on their smartphones. \u201cDo you know Ikea?\u201d one woman asked.Mohammed looked baffled until she showed him a photograph of the furniture store on her iPhone. \u201cYes! Ik-ea,\u201d he said, pronouncing the name with a soft \u201cI\u201d. \u201cWe have that in Jordan.\u201dAlthough a few people mentioned politics, the conversation mostly stayed light, by design. Sitting down to dinner \u201cis normalizing in the best possible sense of the word,\u201d said Melina Macall, 53, a founder of the club. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conversation about something awful. They\u2019ve had awfulness after awfulness. It just gives everyone a break.\u201dMs. McCaffrey and Ms. Macall started the Syria Supper Club on Sept. 11, 2016, as a way to \u201creimagine the day,\u201d said Ms. McCaffrey, 50. Initially, the women organized two events a month. Since the election, demand has ballooned.In January, they organized 15 events held in various suburban homes in the area. \u201cNot everyone wants to go to a demonstration,\u201d Ms. McCaffrey said. Dining together \u201cis a concrete way of supporting refugees by showing hospitality. It\u2019s very calming and soothing just to share a meal together. You feel like you\u2019re living your values.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The second, wearing red-and-black glasses and dogged by the fear that he did not belong \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m really not that good at math,\u201d he had told me earlier \u2014 lingered at the snack cart. \u201cLeave some for the rest of us, J. J.,\u2019\u2019 demanded the third, gently elbowing him aside.To Mira Bernstein, a BEAM instructor and a leading figure in the extracurricular math ecosystem that incubates many of the nation\u2019s scientists and engineers, the scene was unremarkable, except for one striking feature: None of the children were wealthy, and few were white or Asian.Try your hand at five math problems given to students at BEAM. The questions require no knowledge beyond addition and multiplication \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re easy.The 76 students, drawn from New York City public schools with low-income populations, were embarking on a curriculum that they would have to continue on their own during the school year to be eligible to apply for a second, even more intense math summer program, BEAM 7. That application is due at the end of this month, and with it comes a verdict of sorts on their membership in a math-geek subculture where it can be astonishingly difficult to find others who look like them.\u201cThis is probably more math-y black and Hispanic kids than I\u2019ve seen in my whole career,\u201d said Dr. Bernstein, who received a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from Harvard in the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201dBEAM is short for Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, and this, the program\u2019s first year of BEAM 6, for students who had just completed the sixth grade, is what many within elite math circles see as the most promising effort yet to diversify their ranks. The four weeks, spent in a school near City Hall, would be intense: four hours of math a day taught by 10 experienced math teachers, several of them Ph.D.\u2019s. There would be no prepping for standardized tests or effort to cover school material at a faster pace. Instead, as in the elite summer programs that Mr. Zaharopol had himself attended, BEAM focused on the kind of creative problem-solving that mathematicians say lie at the heart of the discipline.And because one summer would not be anywhere near enough to equip the BEAM 6-ers with the same kind of math preparation as their more affluent peers, the real goal of the founders \u2014 a mix of hedge-fund millionaires and professional mathematicians \u2014 was to hook them enough to want to keep at it.A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who suspended his graduate studies in algebraic topology to launch BEAM, Mr. Zaharopol had some idea of what his students were up against.By age 12, many attendees of the highly selective programs on which BEAM was modeled had already won regional math contests and completed online math courses in subjects like number theory. Some had been introduced to advanced math in school honors programs or by math teams. Many were the children of scientists and engineers, or of well-off parents who turned to math as another way to give their children a competitive edge in the battle for admission to elite colleges.By contrast, BEAM students come from environments where \u201cmath is not in the air,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said.\u201cThey did a study that shows white kids have more chances,\u201d he said once, remembering a fragment of something he had been told. Then he shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really true.\u201dTracing Jonathan\u2019s path through the program and into the school year provides a glimpse of both how easy it might be to nurture a love of math, and how daunting. It is also a testament to the persuasive power of friendship, unfolding over several months in the context of prime numbers and polyhedron sculptures.Jonathan, who chose J. J. as his summer nickname, had done everything in his power to avoid attending BEAM, which is financed by individual donors and foundations, and is free to participants. Then 11, he was chosen by his school to take the program\u2019s admissions test, and hid the acceptance letter upon receiving it last spring at school.When his mother, Kiana Ashburn, 32, found the letter buried at the bottom of his backpack, she waved off his pleas to go to the karate camp she had signed him up for. \u201cYou need to get a good education so you can get a good job and have a good future,\u201d she told him that afternoon in their sparely furnished rowhouse in the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx.She often made Jonathan repeat what he was to do if he were ever stopped: \u201cJust do what he says, and like, don\u2019t try to resist,\u201d he recited.She thought of math as a field that \u201cusually Asians dominate,\u2019\u2019 she said. It would not protect him from police violence, she knew, or the other things she feared. Her brother had spent time in prison.\u201cBut it could act as a buffer,\u201d she remembers thinking.Omar Pineda Jr. was the counselor assigned to escort them, but it was Emyr Willis, 11, who broke the ice. \u201cHello,\u201d he greeted them with the formality they would come to see as his trademark. \u201cI am the both the emissary and ambassador from my school.\u201dThays Garcia, also 11, was the group\u2019s third member.\u201cI love math,\u201d she said, her face lighting up when asked why she had agreed to spend her summer doing math problems.Her stepfather, Kevin Rincon, who dropped her off each morning, said he had taught himself algebra while serving a prison sentence for a drug felony.As she breezed ahead several grade levels, her friends gave her a nickname that she proudly took on: \u201cCalculator.\u201dBut Khan, Mr. Rincon also knew, was designed to foster basic math literacy, not \u201cthe theoretic understanding of exactly what is going on,\u201d as he put it in his email to BEAM. \u201cI want new possibilities and worlds opened for her to see.\u201dJonathan did not know it, but he had placed comfortably in the top half of the students admitted to BEAM, who in turn had been drawn from the top quarter of the 400 nominated by schools or parents to take the admissions test. He had spotted patterns and tried solutions that others had not.He had also placed above grade level on New York\u2019s statewide math test, a distinction shared by only 21 percent of the city\u2019s sixth graders, and just 7 percent of sixth graders who are black.He and Thays and Emyr were exactly the kinds of promising students for which BEAM had been created.But it had not been easy to get it going. Some potential supporters objected to devoting resources to high-performing minority students rather than the much larger group performing below grade level.In interviews, directors of established elite math programs expressed dismay at the way their own enrollments reflect those patterns.Most are nonprofits with limited money, organized by trained mathematicians for the benefit of students whose passion for math often leaves them at the bottom of social hierarchies at school. Some offer scholarships, but most said it was often difficult to find qualified students from underrepresented groups.There are other reasons for career disparities beyond who goes to math camp, of course, like the expense of postsecondary education and an effectively segregated public school system that provides poorer-quality education to many minority students.But the math divide is growing as more white and Asian parents enroll their children, even when they don\u2019t show a knack for numbers, in online math classes and the weekly math circles that have sprouted on university campuses. And the lack of enrichment-math experiences for black and Latino students, mathematicians and educators say, makes it harder for even high achievers in good schools to compete for spots at the colleges that serve as a springboard for plum jobs in science and technology.BEAM was founded in 2011 with help from Sandor Lehoczky, a senior trader at Jane Street and a onetime math team champion, who is known for subjecting job applicants to math puzzles. The math whizzes he hires, he said, have been \u201cswimming in a culture of math\u2019\u2019 from an early age.But BEAM\u2019s selective camp for students from low-income backgrounds who had just completed seventh grade has had mixed results.\u201cAlthough our students make tremendous progress,\u201d Mr. Zaharopol wrote in a 2015 grant proposal, \u201cit is clear that many of them, even our highest achievers, are still well below their potential.\u201dBEAM 6, designed for students who have just completed sixth grade, he said, reflected what they had learned: \u201cWe need to start earlier and we need to keep them for longer,\u2019\u2019 he said.At BEAM, Jonathan turned the lights off when he walked in and out of classrooms. He sped from one end of the room to another on his rolling chair, popping in on fellow students who were supposed to be working. He seemed more focused on complaining about the lunch food than zeroing in on logic.\u201cMathematicians love the struggle,\u201d one of the teachers repeated as a kind of mantra when students complained. \u201cWhen you feel uncomfortable, you\u2019re learning.\u201dBut whether students like Jonathan were having trouble with the math, were unprepared or were simply not trying was a subject of debate.In their weekly faculty meetings, the teachers often marveled at their students\u2019 progress. \u201cI can\u2019t get them to stop doing math,\u201d said Giselle George, who teaches at a public middle school on the Lower East Side.But teaching advanced concepts to students who had not all had the chance to learn certain basic math skills, like the laws of exponents, proved more difficult than some had anticipated.\u201cI find they\u2019re not very good at self-advocating when they\u2019re lost or bored,\u201d said another teacher, Marcelle Good. \u201cI guess they\u2019re used to being lost or bored.\u201dDuring the program\u2019s second week, Jonathan was a focus for both their hopes and their frustrations.\u201cHow do you get kids who haven\u2019t had the exposure the tools to even realize that math is something they like?\u201d Dr. Bernstein lamented.\u201cI\u2019m open to suggestions for how to reach him,\u201d said another. \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty big distraction in my class.\u201dBeyond their views, though, there were signs that Jonathan was finding other ways to connect to math.A few days after the challenge problem was posted in the hallway, he was lingering by the snack cart again when Thays arrived.\u201cHey, Thays,\u201d he said, brightening slightly at the sight of his commuting partner.He had infuriated her that morning by snapping a close-up picture of her nostrils with his phone, but had quickly redeemed himself by directing her to the sole empty seat on the crowded train.He shrugged, looking sideways at her.\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said.By the second week of camp, Jonathan, Emyr and Thays knew the passcodes to one another\u2019s phones so they could trade games. Thays and Jonathan had a running Subway Surfers phone game competition; Emyr sought to inspire the others with his passion for Pokemon Go.But they didn\u2019t share everything. Thays did not divulge, for instance, that her biological father, whom she rarely saw, had canceled plans for a trip she was looking forward to later in the summer.His friends did not know that Jonathan\u2019s father was a subway train conductor whom he had last seen about a year ago, in a chance encounter at the 125th street subway station near his school.Emyr did not talk about the bullies who had tormented him in elementary school.Thays, whose parents and stepfather are Dominican, had been to a protest some months earlier with her stepfather. She had written a poem about it.Jonathan had a vivid memory of the video his mother had shown him earlier that month: \u201cThere was a kid in the back of the car,\u201d he said, referring to the death of Philando Castile.Trying to translate, I asked Emyr if he had heard of Black Lives Matter. Emyr\u2019s father is Jamaican, his mother Puerto Rican.\u201cNo,\u201d Emyr said. \u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201dJonathan, looking up from his phone, took the opportunity to fill him in.\u201cHow can you not know what Black Lives Matter is?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s about how black people are getting killed by cops and it needs to stop.\u201dSeeking to lighten the trip home that afternoon, Mr. Pineda asked what they recalled of their day.Thays volunteered the simple riddle Dr. Bernstein had asked in her \u201cCodes Codes Codes\u201d class: \u201cI\u2019m thinking of a number from zero to 15. You have to guess my number by asking me four yes or no questions.\u201dThen Thays added the problem\u2019s final complication: \u201cHow many questions does it take if I\u2019m allowed to lie once?\u201dAs they deduced the strategy, they were working up to a harder problem, related to Hamming codes, the error-correcting codes that underlie digital storage and communications.\u201cThere\u2019s also something called binary,\u201d Thays informed Jonathan and Emyr.The girls she had become friends with in that class had agreed that they were all going to BEAM 7, she volunteered. \u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to BEAM 7,\u201d Emyr said.\u201cJ. J.?\u201d she prodded. But he was peering into his phone.That Jonathan was one of just a few African-American boys at BEAM (some of the other black students were the children of African or Caribbean immigrants) could have been a fluke. Or it could have been a reflection of the unique forms of discrimination faced by young African-American males, even in elementary school.Whatever the reason, many of the college-age counselors working alongside the teachers at BEAM were paying special attention to Jonathan.One of them was Christian Henderson, an African-American accounting major at Siena College, in Loudonville, N.Y. \u201cIt\u2019s important to educate a kid like J. J. right now,\u201d he said, \u201cso they know in their head they\u2019re on the same level as any white or Asian or Hispanic kid, before they get a little older and they see other people may not think, you know, that\u2019s true.\u201dJonathan\u2019s subway counselor, Mr. Pineda, 22, who is part Honduran and part Dominican, told Jonathan how a professor at Amherst College had mentioned that summer math camp had paved the way for many of his wealthy white classmates, whereas he felt lost during his sophomore year in discrete mathematics.By most measures, he knew, he was a success story. He had just graduated with a degree in math and Japanese studies. But it still bothered him that his classmates, the \u201csummer math nerds,\u201d as he and a friend had taken to calling them, had zoomed ahead.\u201cYou should look at this, J. J.,\u201d Mr. Pineda said on the Thursday afternoon of BEAM\u2019s second week, leafing through his homework folder to a triangular numbers problem. \u201cI think you\u2019d like it.\u201dThe following morning, Thays collapsed in pain at the Columbus Circle subway station as they were waiting for the A train.Emyr paced. Jonathan patted her arm. Mr. Pineda debated what to do. Her stomach hurt, she said. He tried to reach her parents, then called 911.Another counselor met the boys to take them to camp while Mr. Pineda accompanied Thays to the emergency room.When she didn\u2019t come back the next day, or the next, Jonathan railed at Thays\u2019s invisible presence as he, Mr. Pineda and Emyr made the morning commute. \u201cThays! I know you\u2019re just at home watching TV!\u201dHe also found himself thinking about math on the subway, visualizing a problem with triangular numbers and sifting through their patterns.BEAM teachers had explained it as a combination of math and pocket change: A triangular number is the number of pennies required if you\u2019re trying to make a triangle.For instance, if you want your triangle to have 2 pennies to a side, you\u2019ll need 3 pennies total; if you want it to have 3 pennies to a side, you need 6 pennies; for a triangle of 4 pennies to a side, you need 10.So 3, 6, 10 (and so on) are called the triangular numbers, and Jonathan was in search of the 299th triangular number. With the help of Marquia Williams, a BEAM counselor who was majoring in math at the State University of New York at Oswego, he figured it out, rewarding her with a stifled grin.After nearly a week away, Thays returned \u2014 her collapse had been caused by an ulcer that required minor surgery \u2014 to find Jonathan actually sitting still. He even raised his hand once in a while to offer insights in the class they shared.At home on one of the final days, Jonathan\u2019s sister, Jasmine, sat on the steps of their house. She had been attending summer school to catch up in several classes.\u201cHow\u2019s that camp going?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you still behind in your math?\u201dHe was silent for a moment.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not at that camp because I\u2019m bad at math,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019m there because I\u2019m good at math.\u201dOn the last day of program, the BEAM students gathered in a room to receive a graduation certificate. As their names were called, the counselors cheered. An especially loud one erupted for Jonathan.They would also receive problem sets in the mail, he told them, and he hoped they would send them back. The application for BEAM 7 would come at the end of the year.Emyr was among many who sobbed as the assembly broke up.A few parents had taken up the invitation to attend, including Thays\u2019s stepfather, but he was under strict instructions to drive home on his own.\u201cShe wants to go home with her regular group,\u201d he said, shrugging.On the subway, Thays fished in her bag, pulling out a white envelope that she gave to Omar; then another that she gave to Emyr, marked with a drawing of his favorite Pokemon character.\u201cYou made a slight mistake with the Pikachu,\u201d he noted. \u201cTheir eyes are supposed to be black on white.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s my present?\u201d Jonathan demanded, as she chatted with Omar. \u201cCome on, Thays.\u201dThays let a few more stops go by before relenting. Jonathan tore open the envelope.\u201cOh special, special JJ,\u201d she had written. \u201cYou are so annoying and rude. You always would get me mad and never stopped bothering me. But you always made the train ride fun. You were such a good BEAM friend and I hope to see you in BEAM 7.\u201dJonathan paused for a moment before looking up.\u201cNow if you gave me a Nerf gun, it would be better for everyone,\u201d he said, and put his arm around her.The three exchanged phone numbers.A few weeks later, poring over the surveys the students filled out on the last day, Mr. Zaharopol and his staff could take some measure of satisfaction. \u201cI want to get a Ph.D. in math,\u201d one student had written. Neither of his parents had graduated from college. Jonathan, in his review, recommended to future students that they pack their own lunches. He also wrote: \u201cI learned math they don\u2019t teach me at school.\u201dThe teachers, though, wondered how much they\u2019d really been able to achieve.\u201cThey\u2019re extremely passionate, and quick to pick up things,\u201d Mr. Zaharopol said in late October, when the BEAM staff gathered for an assessment. \u201cBut how many will stick with it? And are we reaching them soon enough?\u201dAs police shootings of black men continued and Donald J. Trump moved into the White House, Jonathan\u2019s mother had started to question her belief in the power of math to provide her son with a buffer. \u201cIt\u2019s just shocking that his views are the views of a lot of Americans,\u201d she said of the new president.She had allowed Jonathan to take karate after school, and by the start of winter he had obtained his advanced white belt.Jonathan had not heard from Thays, and he was flagging in the online pre-algebra class for which he had dutifully signed up. Sometimes his internet service, always erratic, would disconnect during the lessons.\u201cI might not be able to do it for a few weeks,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have homework.\u201dBut Emyr noted that all three of their names were on the short list of students who had sent back at least two correct answers to one of the problem sets that BEAM sent home.And one evening, on the top bunk of the bed he shares with his brothers, Jonathan decided to try Thays again.\u201cHey,\u201d he typed into his phone.\u201cWho is this?\u201d came the reply.\u201cJonathan from BEAM,\u201d he replied.\u201cJ. J.??!!\u201dHer phone had been broken, she explained. She hadn\u2019t received his texts.They traded messages, until Jonathan\u2019s mother reminded him that his phone privileges had been suspended.\u201cI am grounded for a week, so this is the last time we will be talking for now,\u201d he typed quickly.When the BEAM 7 applications arrived earlier this month, Thays and Emyr set to work. No math problems this time, just questions, 11 of them. What did she want to achieve in the eighth grade? \u201cI want to get into Bronx Science!\u201d Thays wrote, a reference to one of the city\u2019s most selective public high schools. \u201cI mean who doesn\u2019t?\u201d Why did he want to go to BEAM 7? \u201cTo see my BEAM peers,\u201d wrote Emyr, in addition to \u201cchallenging my brain.\u201dJonathan let his application sit on the kitchen table for a week. He let a long snow day with no school pass without looking at it. If he didn\u2019t want to go, his mother had told him, she wouldn\u2019t force him. He could do karate instead. Last Sunday, he began filling in the blanks. What kind of math did he find interesting? However unwittingly, his answer reflected BEAM\u2019s key lesson: \u201cI find proportion problems interesting because I\u2019ll always be confused,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I figure out the answer anyways.\u201dOn Monday, at work, his mother put it in the mail.An earlier version of this article misidentified the academic affiliation of Prof. Danny Martin. He is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, not at the University of Chicago.Advertisement"}

After the presentation by Ms. Downey, a nanny in Philadelphia, Ms. Mathurin took the microphone.\u201cI want you to stand up and close your eyes,\u201d Ms. Mathurin said in her singsong Caribbean accent. \u201cI want you to picture yourself exactly how you see yourself, and I want to tell you some things about yourself.\u201cI want you to know that you are beautiful. I want you to know that you are enough.\u201d Some of the nannies called out in agreement. \u201cI want you to know that you are all woman. And while you are doing this, I want you to exhale.\u201dThe apparent dismissal of his nanny\u2019s contributions made Ms. Reid \u201cagitated,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not here to talk about whether you are legal or not, that is not my business,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I am talking to you about today is professionalism. Raising the bar.\u201dMy Nanny Circle aims to do just that by increasing both knowledge and morale among its members. \u201cThere is nobility in the nanny profession,\u201d Ms. Mathurin said. \u201cThe biggest problem I see is that we have a society that doesn\u2019t value nannies, even though they supply the most important, valuable service: caring for children.\u201dMs. Mathurin understands the issues surrounding inequality and poverty only too well. She was just 3 years old when her mother left St. Lucia in the Caribbean for England, leaving her in the care of her grandmother. She never knew her father.\u201cI was raised in an agrarian society, and we often had nothing to eat, so we would go out looking for chicken eggs or bananas,\u201d she said. When she was 9, she was foraging for food with her grandmother, who suddenly fell into a diabetic coma. \u201cI saw she wouldn\u2019t move,\u201d she said. \u201cShe opened her eyes once and then she died. I screamed as loud as I could.\u201d She was raised by other relatives, but \u201cno matter how old you are, there is a void because I never knew what it was like to have a mother or a father.\u201dAfter graduating from high school in St. Lucia, Ms. Mathurin took a job with American Airlines, which enabled her to travel. She met a man in New York, moved to the city to marry him, and soon gave birth to a son, who is now 15. Unable to find work, she reluctantly took a job as a nanny for newborn twins who lived at the Ansonia on the Upper West Side.\u201cI immediately fell in love with Alene; I just thought she was the most amazing person,\u201d said John Caraccioli, her first employer. Mr. Caraccioli, a real estate broker at Halstead Property, is married to Jeffrey Appel, a vice president at Bank of America. Fifteen years ago, when their twins were born, \u201cthere weren\u2019t a whole lot of guys with kids. We were unique, even in Manhattan.\u201dIt was a culture shock for Ms. Mathurin. \u201cComing from a small Christian society, a gay couple was very much taboo for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI had never seen a family like this before.\u201d She spent those early years bottle-feeding the twins and then returning home to nurse her son. It wasn\u2019t long before an intimate bond formed between the families.\u201cHere I was, working with the most beautiful people on earth, caring for the children of two men, and I don\u2019t even know my own father,\u201d Ms. Mathurin said. \u201cAs a black woman going to the home of two men who loved me, and yet they didn\u2019t look like me, or talk like me, radically changed me. I disregarded everything I thought I knew about race and life.\u201dMost of the nannies in Ms. Mathurin\u2019s network are from the Caribbean, although there are also Latina nannies, white nannies and even a few men.\u201cYou don\u2019t see many guys like me picking up kids,\u201d said James Phinizy, 32, a nanny who was approached by Ms. Mathurin one day at school pickup. \u201cShe saw someone different who was doing a really great job, and she just reached out to me.\u201dMeches Rosales-Maupin, 40, from Guatemala City, has been working in New York for 11 years as a nanny. She used to be an organizer for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, but she left to organize her own group of Latina nannies, and to work closely with Ms. Mathurin, who \u201crepresents love,\u201d Ms. Rosales-Maupin said. \u201cI feel like it is a really confusing time,\u201d she continued, referring to the current political climate. \u201cI see in the future a black cloud, but Alene gives us pride, she celebrates us.\u201dMs. Mathurin makes little money from My Nanny Circle. For the seminar, she flew Ms. Reid in from Los Angeles, paid two of the speakers and a photographer, and picked up the tab for the pizza lunch. To support herself and her son (Ms. Mathurin is divorced), she relies on her book sales as well as part-time nanny work. She also consults, helping families and nannies resolve conflicts. Occasionally, this means coming down on the side of the employer.As Ms. Downey concluded her talk that Saturday, a nanny raised her hand to ask about speaking in her native language to her charges. After all, \u201cI am just a nanny, not a language teacher,\u201d she said.And that is exactly where Ms. Mathurin steps in. As she often says, \u201cIf nannies don\u2019t learn to love themselves, then how can we love the children who depend on us?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Blasting Gum Off Sidewalks", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 6:42 a.m.Good morning on this lovely Tuesday.Let\u2019s talk about gum.More specifically, the quarter-size, tarlike blobs that dot our sidewalks from those who spit out once-fresh gobs of gum for all to tread upon.Go ahead, look around your feet right now if you\u2019re outside. We\u2019ll give you a few seconds.Did you know it\u2019s someone\u2019s job to clean that hardened goo off the pavement?Meet Herbert Murray, the assistant supervisor of sanitation for the Times Square Alliance, who spends three days a week blasting gum off the sidewalks with a machine appropriately named GumBusters. It looks like a miniature gasoline pump on a wheeled, steel cart with a special hose.The machine, which emits a hissing sound like a steam radiator, uses a nontoxic solution to break down the texture of the gum, and water, which turns to steam, to evaporate the gum \u2014 no matter how fresh or old.You could call Mr. Murray, born and raised in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, a chewing gum expert. He can tell if gum is still fresh by \u201cthe pink color or white color\u201d it has. \u201cThe fresher gum is easier to remove,\u201d he said.When he spots gum on the pavement, he rubs the bristles on the end of the GumBusters hose against it, and then lets the solution and the steam do their thing.If it is too cold outside, the GumBusters machine can\u2019t be used because the solution and the water can freeze. Instead, Mr. Murray uses a GumBusters stick: a silver wand with a razor on the end to scrape away the gum.The work can go pretty fast and it comes with instant gratification in the form of clean pavement.\u201cI want people to come to Times Square and see it\u2019s beautiful and that it is clean.\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cIf they smile, I smile. I do it for the people.\u201dHe also offered some advice to gum chewers: \u201cPlease put your gum in a napkin and dispose of it in the trash can. Gum destroys property.\u201dThat\u2019s his polite way of saying: Don\u2019t be lazy and don\u2019t inconvenience others by spitting your gum onto the ground.Here\u2019s what else is happening:My, this February weather we\u2019re having.This very well may leave your closet feeling confused. But hey, at least it\u2019s not snow.The events, co-produced by Harlem Stage and the Apollo Theater, include:\u2022 A talk about black-girl hair culture with the activist Michaela Angela Davis and the comedian Franchesca Ramsey (Friday); and \u2026\u2022 Performances with the singer Jill Scott and other artists that pay homage to black protest music (Saturday).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gorsuch Not Easy to Pigeonhole on Gay Rights, Friends Say", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Phil Berg was nervous as he prepared to tell Neil Gorsuch he was gay.AIDS was still in the headlines at the time, the early 1990s, and same-sex marriage was a far-fetched notion. Some of Mr. Berg\u2019s other friends had not reacted well to his news. So he moved with caution, slipping the word \u201cboyfriend\u201d casually into conversation with Mr. Gorsuch, his dear friend and Harvard Law School classmate.\u201cHe didn\u2019t skip a beat,\u201d Mr. Berg, now a corporate lawyer in Manhattan said, recalling how that conversation led to a \u201cspecial bond\u201d between the two men. \u201cIt was a huge deal for me, and it made a lasting impression.\u201dNow President Trump has named Judge Gorsuch, 49, of the Federal Appeals Court in Denver, his nominee to the Supreme Court at a time when the clash between gay rights and religious freedom is one of the most contentious questions on the court\u2019s agenda.In nominating Judge Gorsuch, Mr. Trump has picked a man with impeccable legal credentials and cast him in the mold of the justice he would succeed, the late Antonin Scalia, who once accused the court of being swayed by a \u201chomosexual agenda\u201d and voted against legalizing same-sex marriage. Judge Gorsuch has said he cried when he learned of Justice Scalia\u2019s death.Like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch regards himself as an originalist, meaning he tries to interpret the Constitution based on the text as written by the founding fathers. But he is three decades younger than Justice Scalia was when he died. He has had two openly gay clerks, and he lives with his wife, Louise, and their two daughters in liberal Boulder, Colo., where his church, St. John\u2019s Episcopal, welcomes gay members.\u201cEverybody\u2019s got him pegged as being more Scalia,\u201d said Christian Mammen, a Democrat and intellectual property lawyer in San Francisco, who grew close to Judge Gorsuch when they were pursuing doctoral degrees at Oxford two decades ago. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I see that.\u201dJudge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination comes as some lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people think their very right to exist is threatened by the election of Mr. Trump.Part of the mystery around Judge Gorsuch is that his record on gay rights is thin and thus difficult to parse. It suggests a deference to religious freedom and a strong skepticism toward using the courts to find a new constitutional basis for L.G.B.T rights. But Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on a case involving whether gays can legally marry.He declined, through a spokesman, to be interviewed.Like other gay rights groups, Lambda Legal took what it called the \u201cunusual step\u201d of opposing the Gorsuch nomination even before the Senate confirmation hearings.\u201cIt was unprecedented for Lambda Legal,\u201d Ms. Tiven said, \u201cbut we are living in times that are not ordinary.\u201dAgainst that backdrop, the judge\u2019s gay friends \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 find themselves vouching for him.\u201cI said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m a liberal gay Jew from New England and you were appointed by George W. Bush, and I want to make sure I\u2019m not going to be uncomfortable here,\u2019\u201d said Joshua Goodbaum, a former clerk of Judge Gorsuch, recalling his 2008 job interview.The New York Times would like to hear from President Trump\u2019s supporters: What do you think about his policies so far?\u201cHe was actually kind of syrupy about it. I remember him saying, \u2018You\u2019re going to see how wonderful this is for your relationship.\u2019\u2019\u2019If Judge Gorsuch is confirmed, the composition of the court that made up the Obergefell majority will be unchanged. Michael Dorf, a law professor at Cornell who knows Judge Gorsuch in passing \u2014 they were both clerks to Justice Kennedy and run into each other at clerk reunions \u2014 says gay rights advocates \u201chave reason to be afraid,\u201d based on the existing evidence about Judge Gorsuch.In 2015, Judge Gorsuch sided with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections in rejecting arguments by a transgender woman who said the Constitution guaranteed her a right to hormone treatment and to wear feminine clothing. And in two prominent cases, both of which reached the Supreme Court, he sided with employers who had religious objections to providing contraception coverage.Critics of Judge Gorsuch frequently cite one of those cases, involving Hobby Lobby Stores, the retail arts and crafts chain, which challenged a section of the Affordable Care Act that required closely held, for-profit secular corporations to provide contraceptive coverage as part of their employer-sponsored health plans. Judge Gorsuch joined in an opinion by the full Court of Appeals rejecting that notion, a decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in 2014.Gay rights groups draw inferences from Hobby Lobby \u2014 Ms. Tiven calls the case \u2018\u2018particularly telling\u2019\u2019 \u2014 to argue that Judge Gorsuch would err on the side of religious freedom in cases involving discrimination against gays. But Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, is unconvinced.\u201cI do not agree that Hobby Lobby is a death knell that proves Judge Gorsuch would say that people can, on religious grounds, violate anti-discrimination laws,\u201d Mr. Tribe, who said he did not have Judge Gorsuch as a student, said in a recent interview. He called the case \u201can indicator\u201d but not \u201ca slam-dunk predictor.\u201dIn picking Judge Gorsuch, Mr. Trump has put forth a candidate with a fine Republican pedigree \u2014 his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was an official in the Reagan administration \u2014 and impeccable academic credentials. His class at Harvard included Mr. Obama as well as Ken Mehlman, who went on to head the Republican National Committee under President George W. Bush.Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter: @SherylNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The Collapse of Organized Farm Labor", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.More than four decades ago California passed a landmark law protecting the state\u2019s farmworkers from abuse and helping them to organize.But the recent resignation of the head of a board that oversees the implementation of the law highlights the extent to which organized labor among farmworkers has collapsed since the days of the pioneering labor leader Cesar Chavez.Chavez\u2019s activism was instrumental in the creation of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, the passage of which Gov. Jerry Brown described as a major accomplishment of his first stint as governor.In his recent resignation letter, the head of the board, William B. Gould IV, described the law as \u201cirrelevant to farmworkers.\u201d He estimated that less than one percent of the agricultural work force is now represented by a union.As chairman of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, Mr. Gould was charged with overseeing the certification process of union elections. Yet Mr. Gould said virtually no workers came to the board during his tenure.\u201cDuring the entire three years that I was chairman of the board there was only one petition for representation filed by a union in the state of California,\u201d he said.Mr. Gould says a major factor for the decline of organized farm labor is the fear that undocumented workers have of dealing with the government. Around half of the Californian agricultural work force is in the country illegally.\u201cThere is not only no incentive to complain but there is no incentive to become involved with government in any way,\u201d Mr. Gould said.California\u2019s agricultural industry is bigger than ever. It produces roughly a third of all fruits and vegetables grown in the United States and has about a third of the nation\u2019s farmworkers.Philip Martin, a specialist on organized farm labor, paints a less stark picture than Mr. Gould of the plight of farmworkers.Farmworker wages \u201chave gone up significantly,\u201d Mr. Martin said, and some workers have the benefit of voluntary agreements that growers sometimes enter with their suppliers. The average hourly wage of farmworkers in California is around $12, he said, above the state\u2019s current minimum wage of $10.Mr. Martin, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Davis, says estimates on unionization rates among farmworkers in California are not very reliable because there are no government requirements to report them. But he says it is undeniable that unionization rates have plummeted from the heyday of union power in the late 1970s.\u201cThere\u2019s not near the union activity that there used to be,\u201d he said.The police canceled the event before it could begin, and buildings on the campus were locked down for several hours.Mr. Yiannopoulos condemned the outcome. \u201cOne thing we do know for sure,\u201d he said on Facebook, \u201cthe Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down.\u201dOn Thursday morning President Trump responded on Twitter, appearing to defend Mr. Yiannopoulos and threaten the university\u2019s funding:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The country\u2019s largest Ikea is opening Wednesday in Burbank.To help grasp the vastness of the home furnishing emporium, some numbers:California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Karen Pence Picks a Cause, and Art Therapists Feel Angst", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 For much of her childhood, RyAnn Watson has been hospitalized for excruciating flare-ups of sickle cell disease. Now 16, she takes refuge from her pain in an art studio at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. On a recent Friday, she was sketching the sandstone towers of the Smithsonian castle with a burnt-red coloring pen, under the watch of her therapist, Tracy Councill.\u201cIt\u2019s more about putting my emotions into the artwork than telling someone about it and making myself upset,\u201d RyAnn said. Without any \u201cpressure to spill the beans,\u201d she said, \u201cI end up talking to Tracy about everything, once I\u2019m drawing.\u201dAlthough art therapy is offered by a number of established medical centers, many Americans don\u2019t know much about it. Art therapy is a form of psychotherapy where mental health professionals use art materials to help patients explore feelings that may not be easy to express in words.\u201cI want to get more people aware of art therapy, not only for children who are going through an illness, but adults as well who have gone through trauma,\u201d Mrs. Pence said in a phone interview.\u201cIt\u2019s a breath of fresh air that someone in such a position can highlight our profession and can bring attention that\u2019s needed and well deserved,\u201d said Irene David, a pioneer of the field and the longtime director of therapeutic arts at NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan.But many art therapists held a different view. On social media, some art therapists argued that the policies supported by President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are largely at odds with the group\u2019s principles and hurt the very people the profession treats, such as immigrants and trauma survivors.The group had about 615 members as of Monday.\u201cThere is a real divisiveness right now between art therapists,\u201d said Savneet Talwar, an associate professor of art therapy at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, who also works with Bosnian refugees. One side is \u201cfor utilizing this opportunity to bring more visibility to art therapy,\u201d she said. On the other side, Dr. Talwar said, people say \u201caligning yourself with her means you\u2019re not being true to our ethical principles.\u201dMs. Broitman said her clients in Chicago are worried they may lose their health insurance or be deported as a result of the policies supported by the vice president. \u201cYou can\u2019t shine a spotlight on art therapy without being accountable to the real danger our clients currently face,\u201d she said.Asked to comment on the schism, Kara Brooks, the communications director for Mrs. Pence, said in an email that Mrs. Pence \u201chas been a champion for art therapy for many years.\u201d\u201cShe has a true appreciation for all those who work in this mental health profession,\u201d Ms. Brooks said. \u201cMrs. Pence\u2019s efforts to bring awareness to art therapy over the years show that she really wants to make a positive difference.\u201dMost states don\u2019t offer licenses to art therapists, meaning they can\u2019t bill insurance. Often, private donors fund art therapists in states without licensure so they can work in schools, mental health clinics or hospitals.\u201cWe know how valuable it is. Now it\u2019s a matter of carrying out the studies to further the evidence of value,\u201d said Dr. Sara Kass, a retired Navy captain who is trained as a family physician, who had planned to have the program at a dozen military sites by year\u2019s end.That said, Dr. Kass is concerned their funding will dry up. \u201cI think we stand to lose a valuable tool,\u201d she said.Despite threats that members will quit, the leaders of the art therapy association still are open to working with Mrs. Pence. \u201cIf Mrs. Pence asks for and wants our support \u2014 which she hasn\u2019t yet \u2014 of course, we are going to offer support and resources,\u201d said Cynthia Woodruff, the executive director.\u201cThe big problem with all of this is there\u2019s no real, well-designed studies to show art therapy helps with people\u2019s cognition or general well-being,\u201d he said.After Sonali Agrawal, of Washington, D.C., was given a diagnosis of leukemia at age 4 in 2012, she regularly went to Ms. Councill\u2019s studio for years. As she had some of her chemotherapy infusions, she made a clay colander and a bird\u2019s nest.\u201cSonali made a lot of pieces of art in which she was caring for an animal and keeping an animal safe,\u201d said Ms. Councill, founder of Tracy\u2019s Kids, which has outposts in Washington, San Antonio, Baltimore and New York. \u201cThat had a lot to do with her wanting to feel safe.\u201dSonali\u2019s father, Dr. Manish Agrawal, an oncologist himself, thought it was \u201ccrazy to think she looked forward to coming to the hospital to get chemo.\u201dBut she did. After watching his daughter\u2019s treatment with art therapy, Dr. Agrawal said he felt the need to change how he practiced medicine. \u201cWe are so cut and dry,\u201d he said of doctors, but \u201cthere\u2019s a huge emotional toll. There\u2019s real suffering.\u201dDr. Agrawal conceded that he is not a Trump supporter, but Mrs. Pence\u2019s support for art therapy, he said, \u201cmay be the silver lining.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "End to Police \u2018High Five Fridays\u2019 at Schools Roils a Massachusetts Town", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a brief period that began in December, students in Northampton, Mass., arriving at elementary schools were greeted once a week by police officers lining the sidewalks to deliver high-fives and encouragement.It was part of a trust-building program called High Five Fridays, intended to show children that police officers were not the scary men and women they might have heard about or seen on television. Parents overwhelmingly supported the program.But in January, Jody Kasper, the city\u2019s police chief, started hearing from a small number of parents who said that their children \u2014 especially minorities and those who have had difficult experiences with the police \u2014 were uncomfortable with the officers\u2019 presence. Concerned that the education of those students might be harmed, Chief Kasper and the school district\u2019s superintendent, John Provost, decided last week to scrap the program.\u201cCertainly we do not want to have our officers at a school and have kids, even if it\u2019s a handful of kids, be traumatized and have a negative experience with our officers,\u201d Chief Kasper said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of the goal we\u2019re trying to accomplish.\u201dShe noted that most of the response to the effort had been positive, but said the police needed to listen to those who felt otherwise.\u201cWe are everyone\u2019s police,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just the majority, and not just the minority.\u201dA petition is circulating to reinstate the program.\u201cI just think my kid will benefit, and the community as a whole will benefit, from positive opportunities for the police and the children to get together,\u201d Tim Chilson, 58, said in an interview on Tuesday.His son, Maverick Carey, 10, was among those who high-fived and fist-bumped officers outside Leeds Elementary School. He said he usually liked going to school, but he was excited on days that he got to talk to the officers \u2014 or, as he put it, \u201cthe really nice people.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed because I felt so happy when I got to school,\u201d Maverick said.\u201cIt\u2019s important, especially in today\u2019s environment, that children know that police officers are their friends, and they\u2019re someone to be trusted and called upon in times of emergency,\u201d said LaTresha Woodruff, a Conway police spokeswoman. She said she had not heard of any complaints.Chief Kasper and Mr. Provost, the Northampton superintendent, said they would work to replace the program with other forms of youth outreach. Though Chief Kasper said the officers loved high-fiving students, she said they needed to be thoughtful of children who fear the police.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re all learning in our current climate is we need to listen to other people and hear what they\u2019re saying,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From an Anchor\u2019s Lips to Trump\u2019s Ears to Sweden\u2019s Disbelief", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoPALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 On Friday night, Fox News aired an alarming six-minute segment in which the host, Tucker Carlson, interviewed a documentary filmmaker about a crisis of violence in Sweden ignited by the recent wave of Muslim migration.\u201cThe government has gone out of its way to try to cover up some of these problems,\u201d declared Ami Horowitz, the filmmaker.\u201cThat is grotesque,\u201d Mr. Carlson responded.One of his viewers agreed, and in that moment was born a diplomatic incident that illustrates the unusual approach that President Trump takes to foreign policy, as well as the influence that television can have on his thinking. After watching the program, Mr. Trump threw a line into a speech the next day suggesting that a terrorist attack had occurred in Sweden the night before.Just like that, without white papers, intelligence reports, an interagency meeting or, presumably, the advice of his secretary of state, the president started a dispute with a longtime American friend that resented his characterization and called it false. The president\u2019s only discernible goal was to make the case domestically for his plans to restrict entry to the United States.The Swedes were flabbergasted.\u201cWe are used to seeing the president of the U.S. as one of the most well-informed persons in the world, also well aware of the importance of what he says,\u201d Carl Bildt, a former prime minister of Sweden, said by email on Monday. \u201cAnd then, suddenly, we see him engaging in misinformation and slander against a truly friendly country, obviously relying on sources of a quality that at best could be described as dubious.\u201dSweden\u2019s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, responded hours later at a news conference, noting that Sweden ranks highly on international comparisons of economic competitiveness and human development.\u201cWe have challenges, no doubt about that,\u201d he allowed. But he added pointedly, \u201cWe must all take responsibility for using facts correctly and for verifying anything we spread.\u201dSweden is hardly the first American friend to find itself uncomfortably at odds with the new president. Mexico\u2019s president canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump over his plans to build a border wall and bill the United States\u2019 southern neighbor for it. Mr. Trump reportedly lit into Australia\u2019s prime minister over refugees in a telephone call that was said to have ended abruptly.But the episode underscored that Mr. Trump obtains, processes and uses information differently from any modern president. He watches television at night and tends to incorporate what he sees into his Twitter feed, speeches and interviews.\u201cIt begs the question of where the president gets his information as he articulates his administration\u2019s global approach,\u201d said Mark Brzezinski, the ambassador to Sweden under President Barack Obama. \u201cTo do so in an improvisational way, based on snippets picked up from cable news, is a major mistake.\u201dImmigration is a hotly debated issue in Sweden, Germany and many other European countries. Sweden, which prides itself as a humanitarian leader, processed a record 163,000 asylum applications in 2015. But statistics in Sweden do not back up the suggestion that immigrants have created a major crime wave.Preliminary data released last month by Sweden\u2019s crime prevention council found no significant increase in crimes from 2015 to 2016, even with the influx of migrants. The council did note an increase in assaults and rapes last year, but it also recorded a drop in thefts and drug offenses. Still, a Pew Research Center survey last year found that 46 percent of Swedes said refugees were more to blame for crime than other groups.Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University in Sweden, said in an interview that immigrants were disproportionately represented among crime suspects, particularly in more serious and violent offenses. But he noted that many of the victims were other immigrants, whether members of criminal networks or simply residents of poor neighborhoods.\u201cImmigration will come with some cost, and we will likely have a bit more crime \u2014 but that\u2019s in a society with low crime rates and in a society that works really well, so in my opinion, it\u2019s something we can live with,\u201d he said. \u201cI know everybody won\u2019t agree with that. But immigration will not double the crime rate, make everybody go broke or turn Sweden into a living hell.\u201dThe Fox News segment featured an interview with Mr. Horowitz, whose short film, \u201cStockholm Syndrome,\u201d depicted Sweden as a place where rape and violence have been on the rise since it began accepting more refugees from Muslim countries.In the Fox interview, Mr. Horowitz acknowledged that most Swedes do not see the situation as he does. \u201cThey\u2019ll make excuses for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of the population in Sweden still wants to have an open-door policy. It\u2019s confounding.\u201dMr. Carlson said that assimilation had failed and that immigration was \u201cin the process of totally changing these ancient cultures into something different and much more volatile and much more threatening.\u201dCritics of Sweden\u2019s migration policies have pointed to a Facebook post on Feb. 3 by a police officer, Peter Springare, who said that migrants were taxing Sweden\u2019s pension, education and health systems and that they were the principal culprits in assaults. \u201cHalf of the suspects we cannot even be sure of because they don\u2019t have any valid papers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMost often this means they are lying about their country of origin and identity.\u201dMr. Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment, but he went back on Mr. Carlson\u2019s show on Monday night to defend his work, citing crime statistics and asserting that the police officers had recanted because they were under pressure. \u201cMy record stands for itself,\u201d he said, \u201cand what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself.\u201dPeter Baker reported from Palm Beach, and Sewell Chan from London.

{"Headline": "In Trump Era, Censorship May Start in the Newsroom", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorThis is how the muzzling starts: not with a boot on your neck, but with the fear of one that runs so deep that you muzzle yourself.Maybe it\u2019s the story you decide against doing because it\u2019s liable to provoke a press-bullying president to put the power of his office behind his attempt to destroy your reputation by falsely calling your journalism \u201cfake.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s the line you hold back from your script or your article because it could trigger a federal leak investigation into you and your sources (so, yeah, jail).Or, maybe it\u2019s the commentary you spike because you\u2019re a publicly supported news channel and you worry it will cost your station its federal financing.In that last case, your fear would be existential \u2014 a matter of your very survival \u2014 and your motivation to self-censor could prove overwhelming.We no longer have to imagine it. We got a real-life example last week in San Antonio, where a PBS station sat atop the slippery slope toward censorship and then promptly started down it.It\u2019s a single television station in a single state in a very big country. And the right thing ultimately happened. But only after a very wrong thing happened.The editorial misfire bears retelling because it showed the most likely way that the new administration\u2019s attempts to shut down the free press could succeed, just as it shows how those attempts can be stopped.Mr. Casey has been able to work for \u201c40 years as a professional smart ass,\u201d he told me, because \u201cI\u2019m not really a bomb thrower \u2014 I\u2019ve watched politicians for so many years that I know how to be strong about something without being unfriendly.\u201dAll set to go, the commentary was mentioned in a Facebook promotion for the show, which in turn caught the eye of Mr. Smith\u2019s office, which called the station to inquire about the segment.At a meeting the next Monday, Mr. Casey said, Mr. Emerson expressed concern \u201cthat the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was under attack and that this would add to it.\u201d The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides financing for public stations, including KLRN, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election has heightened fears that its financing will be cut.It also happens that Mr. Emerson had left journalism for several years to run his own advertising firm and that Mr. Smith had at one point been a client.Mr. Casey says he asked Mr. Emerson if he\u2019d be willing to come on the program and discuss it all, but Mr. Emerson declined. And that seemed to be that.But as we\u2019re learning this year, journalism has a safety net in the people who appreciate it, and the people who work in it.When I caught up with Mr. Emerson this week he acknowledged making \u201ca mistake\u201d that should not tarnish a career spent mostly in broadcast news, starting in a $1.25-an-hour job as a cameraman. \u201cI had to make a decision in what was about 20 minutes,\u201d he said.He acknowledged that \u201cclearly we always worry about funding for public television,\u201d but said that wasn\u2019t the \u201cprincipal reason\u201d for his decision to hold back the commentary. \u201cWe have to protect the neutrality of the station \u2014 somebody could have looked at it as slander,\u201d he said. The \u201ccommentary\u201d label, he said, would take care of it.Mr. Casey is satisfied with the result. But he acknowledged that it was a close call and that he was uniquely qualified to push back in a way others might not be. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be in the position of being 70 years old, and not in the position of being 45,\u201d he said, meaning that job security was not the same issue. \u201cThere\u2019s no level of heroism here.\u201dIn a week in which Congress is calling for a leak investigation into stories in The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN that led to Michael T. Flynn\u2019s forced resignation as national security adviser, heroism is what\u2019s called for. Hopefully there\u2019s enough of it to go around.Zach Wichter contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On a \u2018Day Without Immigrants,\u2019 Workers Show Their Presence by Staying Home", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt first spread on social media, rippling through immigrant communities like the opposite of fear and rumor: a call to boycott. In the New York region and around the country, many cooks, carpenters, plumbers and grocery store owners decided to answer it and not work on Thursday as part of a national \u201cday without immigrants\u201d in protest of the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward them.The protest called for immigrants, whether naturalized citizens or undocumented, to stay home from work or school, close their businesses and abstain from shopping. People planned for it in restaurant staff meetings, on construction sites and on commuter buses, but the movement spread mostly on Facebook and via WhatsApp, the messaging service. No national group organized the action.But what began as a grass-roots movement quickly reached the highest levels of federal government. In Washington, the Pentagon warned its employees that a number of its food concessions, including Sbarro\u2019s, Starbucks and Taco Bell, were closed because immigrant employees had stayed home and that they could expect longer lines at restaurants that were open.\u201cWhat really makes our country great is the diversity we experience here,\u201d Mr. Bayless said in an interview. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about the lack of respect and the fear-mongering and hate-mongering that I\u2019m sensing around us these days.\u201dSome people felt that the support of immigrants who are undocumented was wrongheaded. \u201cOf course, nobody wants to do without immigrants \u2014 they are what made America,\u201d Sarah Crysl Akhtar, 67, a writer in Lebanon, N.H., said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut there is a difference between legal immigrants and illegal aliens.\u201d The latter, she said, \u201cbring down the quality of life for everyone.\u201dSome schools and child-care centers across the country experienced a drop in attendance.At KIPP Austin Comunidad, a majority-Hispanic charter school in Austin, Tex., one teacher posted on Twitter that only seven of her 26 students came to school on Thursday. \u201cSome of our school buses were coming to school with two and four children on them,\u201d said Sarah Gonzales, a second-grade bilingual teacher at the school. \u201cNothing like this has ever happened before.\u201dBy the end of the day, the KIPP Austin Public Schools network executive director, Steven Epstein, said only 60 percent of students attended its 10 schools with 5,000 students. Usually the attendance rate is 98 percent or above.At Siler City Elementary School in rural North Carolina, where 65 percent of the school population is Hispanic, 263 of the 662 students were absent on Thursday. Just 18 were absent on Wednesday, said John McCann, a spokesman for the county school district.Still, cities did not grind to a halt, and for most people, the action registered as an inconvenience \u2014 a longer wait for lunch, a favorite restaurant closed, a bus driver who wasn\u2019t there.In the Hasidic neighborhood of Borough Park, Brooklyn, some customers noticed the absence of the usual Latino immigrant employees at their local stores. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oy, my coffee will not be as good as any day,\u2019 but I felt, \u2018Good for them, they are standing up for their rights,\u201d said Rabbi Joel Labin, 34, a writer and activist who shopped at Center Fresh market. \u201cWe grew up with these stories. I hear from my grandparents the issue of immigration from Europe. I feel like it\u2019s kind of my story, too.\u201dMexican workers participated in large numbers in New York. In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, most bakeries and taquerias were closed, and a public library was crowded with parents and children they kept home from school.But the action was not limited to Hispanic immigrants: On several blocks in Midwood, Brooklyn, virtually all stores were shuttered on Thursday as part of a protest planned by Pakistani shop owners. There, an auto repair shop on Coney Island Avenue posted a handmade sign on its pulled-down metal shutter: \u201cWe Are Immigrants.\u201dThe driver of a discount shuttle bus outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Sam Ahmad, originally from Egypt, said on Wednesday night that he was not going to work on Thursday and many members of his mosque in New Jersey would not, either. Asked why, Mr. Ahmad, 57, said, \u201cBecause that crazy guy,\u201d he said, referring to President Trump. \u201cBecause I\u2019m Muslim and I got a lot of family here. They can get separated, and it\u2019s not right. Our children are born here and grow up here.\u201dIn downtown Newark, a low-key gathering outside the stately Essex County Hall of Records started with only a couple dozen protesters and turned into a spirited event when students from nearby Science Park High School charged in with signs, banners and chants.\u201cWe are loud, we are clear, immigrants are welcome here,\u201d they said, drawing honks from cheering passing motorists.Gina Alvarado, one of the students, said the plan to ditch school for the rally had spread spontaneously Thursday morning via social media, texts and word-of-mouth.In Manhattan, the flower district, mostly concentrated on West 28th Street, was as quiet as the wholesale jewelry and garment district around it. At one point, two construction workers from a nearby site took a coffee and cigarette break. \u201cHalf the job didn\u2019t come in,\u201d said Joe Burns, 32. \u201cAbout 10 people, Spanish guys,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to labor for ourselves today.\u201dIt did seem that in New York, at least, pockets of the nonunion construction industry were shut down.A 28-year-old carpenter from Cuenca, Ecuador, who gave only his first name, Santiago, said in Spanish that at his construction site in Astoria, Queens, a supervisor asked on Wednesday whether workers were coming the next day. They were not, the workers told him.About 500 people from several companies were employed at the site, Santiago said, including carpenters, electricians and plumbers.The Davis Museum at Wellesley College took an innovative approach to the protest. It removed or cloaked 120 works of art that had either been created by an immigrant or donated by an immigrant \u2014 about 20 percent of the museum\u2019s display.With entire galleries shrouded in black felt and placards replacing paintings, the director of the museum, Lisa Fischman said, \u201cI\u2019ve been calling it an intervention, because it takes what we have and reframes it.\u201dReporting was contributed by Manny Fernandez from Houston, Nate Schweber from Newark, Monica Davey from Chicago, Katharine Q.

After we parted, I called my parents and told them I think I\u2019d met a girl I could marry.\u201d\u2014 John Egnatios-Beene, 36, Park SlopePATH train, 1986:\u201cI was living on Bedford Street and commuting via PATH to Newark, where I worked. One day I see this tall, elegant brunette standing in the car. Attracted to her, but couldn\u2019t bring myself to walk to her and speak. Next day, same routine and there she is again. And once again I\u2019m paralyzed with anxiety. Third time\u2019s the charm, they say. And there she was, again. Incredible! Heaven sent. I walked to her in the PATH car. \u2018Hi, I\u2019m John.\u2019 She said hello. \u2018I\u2019ve seen you now three days in a row. I\u2019d like to get to know you. How about we have lunch tomorrow?\u2019 [I said.] \u2018Oh,\u2019 she said, \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 I felt about one foot tall and wanted to slink away. \u2018But,\u2019 she said, \u2018how about dinner?\u2019 We married about eight months later. That was 31 years ago. Still married to her. Two kids. Life is good.\u201d\u2014 John P. Gleason, 72, BronxF train, 1970:\u201cIt was the smile that made all the difference. We were both riding the F train from Manhattan to Brooklyn to teach at different schools. I saw her a few times before I got the nerve to say anything. She smiled. What a smile. She gave me her number. Our first date was a Yankees game against the Minnesota Twins. Then, you know, yada, yada, yada. One thing turned into another. Then we got married. Then we had kids. Then we had grandkids. We met in May 1970. We were married on Dec. 18, 1971, so we just had our 45th anniversary last month. She is still the love of my life.\u201d\u2014 Charlie McMillan, 71, Newton, Mass.Same train line, four decades later:\u201cAfter a particularly trying day, I mistakenly found myself on the uptown platform of the F train when I had intended to be headed downtown. As I audibly shouted an expletive, I caught the attention of a very handsome man who had just made the same mistake. We chatted as we made our way to the correct platform and onto the crowded Brooklyn-bound train. As the train reached my station and the doors opened I reached into my coat pocket and found a lonely business card. I handed it to him and told him it was nice to meet him. He waited a month to call but we have now been married seven years and have a son and two daughters between us.

{"Headline": "Hunched Over a Microscope, He Sketched the Secrets of How the Brain Works", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRam\u00f3n y Cajal started out with an interest in the visual arts and photography \u2014 he even invented a method for making color photos. But his father pushed him into medical school. Without his artistic background, his work might not have had as much impact, Dr. Swanson said.\u201cIt\u2019s fairly rare for a scientist to be a really good artist at the same time, and to illustrate all of their own work, brilliantly,\u201d Dr. Swanson said. \u201cThere seems to be a real resurgence of interest between the interaction between science and art, and I think Cajal will be an icon in that field.\u201dThe images in \u201cThe Beautiful Brain\u201d illustrate what Ram\u00f3n y Cajal helped discover about the brain and the nervous system, and why his research had such an effect on the field of neuroscience.Ram\u00f3n y Cajal wanted to know something no one really understood: How did a neural impulse travel through the brain? But he had to lean on his own observations and reasoning to answer this question.Albert von K\u00f6lliker,\u00a0an influential German scientist, was amazed and began translating Ram\u00f3n y Cajal\u2019s work, which was mainly in Spanish, into German. From there the neuron doctrine spread, replacing the prevailing reticular theory. But Ram\u00f3n y Cajal\u00a0died before anyone proved it.Perhaps one of Ram\u00f3n y Cajal\u2019s most iconic images is this pyramidal neuron in the cerebral cortex, the outside part of the brain that processes our senses, commands motor activity and helps us perform higher brain functions like making decisions. Some of these neurons are so large that you don\u2019t need a microscope to see them, unlike most other brain cells.Ram\u00f3n y Cajal studied Purkinje neurons with fervor, illustrating their treelike structure in great detail, like this one from the cerebellum. Axons, such as the one indicated by an \u201ca\u201d in the picture, can travel long distances in the body, some from the spinal cord all the way down to your little toe, said Dr. Dubinsky, who wrote a chapter in \u201cThe Beautiful Brain\u201d about contemporary extensions of his work. Ram\u00f3n y Cajal traced axons as far as he could, she said.A few of his drawings had features that resembled the work of other artists. In some, Vincent van Gogh appeared influential. In this drawing of the glial cells in the cerebral cortex of a man who suffered from paralysis, the three nuclei (or nucleoli) in the upper left corner resemble Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream.\u201dIn addition to showing how information flowed through the brain, Ram\u00f3n y Cajal showed how it moved through the whole body, allowing humans to do things like vomit and cough. When we vomit, a signal is sent from the irritated stomach to the vagus nerve in the brain and then to the spinal cord, which excites neurons that make us contract our stomach and heave. Similarly, a tickle in the back of your throat can make you cough: The larynx sends a signal to the vagus nerve, then the brainstem and the spinal cord, where neurons signal the muscles in our chest and abdomen to contract. Ahem.This image is a reconstruction of a dendrite (red) and its axons (multicolored) in the outer part of a mouse\u2019s brain. The dendrite has little knobby spines that stick out and receive chemical messages passed from another neuron\u2019s axon across the synapse, or gap between them, via the tiny white sacs called vesicles. Today we know that synapses are plastic, meaning they can get stronger or weaker with use or neglect. This enables us to think and learn.This is what Ram\u00f3n y Cajal described in his neuron doctrine.\u201cPeople regularly begin seminars with pictures of the drawings that Cajal made because what they\u2019ve added fits right in with where Cajal thought it should be,\u201d Dr. Dubinsky said. \u201cWhat he did is still relevant today.\u201d________Because of an editing error, a capsule summary with an earlier version of this article misstated the title of a book.

{"Headline": "Kim Jong-nam Was Killed by VX Nerve Agent, Malaysians Say", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a brief statement, Khalid Abu Bakar, the national police chief, said the substance was listed as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Conventions of 1997 and 2005, to which North Korea is not a party.South Korea has suggested that the killing was the work of the North Korean government. The revelation that a banned weapon was used in such a high-profile killing raises the stakes over how Malaysia and the international community will respond.VX nerve agent can be delivered in two compounds that are mixed at the last moment to create a lethal dose. The police say that two women approached Mr. Kim at the airport with the poison on their hands and rubbed it on his face one after the other.Samples were taken from Mr. Kim\u2019s skin and eyes. The poison was identified in a preliminary analysis by the Center for Chemical Weapons Analysis of the Chemistry Department of Malaysia, Mr. Khalid said.The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons, and North Korea is among the world\u2019s largest possessors of such weapons. In 2014, the South Korean Defense Ministry said the North had stockpiled 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons. (The North has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006.)VX is part of a family of nerve agents created decades ago during research into pesticides. It is tasteless and odorless and kills by causing uncontrollable muscle contractions, which eventually stop the victim from breathing. A dose of about 10 milligrams is enough to kill by skin contact, according to the Federation of American Scientists.Several world powers, including the United States and the former Soviet Union, once had large stockpiles of the nerve agent. American stores of VX were destroyed under the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997, with incineration completed in 2012.In 1994 and 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used homemade VX to attack three people, one of whom died.North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapons production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons during a typical year and 12,000 tons during a period of extended crisis. It is widely reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene and sarin gas, a United States Congressional Research Service report said last year.Relatives and acquaintances of the two women Malaysia has accused of carrying out the killing, by applying poison to Kim-Jong-nam\u2019s face as North Korean agents looked on, insisted they must have been duped into doing so, though the Malaysian authorities say otherwise.\u201cI don\u2019t believe Huong did such a thing,\u201d said Doan Van Thanh, father of Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese woman being held in Malaysia. \u201cShe was a very timid girl. When she saw a rat or frog, she would scream.\u201dMr. Thanh, 63, said he had seen little of his daughter recently. He said she left the family\u2019s home, in a village south of Hanoi, at 17 to attend community college, where she studied to be a pharmacist.She later left Vietnam to work in Malaysia without telling her family and rarely visited, Mr. Thanh said. When she returned home in January for the Tet holiday, he said, she stayed only a few days.North Korea has called for the release of Ms. Huong, an Indonesian woman and a North Korean man who are being held by Malaysia in connection with the death of Mr. Kim.The statement on Thursday from the Jurists Committee was cited by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, in the first comment on the killing from the North\u2019s official news media. The statement accused the Malaysian authorities of pursuing a case \u201cfull of loopholes and contradictions\u201d that proved that its investigators \u201cintended to frame us.\u201d It said Malaysia had done so under South Korean influence.The statement said Malaysia\u2019s Foreign Ministry and the local hospital first told the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur that Mr. Kim had died of \u201cheart stroke,\u201d asking North Korea to take the body and cremate it.But Malaysian officials\u2019 attitude began changing after the South Korean news media, citing anonymous sources, reported that Mr. Kim had been poisoned, according to the North Korean statement.\u201cThe Malaysian secret police got involved in the case and recklessly made it an established fact\u201d that the death had been a poisoning, according to the North Korean statement, which did not refer to Mr. Kim by name.The statement questioned how Ms. Huong and the Indonesian suspect in the killing, Siti Aisyah, 25, had survived if, as Malaysian officials said, they had used their hands to apply a deadly poison.Richard C. Paddock reported from Kuala Lumpur, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

Yet the process of evaluating evidence and writing definitions in a clear and unbiased manner remains the objective, said Katherine Connor Martin, head of American dictionaries at Oxford University Press.The aim is to provide the most accurate information about where a word comes from, how it is used grammatically and what meaning it conveys. \u201cOur goal is really simple,\u201d she said, \u201cand it contributes to a sense of authoritativeness.\u201dBut some dictionary companies are embracing the personality-driven culture of the digital age to make lexicography more accessible and perhaps drive advertising revenue through clicks. Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com use Twitter and other networks to share \u201cword of the day\u201d features, real-time data about words that are suddenly being searched by large numbers of people and cheeky observations on public figures and their use of language.The intent is not to be political or partisan, said Lauren Sliter, who runs the marketing department at Dictionary.com and writes the Twitter feed. Juxtaposing current events with unusual words the site is introducing helps demonstrate the relevance and usefulness of an expanded vocabulary, Ms. Sliter said.Helping to make sense of a president\u2019s message connects to the very purpose of a dictionary, she added. \u201cWe have gone from an era of great oratory to an era of great tweets,\u201d she said. But since tweets often lack context and nuance, \u201cthings can come off as a little ambiguous and we want to be helpful in clarifying things.\u201dMerriam-Webster has also been identified as \u201cthrowing shade\u201d at politicians, for its posts on surges in lookups for certain words and its word-of-the-day entries. For instance, in late January, as the nation was ensnarled in debates about Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to build a wall at the Mexican border, \u201cbarbican\u201d \u2014 which means \u201can outer defensive work; especially: a tower at a gate or bridge\u201d \u2014 was the word of the day.\u201cThe information we share is relevant in a new way that gets more attention,\u201d Ms. Naturale wrote in an email forwarded by Merriam-Webster\u2019s publicist. \u201cThere\u2019s also a sense that we\u2019re increasingly divided, and the dictionary\u2019s role is to help people communicate with each other.\u201dThis is not the only role, of course. Mr. Sheidlower, the lexicographer, said: \u201cIn times of stress, people will go to things that will provide answers. The Bible, the dictionary or alcohol.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Using Stealth, and Drones, to Document a Fading Hong Kong", "Date": "2017-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong JournalHONG KONG \u2014 Three masked explorers appeared atop an apartment tower in Hong Kong\u2019s North Point district and sent a black drone flying, over a clothesline, until it was buzzing more than 10 stories above the cars, trams and pedestrians on the street below.The authorities are \u201crenewing the city on behalf of the developers, not the people,\u201d said one of the explorers, who goes by the alias Ghost in videos and whose pollution mask and fingerless gloves gave him the air of a bank robber or graffiti artist.The explorers belong to HK Urbex, a so-called urban exploration collective whose expeditions often require trespassing or walks through dark, abandoned or dangerous sites. But unlike some urban explorers, they do not court danger purely for its own sake. Their primary goal is to peel back layers of history \u2014 sometimes literally, by digging through dust and trash \u2014 and forge a video archive of Hong Kong\u2019s colonial-era environment.\u201cUntil you peel them back, you don\u2019t know what existed before,\u201d said Ghost, 33. \u201cOthers are interested in the adrenaline rush, but we\u2019re interested in the story. What can it tell us about the past?\u201dMany buildings that went up here before Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 return to China from British colonial rule have already been replaced by taller ones, as exceptionally high property values create economic incentives to cram more towers into an already crowded skyline.But some buildings lie fallow for years between tenant evictions and demolition, and others, like the 1952 State Theater that the explorers filmed recently, are partly open to the public. The State Theater\u2019s main space, for example, is now a snooker hall. HK Urbex sees these structures as prime targets for urban expeditions.The group\u2019s eight members, all longtime Hong Kong residents, use aliases in their work to keep public attention focused on their mission instead of their personalities but also because anonymity helps shield them from potential legal trouble. They agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they be identified only by their aliases.The HK Urbex members often spend weeks researching obscure and abandoned sites before visiting them. Once inside, they document everyday items that they stumble upon \u2014 family portraits, X-rays, ancestral shrines, a broken piggy bank \u2014 and that will probably never be recorded in history books.But Professor Lee of the University of Hong Kong said that the second classification did not legally protect buildings from demolition, and that Hong Kong officials \u2014 unlike their counterparts in Singapore, another wealthy Asian city and former British colony \u2014 rarely bestowed conservation status on modernist landmarks like the State Theater.\u201cUnfortunately, the economy of Hong Kong is still very much pegged to property development,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, reached by telephone, declined to comment on HK Urbex or its activities.The group was formed in 2013 by Ghost and a friend, who goes by the alias Echo Delta. They both are part-time filmmakers, and they discovered their initial HK Urbex sites while scouting locations for film shoots, Echo Delta said.HK Urbex members say their videos are visual expressions of the \u201clocalist\u201d political movement that has recently gained support in Hong Kong and reflects a conviction among many younger people that their city\u2019s identity is distinct from that of the Chinese mainland.\u201cI guess we\u2019re indirectly political,\u201d Ghost said, as Echo Delta\u2019s drone buzzed above North Point.After filming the State Theater, whose structural supports soar above its roof in concrete parabolas like those of a suspension bridge, Echo Delta and Ghost took a taxi to the city\u2019s Central district. The idea was to check on some abandoned buildings that they have been monitoring over the years.One stop was Central Market, a 1930s landmark that Ghost had previously explored twice \u2014 first by sneaking past a security guard who was urinating and later by climbing in through a window.This time, a side door was unlocked.Echo Delta slipped inside, but a security guard quickly shooed him away.\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.On nearby Bridges Street, a white residential building that the pair had once sneaked into was now ringed by a fence, with \u201cX\u201d marks in its windows. \u201cThey\u2019ve cleared it out,\u201d said Echo Delta, whose alias is a play on his real-life nickname.Later, they saw that while several abandoned buildings near the Graham Street Market had been razed for new construction, others were still standing, right beside the market\u2019s open-air vegetable hawkers.One squat apartment building in particular, which had plants growing in its crevices, caught their eye. They lingered for a few minutes under its shadow, apparently transfixed by its architectural features.\u201cLook at those long windows,\u201d Echo Delta said quietly. \u201cVictorian \u2014 no, Georgian?\u201d\u201cThat would be one to look into,\u201d said Ghost, the only white member of HK Urbex. His alias plays on a Cantonese slang term for foreigners.His partner nodded.\u201cI bet it\u2019s going to be turned into a Starbucks,\u201d Echo Delta said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gift for Donald Trump", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you could give Donald Trump the gift of a single trait to help his presidency, what would it be?My first thought was that prudence was the most important gift one could give him. Prudence is the ability to govern oneself with the use of reason. It is the ability to suppress one\u2019s impulses for the sake of long-term goals. It is the ability to see the specific circumstances in which you are placed, and to master the art of navigating within them.My basic thought was that a prudent President Trump wouldn\u2019t spend his mornings angrily tweeting out his resentments. A prudent Trump wouldn\u2019t spend his afternoons barking at foreign leaders and risking nuclear war. \u201cPrudence is what differentiates action from impulse and heroes from hotheads,\u201d writes the French philosopher Andr\u00e9 Comte-Sponville.But the more I thought about it the more I realized prudence might not be the most important trait Trump needs. He seems intent on destroying the postwar world order \u2014 building walls, offending allies and driving away the stranger and the refugee. Do I really want to make him more prudent and effective in pursuit of malicious goals?Moreover, the true Trump dysfunction seems deeper. We are used to treating politicians as vehicles for political philosophies and interest groups. But in Trump\u2019s case, his philosophy, populism, often takes a back seat to his psychological complexes \u2014 the psychic wounds that seem to induce him into a state of perpetual war with enemies far and wide.With Trump we are relentlessly thrown into the Big Shaggy, that unconscious underground of wounds, longings and needs that drive him to do what he does, to tweet what he does, to attack whom he does.Thinking about politics in the age of Trump means relying less on the knowledge of political science and more on the probings of D.H. Lawrence, David Foster Wallace and Carl Jung.At the heart of Trumpism is the perception that the world is a dark, savage place, and therefore ruthlessness, selfishness and callousness are required to survive in it. It is the utter conviction, as Trump put it, that murder rates are at a 47-year high, even though in fact they are close to a 57-year low. It is the utter conviction that we are engaged in an apocalyptic war against radical Islamic terrorism, even though there are probably several foreign policy problems of greater importance.It\u2019s not clear if Trump is combative because he sees the world as dangerous or if he sees the world as dangerous because it justifies his combativeness. Either way, Trumpism is a posture that leads to the now familiar cycle of threat perception, insult, enemy-making, aggrievement, self-pity, assault and counterassault.So, upon reflection, the gift I would give Trump would be an emotional gift, the gift of fraternity. I\u2019d give him the gift of some crisis he absolutely could not handle on his own. The only way to survive would be to fall back entirely on others, and then to experience what it feels like to have them hold him up.Out of that, I hope, would come an ability to depend on others, to trust other people, to receive grace, and eventually a desire for companionship. Fraternity is the desire to make friends during both good and hostile occasions and to be faithful to those friends. The fraternal person is seeking harmony and fair play between individuals. He is trying to move the world from tension to harmony.Donald Trump didn\u2019t have to have an administration that was at war with everyone but its base. He came to office with a populist mandate that cut across partisan categories. He could have created unorthodox coalitions and led unexpected alliances that would have broken the logjam of our politics.He didn\u2019t have to have a vicious infighting administration in which everybody leaks against one another and in which backstairs life is a war of all against all.He doesn\u2019t have to begin each day making enemies: Nordstrom, John McCain, judges. He could begin each day looking for friends, and he would actually get a lot more done.I doubt that Trump will develop a capacity for fraternity any time soon, but to be human is to hold out hope, and to believe that even a guy as old and self-destructive as Trump is still 0.001 percent open to a transformation of the heart.Advertisement"}

Both have come up with clever names for their products: For $11.95, people can buy Fluffy an 8-ounce bottle of Catbernet or Pinot Meow from Apollo Peak, which is based in Denver.Or for $14.95, they can pour 12 ounces of Meow & Chandon from Pet Winery of Fort Myers, Fla.Since alcohol can harm cats, these products are essentially catnip water, which can make a cat loopy and an owner happy.But based on a wine tasting I conducted at a local cat cafe-slash-adoption center, the products are primarily catnip for the owners: The shelter cats did not like wines from either company \u2014 only two of them indulged \u2014 but the people visiting the tastings loved the concept.\u201cThat\u2019s the greatest thing ever,\u201d said Savannah Thrasher, 23, a medical biller who was at the Cat Town Caf\u00e9 here. \u201cIt would be good if my cat can enjoy wine with me,\u201d she said.It all started two years ago when Brandon Zavala, the chief executive of Apollo Peak, \u201cspawned the idea of wine for cats out of nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cA pet is more like a friend, a roommate or a family member,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are we just feeding them water?\u201dMr. Zavala, 32, used to sell pet food products and has been learning more about the business through his start-up. Initially he called his product a \u201csnack beverage.\u201d If he had not changed it to cat wines, he said, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have gone viral.\u201dHe named his business for his cat, Apollo, and for the mountains of Denver. Organic beets from California provide the coloring. The catnip comes from the higher elevations of Colorado. His small wine bottles are sold online and in 200 stores, including T. J. Maxx and Marshalls. Mr. Zavala imbues his products with sayings like \u201cMaking Cats Great Again\u201d and #whydrinkalone.Cat wines are the latest manifestation of a growing trend of pet owners treating them like people.\u201cThe term \u2018pet parent\u2019 has increasingly replaced \u2018pet owner,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sprinkle said. Cat products and supplies make up 30 percent of the $40 billion United States pet market, excluding services, he said.Farm animals, which once roamed the land, began disappearing and multigenerational families gave way to smaller ones and more people living alone. \u201cThe final piece of the puzzle,\u201d Mr. Grimm said, \u201ccoincides with the rise in technology and the severing of a lot of human relationships. We\u2019re doing so much virtually that when we go home at night, our dogs and cats increasingly are beings in our lives that want to interact with us when other relationships are fraying.\u201dMr. Zavala was making the wines in his home kitchen and could not keep up. He hired employees and moved into a larger building. Last year, his company sold $500,000 worth of pet wines.In July 2016, Taryn Nahm, 31, who previously sold advertising, and her boyfriend, Kai Pfretzschner, 37, a chemist, started a cat wine company which they now call Pet Winery. (Their tagline: \u201cOriginal beverages for pets.\u201d) Their wines, also in tiny bottles, are sold online and in 40 stores; they are made in Mr. Pfretzschner\u2019s lab.Mr. Zavala is not amused, but Ms. Nahm is unapologetic.\u201cApollo Peak doesn\u2019t get to own the market,\u201d Ms. Nahm said. \u201cWe have our own viewpoints,\u201d she said, and their own recipes. \u201cWe did salmon oil with catnip,\u201d she said.Both companies have expanded into the dog wine market: Apollo Peak brews chamomile and peppermint in water. Pet Winery adds salmon oil and bacon extract.Needing to know which brand finicky cats preferred, I asked Ann Dunn, the founder of Cat Town Caf\u00e9, to let me conduct a feline focus group involving six fully awake cats and a dozen who were more interested in naps than liquid refreshments.There was a surprise: Only one cat, a black-and-white one named Dickie, seriously liked the beverage. He sipped, then groomed himself and got blissful. Other cats lounging in cubbyholes ignored the offerings, though one was briefly interested.Nevertheless, the cat lovers \u2014 even after seeing that the animals did not like the wines \u2014 were smitten with the products.When I told Mr. Zavala, he understood. \u201cThe best part of the idea is having wine with your pet \u2014 that\u2019s what drives it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not how it tastes for the cat.\u201dIf you really want to attract cats, Ms. Dunn of Cat Town Caf\u00e9 said, open a can of sardines. But sardines lack the coolness factor of a bottle of cat wine (which in turn lacks a strong fishy stench).\u201cWe want to believe we\u2019re making their lives more luxurious, however silly that seems,\u201d said one observer of the wine tasting, Nicole Gounalis, a Ph.D. student of Italian studies at Stanford University.She watched the wine tasting flop, but said she would buy the beverage anyway for her two cats, Dez and Ember. \u201cYou\u2019re imagining this alternative universe, in which cats live miniature versions of what you do,\u201d she said.Robert L. Vetere, the head of the American Pet Products Association, a trade group, said that Ms. Gounalis\u2019s sentiment is an increasingly common one. \u201cWe no longer reward our pets in animal terms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel the need to reward our pets in human terms.\u201dFor instance, \u201cSuddenly, a tennis ball for our dog is not enough,\u201d Mr. Vetere said. Pet lovers are buying \u201chigh-cost collars, and premium bedding and other human-based rewards.\u201dSarah Davidian, 34, a veterinary technician who was visiting the cat cafe, said she had read mixed reviews online for cat wines, but could not resist buying Pet Winery\u2019s Purrgandy for a dinner party to celebrate her friend\u2019s one-year anniversary with her cat, Jimmy. They planned a Mexican dinner for five, \u201cnot counting Jimmy,\u201d Ms. Davidian said, noting that the meal was chosen because Jimmy likes tortillas and shredded chicken.Two days after the wine tasting I staged, Ms. Davidian sent me a text saying that her friend had let Jimmy taste the Purrgandy. He became \u201cvery affectionate and took a long nap,\u201d she reported, adding: \u201cI\u2019ll have to buy a case for him now.\u201d\u201cI buy stuff that spoils my animals rotten,\u201d said Stephanie Turner, who works as a volunteer at the Cat Town Caf\u00e9. Her dog has 17 squeaky toys. Otto and Floyd, her cats, have disco balls and an electric mouse.\u201cWe don\u2019t have kids, so the money that would go toward kids we spend on our pets,\u201d she said. She watched the lackadaisical response of the cats to the wine, but said she too, would buy cat wine.Not all cats are attracted to catnip or flavored drinks. \u201cCats in the wild don\u2019t drink that much \u2014 75 percent of their hydration comes from their food,\u201d said Jackson Galaxy, the host and executive producer of the Animal Planet show \u201cMy Cat From Hell.\u201dCat wines \u201care silly,\u201d he said, but \u201cif they bring people closer to cats, then they can\u2019t be all bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Struggles to Capitalize on Influence and Posts Lackluster Earnings", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports fans were glued to it during the Super Bowl. Millions used it to track American election night results. In the morning, the president of the United States sends a daily missive in the form of a tweetstorm.\u201cYou don\u2019t go a day without hearing about Twitter,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s chief executive, said on a conference call with investors Thursday morning.There is just one problem: For all of its influence, Twitter cannot seem to capitalize on its wide reach.Twitter, which has long aspired to bring its social network to wider audiences globally, added only two million users in the fourth quarter of 2016, taking its total number to 319 million over all. Facebook, by contrast, added tens of millions, its strongest user growth since it became a public company, and it is closing in on two billion worldwide users.That difficulty growing its user base has finally caught up to its financial performance. The company noted that as it moves to \u201creset\u201d itself and tries to focus on making its product more attractive to wide audiences, revenue growth will slow and may continue to do so in the future.Shares of Twitter fell 12 percent to $16.41, erasing the gains made this month.Part of Twitter\u2019s problems are Facebook and Google, the 900-pound gorillas that dominate digital advertising. Over the first half of 2016, marketers spent some $5.7 billion on Facebook advertising alone in the United States, which represented 43 percent of digital advertising growth domestically, according to estimates from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.As a result, Twitter is going back to figure out the different types of ads it can offer advertisers.Some of those may be focused on the company\u2019s live video products, an effort borne out of deals negotiated by Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer. Mr. Noto said that video advertising was the company\u2019s most valuable ad product for the quarter and that it would be a focus for the future.Others said they believed that Twitter\u2019s renewed focus on cleaning up problems with abuse of users on its platform, which Mr. Dorsey said would be a priority in 2017, might make coming to Twitter more attractive for new users and, important, new advertisers.\u201cThey\u2019ve been rolling out many new features and tackling issues such as abuse, all positively received by both users and brands,\u201d said Joshua March, chief executive of Conversocial, a social media customer engagement company. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be seeing more revenue in the future as they become a partner to major brands across the customer life cycle.\u201dTwitter\u2019s management team pushed back on those concerns, pointing to the year ahead as an opportunity for growth after a long, painful 2016. The message was simple: Trust us.\u201cIt may have felt like we weren\u2019t changing much this past year, but those hundreds of little changes added up to more predictable and sustained growth we will now use as a foundation to be more inventive and take bigger risks,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said Thursday morning. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re now going to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shutting Down Speech by Elizabeth Warren, G.O.P. Amplifies Her Message", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans seized her microphone. And gave her a megaphone.Silenced on the Senate floor for condemning a peer, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, emerged on Wednesday in a coveted role: the avatar of liberal resistance in the age of President Trump.For Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters, it was the latest and most visceral example of a woman muzzled by men who seemed unwilling to listen.Critics saw something else: a senator who has rankled members of both parties with her nose for the spotlight lobbing a far-too-early salvo in the next presidential race.\u201cA lot of that\u2019s about 2020 politics,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, grumbled on MSNBC.Mr. McConnell\u2019s subsequent explanation for his maneuver seemed destined for a future Warren campaign ad: \u201cShe was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\u201d After an unsuccessful effort to draft her for the 2016 presidential race, Ms. Warren is considered a very early front-runner for 2020, should she run.After the vote to bar Ms. Warren from speaking further about Mr. Sessions, other senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Tom Udall of New Mexico, read Mrs. King\u2019s letter without facing any objection, prompting some activists to raise charges of sexism.In the letter, Mrs. King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., took aim at Mr. Sessions\u2019s record on civil rights as a United States attorney in Alabama, saying he had used \u201cthe awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens.\u201d She called on the Senate not to confirm Mr. Sessions to a federal judgeship, and his nomination to that post was ultimately rejected.On Wednesday morning, in a conference room in the Capitol \u2014 the vote prohibited Ms. Warren from speaking about the nomination only from the Senate floor \u2014 Ms. Warren addressed civil rights leaders, recounting her long night.\u201cWhat hit me the hardest was, it is about silence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to shut people up. It\u2019s about saying, \u2018No, no, no, just go ahead and vote.\u2019\u201dShe went on.\u201cThis is going to be hard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the tools. There\u2019s going to be a lot that we will lose. But I guarantee, the one thing we will not lose, we will not lose our voices.\u201dAs Democrats strain to navigate the early days of the Trump presidency, weighing the merits of the blanket opposition that many in their base seem to crave, the latest rancor appeared to raise the likelihood of further confrontation in the Senate chamber.Some left-leaning groups seemed comfortable with that.\u201cWhat the public needs to see from Democrats right now is more backbone and more standing on principle,\u201d said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cElizabeth Warren continues to be the model for good behavior.\u201dThe timing is fortunate for Ms. Warren, whose fiery denunciations of corporate greed have long made her a Democratic celebrity.Her new book deal was announced this week. Its title: \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class.\u201d Shortly after Mr. McConnell\u2019s objection on Tuesday, Ms. Warren called a favorite TV anchor, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, and spoke live on the air.On Wednesday, Republicans betrayed no regret for their move, accusing Ms. Warren of ignoring repeated warnings to avoid violating the Senate rule, known as Rule XIX. She had also read a letter from Edward M. Kennedy, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate, disparaging Mr. Sessions.\u201cYou don\u2019t insult \u2014 whether it be from a letter, or from a message from God, or on golden tablets,\u201d said Senator John McCain of Arizona. \u201cThat\u2019s the rules of the Senate. They want to complain about it, complain about it.\u201dDemocrats and their allies resumed their protest against Mr. Sessions on Wednesday with renewed swagger, despite their long odds of blocking his confirmation.\u201cIf Mr. McConnell or anybody else wants to deny me the right to debate Jeff Sessions\u2019s qualifications, go for it,\u201d Mr. Sanders said from the Senate floor hours before the vote.Since the election, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have been among the lawmakers jockeying to be leading messengers for Democratic politics under the Trump administration.There have been bumps. Last month, Ms. Warren faced rare criticism from liberals after voting in a Senate committee to approve Ben Carson as Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development, infuriating voters who had hoped for uniform opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet.This week, it seemed, all had been forgiven. MoveOn.org, the liberal political group, said it had collected about $300,000 in contributions for Ms. Warren since Tuesday night.And by midafternoon, a fund-raising email from Ms. Warren had arrived in the inboxes of her supporters.\u201cI\u2019m still banned from speaking on the Senate floor \u2014 but there\u2019s still time for you to make your voice heard,\u201d the email read, with a link to a page for contributions.She signed off with a familiar message: \u201cKeep fighting.\u201dJonathan Martin and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

A frightening new order is perhaps about to be born from the resentment of the mob. As \u201916 turns to \u201917, civilized men and women hope for the best but fear the worst.\u201cThe year 1916 was cursed,\u201d Czar Nicholas II is said to have written in his diary. \u201c1917 will surely be better.\u201d The czar was, to put it mildly, mistaken. And Helen Rappaport\u2019s splendid new book, \u201cCaught in the Revolution,\u201d charts just how wrong he was. Her eyewitnesses come from the foreign community of Petrograd, whose members watch in horror \u2014 or delight, in the case of John Reed, whose unreliable \u201cTen Days That Shook the World\u201d was to become a definitive chronicle \u2014 as their adopted home succumbs to revolution.The action opens in a city worn out by war. Factory workers shiver in bread lines in the slums while the wealthy continue their glittering social whirl. The expatriate community of St. Petersburg (patriotically rechristened Petrograd after the outbreak of war with Germany in 1914) has been established for almost as long as the city itself. In Pushkin\u2019s memorable phrase, it was Peter the Great\u2019s window chopped through to Europe. By the second decade of the 20th century, entrepreneurial foreigners had established cotton and paper mills, shipyards, timber yards, sawmills and steelworks. The expats, as the American journalist Negley Farson observed, \u201clived like feudal lords.\u201dThe foreigners whose memoirs and letters tell the story of the unfolding crisis are a motley bunch. The American ambassador, David Rowland Francis, a genial former governor of Missouri, does not, in the opinion of the British spy Robert Bruce Lockhart, \u201cknow a Left Social Revolutionary from a potato.\u201d Among Francis\u2019 fellow Americans are two doyennes of Petrograd society who have married into the Russian aristocracy: Princess Cantacuz\u00e8ne-Speransky (Julia Grant, a granddaughter of Ulysses S. Grant) and Countess Nostitz (the daughter of an Iowa grain elevator worker who made a match with Russia\u2019s military attach\u00e9 while working as an actress in Paris).The \u201csuave and gossipy\u201d French ambassador, Maurice Pal\u00e9ologue, spends \u201cmore time socializing than on diplomatic business.\u201d His British counterpart, Sir George Buchanan, insists on walking to the Russian Foreign Ministry through the running street battles, so impressing the Russian soldiers and sailors that they cease fire and wait respectfully as he passes. Leighton Rogers, an American clerk at the National City Bank\u2019s Petrograd branch, sets out in a similar spirit to deliver 9 million rubles\u2019 worth of treasury notes to a safe-deposit vault. He emerges from the crowds unscathed after dawdling to examine playbills on the way.Rogers\u2019s insouciance is telling. Like foreigners in Russia before and since, Rappaport\u2019s narrators are a separate caste, above and apart from the troubles engulfing ordinary Russians. As violence breaks out, many take pains to identify themselves as untouchable. The foreigners are in Petrograd but not of it.\u201cI sit high and see far\u201d is the appropriate Russian aphorism. That outsider\u2019s long view is the book\u2019s strength. After all, these foreigners often have more privileged access to great men and events than the vast majority of Russian witnesses. Ambassadors Pal\u00e9ologue and Buchanan have regular private audiences with the czar, and their diaries offer independent testimony to the autocrat\u2019s weakness. The journalists Florence Harper and Donald Thompson, a Canadian and an American, see more clearly than any of the Russians that revolution is inevitable. \u201cIn fact, I was so sure of it,\u201d Harper later wrote, \u201cthat I wandered around the town, up and down the Nevsky, watching and waiting for it as I would for a circus parade.\u201d Arthur Ransome, correspondent for The Daily News of London, reports that he is \u201cwithin a yard\u201d of Kerensky as he confronts his enemies in the Petrograd Soviet: \u201cI saw the sweat come out on his forehead, I watched his mouth change as he faced now one, now another group of his opponents.\u201dThe British suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst shows up in Petrograd on a quixotic mission to keep Russia in the war. A young agent of British intelligence named Somerset Maugham arrives with $21,000 in his pocket with an equally hopeless brief to prevent the Bolshevik Revolution.Rappaport has unearthed plenty of wonderful new material, including the unpublished memoir of Leighton Rogers, discovered in the Library of Congress. Yet there are some odd omissions. The remarkable Project 1917, a Facebook community set up by the journalist and author Mikhail Zygar, is currently publishing the diaries and letters of a cross-section of witnesses to the revolution in the form of social media posts, appearing exactly a century after they were written. Ambassador Pal\u00e9ologue and the novelist Ivan Bunin, for instance, offer parallel accounts of a dinner for an exhibition of Finnish avant-garde painters that is hijacked by the firebrand poet Vladimir Mayakovsky and his drunken fans. This electrifying moment when the self-appointed prophets of the new age defy the artistic establishment of the old is, sadly, overlooked by Rappaport, as are the exploits of Robert Bruce Lockhart, who is involved in a plot to murder Lenin. So is the career of Frederick Thomas, the American son of slaves who becomes one of Russia\u2019s most successful entertainment impresarios. The exploits of Lockhart and Thomas, unfolding in Moscow, don\u2019t fall into the narrow category of revolutionary Petrograd and are therefore excluded.No matter. By confining herself to foreigners in Russia\u2019s capital, Rappaport takes a necessarily narrow slice of revolutionary history. But the story these witnesses tell is endlessly fascinating.Owen Matthews\u2019s most recent book is \u201cL\u2019Ombre du Sabre,\u201d a novel set during the conflicts in Chechnya and Ukraine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Before Vaquitas Vanish, a Desperate Bid to Save Them", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "No more than 30 vaquitas are left in Mexico\u2019s Gulf of California. Experts propose keeping some in captivity as a last resort.Supported bySAN FELIPE, Mexico \u2014 In the shallow sea waters of the Gulf of California swims a porpoise that few have seen, its numbers dwindling so fast that its very existence is now in peril.Known mostly by its Spanish name, the snub-nosed vaquita is the world\u2019s smallest cetacean, a miniature porpoise with a cartoonlike features and dark smudges around its eyes. The species lives only in the fertile waters of the gulf\u2019s northern corner.The size of its population has always been precarious, but now voracious demand in China for a fish that shares the vaquita\u2019s only habitat has pushed the tiny porpoise to the brink of extinction.This calamity has hardly gone unnoticed. The vaquita has been vanishing in plain sight, to the despair of conservationists who have been advising the Mexican government on how to save it. All of the resources brought to bear, including the protection of the Mexican Navy, have proved to be no match against the illegal wildlife trade.\u201cIf we continue on the path we\u2019re on, we\u2019ll have no vaquitas in two years,\u201d said Barbara Taylor, a marine mammal expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The vaquita are simply bycatch, trapped and drowned in curtains of illegal gillnets set for an endangered fish called the totoaba. The fish\u2019s swim bladder is dried and smuggled to China, where wealthy diners pay thousands of dollars for the delicacy, believing it to have medicinal powers.To feed that appetite, totoaba poachers have killed 90 percent of the vaquita population since 2011, according to the acoustic monitoring program led by Armando Jaramillo Legorreta at the Mexican government\u2019s National Ecology and Climate Change Institute, known as INECC.With so few vaquitas left, experts advising the Mexican government have proposed capturing several specimens and holding them in a sea pen as a way of conserving the species until the threat to its habitat is removed. It\u2019s a last-ditch measure that conservationists had hoped they would never have to resort to.\u201cWe had always been opposed to captivity,\u201d said Lorenzo Rojas Bracho, a marine mammal expert at INECC and the chairman of an advisory group, the International Committee for Vaquita Recovery. But nobody expected that the population would decline so quickly.\u201cThere are risks,\u201d Dr. Rojas Bracho said of the capture plan. \u201cBut they are fewer than leaving them with the fishing as it is.\u201dThe plan would entail training United States Navy dolphins to locate vaquitas, capturing them for transfer to a temporary pool and then to a sea pen to be built in their habitat along the Gulf of California coast. The majority of vaquitas would remain in the wild.But the unknowns loom large. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether they find them,\u201d Dr. Taylor said of the dolphins. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we can catch them. We don\u2019t know how they will react.\u201d\u201cIf you get a negative result in any one of these steps,\u201d she added, \u201cit\u2019s basically game over\u201d for the capture plan. Even in the best of scenarios, breeding in captivity is unlikely to restore the population. A female vaquita gives birth to one calf every two years on average.If the proposal goes forward, the vaquita would join other species at the brink of extinction \u2014 like the California condor and the golden lion tamarin, in Brazil \u2014 that are being closely managed in some form distinct from their natural setting. It would be the first such effort for a marine mammal.A very small population can be pulled back from the edge, but \u201cit requires outside-the-box thinking,\u201d said Samuel Turvey, a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London who studies conservation management for highly threatened species.A managed-conservation plan designed with the expectation that the animals can eventually be returned to the wild \u201cis not a permanent solution,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency stopgap with an exit strategy.\u201dNor would it be a quick fix. \u201cIt requires intensive sustained efforts for decades to recover species from these catastrophic low levels,\u201d said Richard Young, the head of conservation science at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust .Dr. Turvey speaks from experience. He witnessed the first human-caused extinction of a cetacean, the Yangtze River dolphin. Like the vaquita, the baiji, as it was more commonly known, occupied a limited habitat in small numbers and was decimated as bycatch in local fisheries.The baiji \u201conly became a story when it was gone,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit was really dark and upsetting.\u201dIt is an experience that Dr. Taylor, who was on the expedition, hopes not to repeat. \u201cIt\u2019s idealistic to think that we\u2019re going to effect the significant changes in fisheries and enforcement practices in the wild in time to save vaquitas,\u201d she said.If anything, those efforts have reached a nadir.Two years ago, the Mexican government imposed a two-year ban on all gillnets across 5,000 square miles of the vaquita habitat and sent its Navy to enforce it. To support the communities of the upper Gulf, which depend on fishing and shrimping, the government allocated $74 million in compensation over the two years.The hope was that the military could halt the totoaba trade and that two years would be long enough to complete development of vaquita-safe trawl nets to substitute for shrimp gillnets. (Even before the totoaba trade surged, legal gillnet fishing had depleted the vaquita population.)But local fishermen argue that the new nets\u2019 catches are too meager to provide a living, and the authorities have been sympathetic. \u201cWhile there is no alternative to fishing practices, nobody will give up their gillnets,\u201d Dr. Rojas Bracho said.The promised enforcement also has fallen short. That was evident this month aboard the Sam Simon, a 57-meter antipoaching vessel operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an environmental organization.At about 4 p.m. one afternoon this month, a fishing boat pulled up just a few hundred meters from the Sam Simon carrying four men guided by a hand-held GPS device. One of the men dragged a hook in the water, looking for a gillnet they had hidden there.The Sam Simon sent a drone over the small boat and it sped off, only to return with six men aboard, who threw objects at the drone before leaving again. Despite a call to the Mexican Navy, nobody came.Even when arrests are made, conservationists say, the prosecution is too slapdash to win a conviction for a serious crime.Last year, Mexican Navy patrols succeeded in scaring off the totoaba poachers by day, forcing them to haul in their nets at night. But this year, the poachers work openly during the day, some wearing balaclavas, apparently undeterred by desultory government patrols. Some poachers even post photos of their weapons on Facebook.At the same time, four boats belonging to Mexico\u2019s environmental prosecutor are parked on a side street running above the dock here, their motors broken or simply unused because fuel is in short supply.The nets tell a similar tale. Over 10 weeks last spring, Operation Milagro pulled 42 totoaba nets from these waters. In the fall, a broad government-sponsored survey succeeded in finding 36 totoaba nets, 28 of which were in use.In mid-December, Operation Milgro resumed and found 56 more totoaba nets in nine weeks. Almost all were new, and some were set in the same places that the government effort had cleared just weeks earlier.During night patrol aboard the Sam Simon last week, the crew pulled up yet another totoaba net of wide blue mesh, its unweathered red buoys evidence that the net was brand new.\u201cThe situation is so dramatic that we have to take huge measures,\u201d Ms. Layolle said. \u201cIt is a desperate time.\u201dMexico\u2019s environment minister, Rafael Pacchiano Alam\u00e1n, promised this month to send 45 federal police officers to patrol the beaches and to dismantle poachers\u2019 camps.But he did not respond to the main recommendation of conservationists: a permanent gillnet ban. The legal fishing season for corvina has begun, which usually means that dozens of small boats are on the water, giving cover to poachers. But this year the Mexican government has so far declined to grant any fishing permits.\u201cIf you can\u2019t remove the threats, the population keeps declining,\u201d Dr. Turvey said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time for complacency.\u201dAn article on Feb. 28 about the endangered vaquita, a miniature porpoise, referred imprecisely to the legal fishing season for corvina, a type of fish. While the fishing season had begun when the article was published, the Mexican government had not yet granted any permits, so the corvina boats would not have been out fishing and would not have been able to provide cover to poachers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Olympian Winter Moment", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "South Korea is a skiing afterthought no more. The 2018 Winter Olympics is a coming-out party for the country as a winter sports destination.Supported byEmerging from the warmth of her car, Jung Sang-mi watched her husband trudge up a snowy hill, red sled in hand, as their 5-year-old son bounded excitedly ahead, ready for another run. Like many young South Koreans in the congested capital of Seoul, she and her husband escape to the nearby Taebaek Mountains to hit the slopes several times each winter, though she admitted they are still trying to find their legs as skiers.\u201cWe are not really good at it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we do enjoy the sledding.\u201dIndeed, compared with neighboring Japan and its ingrained ski culture, deep-powder skiing and well-established resorts, South Korea is in many ways still coming into its own as a skiing and snowboarding destination. But this could soon change when Pyeongchang hosts the Winter Olympics from Feb. 9 to 25, 2018, only the third time the Winter Games will be held in Asia, and the first time outside Japan.It\u2019s a big moment for the country, which views the Winter Games as a huge source of national pride and is eager to put on a memorable spectacle on par with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 2002 World Cup that South Korea co-hosted with Japan.With tens of thousands of athletes, journalists and spectators expected to descend on Pyeongchang for the Games, it\u2019s also a coming-out party of sorts for South Korea as a winter sports hub, a chance to show the world that it, too, has sparkling-white slopes and a top-notch skiing infrastructure that can continue to attract powder hounds long after the Olympics are over.This quiet region of pine-covered mountains and potato fields not far from the North Korean border, long one of the country\u2019s least-developed areas, has overcome a number of obstacles just to get to this point. Pyeongchang, largely unfamiliar even to many Koreans before the Olympic bid, was once seen as a sizable underdog to win the Olympics. It finally succeeded in its third bid after razor-thin defeats to Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014.The preparations have also been rocky. There were struggles initially to find domestic sponsors and disputes over funding for venues and the plan to build a downhill course in a virgin forest on a protected mountainside. (The organizing committee has done damage control by promising to replant trees and return the mountain to its natural state after the Games.)With one year to go before the opening ceremony, organizers are fervently trying to shift attention back to South Korea\u2019s moment in the sporting spotlight. Most of the venues are nearing completion, including a brand-new Alpine ski center, speedskating oval, figure skating arena and sliding track for the bobsled, luge and skeleton events. The two villages for athletes are about half-finished \u2014 one in the Pyeongchang mountain cluster, the other in the coastal city of Gangneung, where the ice events will be held. A new high-speed rail line is expected to be completed by mid-2017, too, whisking visitors from Seoul to Pyeongchang in just 69 minutes, compared with the current two-and-a-half-hour drive.And the Olympic spirit is finally starting to seep into Pyeongchang, a sprawling county made up of ski resorts and sleepy towns like Hoenggye, where the athletes\u2019 village and Olympic Stadium are being built.Hoenggye is as far from a typical ski town as it gets. The streets are lined with homey dumpling and Korean fried chicken restaurants, as well as nondescript clothing stores with names like Barbie Fashion Shop that stock off-brand sweaters and windbreakers, but nary a ski jacket in sight. A small truck with a squawking loudspeaker makes the rounds in the afternoons selling fresh crab and squid from the coast, and on the outskirts of town, locals hang pollock on wooden racks for days in the winter sun until they become tough as leather, a popular Korean delicacy called hwangtae.A short drive away, the new Alpensia Ski Jumping Center has also become a draw for families, with young children bundled in heavy jackets warily eyeing the top of the steep, icy slope before heading to the observatory for popcorn and photos in front of a less frightening picture of the real thing.The hope is that the Olympics can have a lasting impact on the tourism industry here and help South Korea rival Japan \u2014 and upstart China \u2014 as a winter sports destination.It may take some time to catch up to its neighbors. According to the Ski Business Association of Korea, the number of ski visits in South Korea grew slowly from 5.4 million in 2004-5 to a peak of 6.8 million in 2011-12, but then fell to just 4.9 million in 2015-16, in part because of a slowing economy and an aging population.Japan\u2019s ski industry has also seen a sharp decline since the boom years of the 1980s, but still averages more than 30 million ski visits per year. Though the downturn has hit some resorts hard, the attractions in Japan are still legion: well-equipped resorts with dozens of trails and steep verticals; a lengthy ski season that sometimes stretches into early May; a raucous apr\u00e8s-ski scene (particularly popular among hard-partying Australians), and above all, the endlessly falling snow.Yongpyong has 28 slopes, served by 13 lifts and a gondola, but many of the trails are geared toward beginners and intermediates; an experienced skier can pretty much cover all the \u201csuper-advanced\u201d diamond trails by lunchtime. Safety and proper decorum, not speed, also seem to be paramount concerns \u2014 fences prevent skiers from going off-piste, helmets are ubiquitous, and signs constantly remind visitors to select the appropriate slope for their skill level and slow down.Sharing a Korean Hite beer with friends after a morning on the slopes, Ulrike Pertoll, an Italian who lives in Seoul, said she prefers the pure powder in Japan and the longer runs in the Dolomites back in Italy. But, she added, skiing in South Korea has its benefits: Ski rentals and lodging are cheaper than in Japan, and the proximity of the slopes to Seoul means you can leave work at 5 p.m. on a Friday and be on the slopes several hours later. \u201cWhere else can you do that so easily in Asia?\u201d she said. Yongpyong\u2019s slopes stay open until 2:30 a.m. for night owls, too.The standard dress is a hooded sweatshirt down to the knees (and sometimes well beyond), along with hair dyed various shades of blond and cherry-red and an obligatory flat-brimmed baseball cap, usually covered by the hood for effect. Some boarders go for a head-to-toe ensemble in a glaring shade of pink or orange; the brighter the color, the bolder the fashion statement.It\u2019s not unusual to see GoPro cameras attached to helmets and, on occasion, a rebel snowboarder with a selfie stick fully outstretched, filming himself as he recklessly, yet oh-so-stylishly, carves his way down the mountain. (A clear violation of the rules, mind you.)It\u2019s part slope, part catwalk, with skiers trying as hard as they can to get noticed.Mr. Kim fancies himself a skiing purist \u2014 most of the time. \u201cI just like an outfit I feel comfortable in. If I go with a girlfriend, that\u2019s a different story \u2014 then I like to wear Gucci or Chanel.\u201dAs the industry matures, Mr. Kim hopes Koreans move beyond the image-conscious, fashion-oriented aspect of the sport and try something even more daring \u2014 backcountry skiing on untamed mountainsides far away from the safety of groomed trails. This is difficult to do at the rule-bound resorts around Pyeongchang, but his company organizes backcountry tours to snowy Ulleung island.\u201cWhen Koreans think about skiing, everyone thinks it\u2019s about skiing in a ski resort, surrounded by a fence,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple years ago, people didn\u2019t understand about backcountry skiing, but nowadays lots of people try to do this.\u201dThere\u2019s another change some hope could come with the Olympics: a livelier apr\u00e8s-ski scene.Korean resorts are decidedly family-oriented, with few entertainment options after sundown. At the Alpensia Resort, a small, six-slope facility that\u2019s within minutes of most Olympic venues and will serve as the focal point for the Games, the only apr\u00e8s-ski options are a karaoke parlor, a smoke-filled pool hall and a charmingly rustic bar with Hite beer on tap and a dozen varieties of chicken, from soy sauce chicken to a curiously named \u201ccheese chicken.\u201d\u201cPeople tend to go to a restaurant and base everything around food. Then they start drinking and have a good time, or entertain in their apartments,\u201d said Mr. Hughes, of Korea Snow. \u201cAs an Australian, I\u2019m used to a bar culture.\u201dThen again, there are some advantages to a quieter ski destination. In Japan, he noted, \u201cthere are so many Australians, I feel like I haven\u2019t left home. When I go to Korea, we\u2019re pretty much the only ones there.\u201dThe OlympicsGetting ThereWhere to Stay and SkiSki clothing rental is available at all resorts, too.Justin Bergman is the Shanghai correspondent for Monocle magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Snap\u2019s I.P.O. Filing Reveals About the Company", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProspective investors will be drawn to how quickly Snap has grown its advertising business in roughly two years, with the company showing a nearly sevenfold increase between 2015 and last year. The question is how long the start-up can maintain anywhere close to that kind of growth.The company said in its prospectus that it views daily active users as a critical measure of engagement \u2014 a measure that is tracked closely by similar companies. (Facebook on Wednesday reported that it had an average of 1.23 billion daily active users in December.)We plan to continue to make acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, and seriously harm our business.As does every company in this kind of filing, Snap laid out a number of potential risks to its business. Among them is Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, what has come to be known as Brexit, which could pose large problems for the company because it recently designated London as its international hub.Snap noted that other countries may choose to censor Snapchat. Moreover, the company pointed out that many of Google\u2019s services, which power a significant portion of Snap\u2019s computer services, are restricted in China. So, according to Snap, it isn\u2019t clear \u201cif we will be able to enter the market in a manner acceptable to the Chinese government.\u201dThe company was originally built for users to send self-destructing photographs and messages to their friends. But the company\u2019s ambitions have grown to include user stories, news and branded content.(3) Amounts reported include 401(k) contributions and life insurance premiums paid by us on behalf of the named executive officer.(4) Amount reported includes $890,339 for security for Mr. Spiegel.(5) Amount reported includes (i) $328,747 for security for Mr. Spiegel and (ii) $15,766 for personal travel.(6) Mr. Sehn was not a named executive officer for the year ended December 31, 2015.Evan Spiegel, 26, one of Snap\u2019s two founders, started the company while he was a student at Stanford. Mr. Spiegel, who is the company\u2019s chief executive and serves on the board, owns a stake in the company that was worth $3.7 billion at the end of last year. His 2016 compensation package came to $2.6 million and included $503,205 in base salary, a $1 million bonus and $901,635 in other compensation that covered his $890,339 personal security budget.The company\u2019s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, received nearly $151 million during that same time, largely because of a $145 million stock award when he joined the company from the investment bank Credit Suisse in 2015.In August 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of 260,832 shares of Class B common stock from Mr. Horowitz, at a purchase price of $30.72 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million.A month before the company first filed initial public offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its two co-founders each sold stock worth $8.1 million.The company more than tripled its employee ranks from 2015 to 2016. Yet even with 1,859 staffers, the company has a relatively small number of workers relative to its valuation.The company has attracted a number of prominent backers, who are expected to reap handsome rewards \u2014 if only on paper \u2014 in the initial public offering.

{"Headline": "Binding the Nation in Its Love of Meatloaf", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who loves bow hunting so much that he worries the scent from his security detail may scare off the deer, was more than happy to hand over his recipe for venison meatloaf.Senator Chuck Schumer was equally enthusiastic about his own recipe, a wide-ranging cooking project that centers on a meatloaf of beef, veal and pork surrounded by pieces of barbecued chicken.On the chilly evening before President Trump was inaugurated, Mr. Bruni and Ms. Steinhauer sat down in a loud bourbon bar not far from the Capitol to discuss meatloaf, a topic far from the political drama playing out on the big screen over their heads.Then again, maybe not all that far. \u201cIt\u2019s a quintessential American dish that can bind a nation!\u201d Mr. Bruni proclaimed.Propelled by their own Proustian meatloaf memories and leveraging their connections to politicians, chefs and other journalists, Mr. Bruni and Ms. Steinhauer have attempted the seemingly impossible: a comprehensive and compelling collection of 49 recipes for meatloaf.Friends since they met at The Times in the mid-1990s, the two talk in the shorthand of an old married couple. In the amount of time it takes to finish a cocktail, they will have discussed Hill politics, office politics and sex, and made two references to Nora Ephron, to whom the book is dedicated.\u201cAt some point we thought, \u2018Isn\u2019t this a moment for meatloaf?\u2019\u201d Ms. Steinhauer said. \u201c\u2018Can we make meatloaf ecumenical?\u2019\u201dThe book\u2019s first recipe is essentially the Chevy of meatloaves, built from ground beef seasoned with onions and topped with tomato sauce. It\u2019s from Mr. Bruni\u2019s mother, Leslie Bruni.The authors call it a populist meatloaf, but soon the recipes that follow take a pluralist turn. Dry Spanish chorizo and manchego cheese marry inside a loaf of ground pork. Chopped ahi tuna is covered with a clove-scented sauce of mushrooms, tomatoes and red wine. There are loaves infused with the flavors of Japan and China. Lamb, their favorite meat to make into a loaf, is punctuated with mint, pine nuts, couscous and harissa.There is a Frito pie meatloaf, a hamburger and French fries meatloaf, and a chicken meatloaf that tastes like a Buffalo wing dipped in blue cheese dressing.Meatloaf, they write, is the \u201cTalented Mr. Ripley\u201d of food because it can impersonate anything.\u201cWhen you start researching meatloaf varieties, you realize how many people have done meatloaves that essentially mimic other dishes,\u201d Mr. Bruni said. \u201cIf you eat our taco meatloaf and you close your eyes, you really think you are eating a hard-shelled beef taco.\u201dPerhaps not every dish can be represented in meatloaf. Mr. Bruni\u2019s Waterloo was the chicken cordon bleu meatloaf. After three versions, he gave up.Still, poultry \u2014 at least dark meat \u2014 can be a perfect canvas. \u201cPoultry\u2019s blank stare allows the other flavors and textures to strut,\u201d Ms. Steinhauer writes, pointing readers to a chicken eggplant loaf scented with fennel seeds, donated by the chef Michael White.Other celebrity chefs contributed, and with the exception of Daniel Patterson\u2019s vegetarian zucchini loaf with lentils and barley, they make intricate projects out of a humble dish. Bobby Flay devised a Korean-style meatloaf with deep-fried shallots and fried eggs. Mario Batali offered a technique-heavy Italian stuffed meatloaf. April Bloomfield\u2019s recipe is built on lamb shoulder that she suggests cooks grind at home.The authors make passionate arguments for saut\u00e9ing onions before mixing them into meatloaf batter. They deeply consider the crucial role of binders, those unsung starchy players like rice, bread and potatoes that hold each loaf together.They hand down rules: Hand-chopping vegetables produces a better texture than using a food processor. Meat should be almost at room temperature before supporting ingredients are mixed in. And always use your hands instead of a spoon.They learned, too, that meatloaf likes spice, and a lot of it. The lesson came when Anne Kornblut, a former Washington Post editor who is now a Facebook executive, sent her recipe for a Moroccan-influenced lamb loaf that called for such an unruly parade of garlic and spices that the authors feared it would be a disaster.\u201cI thought, \u2018I am going to have to fix it, which is boring, and I\u2019m going to have to tell her, which is painful,\u2019\u201d Ms. Steinhauer said. As it turned out, the recipe was brilliant.Eventually, the two even asked politicians for recipes because \u201cyou\u2019ve got to get to 50 meatloaves somehow,\u201d Mr. Bruni said.They called a simple beef recipe from Senator Susan Collins, a Republican known for cooperating with her Democratic colleagues, the bipartisan loaf. The office of the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, sent a recipe for a Cal-Ital meatloaf that mixes veal and bison with ciabatta bread, rosemary and cilantro. They said she makes it with her granddaughter.\u201cAnyone who has worked with Pelosi can imagine what it was like to try to get a recipe from her,\u201d Ms. Steinhauer said.Of course, when they were writing the book, neither Mr. Bruni nor Ms. Steinhauer knew that Mr. Trump would become president, or that the nation would be spinning with political disruption. But their timing proved to be perfect.\u201cI don\u2019t think meatloaf can save the world,\u201d Mr. Bruni said. \u201cBut I certainly think in the coming tomorrows there will be a healthier appetite for comfort.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sweden, Nation of Open Arms, Debates Implications of Immigration", "Date": "2017-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMALMO, Sweden \u2014 It has been only three years since she came to Sweden from Syria, but Hiba Abou Alhassane already says \u201cwe\u201d when speaking about her new home country.In many ways, Ms. Alhassane is a perfect example of Sweden\u2019s long-held belief in the rightness of sheltering and helping to support migrants and refugees. She has worked hard to integrate. Already nearly fluent in Swedish, she teaches at two local primary schools.Some residents see the clash as a refreshing chance to voice long-held concerns over immigration and its effects. Others see it as both racist and redundant, since Sweden is already changing its immigration policies.Swedes are not rushing to a hard-line Trump-like approach to immigration, nor are they ready to throw out their country\u2019s humanitarian values when it comes to sheltering refugees, values that remain firmly rooted in the national psyche.Until a year and a half ago, Sweden offered lifetime protection, along with family reunification, to people deemed legitimate refugees. In 2015, about 163,000 people came and sought that protection, and the sheer numbers led this country of roughly 10 million to tighten the rules. Protection is now subject to review after one or three years and family reunification is more difficult, making Sweden less accessible and less attractive to immigrants.\u201cSweden has been a top recipient of asylum seekers per capita in Europe, priding itself on a humanitarian approach to immigration,\u201d said Daniel Schatz, a visiting scholar at Columbia University\u2019s European Institute. \u201cDuring the Iraq war, Sodertalje, a small Swedish municipality, took more Iraqi refugees than the U.S. and U.K. combined.\u201d\u201cSweden is experiencing a clash of ideals,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile the country seeks to maintain a humanitarian ideal, public concerns around immigration have begun to shift the politics of traditionally liberal Sweden to tighter immigration controls and more restrictive policies. The debate on migration is thus a very personal one for many Swedes.\u201dMr. Trump is not the only person pointing to what he considers to be the troubling consequences of immigration to Sweden. This month, a seasoned investigator with the police department in Orebro, Peter Springare, caused a stir with a Facebook posting in which he discussed the case files on his desk.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been handling Monday-Friday this week: Rape, rape, serious rape, assault rape, black mail, black mail, assault in court, threats, attack against police, threats against police, drugs, serious drugs, attempted murder, rape again, black mail again and abuse,\u201d Mr. Springare said. He went on to list the first names of the people he said were suspects, all but one of which were traditionally Middle Eastern.The post, which was shared 20,500 times, led to an outpouring of support. People sent hundreds of flowers to Mr. Springare\u2019s police station, and more than 170,000 people joined a Facebook group supporting him.But both his superiors and the police in other departments said that they did not recognize his description, and that national levels did not resemble his claims.Manne Gerell, a lecturer in criminology with Malmo University, said more immigrants than Swedes commit crimes, but the exact numbers are hard to determine. And on the national level, he said, the imbalance is not nearly as great as Mr. Springare suggested.Still, it seems as if frustrations over the issue are spreading.In 2014, the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats gained 12.9 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections to become the country\u2019s third-largest party, up from only 2.9 percent eight years earlier.\u201cShunned by mainstream parties, their stance is increasingly resonating with some voters,\u201d Mr. Schatz said.Some of the party\u2019s progress has to do with residents\u2019 perceptions of crime, a significant issue here in Malmo, Sweden\u2019s third-largest city with about 350,000 people, whichis often called the \u201cChicago of the Nordic region.\u201d The reference is not to its icy, windswept shores. The murder rate in Malmo is the highest among Scandinavian countries: 3.4 annually per 100,000 citizens, compared with 1.3 in Stockholm, the capital.More than 40 percent of the city\u2019s residents or their parents are foreign-born, a fact that is often linked to Malmo\u2019s crime rates, but Mr. Gerell, the criminologist, said a correlation was not clear, and even if there was one, immigration was not the only contributing factor.\u201cImmigration has most likely played a part in the crime rates,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have many, many poor people living in poor areas so it\u2019s not only about immigration. That said, poverty doesn\u2019t necessarily cause crime, but when there are lots of social problems there will be more of other problems.\u201dEven some longtime immigrants concede that integration has not always gone smoothly, and that Sweden needs a more robust debate about what has gone wrong and what could be done better.Maher Dabour, who came to Sweden from Lebanon in the 1980s, said the main problem lay in how migrants are schooled in societal differences.\u201cThey didn\u2019t manage to explain to us how to be citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cIn legal terms it\u2019s not difficult, and they\u2019ve been more than generous, but it\u2019s not enough to give money.\u201dThirty years after leaving Lebanon, Mr. Dabour drives a Volvo and instinctively buckles his seatbelt like a Swede, but he breaks with tradition and chain smokes.He said that Swedes had built a society based on the individual\u2019s respect for the state, discipline and rules, but that many newly arrived people come with no respect for, or trust in, government authorities, but great regard for family and elders.\u201cThe authorities say everything is O.K. and in order, but it\u2019s not true,\u201d Mr. Dabour said. \u201cWe need to have an open and honest discussion about the problems,\u201d he added, referring to crime among immigrants.In Malmo, the Rosengard district has for years been named by the national police as having a high crime rate, although that has improved recently. It is home to 25,000 people, 86 percent of them with foreign backgrounds. Low-rent housing is clustered around a shopping center, where shops bear names like Noor, Najib and Orient Musik.\u201cWe try to not focus on the problems,\u201d said Maria Roijer, the chief librarian at the public library. She tries to act as a bridge between the many nationalities of Rosengard and Swedish society.Ms. Roijer said many people of foreign origin come to the library and join the language cafe to practice their Swedish, to borrow books and use the computers.\u201cThey need them to be able to communicate with authorities,\u201d she said.For decades area residents have felt they got more negative attention from the media than positive responses from municipal officials.\u201cThey built a nice waterfront and created 10,000 jobs in the western part of town, but all we got was two mosques,\u201d said Mira Dekanic, a retiree and nearby resident.But change is coming. Recently three new real estate companies bought apartment blocks here and one also acquired the shopping center. The companies say that while they must make a profit for their shareholders, they are also committed to the area\u2019s social development so people who live in Rosengard will have jobs, better houses and more places to meet and things to do in their free time.\u201cWe\u2019re aiming for the long term,\u201d said Birgitta Bengtson, a representative of Trianon, one of the developers.If all goes well, more native Swedes and Swedish retailers may move to Rosengard. \u201cH&M and Espresso House is a dream,\u201d she said.And for her part, Ms. Alhassane, was not interested in the comments, either.\u201cHonestly, everything coming from the U.S. these days is a kind of joke,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even curious to find out if what he said was true. I didn\u2019t need to.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Tell a Ghost Story", "Date": "2017-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTip\u201cThe most important thing is the setting,\u201d says Ruth Robbins, professor of Victorian literature at Leeds Beckett University in England. \u201cIn the 19th century, ghost stories were read aloud so that the atmosphere set people up to be pleasurably scared in a communal way.\u201d Britons in the Victorian era were obsessed with ghost stories because they reflected uncertain times \u2014 the Industrial Revolution, a move to urban living and technological advances like the telegraph, a supernatural-seeming invention. \u201cStart with elements that you may be afraid of because of that atavistic, primitive danger,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cBodies that are apparently human but might not be, like dolls and portraits. If the narrative begins in a room with those items, you\u2019re more likely to be haunted by that space.\u201d Material detail is powerful, because ghost stories are often about objects. \u201cPeople become possessed by possessions,\u201d Robbins says.Establish what kind of ghost is haunting the setting \u2014 ideally a figure from the past with unsettled business. Many ghosts \u201ccome back because the dead person can\u2019t rest,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cEither they\u2019ve been done violently to death or their possessions have been stolen. So they come back to put things back where they belong.\u201d But you don\u2019t want your ghost to be defined too clearly. \u201cThe way to get really frightening is if you go for something that you can only glimpse out of the corner of your eye and your other senses tell you that something is there. You can hear it, you can smell it, you can sense that it is really big.\u201dTo get a feel for effective ways to be scary, read a wide range of stories, from Victorian literature to the modern day. \u201cYou might construct ghost stories in which the dead communicate through their Facebook pages or tweets or Snapchats,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cGhost stories have always made use of modern technology.\u201dDetermine what sort of resolution works best for you. A lot of ghost stories wrap things up like a \u201cScooby Doo\u201d episode. Others leave your audience in a world that doesn\u2019t feel secure. \u201cSome of the best stories end out of nowhere, and we can\u2019t explain it, and it leaves us feeling unsettled for ages,\u201d Robbins says.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Assailant Near Louvre Is Shot by French Soldier", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA soldier opened fire, hitting the attacker several times, but not before he slashed at one of the other soldiers, causing minor injuries.The Paris prosecutor, Fran\u00e7ois Molins, said the attacker, who was 29 years old, was believed to be an Egyptian who arrived in France on Jan. 26 from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, on a visa he obtained last November.The assault took place on a stairway leading down to the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall that lies between the subway station closest to the museum and one of the museum\u2019s entrances.Mr. Molins, who is known for sticking to the facts, refrained from saying anything about the man\u2019s motivations, but said that his passport had two visas to Turkey, in 2015 and 2016, and that he also had a visa for Saudi Arabia. He had a residency document for the United Arab Emirates.Mr. Molins did not say where the man might have traveled in Turkey. Until recently, a stretch of the eastern Turkish border with Syria was highly porous, and many people slipped into territory held by the Islamic State in Syria\u2019s northeast.The man was not known to the French security authorities, but he was identified through fingerprints and a photograph taken when he obtained his visa, Mr. Molins said.The suspect had rented an apartment for one week, paying about $1,830, in a well-heeled neighborhood just four subway stops from the Louvre. Two days after arriving in Paris, he bought two military-grade 16-inch knives at an arms store in central Paris for about $730, according to the authorities.Although the Louvre attack was swiftly contained and involved only one assailant, it was likely to add to the woes of the museum and the city, where the number of visitors declined significantly in 2016 because of successive terrorist attacks and attempted attacks. The number of visitors to the Louvre was down 15 percent from 2015, and the number of foreign visitors fell, notably from Russia, Japan, China and Brazil.Friday\u2019s attack also coincided with the city\u2019s final presentation of its bid for the 2024 Olympic Games, casting something of a pall over a day that Paris officials had hoped would not be associated with terrorism.Still, the quick response by the military was likely to ease criticism about the expense and efficacy of using soldiers alongside the police to fight terrorism.When terrorists carried out a massacre at the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 attacks, soldiers were nearby but were not under orders to act and were unable to aid the police, raising questions about their usefulness. While the situation on Friday was different \u2014 the soldiers were acting in self-defense \u2014 it was described repeatedly by politicians and senior government officials as a display of preparedness and \u201csang-froid.\u201dAbout 10,000 soldiers are deployed throughout France, with 3,500 in the Paris region alone.Many people were also impressed by the calm efficiency displayed by the staffs of both the museum and the Carrousel du Louvre.The museum had several rooms designated as secure places, and guards escorted visitors to those areas.Bastien Lopez, 21, an intern at the museum, said he was at work when \u201call of a sudden we saw a huge flow of people coming in the museum, and the people in charge of the security shut down the three main access doors.\u201d\u201cThen they asked us to follow an itinerary that led us into a specific room,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere we stayed confined for two hours and a half.\u201d He stayed in one of the rooms of the department of Islamic art, in the museum\u2019s basement, with a few hundred people.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a rush: Everything went very smoothly,\u201d Mr. Lopez added. \u201cWe were not piled up; we could all sit on the floor. Some people took a nap.\u201d\u201cThe tourists reacted super well. The security persons were given instructions that we translated in English and in Chinese.\u201dThomas, a 21-year-old who declined to give his surname, said he was doing maintenance work on electronic screens in the underground mall when he heard gunfire nearby.He suspected an attack, yet his first reaction was not fear, but a \u201csurvival instinct,\u201d fueled by a \u201csurge of adrenaline,\u201d he recalled as he stood near a police cordon a few hours later.\u201cI followed the protocol, which was to leave through the emergency exits, since we were in one of the stores,\u201d he said. \u201cI evacuated, and I took two people with me.\u201dElian Peltier contributed reporting from Paris, and Hannah Olivennes from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice Department Urges Appeals Court to Reinstate Trump\u2019s Travel Ban", "Date": "2017-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe administration\u2019s brief was the last in a series of urgent pleas to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which is now set to rule on the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency. The ruling will almost certainly be followed by an appeal to the Supreme Court.The court scheduled an hourlong oral argument for Tuesday. That gives at least another day of reprieve to foreign visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, as well as other immigrants, who initially were blocked from entering the United States by Mr. Trump\u2019s order.The administration\u2019s brief largely tracked its earlier arguments that dismissing the ban outright would threaten national security and disregard presidential authority. But it also asked the appeals court, at a minimum, to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u2014 appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government\u2019s case might not be successful.\u201cAt most,\u201d the brief said, the court order blocking the ban should be limited to \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\u201d That would allow the federal government to block people who have never visited the United States.On Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the administration stood ready to reinstate the entire ban. \u201cOnce we win the case, it will go right back into action,\u201d he said.Later on Monday night, Mr. Trump called threats \u201cfrom radical Islamic terrorism is very real.\u201d\u201cCourts must act fast!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation\u2019s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court. And none of the lower-court rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump.The Ninth Circuit scheduled the oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 3 p.m. Pacific time. It is to take place by telephone, and the court said it would be live-streamed on its website. Holding an oral argument by telephone in a major case is unusual.The case will be heard by Judge William C. Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush.Opponents of Mr. Trump\u2019s targeted travel ban made three kinds of arguments in their submissions to the appeals court, saying that the ban is unlawful, that it represents bad national-security policy, and that it is a threat to the nation\u2019s economy.Fifteen states and the District of Columbia \u2014 including New York, California, Massachusetts and Virginia \u2014 filed a supporting brief to argue that allowing the ban to stand would \u201ccause harm to the states, including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents.\u201dIn a brief filed Saturday, the Trump administration argued that Judge Robart\u2019s order would cause irreparable harm to national security.In response, lawyers for Washington and Minnesota said that was not plausible, because it would mean the nation had long been suffering \u201csome unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm.\u201d\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d the brief said. \u201cAs this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\u201dOn Monday, the Trump administration responded that the states were asking the courts \u201cto take the extraordinary step of second-guessing a formal national-security judgment made by the president himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority.\u201dThe states responded that \u201ccourts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants\u2019 true motives.\u201dThey added that the administration had taken \u201ca dizzying number of positions\u201d on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order itself appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it will not enforce that part of the order.Questions about permanent residents are not moot, the states\u2019 brief said, as the administration could again change positions.The officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama; Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton; Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser; and Leon E. Panetta, secretary of defense and director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama.Mr. Trump\u2019s order, the officials said, would endanger American troops and intelligence sources, disrupt counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts, damage the economy and have \u201ca devastating humanitarian impact.\u201d\u201cAnd apart from all of these concerns,\u201d the former officials said, \u201cthe order offends our nation\u2019s laws and values.\u201dThe third front in the legal battle against Mr. Trump\u2019s order was opened by the technology industry and other businesses.Almost 100 companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, urged the Ninth Circuit to continue to block the order, saying it \u201charms the competitiveness of U.S. companies.\u201dThe \u201cinstability and uncertainty\u201d created by the order, the brief said, \u201cwill make it far more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to hire some of the world\u2019s best talent \u2014 and impede them from competing in the global marketplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Sen was in a gold gown, Ms. Lopes in silver, Ms. Bailey in a purple encrusted with beige, Ms. LeFrak in navy and Ms. Torres in a strapless and backless pink feathered number. I chose my black Ashish sparkle track suit and sequined leopard top, and fit right in.Miss Colombia, who reminded me of Jessica Alba complete with big dark eyes and knockout figure, was the favorite going in because last year (as anyone who\u2019s ever on social media may remember), the host Steve Harvey mistakenly announced Miss Colombia as the winner before realizing she was actually the first runner-up. Miss Philippines was, in fact, the Queen. This year\u2019s representative from Colombia made it to the final three \u2014 along with Miss Haiti and Miss France, all in form-fitting gold-sequined gowns.The crowd exploded with excitement when the crown was placed on her head.I\u2019m a feminist, and I know that pageants can be seen as a sexist relic of bygone days. But I could see these women\u2019s joy and satisfaction at being given a global platform to show off not only their legs but also their intelligence and accomplishments.The fact is, after \u201cBrexit,\u201d the chaos of the Trump administration\u2019s first week, and global discussions of walls and isolationism, the Miss Universe 2017 pageant felt uplifting and empowering place by contrast. I can\u2019t think of any other experience where I\u2019ve felt that inspired while being that overdressed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colbert Rides a Trump Wave, While Fallon Treads Water", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookThe difference: Mr. Colbert brought a carving knife, and Mr. Fallon brought a butter knife.The president\u2019s conference \u201cwas a robust one hour and 17 minutes long,\u201d said Mr. Colbert in the \u201cLate Show\u201d monologue that night. \u201cIt was so beefy you could eat it with a fork. But you\u2019re going to want to use a spoon to get every drop of the crazy.\u201d He played a clip in which Mr. Trump declared, \u201cI inherited a mess.\u201d Mr. Colbert answered: \u201cNo, you inherited a fortune. We elected a mess.\u201dMr. Fallon began NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in bronzeface as Mr. Trump, squinting and head-bobbing, hitting many of the same highlights, but much less pointedly. \u201cWe inherited a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is such a mess. Not even a giant Roomba could clean it up.\u201d Drinking from a water glass held in a tiny prop hand, he added: \u201cI\u2019ve just made my new secretary of labor Beyonc\u00e9. Who knows more about going into labor than someone carrying twins?\u201dWhen Mr. Colbert moved to CBS from Comedy Central a year and a half ago, he was the one struggling to adjust. How could he transition from the scathing political comedy of \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d to broadcast TV, where Mr. Fallon had shown, like Jay Leno before him, that audiences just want to escape after a long day?Mr. Colbert is not, right now, the fiercest of the late-night anti-Trumpists (that\u2019s Samantha Bee), the most depthful (John Oliver) or the most potent (Seth Meyers, whose \u201cA Closer Look\u201d segments are killing). But he has a bigger stage, and he seems to have figured out how to be authentic within that space.It was both one of the worst and one of the best shows Mr. Colbert has ever done, growing both awkward and earnest as it sunk in, live on camera, that Mr. Trump would be the next president. \u201cI can\u2019t put a happy face on that,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s my job.\u201dInstead, he has put his game face on. Mr. Colbert\u2019s comedy hasn\u2019t become radically different, but it has been more frank and caustic. After the president implied that something dire had just taken place in Sweden (it hadn\u2019t), on Monday night he quoted former Prime Minister Carl Bildt of Sweden, who asked, \u201cWhat has he been smoking?\u201d Mr. Colbert suggested a certain part of the Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s anatomy.Then he smiled, walked to the camera and blew a kiss. The network-TV Mr. Colbert is more cheery than his cable character. But it\u2019s as if the Trump administration had solved the problem of reconciling his new comedy with his old by making truthiness America\u2019s official language.Some of Mr. Colbert\u2019s deadpan jokes on the Sweden story \u2014 \u201cNever Fjorget\u201d \u2014 could have come straight off the \u201cReport\u201d: \u201cTragically, Sweden is the third not-a-terrorist-attack that has not shocked the world in the last month. First, there wasn\u2019t the Bowling Green Massacre, then no one was lost in Atlanta.\u201dMr. Colbert\u2019s ability to do more serious interviews \u2014 minus the ironic distancing of his \u201cReport\u201d character \u2014 has also been an advantage. On Tuesday, Joe Scarborough, the Republican host of \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d told him that his party colleagues \u201care going to be judged for the next 50 years\u201d on how they respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the press and the judiciary. (\u201cI wish I shared your optimism that there will be a time after Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Colbert said.)Mr. Colbert\u2019s and Mr. Fallon\u2019s approach to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency is, broadly: \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d But where Mr. Colbert means it in the sense of, \u201cThis is terrifying,\u201d for Mr. Fallon it\u2019s more like, \u201cThis is silly.\u201dHis \u201cTonight\u201d monologues about Mr. Trump have been quick and glancing \u2014 but Mr. Fallon has never really been a monologue guy. He has played Mr. Trump as the anchor of his own news network (\u201c100 percent fair and 112 percent factual\u201d), and in the Oval Office spinning a wheel with the names of potential Supreme Court nominees while dancing to the \u201cPrice Is Right\u201d theme song. He has goaded Alec Baldwin, the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d impressionist in chief, into a battle of Trumps.His bits have been typical Fallon \u2014 goofy, light, full of pop culture references. But right now, they feel the opposite of huge.It\u2019s a pretty accurate word for Mr. Fallon\u2019s approach, though. That\u2019s not to say he has any deliberate plan to soften Mr. Trump\u2019s image. (In fairness, he also had Barack Obama on for \u201cSlow Jam the News.\u201d)Rather, the whole spirit of Mr. Fallon\u2019s comedy is that of someone who badly wants things to just be normal again. Guys! Can we all cool off and laugh about the president\u2019s goofy hair? Can\u2019t we just take an hour and chill?But things aren\u2019t normal. Not even Mr. Trump\u2019s fans \u2014 who voted for him to deliver a shock to the system \u2014 see it that way. Mr. Trump made his campaign angry, cultural and personal. As president, he has continued to goad his followers into a war of all against all with internal enemies: refugees, the media, any Americans deemed less \u201creal.\u201dVery recently, Mr. Fallon\u2019s political material has gotten a bit feistier. After Mr. Trump visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Tuesday, he joked, \u201cThings got awkward at each exhibit when Trump would turn to Ben Carson and say, \u2018Friend of yours?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Treadmills Add to Evidence in Arrest for Dog Fighting", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA woman was arrested on charges of animal cruelty after officials found all the signs that her pit bulls had been used for dog fighting, according to prosecutors in Queens. Huddled in cages inside a garage in Far Rockaway, Queens, the four dogs had torn ears, bruises, broken teeth, puncture wounds and cuts.But it wasn\u2019t just the battered dogs that detectives said confirmed their suspicions. Investigators also found a stockpile of training equipment, like a bloodied \u201cbreak stick,\u201d a tool commonly used to separate a dog\u2019s clenched jaws, as well as a device known as a slat mill, a dog-powered treadmill often used to make fighting animals firm and fleet.Yet animal cruelty experts and the police say that these machines are the dog fighting world\u2019s open secret and are found and used as evidence in most dog fighting stings nationwide.Some pet owners, manufacturers and veterinarians say that the devices can be a healthy way to strengthen dogs and that they can help produce prize dogs for the somewhat obscure world of canine strength competitions. The machines can be used by any dog, their defenders say, but the avalanche of online instructional videos show overwhelmingly that it is pit bulls \u2014 the chief breed used in dog fighting \u2014 doing the running.At the offices of the Humane Society of the United States in Gaithersburg, Md., Chris Schindler, the director for animal cruelty and fighting prevention, keeps as a teaching tool a slat mill recovered during a sting operation. Owning a running machine or making one hardly means that a person is involved in dog fighting \u2014 people living in apartments or with limited mobility might find them a practical way to exercise energetic dogs.Dr. Richard Goldstein, the chief medical officer of the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, said the center used motorized treadmills to rehabilitate patients, adding that the machines must be monitored at all times by trained workers. Nonmotorized treadmills can be a cheaper and safer alternative for pet owners, he said, adding that sled dogs, for example, are often trained on treadmills before races so they can run indoors.\u201cWe understand that there is obviously abuse of the techniques to train dogs to strengthen their endurance,\u201d Dr. Goldstein said, \u201cbut it is a legitimate tool for training dogs.\u201dSlat mills are a preferred piece of equipment for dog fighters, said a man who trained and fought pit bulls across the United States for over 20 years, before quitting in 2010 and becoming an informant for animal rights groups and law enforcement.\u201cYou can be very discreet with your illegal activity. You can portray it as saying that it\u2019s just exercise equipment,\u201d said the man, who declined to be named because he is an informant. \u201cThe reality is, it\u2019s all illegal and it is made to make these dogs fighting machines.\u201dExperts say there is a strong correlation between fighting and the running tracks commonly sold on the web. \u201cA lot of things can be inhumane in the wrong hands,\u201d Mr. Schindler said.Dog fighting is illegal nationwide, and in 20 states, including New York, possession of slat mills is, too, if there is proof of intent to use them for dog fighting purposes.\u201cYou\u2019re not talking just about the mill itself, you\u2019re talking about the totality of the evidence seized, that show this person is involved in dog fighting, which is inherently cruel,\u201d Mr. Schindler said.\u201cIt\u2019s relatively compact, you can keep it in your basement, no one sees you involved in the training, and it can be secretive,\u201d Dr. Lockwood said. \u201cThat is why it is one of the preferred pieces of conditioning equipment.\u201dSlat mills were discovered on the property of Michael Vick, a former professional football player who was convicted in 2007 of running a dog fighting ring on his Virginia estate.When people call to order mills, however, he has learned to listen for certain buzzwords and unusual questions to try to keep them from falling into the wrong hands. They may mention \u201ca keep,\u201d or ask how long a dog can run until exhaustion.\u201cI end the conversation abruptly,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIt is for my own mental and emotional well-being.\u201dThe woman who has been charged with animal cruelty by Queens prosecutors, Cherise Mickens, 27, had rented a garage in which her dogs were found starving, stacked in metal crates, alongside a slat mill. She faces up to four years in prison if convicted. A lawyer for Ms. Mickens did not respond to a request for comment.Advocacy groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals condemned the discovery and stressed that laws around the running machines should be strengthened.The whole slat mill industry is problematic, the dog fighting informant said.Manufacturers \u201ccan\u2019t differentiate between if I\u2019m a dog fighter or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be banned in every state and every country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Girl Meets Boy, Finally, After 9 Years Online", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVows9 PhotosSeventeen years ago, a pair of 14-year-olds living on opposite coasts were connected through a website for video-game enthusiasts.Though romance was not on the minds of Joanna Champion, who lived in Rochester, or Tristan Cooper, who lived in Silverton, Ore., their connection grew stronger with each passing day, making it virtually impossible \u2014 despite the distance between their keyboards \u2014 for either of them to pull the plug on their electronic chats.So they kept on chatting, and a conversation that began with a single click in 2000 continued for nine straight years, until Ms. Champion and Mr. Cooper came face to face in October 2009.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain how it felt to grow close to someone over such a long period of time without actually meeting,\u201d Ms. Champion said.\u201cIn some ways it was weird,\u201d she added, \u201cbut in other ways it was great, because there was a real sense of freedom in our communication, and I think we felt like we could be truly honest and authentic because we led entirely separate and distant lives.\u201d\u201cIt sounds strange now, but it didn\u2019t at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cHer boyfriend and I eventually fell out of touch, but me and Joanna, we just kept on talking.\u201dMs. Champion, who described both herself and Mr. Cooper as \u201cnerdy, homebody types,\u201d recalled their earliest conversations, which took place on AOL Instant Messenger and occasionally on the telephone in the days before Facebook and Snapchat.\u201cAt first it was like, \u2018How\u2019s school?\u2019 and \u2018What movies have you seen lately?\u2019 that kind of stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we struck up a friendship and learned so many things about each other, like the fact that we were both movie geeks who loved cheesy action films from the \u201980s with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal \u2014 the good Steven Seagal.\u201dBy 2003, their friendship had evolved into a mutual crush. Now both 17 and living in a still-Twitterless universe, they exchanged photos of themselves, for the first and only time, using a computer scanner.Ms. Champion, who was just beginning her first year at New York University, and Mr. Cooper, still a senior in high school, knew almost everything about each other, but they also knew that their timing for romance was not quite right.\u201cThere was nothing we could do about it,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cWe were almost 3,000 miles apart, didn\u2019t have money to buy airline tickets, and our parents had no idea what was going on, as we kind of kept what we had as our own little secret.\u201dThat secret was nearly spilled when Mr. Cooper\u2019s father, Christopher, said he came home early one day and realized his son had skipped school.\u201cI walk in and the computer is on, so I know Tristan is playing hooky,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI look down and see a note on the screen saying, \u2018I\u2019m bored.\u2019 So I wrote back, \u2018I\u2019m really bored, too.\u2019\u201cTristan, who was never confrontational, comes in as I\u2019m at the keyboard and shouts: \u2018What are you doing? You crossed the line!\u2019 We had it out and he stormed away, and I never heard about it again.\u201dMs. Champion and Mr. Cooper continued to chat on a wide range of topics, including details regarding other people they were dating.\u201cThat brought out a lot of jealousy and anger in each of us,\u201d Ms. Champion said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201dIt reached a point, Mr. Cooper said, where he refused to talk with Ms. Champion whenever he was dating someone else.\u201cIf I heard Joanna\u2019s voice, I knew my feelings for her would start to bubble up again, and I didn\u2019t want to emotionally betray my girlfriend of the time,\u201d he said.Despite the ebb and flow of their relationship, they always managed to stay in touch.\u201cEach day never felt right unless we talked,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cThere were a few times where we got into some stupid fights and stopped communicating, but one of us would eventually cave in and re-establish contact.\u201dBy 2008, Ms. Champion had graduated from N.Y.U., and was working as a hall director there while studying for a master\u2019s degree in visual culture. Mr. Cooper, who had not yet graduated from Portland State, was still living in Silverton and working on occasion in retail.\u201cI was just sort of floating around aimlessly, not really doing much with my life but talking to Joanna,\u201d he said.During one particular chat that year, Mr. Cooper suggested to Ms. Champion that it was time for them to come out from behind their consoles and meet in person.\u201cWe were now independent and had enough money to get together,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter years of talking to her but never seeing her, I thought it would be a natural extension of our relationship.\u201dMs. Champion had doubts.\u201cI was so nervous, I thought I would die,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all those years, what if something about our friendship and banter and chemistry was different in real life? What if it was awkward, or we hated each other? What if he smelled bad?\u201dIn October 2009, she put those concerns to rest and boarded a plane for Seattle, which she deemed a \u201cneutral city,\u201d to meet her longtime pal, up close and personal.\u201cWe were both 23 and still hadn\u2019t told our parents about each other,\u201d Ms. Champion said. \u201cI was very nervous about going out there to meet him alone, but I looked at it logically and thought that if he were an ax murderer or if this were some type of con job, what sense would it have made for him to have invested nine years of his life in me?\u201dShe was waiting by the luggage carousel when he arrived to pick her up at the airport.\u201cWe approached each other nervously and then hugged,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt strange to be meeting someone for the first time that I had already known so well, and for so long.\u201cBut once we started talking again, the butterflies went away and things were back to normal. And this time, there was a real sense of excitement and romance in the air.\u201dThey spent four days together in Seattle, checking into a hotel and doing what Mr. Cooper described as \u201ctouristy things,\u201d all the while making the kind of in-person observations that were not visible over a phone line.\u201cI realized I\u2019m about an inch shorter than she is,\u201d Mr. Cooper said, laughing. \u201cI was a little self-conscious about that.\u201dHis favorite first, however, was the sight of Ms. Champion laughing at his jokes.\u201cFor years, all I got when we made corny jokes was the sound of her laughing or two letters alternating back and forth, some variation of ha-ha,\u201d he said. \u201cI found out that I really loved her smile. Part of me always knew I would.\u201dMs. Champion said she first noticed \u201chis beautiful blue eyes,\u201d and how \u201che was as kind and respectful and funny in person as he was on the phone.\u201d\u201cAnd by the way,\u201d she said, \u201che smelled lovely.\u201dDuring the car ride back to the airport, Ms. Champion and Mr. Cooper sealed nine years of friendship, and a promise to continue chatting, with a long-awaited, much-anticipated kiss.In the ensuing months, they embarked upon a long-distance relationship, visiting each other whenever they could, and began letting family and friends in on their secret.\u201cMy husband and I were sitting in our den one day when Joanna comes in pretty nervously, and says, \u2018I have something to tell you,\u2019\u201d recalled her mother, Linda Champion. \u201cWhen she told us about Tristan and how long they had been communicating, we were blown away.\u201dTherese Grande, one of Ms. Champion\u2019s best friends from N.Y.U., remembered the moment she found about Mr. Cooper.\u201cWe were on this really long flight to Paris together,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen Joanna turns to me out of nowhere and says, \u2018Well, as it turns out, there\u2019s kind of been this person in my life for a really long time that I need to tell you about.\u2019\u201cAll of a sudden, it was like this Tristan guy just fell out of the sky. I was stunned.\u201dMr. Cooper moved to New York to be with Ms. Champion in August 2013, and proposed to her in October 2015.\u201cI wanted to get a job before we got engaged,\u201d he said. \u201cI was always a little too laid-back, the least motivated kid in gifted class, and not nearly as driven as Joanna, but she has given me a wonderful reason to be more motivated in life.\u201dThey were married Jan. 21 at Thalassa Restaurant in TriBeCa, known as much for its stellar seafood reviews and celebrity sightings \u2014 Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep have dined there \u2014 as for hosting family-style weddings. This one spread out over three floors: the wine cellar, where the ceremony was held; the main floor, where the reception took place; and the loft, where dinner was served.Some of the guests arrived early, many by yellow taxi, and were treated to the sight of Ms. Champion and Mr. Cooper posing for prewedding photos \u2014 she in a bridal gown by Adrianna Papell, and he in a suit by Combatant Gentlemen \u2014 just outside the restaurant\u2019s front door on Franklin Street.A short time later, their nearly 100 guests gathered inside, where John D. Carrion, a friend of the couple who was ordained online by American Marriage Ministries, stood with them beneath a wedding canopy as they exchanged vows.\u201cI\u2019m so glad that 17 years ago a geeky boy and an awkward girl managed to find each other against all odds, from 2,700 miles away, and start down a road that led us here today,\u201d said Ms. Champion, her voice beginning to crack.Mr. Cooper told Ms. Champion that meeting and marrying her was a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime kind of luck.\u201d\u201cI feel as if I married the girl next door,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though she was virtually a world away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "College Costs Too Much? N.Y.U. Paves Way to Graduate Faster", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudents at New York University, where a year of undergraduate education can run to about $66,000 in room, board, tuition and fees, often complain about the cost of four years at the school in Greenwich Village.Now, N.Y.U. has a suggestion for them: Finish faster.On Friday, the university announced a series of measures that make it easier to graduate in under four years, part of an initiative aimed at diminishing the university\u2019s enormous affordability problem.\u201cWe were surprised,\u201d Professor Schall said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what convinced us we needed to make this more transparent and more available to more students.\u201dStudents have long found ways to make it through school more quickly to save money. But there is increasing momentum to formalize the process in the face of ballooning outrage over college costs and student debt \u2014 while N.Y.U. is expensive, many other private universities cost $60,000 or more a year.N.Y.U.\u2019s \u201cacceleration\u201d effort relies on a few shifts. For example, while students pay for 18 credits per semester, many actually take only 16, officials said, so the university will increase the number of two-credit courses it offers.It will also allow many students to transfer in up to eight credits from other schools, like local community colleges where they can take inexpensive classes over the summer \u2014 in the past, this has been allowed on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the university has trained advisers to help students create schedules that will get them to their three-year goal.But some who study education wonder what students will miss if they rush through their undergraduate years, and they worry about who will feel pressure to make those sacrifices.While some students can get what they need academically in three years, Dr. Goldrick-Rab said, packing in all those credits can take away from the time they can spend on other things.\u201cWe agree that the price of college is a problem,\u201d she said. But she questioned whether the solution was \u201cto essentially have less college, or less time in college.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d she said of accelerated schedules, \u201cbut it worries me.\u201dMichael S. Roth, the Wesleyan president disputed the idea that there was something uniquely effective about an eight-semester undergraduate education.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything magical about eight semesters, or six, or 10, for example,\u201d he said. \u201c I think it\u2019s just a convention.\u201dThe sped-up tracks are not always popular, however. Mr Roth estimated that about 20 Wesleyan students annually graduate in three years, up from roughly three a year before they made the option official. As of this May, Purdue expects 14 students to have graduated in three and a half years or less, since the program was announced in 2014.\u201cSo far, we haven\u2019t had a lot of takers,\u201d said Josh Boyd, director of undergraduate studies in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue. \u201cWhen we speak to parents, they tend to be more excited about it than the students.\u201dAshley Korkeakoski-Sears, an N.Y.U. English major who is on track to graduate this May after just three years, said that she did not regret speeding through. While she had to skip some fun classes, like hip-hop dance, she has had time for plenty of experiences. She interned at the International Rescue Committee, she has worked as an office assistant and an executive assistant, and she studied abroad in Madrid.Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said she decided to hustle through to save money. She expected to receive less financial aid her senior year because her mother planned to go back to work.But this track is not for everyone, she said. Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears, who describes herself as a planner, said she knew she wanted to be an English major when she was a junior in high school. Students who need time to to figure that out, as most do, would be better served taking their time, she said.\u201cI definitely think this is a way to ease the burden for now, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term solution\u201d to the cost of college, Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take into account every type of student, and every type of student should have the ability to make college affordable to themselves.\u201dCouldn\u2019t N.Y.U. and other colleges solve the problem just by cutting how much they charge? Professor Schall said there was a constant pressure on universities to increase their capacity to teach and do research, \u201cand those things are expensive.\u201d\u201cThere is no silver bullet,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf we could triple our endowment, that would be lovely, but short of that, we\u2019re looking at everything from the price of books to the use of temporary employees,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be as creative as we can.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Waited 5 Years (and 45 Minutes) to Marry", "Date": "2017-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVows9 PhotosElena Sarkissian had plenty of time to figure out whether she wanted to marry Demetrios Orfanoudis before their wedding on Jan. 21. First came five years of long-distance dating. Then, just before the wedding itself, came an unexpected stretch of time with nothing to do but sit and think.\u201cI ended up spending 45 minutes circling the cathedral,\u201d said Ms. Sarkissian, 44, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman in Manhattan. Alone in the back seat of a rented Bentley in her Anna Maier couture wedding gown, with only the car\u2019s driver for company, \u201cI had no phone, and no watch,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I knew we were running more and more late for the ceremony. It was such a stress. But we just kept circling.\u201dAbout 60 of the 150 guests invited to Ms. Sarkissian and Mr. Orfanoudis\u2019s wedding had gotten stuck on a rented bus, inching through the protest to get them to the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on East 74th Street for the 4 p.m. wedding. The bus, carrying friends and family, who came from as far as Athens and who were staying at a Midtown hotel, did not make it for 40 minutes or more.Ms. Sarkissian knew she couldn\u2019t start the wedding with nearly half her guests in transit. And so she circled. And as she did, she didn\u2019t feel anything approximating jitters. She felt something else entirely: the kind of eagerness born of waiting for years to seal the deal on a romance in which everything went right.\u201cI married my best friend,\u201d Ms. Sarkissian said after an hourlong traditional Greek Orthodox ceremony that included chanting, crowns and a priest in robes. Despite the transit chaos and the late start, all the Holy Trinity pews were full, and the mood was buoyant. \u201cIt was really stressful and exhausting. But I feel like the luckiest girl alive.\u201dMs. Sarkissian and Mr. Orfanoudis met in September 2011 after a monthlong telephone courtship set in motion by a friend of Ms. Sarkissian, Dr. Mary Vouyiouklis Kellis.Dr. Kellis, who lives in Cleveland, remembers going out with her soon-to-be husband, Augustine Kellis, and Ms. Sarkissian. \u201cElena said to Augie, \u2018I\u2019m really tired of dating the same kind of guy in New York,\u201d\u2019 Ms. Kellis said. She asked if he had any solid, intelligent, eligible friends worth meeting.\u201cHe told me all his friends were married,\u201d or else an unprintable word that means not especially nice, Ms. Sarkissian said. \u201cAnd then Mary said to him: \u2018What about your cousin Demetri? He\u2019s such a great guy.\u2019\u201dFor Ms. Sarkissian, a classic dark-haired beauty who grew up in Michigan and moved to Manhattan when she was 30 after becoming a cancer epidemiologist in Chicago, \u201ca great guy\u201d was starting to mean someone other than the hard-charging finance professionals she had gotten used to dating.\u201cThese types of guys were very driven, and they weren\u2019t ready for anything real,\u201d said Ms. Sarkissian, who switched careers from medicine to real estate after several medical school friends enlisted her to help them find apartments to buy. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to have fun when you\u2019re dating in New York. But I do think it\u2019s hard to find someone you connect with on different levels, in terms of both your everyday enjoyment of your time together and on higher levels that are more important, like values, character, family and your goals for the future.\u201dEven harder, at least for Mr. Orfanoudis and Ms. Sarkissian, was finding those higher-level matchups in the same city. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. Like Ms. Sarkissian, Mr. Orfanoudis had dated many women in Washington before he found what he called \u201cmagic\u201d in New York.\u201cMy parents always wanted me to meet someone I could happily spend my life with,\u201d said Mr. Orfanoudis, who, like Ms. Sarkissian, was raised Greek Orthodox; he cannot personally rebut the stereotype about traditional Greek families\u2019 obsession with seeing their children settle contentedly into marriage, he said. \u201cI had been hearing some of that for a while. I just never found the right person.\u201dWhen he finally traveled to Manhattan to meet Ms. Sarkissian, after that month of getting-to-know-you phone calls during the summer of 2011, he knew he had struck romantic gold.\u201cWe just hit it off,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has this great smile and huge dimples, and she\u2019s an aggressive, very professional businesswoman, but when you scratch the surface, she turns out to be this superfun person who laughs at my jokes. Which is important.\u201dMs. Sarkissian felt just as comfortable around the tall and gentle Mr. Orfanoudis, though she admitted she was concerned there might be no physical attraction. \u201cHe had seen a lot of pictures of me on Facebook, but he had only one or two on there of himself, that were very old,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect. And then he sent me a picture of him that was kind of awkward and not very flattering.\u201dAdding to her unease was the dawning awareness that she had already fallen for him.\u201cThe fact that we had solidified our friendship on the phone before we met actually provided a bit of anxiety,\u201d she added. \u201cYou don\u2019t spend a month on the phone with someone you\u2019re not invested in.\u201dFortunately, she said: \u201cThe attraction was there. He was very warm, and we had this easy exchange that translated from our phone conversations. We just rolled right into the relationship.\u201dThey have been rolling ever since, with Mr. Orfanoudis and Ms. Sarkissian making the commute from Washington to New York, or vice versa, almost every other weekend. (\u201cI\u2019ve explored every method of transportation,\u201d Mr. Orfanoudis said, \u201cbut no matter what you do, it takes four hours.\u201d) In addition to savoring the moments together in New York and Washington, they often go farther afield.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just as easy for us to spend the weekend somewhere else, so we\u2019ll go for weekend trips,\u201d Mr. Orfanoudis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to places like the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Miami, Vegas.\u201dWhen Mr. Orfanoudis proposed to Ms. Sarkissian in September, he had recently been admitted to the New York bar, paving the way for him to become a full-time New Yorker and a full-time partner to Ms. Sarkissian.\u201cI wanted to kind of move things along so she could be a part of everything,\u201d he said.Ms. Sarkissian, who accepted Mr. Orfanoudis\u2019s proposal after he traveled to her hometown, Bloomfield Hills, Mich., to ask for her parents\u2019 approval, rallied.\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 had two requests after we were engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cOne was that we try to get it done A.S.A.P. because his mother was gravely ill. And the other was that he wanted to get married before his 50th birthday, which was Feb. 8. So I had to hustle.\u201dMs. Sarkissian\u2019s father, Miran, is Armenian. Her mother, Angela, is Greek; they split time between homes in Athens and Bloomfield Hills. Ms. Sarkissian calls herself \u201cGreek lite\u201d compared with the more traditional Mr. Orfanoudis. But aside from Ms. Sarkissian\u2019s modern-leaning decision to have both her parents walk her down the aisle, and the blessings at the altar from an Armenian archbishop, Khajag Barsamian (who flew to a meeting with the pope at the Vatican just afterward), their wedding was a study in traditional Greek Orthodoxy.Ms. Sarkissian\u2019s cousin Lisa Chicouris, of Chicago was the koumbara. In addition to providing an extra set of hands to hold the bridal bouquet of cala lilies and white roses, her responsibilities included interchanging the rings three times after the Rev. John Vlahos blessed them; the triple interchange refers to the holy trinity and represents the couple\u2019s devotion.Col. Alex Stathopoulos, a longtime friend of Mr. Orfanoudis from Washington, was the koumbaros. He exchanged the crowns three times before Father Vlahos placed them on the heads of the bride and groom to symbolize the couple\u2019s intertwined lives and the joining of their souls.Most of the service was chanted rather than spoken, though much of the chanting was in English instead of the customary Greek. Adding to the drama of the chanting, which at times took on a deep baritone, was the cathedral\u2019s Byzantine mosaics and religious iconography. In keeping with tradition, neither Ms. Sarkissian nor Mr. Orfanoudis spoke during the service, not even to utter \u201cI do.\u201d Instead, they were led by Father Vlahos in a ceremonial walk around the wedding table three times, symbolizing the circle of eternity and signifying their first steps as husband and wife.That, perhaps, was the easiest journey they had taken all day.When the guests and wedding party filed out of Holy Trinity, the same bus that ferried the 60 late arrivals, as well as the Bentley Ms. Sarkissian killed time in, were idling outside, waiting to take everyone to the Yale Club.Ms. Sarkissian\u2019s father settled in near a piano player once there and offered a theory on marriage, and of patience.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting a long time for Elena to decide to get married,\u201d Mr. Sarkissian said. \u201cBut our being anxious was not part of the equation for her. It didn\u2019t matter. Waiting a few extra minutes for her wedding didn\u2019t matter, either. What matters is that she came up with the right person.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Supreme Court Weighs In", "Date": "2017-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe justices\u2019 remarks, which indicated easy familiarity with the major social media services, suggested that they would strike down the North Carolina law under the First Amendment.Justice Elena Kagan said that President Trump, every governor and every member of Congress has a Twitter account.\u201cSo this has become a crucially important channel of political communication,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a person couldn\u2019t go onto those sites and find out what these members of our government are thinking or saying or doing.\u201dThe North Carolina law makes it a crime for registered sex offenders to use many commercial websites that allow the exchange of information and do not limit their membership to adults.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that social media sites had become, and in some ways had surpassed, the public square as a place for discussion and debate.\u201cThe sites that Justice Kagan has described and their utility and the extent of their coverage are greater than the communication you could have ever had, even in the paradigm of public square,\u201d Justice Kennedy said.The North Carolina law has economic consequences, too, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\u201cTake something like LinkedIn, which many, many people in our society today are looking for jobs there, but high school students are permitted to look for jobs and to post their personal data on that site,\u201d she said.Justice Kennedy mused that any number of free-speech doctrines doomed the law.\u201cElizabeth Barrett Browning,\u201d he said, before quoting the poet: \u201cLet me count the ways.\u201dJustice Stephen G. Breyer told Robert C. Montgomery, a lawyer for the state, that it could have drafted a much narrower law to protect children from sexual predators. Justice Breyer sketched out his analysis.\u201cThe state has a reason?\u201d he asked. \u201cYeah, it does. Does it limit free speech? Dramatically. Are there other, less restrictive ways of doing it? We\u2019re not sure, but we think probably, as you\u2019ve mentioned some. O.K. End of case, right?\u201dThe law was challenged by Lester Packingham, who had pleaded guilty in 2002 to taking indecent liberties with a minor when he was a 21-year-old college student. He received a suspended sentence and two years\u2019 probation and was made to register as a sex offender.Mr. Packingham came to the attention of the authorities in 2010, when he wrote on Facebook about having a traffic ticket dismissed. \u201cGod is good,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Montgomery did not defend that reasoning at Monday\u2019s argument in the case, Packingham v. North Carolina, No. 15-1194. He argued instead that the state was entitled to limit Mr. Packingham\u2019s speech.Some justices noted that criminal convictions can have lasting consequences. \u201cSome states prohibit ex-felons from voting,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said. \u201cSome states and the federal government prohibit keeping and bearing arms. Those are constitutional rights.\u201dDavid T. Goldberg, a lawyer for Mr. Packingham, said those restrictions had a basis in history and logic. They were nothing like \u201ctaking away people\u2019s First Amendment rights,\u201d he said.Mr. Montgomery said the North Carolina law left sex offenders with plenty of other ways to exercise their First Amendment rights. \u201cIt\u2019s not the entire internet that is being taken away from these offenders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can still have their own blog. They can read blogs. They can do podcasts. They can go to nytimes.com.\u201dFour justices asked whether The New York Times\u2019s website would in fact be covered by the law, and the argument concluded without a clear answer.\u201cEven if The New York Times is not included,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said, \u201cthe point is that these people are being cut off from a very large part of the marketplace of ideas. And the First Amendment includes not only the right to speak, but the right to receive information.\u201dJustice Kagan agreed. \u201cWhether it\u2019s political community, whether it\u2019s religious community \u2014 I mean, these sites have become embedded in our culture as ways to communicate and ways to exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d she said.Justice Kagan added that the law had curious features. \u201cSome of what\u2019s exempted by the law seems, I have to say, some of the most dangerous stuff,\u201d she said, mentioning exceptions for \u201cany website that provides only a chat room or only photo sharing.\u201dMr. Montgomery said the state had tried to write the law narrowly and to address the danger of lurking predators quietly harvesting personal information about minors. But Justice Kagan said the distinctions it drew made no sense.\u201cSo you mean that there\u2019s a constitutional right to use Snapchat, but not to use Twitter?\u201d she asked.Justice Kennedy was not impressed. \u201cI think that does not help you at all,\u201d he said, as the buffer zone was limited in size and applied to everyone. \u201cYou could have all the political speech in the world\u201d outside the zone, he added.Justice Kagan said a restriction on using social media was quite different. \u201cHow many people under 30 do you think don\u2019t use these sites to get all their information?\u201d she asked. \u201cUnder 35? I mean, increasingly, this is the way people get all information.\u201dJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. did not seem ready to concede that. But, he said, \u201cI know there are people who think that life is not possible without Twitter and Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Other couples across the world were still in limbo.\u201cWhat does it mean if you live in heaven and don\u2019t have the person you love?\u201d asked Mr. Nasreldin, a Sudanese-born dental hygienist in Aurora.For couples of different nationalities trying to navigate America\u2019s immigration system, the president\u2019s executive order and the legal upheaval it created have thrown relationships and marriages into turmoil.Americans with Syrian and Sudanese partners outside the United States are staying up past midnight to buy one-way plane tickets and plan harried reunions while enforcement of the order is still suspended. Legal challenges aside, couples of mixed Iranian and American backgrounds are rethinking their plans to build lives together in a country where one partner no longer feels welcome. Engagement parties abroad have been scrapped, a wedding dress returned.Mr. Nasreldin and Ms. Fadul were among those racing to reunite, hoping to bind themselves together no matter the outcome of federal court cases challenging the legality of Mr. Trump\u2019s temporary ban.Many of the couples touched by the executive order are accustomed to living apart. They had met online, on business trips or on return visits to countries that one or both had left years ago. What changed, they said, was their certainty they would make it through the immigrant vetting process and one day live together in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s all up in the air,\u201d said Guy R. Croteau, a psychotherapist in Boston who met his fianc\u00e9, an Iranian, through Facebook and became engaged after a few whirlwind visits in Istanbul and Malaysia.\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Croteau said. \u201cWill there be additional vetting? We don\u2019t know.\u201dIn the meantime, couples are trying to bridge the divide digitally. Olivia Cross chats by video with her husband, Yahya Abedi, an Iranian, as she walks between classes at the University of Michigan. Mr. Abedi has taped photos of the couple\u2019s wedding to the wall of his apartment in Bandar Abbas so Ms. Cross, an American citizen, can see them when she calls.After meeting online, they married last February in Tbilisi, Georgia, and had been threading their way through the visa process when Mr. Trump signed the order. Iran retaliated, saying it would bar American citizens from traveling there. And there went the couple\u2019s plans for a reunion in Iran this May.\u201cI just feel like whatever I do, however I try to pivot, it\u2019s all blocked,\u201d Ms. Cross said. \u201cWe just want to be able to live our life together.\u201dWhen Michelle Brady chats by video with her husband, a Sudanese-born aid worker recovering in Poland after heart surgery, their 21-month-old son, Jad, recognizes his father\u2019s pixelated face on the screen. When they disconnect, Jad tries to find his father in the computer.\u201cHe\u2019s crying and upset that his dad is not there,\u201d said Ms. Brady, who is now unsure when her husband can join them at their home in the Washington area.Even those who aren\u2019t separated say the order has scrambled their plans for weddings and engagements. Relatives from Iran or Syria aren\u2019t sure whether they will be able to attend summer weddings in the United States. Couples with immigrant parents say they are hesitant about traveling to their familial homelands to celebrate.Dr. Arash Afshinnik, who leads a neurointensive care unit in Fresno, was married three weeks ago in California and planned to fly to Iran with his wife, Sandra Shahinpour, for a second ceremony with her family. He has been in the United States since he was 3 months old, but she spent part of her 20s in Iran and is close to friends and cousins who had wanted to celebrate.\u201cWe\u2019ve scrapped the plans,\u201d Dr. Afshinnik, 40, said. His wife returned the dress she had bought for the ceremony. \u201cWhile everything\u2019s getting sorted out, what hasn\u2019t changed is the uncertainty. Why even dip your toe in the pool? It just seems too hot.\u201dFor much of their 21-month courtship, Jehan Mouhsen and Khaled Almilaji lived apart. She studied medicine in Montenegro. Dr. Almilaji, 35, a Syrian physician well known among humanitarian-aid workers, was in Turkey, saving lives, he said, by supporting doctors in the Syrian conflict zone. He is a romantic who sent Dr. Mouhsen, 26, \u201cbuckets of roses\u201d and surprised her with visits to Montenegro.They married in July, and in August they settled in Rhode Island, where Dr. Almilaji had received a scholarship for a master\u2019s degree in public health at Brown University, studying on a student visa. He was excited to be sharpening skills to help rebuild his country. She was excited because it seemed their days apart were over.Now Dr. Almilaji is stranded in Gaziantep, Turkey, near the Syrian border, after what was supposed to be a one-week visit to take care of personal and professional affairs. His original return visa was not honored. He went to the American Consulate in Istanbul on Jan. 20 to get a new visa to return, and has not heard back.Dr. Mouhsen fled the loneliness of their apartment in Providence to stay with friends in New York City, where she is studying for her medical board exams and wrestling with morning sickness. She is pregnant.\u201cHe tells me to eat fruits and vegetables, take care of me and the baby,\u201d she said.Although Dr. Mouhsen has Montenegrin roots, they both grew up in Aleppo, Syria, and plan to return someday. In 2013, Dr. Almilaji\u2019s early detection system found that polio was making a comeback in war-ravaged Syria, and he coordinated a campaign the next year that vaccinated more than a million Syrian children. Though his work was supported by powerful organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, Unicef, the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, there is little they can do to help him now.Early in the civil war, Dr. Almilaji was arrested, tortured and jailed for six months by the regime. But he says he feels even more powerless now that his wife is suffering from an abrupt separation caused by the action of the United States government.\u201cI\u2019ve been arrested, and I\u2019ve been tortured and everything,\u201d he said in a phone conversation from Turkey. \u201cBut my wife, she doesn\u2019t have to suffer this.\u201dJack Healy reported from Aurora, and Anemona Hartocollis from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Snapchat Cohort Gets Into Politics, and Civics Is Cool", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the hallways of Middle School 447 in Brooklyn, talk of gay rights and President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration has replaced chatter about \u201cthe Kardashians or Beyonc\u00e9, or somebody\u2019s new sneakers,\u201d said Leslie Hughes, a seventh-grade English teacher.These are signs of unusual times.With Mr. Trump in the White House, the obsession with politics that has many adult Americans fiercely focused on the Senate\u2019s latest confirmation hearing and the president\u2019s last Twitter message has filtered down to those not yet of voting age. High school and even middle school students are showing a level of civic engagement not seen in years, their teachers and principals say.That, in part, is because it is so much easier to keep up with current events than it was in the past. Rather than having to sit down and watch the nightly news, teenagers can just scroll through Snapchat and Facebook on their phones. The adults in their lives are more attuned to politics as well, and dinner tables are thick with conversation about Mr. Trump\u2019s latest executive orders. And then there is the ultimate teenage imperative: Their friends are talking about it, and they don\u2019t want to be left out.\u201cEven if you aren\u2019t looking for it, you\u2019re going to find it,\u201d added Hayden Mosher-Smith, a classmate, who compared the trending level of political memes to those of pop stars. \u201cLike how you don\u2019t have to read a story about Zayn Malik. You\u2019ll know about Zayn Malik.\u201d\u201cAnd Bernie Sanders is the new Zayn Malik,\u201d Theo said.For students who identify as liberal, many appear to be animated by concerns about the rights of immigrants, Muslims, women and the L.G.B.T. community. At the Manhattan rally, a couple of hundred students from different schools convened at Foley Square, having walked out of class in the middle of the day. Word spread largely on social media, and the students arrived on a wet and cold afternoon, shouldering signs along with their backpacks. One sign said, \u201cMake Racists Afraid Again (or, like, for the first time).\u201dBut the interest is not confined to young people on the left. At Ms. Francis\u2019 Staten Island high school, the students are a mix of liberal and conservative \u2014 Staten Island was the only one of New York City\u2019s five boroughs to go for Mr. Trump in the presidential election. Ms. Francis is in her 16th year of teaching, and she has been through plenty of elections, but during this presidential campaign, something started to change, she said.Her students would ask her arcana about the caucus process and superdelegates. Now, they can offer up specifics about United States border policies during class discussion. When Ms. DeVos was confirmed as education secretary last week, Ms. Francis said, she heard about it from a student.Ms. Beam, who teaches science at the same state\u2019s Riverside High School, said she had to limit how much class time she and her students could spend discussing politics during the presidential campaign. \u201cI\u2019ll foster this debate,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got to learn chemistry at some point.\u201dFor teachers of social studies and A.P. government, however, this moment is scholastic manna from heaven.\u201cThey know a lot, and they\u2019re proud that they know a lot,\u201d Ms. Francis said. \u201cWhat\u2019s on their radar in terms of world events and domestic issues has grown exponentially.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018You guys watched that?\u2019 And they tell me, \u2018It was on C-Span!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even watch C-Span.\u201dBut students can be just as vulnerable to the scourge of \u201cfake news\u201d as their parents.Mr. Raines said that while his school was in a conservative area, he did have some students on the left. And on either side, he said, their questions seem to be seeking something similar: reassurance in an age of bifurcation and rancorous disagreement.\u201cThe whole notion of being able to disagree without being disagreeable is something that I think the kids long for,\u201d Mr. Raines said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re seeking direction on how we get back to that point.\u201d\u201cThis is something that has been a note of hope for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s seeing students wake up to their citizenship, to the fact that citizenship is not passive, or shouldn\u2019t be. Regardless of how you feel about everything that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s thrilling as an educator to see that shift happen in a teenager, to see their world get wider.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Kevin Durant Became Silicon Valley\u2019s Hottest Start-up", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven so, every article on Mr. Durant seemed to boil down to this: He was too nice. And super-duper-stars aren\u2019t \u201cnice.\u201dThat narrative persisted until last June, when Mr. Durant, who had spent eight years dutifully toiling in small-market Oklahoma City for the Thunder, became one of the most heavily courted free agents in league history. The bidding war for his services was like a sports-world variation of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201dBut the funny thing about being in the eye of the hurricane? It\u2019s surprisingly calm there.Here is a look at Mr. Durant\u2019s life in the Bay Area over a recent two-day stretch between big wins against the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Thunder, as he made the rounds as arguably the hottest start-up in Silicon Valley.It was early afternoon on an unseasonably warm winter Tuesday, and Mr. Durant was in high spirits, barreling down the Bayshore Freeway in a black Cadillac Escalade on the way to a speaking engagement at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif.That morning, Mr. Durant was the centerpiece a lavish groundbreaking ceremony for the Chase Center, the $1 billion pleasure dome on the San Francisco waterfront that the team plans to occupy by 2019.With his six-foot-infinity frame and impossibly long legs, Mr. Durant seemed to swallow a yard of real estate with each stride. As an eight-time N.B.A. All-Star seemingly dressed for Pitti Uomo (he wore a blue custom suit, a striped pocket square and white Common Projects sneakers), Mr. Durant certainly stood out in the wood-beam suburban sports bar where a number of diners were decked out in blue-and-gold Warriors gear.Mr. Durant is comfortable with the level of scrutiny he receives in the Bay Area, meaning, not too much. \u201cHey, it\u2019s not L.A., it\u2019s not New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere in between.\u201dAlthough he has appeared on magazine covers for a decade, he still carries himself like a teenager. He slouched in the booth with his shoulders slumped, face buried in his iPhone before the food arrived.Once the conversation did start, however, Mr. Durant sounded pensive, introspective. Unlike many M.V.P.-caliber athletes who seem to field every question seemingly looking for the quickest exit strategy, Mr. Durant paused to consider each question, and he seemed unafraid to open up, despite his natural shyness.\u201cI didn\u2019t really have friends,\u201d Mr. Durant said of his childhood in Seat Pleasant, Md., which neighbors Washington. \u201cI was quiet. I was awkward-sized.\u201dRaised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood, Mr. Durant said he \u201cdidn\u2019t look the part\u201d of a cool kid, adding that, \u201cIt made it easy for me to not worry about the social life and just play basketball.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the gift and the curse of being an athlete that is so dedicated at an early age, you forget about real life sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just in the last few years starting to feel comfortable to meet new people, going out in groups, meeting new girls, hanging out. That stuff was foreign to me until a few years back.\u201dNear the end of the lunch, a petite woman in a Warriors jersey trailing two eager children approached the booth. \u201cExcuse me, Kevin?\u201d she asked diffidently. But a man in his security detail whisked her away before he could respond.Upon leaving the booth, however, Mr. Durant demonstrated his growing ease with fame among his adopted family of Warriors fans, making a beeline toward the woman\u2019s table to graciously pose for selfies with the family.\u201cThey can feel how much heat that I got from coming here,\u201d he said of his controversial move to Bay Area. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make me feel at peace.\u201dFifteen minutes later, the Escalade pulled into a parking garage beneath the sprawling YouTube campus. Mr. Durant had no time for a plunge down the office\u2019s 45-foot-long red slide, sink a 10-footer on the indoor putting green or grab a quick snooze in a Kubrickian, white-plastic \u201cnap pod.\u201d After all, he was the employee perk that day.He proceeded to an auditorium that was filled to capacity with YouTube employees, some of them looking barely old enough to vote, let alone drink, and took a seat onstage across from Neal Mohan, YouTube\u2019s chief product officer, who was moderating an employees-only question-and-answer session that was live-streamed to YouTube and Google offices around the world.Flashing a $59,000 Vacheron Constantin watch, Mr. Durant did not exactly fit the profile of the skinny-armed tech programmer. But he cast himself as just another member of the YouTube generation, talking about his obsession with Grand Theft Auto V, hip-hop and, of course, YouTube. \u201cI\u2019m sure you guys know, you want to look at one quick video and it turns into four or five hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dangerous, that app.\u201dWhen an audience member asked if he planned to try acting, like the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Blake Griffin or the Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James, Mr. Durant snorted sarcastically, \u201cIf anybody could do it, it\u2019s Blake Griffin and LeBron.\u201d The audience erupted in laughter, since both players are considered Oscar-worthy on-court floppers. Mr. Durant, holding back a chuckle, insisted that he was talking about their impressive work in commercials and movies.In a sense, Mr. Durant is not wholly unlike the legions of ambitious 20-somethings in hoodies and cool sneakers who descend on Silicon Valley to make hundreds of millions.The only difference is, he has already made hundreds of millions.The next day, Mr. Durant was piloting his black Tesla Model S up a windy road in the Oakland Hills, after the Warriors\u2019 morning shootaround. It was around noon on game day, the second meeting of the season with his former team, the Thunder. He seemed more distant that day, his voice quieter, raspier.Dressed in a gray Warriors hoodie, he steered into a hilltop cul-de-sac and pulled into a driveway of his sleek contemporary-style house, where he hopped out, plugged in the Tesla, and headed into the house through a garage where his black labradoodle Ro was resting peacefully.As his private chef hunched over the stove, preparing a game-day pasta meal, Mr. Durant slumped into the world\u2019s longest sectional sofa and stared out the soaring windows, which were rattling from the wind, toward downtown Oakland in the distance. He chose the house for the view.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to be on top of everything, see it from a different perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was at the bottom growing up.\u201dMr. Durant has been living in the 10,000-square-foot rental for only a few months, and as a bachelor who spends half his time on the road, it has a temporary feel to it. The white lilies on the kitchen table were silk, the fiddle-leaf fig plant in the corner of the family room was plastic.Still, it was decorated in a style that might be called Sports Superstar Moderne: the stark white walls are festooned with abstract Expressionist artwork, with ample trophies on display. The house has a home recording studio, a recreation room littered with Washington Redskins memorabilia, a movie theater that seats 16, and a walk-in closet devoted to sneakers.Mr. Durant padded barefoot past his hangar-size master bedroom, into another vast closet where he keeps his custom suits, jewelry and watches. The real treasure there, however, was his swelling collection of vintage concert T-shirts from the 1980s and \u201990s \u2014 Nas, Biggie, Metallica, Stone Cold Steve Austin. \u201cI take pride in my collection,\u201d he said.But what\u2019s the point of looking runway-ready in a culture where Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s sweatshirt sets the tone? Mr. Durant feels more at home in the Silicon Valley-approved wardrobe of jeans, sneakers and hoodies.\u201cFashion,\u201d he said, \u201cis what you make of it.\u201dBack in the family room, Mr. Durant paused in front of his frame wall containing a moody black-and-white photograph showing three clenched fists, each with a small triangle tattoo at the base of the thumb. One fist was Mr. Durant\u2019s, another belongs to Charlie Bell, a childhood friend who is now a top executive at Jay Z\u2019s agency, Roc Nation, and third to Mr. Kleiman, who still represents Mr. Durant through Jay Z\u2019s Roc Nation Sports and is also working for him directly as his manager and partner in the Durant Company.The photo is a reminder to himself about real friendship, Mr. Durant said. His social world had shrunken since his controversial move.\u201cWhen you make it to the league, especially from where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s like everybody made it,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cI can remember times going to a club, I had 30 people with me. I\u2019m thinking to myself, this was never me. But if you\u2019ve never had the support outwardly like that, people showing you affection in your face, love in your face, even if it\u2019s fake, you try to grab that because it feels good for the moment.\u201cNow, it\u2019s us three.\u201dHe may be rounding the math a little bit. Mr. Durant may have called off his engagement with Monica Wright, a W.N.B.A. player, and dialed back the entourage, but he goes out often after games in San Francisco and is quickly making friends with the tech titans who populate Oracle Arena\u2019s version of celebrity row.In September, he celebrated his birthday at a lavish barbecue at the house of Ben Horowitz, the influential venture capitalist and business partner of Marc Andreessen. Two months later, he watched the election results at the home of Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services, along with Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, and Pharrell Williams.\u201cI think that\u2019s why a lot of athletes and entertainers work well with some of those guys, because for one, they all had humble beginnings,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cThey built something from the ground up, so they can relate to us.\u201dMinutes before he was ready to settle down for his 2 p.m. nap, Mr. Durant headed to the real sanctuary in his Oakland home, the recording studio.\u201cMan, why you all keep it so cold in here?\u201d he asked Raleigh Dunn, his recording engineer, while taking a seat in the corner. The lights turned low, Mr. Dunn prepared a sample of the Chi-Lites \u201cHave You Seen Her\u201d for Mr. Durant to lay rhymes over. While some might call Mr. Dunn a \u201cproducer,\u201d Mr. Durant has a different name for him: music therapist.\u201cI\u2019ve got so much stuff on my mind, quite honestly, it\u2019s kind of easy for me to say it all here,\u201d Mr. Durant said, looking almost monastic with his goateed face hidden in the hood of his sweatshirt. Music, he said, is \u201ca release. It keeps me in the moment. It takes my mind off this crazy world.\u201dBut at the moment, Mr. Durant would only say that latest rhymes were about \u201crelationship things, both with male friends, females, relationships that might have been broken on both sides.\u201dThat\u2019s the beauty of music. Once you put it down on tape, he said, all the nagging issues \u201care just out of my mind. I can move on to the next thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did Kuwait Copy Trump\u2019s Travel Ban? Not Quite", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany sites that often support Mr. Trump and also published the report, including Infowars.com and Russia\u2019s Sputnik news agency, have since clarified that it was outdated and unrelated to Mr. Trump\u2019s order.But by Tuesday night, his uncorrected posting had racked up more than 251,000 reactions, 68,000 shares and 15,000 comments, many by fans who see Kuwait\u2019s supposed decision to follow Mr. Trump as a vindication of the president\u2019s policy.\u201cSo you mean to tell me Muslims are banning Muslims from certain countries?\u201d a user wrote under the name Christina Villar. \u201cThen we have some Americans thinking our president is heartless. No, he is smart!\u201dThe White House did not respond on Tuesday night to a request for comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.The internet has long been home to countless sites of dubious credibility, and the Arab world is full of news sites bankrolled by private parties to promote their interests. Historically, their audiences have been limited.But in this case, false information, based on a mistake from a little-known news source, was trumpeted to a vast audience by an American president who is prone to exaggeration and falsehoods, whose immigration policy is under fire, and whose administration has promoted the term \u201calternative facts.\u201dThat exposure has shocked, and pleased, some who published the false information.The spreading of articles about the old Kuwait visa ban began last week, after Mr. Trump signed an executive order blocking citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.As chaos spread at airports and opponents mounted legal challenges to the order, an editor working the night shift at The New Arab, a news site based in London, came across a report that Kuwait had announced a visa ban of its own on citizens from five Muslim-majority states.By the time the error was spotted and the article updated, the first, erroneous version had already spread.\u201cMistakes happen and unfortunately we found ourselves in a situation where a serious mistake like this (for which the member of staff has been disciplined) went viral,\u201d the site\u2019s statement said.That article caught international attention, and a number of sites that often defend Mr. Trump\u2019s policies ran their own versions of it.By the time some of the sites that had published the erroneous information issued clarifications, noting the Kuwaiti denial, the articles on The New Arab and Albawaba topped the \u201cmost popular\u201d lists on their sites, even though the articles were six days old.Mr. Brownsell, of The New Arab, said his site\u2019s article had generated more traffic than most of its articles, although he declined to give numbers.\u201cIt is safe to say more than usual,\u201d he said.Albawaba issued a statement, also after an inquiry from The Times, saying its article had highlighted how hard it is for people from Syria and other countries to obtain visas to Kuwait, even if there is no official blanket ban.Ms. Dabbous, the editor at Albawaba, said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the article had served the site\u2019s goal of airing \u201csome of the truths about the Middle East that are narratives that you don\u2019t often see.\u201dShe was unconcerned that her site had kept the erroneous article shared by Mr. Trump up for six days.\u201cWith this one, we didn\u2019t consider it all that wrong because we just think it exposes other truths,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago to Facebook, a National Security Crisis in the Open", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe scene \u2014 of aides huddled over their computers and the president on his cellphone at his club\u2019s terrace \u2014 was captured by a club member dining not far away and published in pictures on his Facebook account. The images also show Mr. Trump conferring with his guest at the resort, Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister.Shortly before the club member, Richard DeAgazio, who joined Mr. Trump\u2019s club recently, took the pictures, North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile into the sea off its eastern coast. Mr. DeAgazio posted his photographs to Facebook as the two leaders and their staff members reviewed documents and worked on their laptops, using cellphones as flashlights.\u201cHOLY MOLY !!! It was fascinating to watch the flurry of activity at dinner when the news came that North Korea had launched a missile in the direction of Japan,\u201d Mr. DeAgazio wrote later on Facebook, describing how the two leaders \u201cconferred and then went into another room for hastily arranged press conference.\u201dThe fact that the national security incident played out in public view drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who said it was irresponsible for Mr. Trump not to have moved his discussion to a more private location.Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Tom Udall of New Mexico, Democrats who have called for Mr. Trump\u2019s club to release a list of its members, denounced the president on Monday for discussing the North Korean missile launch in the open.\u201cThis is America\u2019s foreign policy, not this week\u2019s episode of \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019\u201d the senators said in a statement. \u201cWe urge our Republican colleagues to start taking this administration\u2019s rash and unprofessional conduct seriously before there are consequences we all regret.\u201dRepublican senators also seemed puzzled by the president\u2019s actions. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said, \u201cUsually that\u2019s not a place where you do that kind of thing.\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, could barely find words. \u201cCan\u2019t make it up,\u201d he said.Michael J. Morell, a former acting C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama, said, \u201cEvery president with whom I have worked would have gone to a private room to have what was potentially a classified discussion.\u201dMr. Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. \u2014 known casually as the Winter White House \u2014 for a get-to-know-you weekend with Mr. Abe, including time with the prime minister on the golf course and dinners with their spouses.Around 8 p.m. on Saturday, the two leaders appeared for a brief photo-op together at the main entrance to the resort. Mr. Trump ignored a shouted question from a reporter about the North Korean missile test, which had occurred about an hour earlier.The president and his guests dined at the resort\u2019s restaurant during the next two hours, eventually providing the flurry of national security activity that Mr. DeAgazio captured.Around 10:30 p.m., Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe made short statements to a small group of reporters brought to a separate room in the resort.Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s press secretary, told reporters at the White House that Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe had not reviewed classified material on the resort\u2019s patio.Mr. Spicer said the president was briefed about North Korea in a secure location on the property. It is against the law for officials to be handling classified materials in a nonsecure setting.Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump and his aides were reviewing \u201cnews conference logistics\u201d about the North Korean missile test.But national security veterans of past administrations still expressed surprise that Mr. Trump and his staff would not have excused themselves to be able to have candid conversations about the North Korean situation and to review sensitive or classified documents.Discussions about how to respond to international incidents involving adversaries like North Korea are almost always conducted in places that have high-tech protections against eavesdropping, like the White House Situation Room.When presidents are away from the White House, they often conduct important business in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, a location that can be made temporarily impervious to eavesdropping.Such facilities can be installed permanently in places that the president visits frequently, like Mar-a-Lago. And a communications team travels with the president wherever he goes to ensure that he can communicate securely regardless of where he is.There are examples from the previous administration. In 2011, the White House released a photograph of Mr. Obama and members of his national security team sitting in a secure tent while on a trip to Brazil. Mr. Obama had begun attacks on Libya and was conferring about the military operation.Two years later, Mr. Obama held a dinner with President Xi Jinping of China at the Sunnylands resort in Rancho Mirage, Calif. But the dinner between the leaders was out of sight of members of the public, in a private dining room.Mr. Trump and White House aides who joined him and Mr. Abe for dinner on Saturday, including Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, did not relocate the discussion to a secure location.Mr. Trump appears to enjoy presenting the spectacle of his presidency to those at his privately held club, where members pay $200,000 to join.While the club is not open to the public, Mr. Trump\u2019s dinner with Mr. Abe was in the club\u2019s dining room, where members and their guests were likely to be.Individual club members can invite guests, submitting a list of names of table guests to security officials ahead of time. But none of that would give them clearance to see sensitive or classified material handled by the president or his aides.In addition to posting the pictures of the North Korea conversation, Mr. DeAgazio also published pictures of himself standing with a person he described as Mr. Trump\u2019s military aide responsible for carrying the nuclear \u201cfootball\u201d \u2014 the briefcase that contains codes for launching nuclear weapons.After news reports were published about Mr. DeAgazio\u2019s Facebook account, the account was deleted, along with the photographs.Representatives of the Mar-a-Lago resort did not respond to requests for comment about Mr. DeAgazio\u2019s use of social media to post photographs of the president.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bild Apologizes for False Article on Sexual Assaults in Frankfurt by Migrants", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its Feb. 6 report, Bild, the most widely read newspaper in Germany, quoted Jan Mai, the owner of a cafe in downtown Frankfurt, as saying that 50 \u201cArab-looking men\u201d had assaulted women on Dec. 31. It also quoted a woman it identified only as Irina A., 27, who said she had been among those who were groped \u201ceverywhere\u201d by the men.The Bild report from Frankfurt was picked up by other outlets and was widely shared on social media. More than a week later, after the Frankfurt police and other news organizations cast doubt on the allegations, Bild conceded that the attacks described in the article \u201cdid not take place,\u201d and it removed the article from its digital platforms.\u201cThe editorial staff of Bild emphatically apologizes for this untrue report and the allegations that it made against those concerned,\u201d the newspaper said in a note published online on Tuesday that cited the police findings and pledged an internal review. \u201cThis reporting in no way reflects the journalistic standards of Bild.\u201dBild has a daily circulation of 2.5 million and often sets the tone for political discussions in Germany, and the decision by prosecutors to open an investigation reflects broader concerns in the country about the spreading of false stories and anti-immigrant or anti-European propaganda.Chancellor Angela Merkel, under whose leadership Germany admitted 890,000 asylum seekers in 2015, is seeking a fourth term this year. Both she and her refugee policy have been the subjects of false news reports and base insults, which officials worry are aimed at whipping up fear and at shifting perceptions before the vote on Sept. 24.Other newspapers, including the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the left-leaning Taz, had swiftly published articles questioning the claims in the Russian report. But they were not accepted as false until the police discovered that the teenager had been with her boyfriend at the time of the alleged assault.The Frankfurt police initially disputed the Bild article on the New Year\u2019s Eve attack, saying that they had no reports of such events that night. On Tuesday, they said that an investigation of testimony by the owner of the cafe and by a woman who said she had been assaulted had failed to turn up any evidence.Mr. Mai could not be reached on Thursday. Both his personal Facebook page and that of his cafe appear to have been taken down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Small Firms Can Defuse a Political Threat and Blunt a Boycott", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipOne winter\u2019s day, Nicole Morgenthau received an email that jolted her. She owns Finch Knitting and Sewing Studio in Leesburg, Va., and the note threatened her beloved store with a potential boycott.An angry supporter of President Trump was compiling a list of businesses openly hostile to customers who voted for him. The question: Was Finch Knitting \u201can anti-election establishment?\u201d\u201cThe business is my baby,\u201d Ms. Morgenthau said. \u201cI was immediately worried about it being threatened.\u201dBut unlike corporations with crisis management firms at their behest, small-business owners have to rely on their own wits to respond and salvage sales and relationships.Ms. Morgenthau responded by email to the Trump supporter, hoping to build rapport. \u201cWe are not and never have been hostile to any human being,\u201d Ms. Morgenthau\u2019s letter began. It ended with these words: \u201cJust remember you belong here.\u201d\u201cThere needed to be some kind of public record,\u201d said Ms. Morgenthau, whose business logged $389,000 in sales last year. \u201cAnd I also felt that my local business community should know.\u201dA crisis was most likely averted by her conciliatory actions. Boycotters never appeared. Instead, supportive customers began flooding into her store, some coming from other states. Weekend sales began soaring more than 60 percent.In this era when emotions are running high and even basic business decisions can be perceived as politicized, business owners and marketers offer several examples on how to avoid or respond to boycotts and political issues. Here are some factors to keep in mind:Boycotts are an American tradition dating back to the Boston Tea Party. The term wasn\u2019t used until the 1880s, though, when an American journalist in Ireland popularized the name rather than \u201costracism,\u201d the prevailing word.\u201cThe term boycott spread like wildfire,\u201d said Lawrence B. Glickman, a Cornell University history professor. \u201cAnd within three months, it was being used in Salt Lake City.\u201dFrom then on, boycotts \u2014 ranging from the Jim Crow-era boycott of streetcars in the early 1900s to the mass civil rights demonstrations of the 1960s \u2014 have been an American staple. \u201cWe\u2019re in another moment like that again,\u201d Mr. Glickman said.Small businesses benefit from having some advantages. \u201cBuy local\u201d campaigns have gained steam in recent years, helping lift small-business sales and creating stronger communities.Even grass-roots boycott efforts, like the site and hashtag #GrabYourWallet, which has gone after Trump-related products, do not usually take aim at small businesses.Still, small-scale efforts to shun a local business can directly affect the bottom line. \u201cSmall businesses are living on the edge,\u201d said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cTwo months of bad sales can send them under. So the challenge is difficulty adapting.\u201dSome business owners, however, have been able to carefully balance their political beliefs with the demands of running and owning a business.Cherie Corso, owner of the e-commerce site G2organics.com, has been in business for seven years. Her company sells beauty products with fewer chemicals. Ms. Corso works with chemists to create her products and is adding new items like organic Himalayan soap to her site.For the most part, however, the decision has been a wash for her bottom line. Now, business mostly comes from red states like Texas and less from blue states like New York.\u201cWe\u2019re only going through life once,\u201d said Ms. Corso, a former model. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not afraid to put my political views on my website. For every customer, I\u2019ve lost, I\u2019ve gained one.\u201dSome online businesses have been fully prepared to court controversy, regardless of the effect on sales.He even appeared on CNN in 2015, after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy, to explain why he was opposed to him. These actions resulted in hundreds of angry phone calls for a few days, he said.Mr. Goldstone kept his word. And ScanMyPhotos has now scanned thousands of photos, he said, and won over some Trump supporters as paying customers.\u201cYou have to speak up and have a voice,\u201d said Mr. Goldstone, whose business employs 20 people. \u201cI\u2019m trying to demonstrate the value of integrity. And I need to keep my word.\u201dMr. Goldstone also benefits from a huge market. His company has digitized 300 million photos so far, he figures, but 3.5 trillion photos in the country are still in paper form.In general, though, experts advise small-business owners to avoid politics.

{"Headline": "E.P.A. Workers Try to Block Pruitt in Show of Defiance", "Date": "2017-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Employees of the Environmental Protection Agency have been calling their senators to urge them to vote on Friday against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, President Trump\u2019s contentious nominee to run the agency, a remarkable display of activism and defiance that presages turbulent times ahead for the E.P.A.Many of the scientists, environmental lawyers and policy experts who work in E.P.A. offices around the country say the calls are a last resort for workers who fear a nominee selected to run an agency he has made a career out of fighting \u2014 by a president who has vowed to \u201cget rid of\u201d it.\u201cMr. Pruitt\u2019s background speaks for itself, and it comes on top of what the president wants to do to E.P.A.,\u201d said John O\u2019Grady, a biochemist at the agency since the first Bush administration and president of the union representing the E.P.A.\u2019s 15,000 employees nationwide.Nicole Cantello, an E.P.A. lawyer who heads the union in the Chicago area, said: \u201cIt seems like Trump and Pruitt want a complete reversal of what E.P.A. has done. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any other agency that\u2019s been so reviled. So it\u2019s in our interests to do this.\u201dThe union has sent emails and posted Facebook and Twitter messages urging members to make the calls.\u201cIt is rare,\u201d said James A. Thurber, the director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other time when people in the bureaucracy have done this.\u201dThe campaign is not likely to succeed. Before Friday\u2019s vote, two Democratic senators, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, announced that they would vote for Mr. Pruitt\u2019s confirmation, and only one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, has said she will oppose him.But because Civil Service rules make it difficult to fire federal workers, the show of defiance indicates that Mr. Pruitt will face strong internal opposition to many of his promised efforts to curtail E.P.A. activities and influence.\u201cWhat it means is that it\u2019s going to be a blood bath when Pruitt gets in there,\u201d said Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican former governor of New Jersey and the E.P.A. administrator during the first term of President George W. Bush.Ms. Whitman predicted a standoff between career employees and their politically appointed bosses, noting that Mr. Pruitt would be blocked by legal Civil Service protections from immediately firing longtime employees, but would probably be able to retaliate in other ways, such as shifting them to different jobs.The showdown could embolden the White House and Congress to change federal Civil Service laws.\u201cThe Civil Service is supposed to be a class of experts implementing policy, regardless of politics,\u201d said Myron Ebell, a fellow at the free-market Competitive Enterprise Institute, who led Mr. Trump\u2019s environmental transition team. \u201cIf they have now become a special interest group pleading their own agenda, then it is probably time to look at reforming the Civil Service laws.\u201dThe revolt has also angered supporters of Mr. Pruitt.\u201cThere clearly has been an organized effort to demonize Pruitt, and I think that\u2019s unfair and unfortunate,\u201d said Jeffrey Holmstead, a senior E.P.A. official in the George W. Bush administration who has been mentioned as a possible deputy to Mr. Pruitt. \u201cI don\u2019t remember, in my time, anything like this. But I think that anyone Trump nominated would be targeted.\u201d\u201cWe know that he\u2019ll dismantle Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule, but he\u2019s not going to go in there and start firing people,\u201d said Mr. Holmstead, referring to Obama regulations on climate change and water pollution.Mr. Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, has sued the E.P.A. at least 14 times, often in concert with the nation\u2019s largest fossil fuel companies, to block major environmental regulations. He has questioned human-caused global warming and is a key architect of the national legal effort to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change policies.Donald Trump and his cabinet have sent mixed signals on some big environmental decisions they face. Take this quiz and see where the different possible choices lead.He has harshly criticized the role of the federal agency, saying much of its authority should be dissolved and left to the states. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s legal views on environmental protection broadly, and the role of the E.P.A. specifically, appear to line up with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign claim that \u201cEnvironmental Protection, what they do is a disgrace.\u201dWithin days of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s swearing-in, Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, and possibly to begin dismantling some E.P.A. offices and programs, people familiar with the White House\u2019s plans said.While it will be impossible to undo most major rules or programs that quickly, the presidential signatures would authorize Mr. Pruitt to cut existing environmental regulations \u2014 and, eventually, the jobs of many of the people who enforce them.Ms. Cantello said most of her career at the E.P.A. had been focused on water protection, particularly on cleaning pollution in the Great Lakes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid all the work I\u2019ve done will be abandoned,\u201d she said.Ms. Cantello and other longtime agency employees said that while they sometimes chafed under the administration of George W. Bush, who sought to loosen some environmental rules, they did not openly rebel against it \u2014 nor, they said, did they fear that Mr. Bush and his appointees wanted to eliminate the agency.\u201cI\u2019ve been here for 30 years, and I\u2019ve never called my senator about a nominee before,\u201d said an E.P.A. employee in North Carolina who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of losing her job.The calls to senators come on top of an anti-Pruitt protest last week by Chicago E.P.A. employees, and agency workers say that if Mr. Pruitt is confirmed, they intend to amplify their resistance to him, taking their case to the American public.\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s just, \u2018call your senator,\u2019\u201d Mr. O\u2019Grady, the union president, said. \u201cWe plan on more demonstrations, more rallies. I think you will see the employees\u2019 union reaching out to N.G.O.s and having alliances with them,\u201d he added, referring to nongovernmental organizations. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at working with P.R. firms.\u201dThe White House and E.P.A. did not respond to emailed questions about the employees\u2019 campaign.The E.P.A. emerged as a Republican political target during the Obama administration, after Mr. Obama turned to the agency to muscle through an environmental agenda that could not get through Congress.While Mr. Trump campaigned on slashing Obama-era rules on climate change and waterways, his efforts might also be thwarted by Congress. But the E.P.A. is likely to be at the center of his antiregulatory agenda.Experts say it is not surprising that liberal and environmental groups like the Sierra Club have campaigned against Mr. Pruitt. Over 700 former E.P.A. employees have signed a letter to senators opposing his confirmation.But former E.P.A. officials said the open rebellion by current employees was extraordinary, especially considering that their resistance could backfire once Mr. Pruitt arrives on the job.\u201cE.P.A. staff are pretty careful. They\u2019re risk-averse,\u201d said Judith Enck, who left the agency last month. \u201cIf people are saying and doing things like this, it\u2019s because they\u2019re really concerned.\u201dSenator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said on Wednesday that his office had received dozens of calls from people both opposing and supporting Mr. Pruitt\u2019s nomination, including E.P.A. employees, and that he had not yet decided whether to vote for him. \u201cI do have concerns about the Great Lakes,\u201d he said.Mr. O\u2019Grady said that he expected the calls to continue through Friday\u2019s vote. \u201cI pray they don\u2019t dismantle the E.P.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like Humpty Dumpty \u2014 very difficult to put back together again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Texts From a \u2018Hell Prison\u2019 in the Pacific Led to a Powerful Video Diary", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScanning through months of WhatsApp texts from Behrouz Boochani reminds me of just how much uncertainty he has seen in the last three years.\u201cI can say that the Australian government took me like a hostage to Manus Island.\u201d\u201cThey did not tell me how many years I would have to stay in this hell prison.\u201d\u201cThis place is much worse than a normal prison because we don\u2019t know anything about our future.\u201dSo began our conversations in August 2016, when I first connected with the 33-year-old Kurdish journalist. He is just one of hundreds of refugees and migrants attempting to make their way to Australia by boat who have been held in offshore detention centers by that country\u2019s government. He has been on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea since 2013.His detailed notes proved vital to many journalists, like myself, trying to understand the reality of life on these islands. He shared updates of detainees with health concerns, wrote about the mental anguish of indefinite detention, and shared photos and videos of Manus.Soon after, I got his phone number and reached out on the WhatsApp messenger.Through these text and audio memos, I learned his back story. Mr. Boochani had worked as a freelance journalist for several Iranian publications before founding a weekly magazine, Werya, that focused on preserving Kurdish culture.When his offices in Ilam, Iran, were raided and several colleagues were arrested, Mr. Boochani felt he had to leave or risk imprisonment himself. But making his way to Australia, where he had planned to seek asylum, was not as easy as he had hoped.He traveled first to Indonesia, where he paid smugglers to take him by boat to Australia. The first attempt nearly cost him his life when the boat sank. He was detained by Indonesian police, but weeks later made his second attempt to reach Australia.\u201cThey don\u2019t care that I didn\u2019t know anything about the 19 July law before I left Indonesia,\u201d Mr. Boochani wrote in one of the earliest messages we exchanged. \u201cNot knowing is a big torture, and really we still don\u2019t know how many more years we will be imprisoned here.\u201dMy colleague in the video department, Yara Bishara, and I got to work planning an interactive piece on the diverging fates of the people held at these offshore detention sites. That is when Mr. Boochani first started sending me video diaries detailing the process as he waited to see what would come. Every few days I would send him a series of questions over WhatsApp, and he would respond. We had intended for these to be part of a larger narrative, but realized that Mr. Boochani\u2019s account spoke for itself.Limited internet connectivity in the detention center often meant that he would record a handful of videos at one time, then travel to the nearby town of Lorengau to connect to the internet and send them.But he is a journalist, even in this detention, and he was determined to tell the story of those on the island. He made it work.He sent over clips of swallows flying over the fence of the Manus detention center, scenes of the cramped living quarters and detailed accounts of his experience waiting for news about resettlement in the U.S.As the weeks went on and America geared up for the inauguration of President Trump, Mr. Boochani\u2019s video diaries took on a more uncertain tone. He knew this president had very different priorities, and the stress of waiting for answers about his future was visible on his face. Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration came and went, and still no news.I knew this was the right time to tell Mr. Boochani\u2019s story, and to offer a look at one of the hundreds of people living in limbo who would be affected by a possible policy change. I reached out to him again on WhatsApp. His reply was swift.\u201cManus prison did not expect the new president to accept this deal,\u201d Mr. Boochani wrote, clearly distraught at the prospect that he could remain on the island. \u201cThe Australian government continues to play multiple political games with refugees that have caused suffering for our souls and minds again and again during the past four years.\u201dHe also sent a video from the detention center in which he described the uncertainty he felt that night.\u201cWe are so worried,\u201d he said as he looked straight into the camera, his tired eyes speaking volumes.Yara and I scrambled to pull together the video diaries we had been collecting since November. We decided, with guidance from colleagues on the International desk, that Mr. Boochani\u2019s story was strong enough to stand on its own, in the larger context of the Trump administration\u2019s plans.Yara got to work editing the diaries into a cohesive package, intercutting scenes that Mr. Boochani had shot for us inside the detention center.At the same time, we had to stay up to speed on the Trump administration\u2019s ever-evolving statements on the agreement. By the time his tweet referencing the \u201cdumb deal\u201d was posted on Wednesday morning, we were nearly done with our piece, and had to swiftly re-edit.By that afternoon, we had the video ready for the Times home page, offering our readers a side of the story they were not able to see anywhere else.Mr. Boochani\u2019s story does not end here. He is still in detention, still stuck in limbo on this remote island like so many others. But he will continue to document how the situation unfolds, and we will continue to tell the story of these detainees.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Flood Risk Near Oroville Dam Causes Thousands to Evacuate in California", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe authorities in Northern California raced to evacuate tens of thousands of people on Sunday night in fear of the possible failure of an emergency spillway at the Oroville Dam.Despite concerns of an imminent breakdown earlier in the night, officials said late Sunday that the water level at the Lake Oroville reservoir had dropped, halting water flow over the emergency spillway and temporarily stabilizing the situation.Still, officials were concerned about the integrity of the emergency spillway, and more than 180,000 people were ordered to evacuate.Gov. Jerry Brown warned late Sunday that the situation was \u201ccomplex and rapidly changing\u201d and directed the deployment of state resources to the area to deal with \u201cthis very serious situation.\u201dSheriff Kory Honea of Butte County said at an evening news conference that although the situation appeared to be improving, he urged residents to continue evacuating the area in and around Oroville, about 70 miles north of Sacramento.\u201cThe erosion that caused all of this concern was not advancing as rapidly as they thought \u2014 that\u2019s a very good thing,\u201d he said, citing assessments from the California Department of Water Resources.Repeated rounds of rain have pounded the area in recent weeks, rapidly raising the water level at Lake Oroville, the second-largest reservoir in California and a linchpin of the state\u2019s water system. On Tuesday, a gaping hole opened in the main spillway that is used to release extra water. Early Saturday, an adjacent emergency spillway was also put into use, the first time water flowed over it since the dam was finished in 1968, department officials said.State officials have said the 770-foot Oroville Dam itself, the nation\u2019s tallest, is sound.Officials described the situation as having stabilized on Sunday morning, but conditions quickly worsened, prompting the evacuation orders throughout the afternoon. Roads in the area quickly backed up as a result, according to reports.\u201cThat has helped reduce the level of the lake rather quickly,\u201d Sheriff Honea said. \u201cIt is hopefully going to reduce the pressure on that alternative-slash-emergency spillway and stabilize the situation.\u201dThe department also said that it was flying in rocks to fill a gouge in the spillway.\u201cWe continue to believe that the dam is not threatened. Its integrity is intact,\u201d said Doug Carlson, a department spokesman.The lake\u2019s water level had risen sharply as a result of a \u201ctremendous amount of rainfall,\u201d he said. Adding, \u201cWe are at about 225 percent of normal rainfall in Northern California since Oct. 1.\u201dGerry Mullany contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

Several activists said that they did not know how the campaign began or how many people would heed it, and that as far as they knew, there was no national organization behind it.His daughter, Laela Shallal, who manages finance and marketing for the company, said employees could choose between using some of their paid leave on Thursday, or going to work to clean or organize the restaurants and offices.\u201cWe think that this is really something that a lot of our staff feels really passionate about,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking their side, so that they feel the company they work for is living up to their values.\u201dAmaya Sales, a kitchen manager at the Busboys and Poets restaurant in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington, said workers first approached management early this week about taking part. \u201cIt\u2019s just to, like, show most of America how much important we are to do the hard work in the United States,\u201d Mr. Sales said.In a city with more than 2,000 restaurants, the day of closures and absences may not be enough to prevent anyone from getting a table. But given the upscale, popular businesses involved, it will be noticed.An immigrant advocacy group, Cosecha (the Spanish word for harvest), has been planning a day without immigrants on May 1. Maria Fernanda Cabello, a Cosecha organizer, said it was not behind Thursday\u2019s campaign, but viewed it as something of a dry run, and was working with some local groups that were promoting it.\u201cWe don\u2019t know where this started, and as far as we know, there isn\u2019t anyone putting it all together,\u201d Ms. Cabello said. \u201cWe started seeing messages about it in different cities a few weeks ago, and it\u2019s really picked up in the last couple of days.\u201dOwners of some smaller businesses said that they supported the idea but that the campaign was too hastily organized to justify closing. Josh Phillips, a co-owner of Espita Mezcaleria in Washington, said that rather than close, he wanted to donate a portion of his restaurant\u2019s proceeds on Thursday to the organizers of the campaign. But, he said, \u201cwe still don\u2019t know who\u2019s organizing it.\u201dEach dinner receipt, Mr. Phillips said, will be inscribed with the phrase, \u201cThis meal was made possible by immigrants.\u201dIvan Iricanin, who owns Ambar, a Balkan restaurant with locations in Washington and Arlington, Va., said that after meeting with his staff on Monday, he decided to keep the restaurants open. But, he said, about seven of his 100 employees chose not to work on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a lot of questions that were unanswered,\u201d Mr. Iricanin, 39, said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I think that some people are all for it and some are in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Make sense to you?I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that this is as close as we\u2019ve come to seeing Mark give some sort of political statement in a rather charged environment. Even his company\u2019s mission \u2014 to connect the world \u2014 is now a polarizing idea.One could argue that deep currents of isolationism have run throughout nations over the history of mankind. And as many Trump supporters would argue, there are reasons for borders, even far before the internet ever existed.I think a lot of this depends on whether you buy into the idea that Facebook can ultimately be a uniting force for good in the world, or whether you think it will end up further polarizing us.So if you\u2019re over the age of 18, you may not actually know who PewDiePie is. In a nutshell: He is Felix Kjellberg, one of the world\u2019s most popular video game live-streamers on the internet. He\u2019s amassed an enormous following on YouTube, where he essentially films himself playing video games and talking to the camera. I\u2019ve watched him before \u2014 for the entire length of him beating a video game \u2014 and it\u2019s actually captivating and somewhat intimate, like he\u2019s having an extended discussion with you. He\u2019s made millions of dollars doing it, too.Kjellberg maintains they were off-color jokes that went too far. But that didn\u2019t stop Disney and YouTube from severing ties with the guy, cutting short his multimillion-dollar contracts.So I\u2019m curious. What do you think this episode says about online gamer culture? A ton of folks are coming to Kjellberg\u2019s aid after this whole thing, saying that The Journal has blown the whole thing out of proportion. Do you buy that?The bigger question for me is how the big sponsors of these stars of tomorrow \u2014 companies like Google and Disney \u2014 change how they vet people like PewDiePie. Tomorrow\u2019s celebrities are going to come from the internet culture. To older folks running these media companies, internet celebs are going to look and sound totally off the wall, but the execs are going to feel pressure to sign them based on their huge popularity. It seems clear no one at Disney was actually paying attention to PewDiePie \u2014 the Nazi stuff was out there for everyone to see, and Disney responded only once The Journal came calling. So perhaps that will be the first fix here: actually paying attention to the internet celebs you\u2019ve paid so handsomely.Anyway, that\u2019s enough from me. I\u2019m going to start my own streaming channel starring my dog.Advertisement"}

Turso, said, \u201cSometimes people see snow and think we haven\u2019t plowed.\u201dTo prevent damage to sewer covers and the street, the snowplows often don\u2019t clean down to the blacktop.\u201cWe leave that up to the salt, and cooperation from Mother Nature,\u201d Mr. Turso said.We\u2019d like to know: How clean are your streets this morning? Tell us in the comments.Here\u2019s what else is happening:For one New Yorker, that was cause to celebrate.\u201cI\u2019m thrilled,\u201d Lindley Hanlon, a professor of film studies at Brooklyn College, said when she heard the news.Earlier this week, Ms. Hanlon was leaving Kennedy International Airport dressed as the Statue of Liberty when our photographer caught up with her.After hearing about the travel ban, Ms. Hanlon bought a set of curtains, stitched together the costume in her Greenwich Village apartment, and went to the airport.\u201cI wanted to continue the legacy of the Statue of Liberty as a figure of welcome and embrace and freedom to arrive and depart,\u201d she said.She is returning to the airport this morning, she added.This time, \u201cto welcome people and celebrate.\u201dSaturday Sunday \u201cMost of the knowledge of the world is not online,\u201d Mr. Knipel told us. \u201cIt\u2019s in books and in museums written by experts and curators.\u201dHis job: To digitize the museum\u2019s holdings, share them and encourage the Wiki community to use the images in creative ways.His motto: \u201cTo Wikify the Met, and Metify the Wiki.\u201d\u201cWikipedia does not have an article on the Chiriqu\u00ed, the historical culture that created it,\u201d he said.But he\u2019s not always so involved.\u201cPeople are more interested in writing an article about an artwork when they can see it,\u201d he said.Sean Piccoli contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Ignored Trump News for a Week. Here\u2019s What I Learned.", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didn\u2019t read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president.It wasn\u2019t my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours), but shifted most of my energy to looking for Trump-free zones.My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no Trump-free part of the press.But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosystem. Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever. The reasons have as much to do with him as the way social media amplifies every big story until it swallows the world. And as important as covering the president may be, I began to wonder if we were overdosing on Trump news, to the exclusion of everything else.The new president doesn\u2019t simply dominate national and political news. During my week of attempted Trump abstinence, I noticed something deeper: He has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind, political or not. He is no longer just the message. In many cases, he has become the medium, the ether through which all other stories flow.Obviously, just about every corner of the news was a minefield, but it was my intention to keep informed while avoiding Mr. Trump. I still consulted major news sites, but avoided sections that tend to be Trump-soaked, and averted my eyes as I scrolled for non-Trump news. I spent more time on international news sites like the BBC, and searched for subject-specific sites covering topics like science and finance. I consulted social news sites like Digg and Reddit, and occasionally checked Twitter and Facebook, but I often had to furiously scroll past all of the Trump posts. (Some news was unavoidable; when Mr. Flynn resigned, a journalist friend texted me about it.)Even when I found non-Trump news, though, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a fruit-and-nut cake without getting any fruit or nuts.Where else could I go? Snapchat and Instagram were relatively safe, but the president still popped up. Even Amazon.com suggested I consider Trump toilet paper for my wife\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day present. (I bought her jewelry.)All presidents are omnipresent. But it is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now. It\u2019s possible that not even the most famous or infamous people of the recent or distant past \u2014 say, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali or Adolf Hitler \u2014 dominated media as thoroughly at their peak as Mr. Trump does now.I\u2019m hedging because there isn\u2019t data to directly verify this declaration. (Of course, there are no media analytics to measure how many outlets were covering Hitler the day he invaded Poland.) But there is some pretty good circumstantial evidence.Consider data from mediaQuant, a firm that measures \u201cearned media,\u201d which is all coverage that isn\u2019t paid advertising. To calculate a dollar value of earned media, it first counts every mention of a particular brand or personality in just about any outlet, from blogs to Twitter to the evening news to The New York Times. Then it estimates how much the mentions would cost if someone were to pay for them as advertising.In January, Mr. Trump broke mediaQuant\u2019s records. In a single month, he received $817 million in coverage, higher than any single person has ever received in the four years that mediaQuant has been analyzing the media, according to Paul Senatori, the company\u2019s chief analytics officer. For much of the past four years, Mr. Obama\u2019s monthly earned media value hovered around $200 million to $500 million. The highest that Hillary Clinton got during the presidential campaign was $430 million, in July.It\u2019s not just that Mr. Trump\u2019s coverage beats anyone else\u2019s. He is now beating pretty much everyone else put together. Mr. Senatori recently added up the coverage value of 1,000 of the world\u2019s best known figures, excluding Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. The list includes Mrs. Clinton, who in January got $200 million in coverage, Tom Brady ($38 million), Kim Kardashian ($36 million), and Vladimir V. Putin ($30 million), all the way down to the 1,000th most-mentioned celebrity in mediaQuant\u2019s database, the actress Madeleine Stowe ($1,001).The coverage those 1,000 people garnered last month totaled $721 million. In other words, Mr. Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1,000 famous people put together. And he is on track to match or beat his January record in February, according to Mr. Senatori\u2019s preliminary figures.\u201cFrom a media perspective, it\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d Mr. Senatori said. \u201cThe sheer volume, and the sheer amount of consumption, and all the new channels that are available today show that, yeah, he\u2019s off the charts.\u201dMr. Trump is a historically unusual president, and thus deserves plenty of coverage. Yet there\u2019s an argument that our tech-fueled modern media ecosystem is amplifying his presence even beyond what\u2019s called for.There\u2019s a reason you aren\u2019t seeing these stories splashed across the news. Unlike old-school media, today\u2019s media works according to social feedback loops. Every story that shows any signs of life on Facebook or Twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet, becoming unavoidable.Mr. Watts and his colleagues found that adding social signals changed the music people were interested in. Inequality went up: When people could see what others were downloading, popular songs became far more popular, and unpopular songs far less popular. Social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes; when people could see how others had picked songs, the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success, and bad songs were more likely to become popular.I suspect we are seeing something like this effect playing out with Trump news. It\u2019s not that coverage of the new administration is unimportant. It clearly is. But social signals \u2014 likes, retweets and more \u2014 are amplifying it.It\u2019s only been a month since Mr. Trump took office, and already the deluge of news has been overwhelming. Everyone \u2014 reporters, producers, anchors, protesters, people in the administration and consumers of news \u2014 has been amped up to 11.For now, this might be all right. It\u2019s important to pay attention to the federal government when big things are happening.But Mr. Trump is likely to be president for at least the next four years. And it\u2019s probably not a good idea for just about all of our news to be focused on a single subject for that long.In previous media eras, the news was able to find a sensible balance even when huge events were preoccupying the world. Newspapers from World War I and II were filled with stories far afield from the war. Today\u2019s newspapers are also full of non-Trump articles, but many of us aren\u2019t reading newspapers anymore. We\u2019re reading Facebook and watching cable, and there, Mr. Trump is all anyone talks about, to the exclusion of almost all else.There\u2019s no easy way out of this fix. But as big as Mr. Trump is, he\u2019s not everything \u2014 and it\u2019d be nice to find a way for the media ecosystem to recognize that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Liberal Activists Join Forces Against a Common Foe: Trump", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Justin Boyan worried about the effects of climate change but focused on his wife, his two daughters and his work as a computer scientist in Rhode Island. Then Donald J. Trump became president, and Mr. Boyan was jolted into political activism.Within days of the election, Mr. Boyan began volunteering for the Working Families Party, a liberal political organization focused on income inequality, and attended almost weekly protests to voice his dismay. He traveled to the Women\u2019s March on Washington with his family the day after inauguration, protested Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban at the Rhode Island state capital, and began studying criminal justice issues, which he connects to climate change as two issues where policy makers, he believes, have put the demands of big-money contributors over the needs of ordinary people.The same energy motivating Mr. Boyan is bursting out at demonstrations and town hall meetings across the country. Protesters who had focused on issues like police shootings of black people, a $15 minimum wage and climate change are collaborating against a common foe, President Trump. In cities and states, activists are exchanging civil disobedience tactics, pooling financial resources and showing up to demonstrations about issues that they may not have previously focused on.Call it Protest Nation: Activists across the country have been strengthening old partnerships and making new ones.In New York, organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington last month made sure to address a broad range of issues, including abortion rights and access to contraception, racism, immigration laws and demands for pay parity between men and women. In Charlotte, N.C., on the weekend that the travel ban went into effect, African-American activists accustomed to blasting out information about police shootings sent a mass text message asking people to gather at an airport to support travelers from Muslim-majority countries.In Chicago, a group focused on racial discrimination has teamed up with one focused on Latinos to push a new initiative aimed at expanding both the number and the definition of sanctuary cities to protect undocumented immigrants and curb police brutality.\u201cI was on the phone arranging a car pool to violin practice and I said: \u2018All right, I\u2019ll be there in 20 minutes. Bye.\u2019 And the mom said, \u2018Resist,\u2019\u201d Mr. Boyan, 46, marveled about a recent conversation. \u201cWhen people say goodbye to each other, they are saying, \u2018Resist.\u2019\u201dFor opponents of Mr. Trump, there is a risk protesting a president who revels in opposition, mocks demonstrators and says he speaks for a silent majority, said Micah White, 34, of Nehalem, Ore., who helped start Occupy Wall Street in 2011. That movement prompted thousands to camp in public parks, protest the excesses of \u201cthe 1 percent\u201d \u2014 and eventually disperse with little to show for the efforts.\u201cDonald Trump is a master of stagecraft, and he\u2019s obsessed with ratings,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cSo large-scale protests, they are just part of the spectacle game. They draw more attention to him. They help him feel like he is the center of the universe. And until there is a social protest movement that is ready and willing to take power and govern, then protests will always be ineffective.\u201dActivists opposing Mr. Trump still see strength in mass action, and they have begun broadening their reach.Since she helped organize the Women\u2019s March on Washington, which drew hundreds of thousands of people, Tamika D. Mallory, a gun control advocate and one of the march\u2019s four co-chairwomen, has protested against the travel ban, spoken out against Attorney General Jeff Sessions and worked on organizing follow-up events to keep people involved after the march. She said that while she was still focused on racism and the lives of black people, she also understood that Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid-fire pace meant people must work together and learn about issues outside their main concerns.\u201cThis is the moment for us to show up for one another and to show up as concerned Americans versus being sort of stuck in our silos,\u201d Ms. Mallory, 36, said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before a different community is under attack.\u201d\u201cThe playbook has changed,\u201d she added.Two weeks ago, when thousands of people protested the travel ban at airports across the country, Nelini Stamp, national membership director of the Working Families Party, said she could sense the coalescing of a national protest movement. Messages to gather at Kennedy International Airport in New York came through texts, emails and Facebook posts across a spectrum of interest areas. Ms. Stamp, who several years ago got involved in organizing through Occupy Wall Street, said that by the time she got to the airport it felt like a family reunion.\u201cI saw folks that I worked with on labor issues, folks that I had worked with on the street, folks I\u2019ve been arrested with doing civil disobedience,\u201d she said. \u201cA community of folks just merged, and it felt like magnets drawing to each other.\u201d\u201cAs organizers we already understand the value of relationships, and as organizers we also understand the urgency of this particular moment,\u201d said Charlene Carruthers, 31, national director of Black Youth Project 100.Tania A. Unzueta, 33, policy and legal director of Mijente, said she saw the collaboration as crucial for undocumented immigrants like herself and to minority communities where discrimination can have deadly consequences.\u201cWe really do think our survival depends on being able to find collective strength,\u201d said Ms. Unzueta, who came to the United States from Mexico at 10. \u201cThey are attacking our communities in different ways, and I think there are ways that our communities may be pitted against each other.\u201dLast month, Jimmy Dahman, 25, and about 100 volunteers from across the country started a push called Town Hall Project 2018. Through a publicly accessible Google spreadsheet, the group is listing dozens of town-hall-style meetings being held by members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Dahman, who worked as an organizer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, said he wanted to make it easier for people to have face-to-face interactions with elected officials.\u201cWe have volunteers who are particularly upset about the prospect of climate change regulations being rolled back,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are folks who are very nervous that they or someone they know and love may lose their health care. There are folks who are upset about the Muslim ban and some of the travel bans that the administration has put in place. They are all fired up for different reasons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bathroom Case Puts Transgender Student on National Stage", "Date": "2017-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The bespectacled teenager in the gray A.C.L.U. hoodie and cargo pants stood, back pressed against a chain-link fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, under a sign saying \u201cNo Trespassing, Authorized Personnel Only.\u201d The White House, illuminated at night, cast a glow over well-wishers who, having just wrapped up a protest against President Trump, waited in line to pay homage to 17-year-old Gavin Grimm.Mr. Grimm looked a little flustered. \u201cAbsolutely humbled,\u201d he pronounced himself, as his admirers thanked him for being brave.Mr. Trump has portrayed the issue as one of states\u2019 rights, and already the country\u2019s transgender students face differing realities depending on their school. Some are restricted to the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. Others are not. Then there are the students like Mr. Grimm, who have had separate facilities set aside for them.At issue in Mr. Grimm\u2019s case is whether Title IX, a provision in a 1972 law that bans discrimination \u201con the basis of sex\u201d in schools that receive federal money, also bans discrimination based on gender identity. President Barack Obama concluded that it did. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s action, lawyers for both Mr. Grimm and the school board said Thursday that they expected the case to go forward, with oral arguments set for March 28 and school officials across the country awaiting the result.For Mr. Grimm, who said he knew he was a boy \u201cas soon as I was aware of the difference between boys and girls,\u201d the case amounts to a crash course in government and media relations. It bears his initials, G.G., because he is a minor, and the name of his mother, Deirdre.At home in rural Gloucester, he is a kid with a pet pig named Esmeralda, a geek\u2019s love of Pok\u00e9mon cards and 600-plus Facebook friends. He wears $12 sneakers from Walmart and likes eating at Fuddruckers because the name sounds funny. He is applying for college, but doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.At the protest here Wednesday night, he was the star speaker, besieged with teary hugs and cellphone selfies. The mother of a transgender child burst into tears when she saw him. A government lawyer shook his hand. Activists posed for pictures.Mr. Grimm looked awe-struck at the thought. \u201cI just hope I do it justice,\u201d he said quietly.When Mr. Grimm was about 12 or 13, he said, he was able to put a name to what he was feeling and recognized himself as transgender. He came out first to his friends, which was easier than telling his parents.For the family, it was a jolt, his mother said. It made her question preachers \u2014 she eventually left her church \u2014 but strengthened her faith.\u201cGod gave me this child to open my heart and my mind,\u201d Mrs. Grimm, a nurse, said.In 2014, when Mr. Grimm was 15 and starting his sophomore year, the family told his school he was transgender. Administrators were supportive at first and allowed him to use the boys\u2019 bathroom.But amid an uproar from some parents and students, and after two tense school board meetings, the board barred Mr. Grimm from using the boys\u2019 bathrooms and instead adopted a policy requiring transgender youth to use separate \u201csingle user\u201d restrooms. The school now has three such restrooms, but two are in refurbished utility closets, said Mr. Block, the A.C.L.U. lawyer.Kyle Duncan, a lawyer for the school board, said the board \u201cagonized\u201d as it sought a thoughtful way to accommodate Mr. Grimm while protecting students who felt uncomfortable. \u201cThis is a sensitive and difficult issue in which everyone\u2019s privacy rights need to be respected,\u201d he said.But Mr. Block said that Mr. Grimm had been singled out for \u201cclassic sex discrimination.\u201dMrs. Grimm was more pointed: \u201cThis school board has targeted my child.\u201dHer son did not always have such aplomb. Before he began \u201cliving authentically,\u201d his mother said, he was introverted, often retreating to his room. She winces at the times she tried to curl his hair and make him wear dresses.Mr. Grimm is, by all accounts, the perfect plaintiff, poised beyond his years. He knows how to deflect unwanted lines of questioning (he will not talk about his twin brother, friends or teachers) and is unfailingly polite in replying to intimate queries about his bathroom habits (\u201cIf I have to go, I go to the nurse\u2019s restroom,\u201d he told a local television reporter on Wednesday night) and his emotions (\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating, it\u2019s embarrassing, it\u2019s very uncomfortable. I have this neon sign above my head that says I\u2019m different from my peers\u201d).But at heart, he is still a kid. Once, while touring the National Archives here, Mr. Grimm excitedly played Pok\u00e9mon Go in front of the Declaration of Independence, as Bill Farrar, a spokesman for the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Virginia affiliate, patiently tried to remind him that he was probably \u201cthe only person here who has a legal proceeding before the Supreme Court.\u201dThe two have bonded over hours of travel, including a dash from Gloucester to Washington on Wednesday. Mr. Grimm stuffed his belongings in a white trash bag, sticking in a dress shirt at the last minute, which proved handy for \u201cThe View.\u201dAnd with just eight justices on the court \u2014 confirmation hearings for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for the ninth seat, are scheduled to begin March 20 \u2014 the justices might be inclined to wait.But Vanita Gupta, who ran the Civil Rights Division in Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department and helped write the directive that Mr. Trump rescinded, said the Grimm case had already advanced the cause of transgender rights, just by raising awareness.\u201cThere has been such social and cultural change in the hearts and minds of people in this country,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s only going to grow, even if there is a legal setback.\u201dWhatever happens, Mr. Grimm appears destined for a life of advocacy. He says he feels a heavy burden standing up for other transgender people, knowing that everyone is different. He worries that other young people will not have the support that he has had.While he is not much on school (he is taking only the two courses he needs to graduate), he would like to be a geneticist. He wants to know how the brain works.But asking him about his career plans brings a Gavin-like answer \u2014 wry and pointed.\u201cI want to be,\u201d he said, \u201csomeone who doesn\u2019t have to talk about where he is going to use the bathroom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Sense of Dread\u2019 for Civil Servants Shaken by Trump Transition", "Date": "2017-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Across the vast federal bureaucracy, Donald J. Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House has spread anxiety, frustration, fear and resistance among many of the two million nonpolitical civil servants who say they work for the public, not a particular president.At the Environmental Protection Agency, a group of scientists strategized this past week about how to slow-walk President Trump\u2019s environmental orders without being fired.At the Treasury Department, civil servants are quietly gathering information about whistle-blower protections as they polish their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.At the United States Digital Service \u2014 the youthful cadre of employees who left jobs at Google, Facebook or Microsoft to join the Obama administration \u2014 workers are debating how to stop Mr. Trump should he want to use the databases they made more efficient to target specific immigrant groups.The New York Times would like to hear from President Trump\u2019s supporters: What do you think about his policies so far?\u201cIt\u2019s almost a sense of dread, as in, what will happen to us,\u201d said Gabrielle Martin, a trial lawyer and 30-year veteran at the Denver office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where colleagues now share daily, grim predictions about the fate of their jobs under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201cIt\u2019s like the movie music when the shark is coming,\u201d Ms. Martin said, referring to \u201cJaws,\u201d the 1975 thriller. \u201cPeople are just wary \u2014 is the shark going to come up out of the water?\u201dThis article is based on interviews around the country with more than three dozen current and recently departed federal employees from the Internal Revenue Service; the Pentagon; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Justice and Treasury Departments; the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development; and other parts of the government. They reveal a federal work force that is more fundamentally shaken than usual by the uncertainties that follow a presidential transition from one party to the other.Federal workers are more likely to be Democrats, according to surveys. But partisanship and ideology explain only some of the intense feelings among workers, many of whom have seen Democrats and Republicans in the White House come and go.At bars after work, in employee break rooms, on conference calls and on social media networks, employees at agencies targeted for steep reductions fear for their jobs. They worry about Mr. Trump\u2019s freeze on hiring and regulations, his pledge to reverse environmental protections, and his executive order shutting down immigration for refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.Some federal workers welcome Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to create new jobs, build infrastructure and lower taxes. Others say they are focusing on doing their jobs and trying not to be distracted by the political noise that surrounds them. Still others say they are struggling with the question of whether they want to work for a president with whom they so strongly disagree.\u201cWhat do you do,\u201d asked Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, if you work at a place where the leader \u201cavowedly renounces the work of that agency?\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden, you are faced with a real moral dilemma,\u201d continued Mr. Connolly, whose district just outside Washington is home to thousands of federal workers.Federal workers watched with growing alarm last year as Mr. Trump waged a campaign filled with antigovernment bombast and then during a transition in which he recruited cabinet secretaries hostile to the agencies they lead. Now they wait in these chaotic early days of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency as he and his political advisers use executive orders to shred the policies and traditions the workers have championed.The intensity of feeling was already raw in late December, when members of the Digital Service gathered for drinks at the Laughing Man Tavern, a Washington bar, to say goodbye to Mikey Dickerson, their boss and the Google engineer first hired to rescue HealthCare.gov, the government\u2019s Affordable Care Act website.Mr. Dickerson had recruited many of them to overhaul outdated government systems and databases, with the goal of helping President Barack Obama open the country\u2019s doors to refugees, protect immigrants, aid veterans and improve health care. Now, he said, those who choose to stay will be building better tools for the agenda of Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is a crisis moment,\u201d Mr. Dickerson told his staff that night, according to a rough transcript of his remarks. \u201cThe coalition that brought us all together for a while is broken, because the values that we have all prioritized differently are now pointing in different directions.\u201dFour days after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers \u2014 Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell \u2014 attended the Digital Service\u2019s staff meeting. The pair, who are close to Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, told the nearly 100 staff members that their expertise was valued by the president; Mr. Kushner; Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist; and others in the West Wing.The message was meant to provide reassurance. But several members of the team said it had the opposite effect. One employee who still works there said it was the moment she realized their combined technological prowess would be harnessed for a new purpose.\u201cAt that moment, when folks heard the name Steve Bannon, it was like a punch in the gut. It became so real,\u201d said the employee, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.Career employees are particularly nervous at the E.P.A., which Mr. Trump repeatedly singled out for attack on the campaign trail, vowing at one point to \u201cget rid of\u201d the agency. On Monday, about 100 employees at the agency\u2019s Chicago office, which oversees the enforcement of environmental regulations in five Midwestern states, used their lunch hour to protest the Senate\u2019s confirmation of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the agency. Mr. Pruitt was a fierce critic of its mission under Mr. Obama.\u201cI have been through several transitions, but I have never had or seen this level of alarm,\u201d said Nicole Cantello, an E.P.A. lawyer in the Chicago office, who heads the Chicago-area union of the agency\u2019s employees.Ms. Cantello, who has worked for the E.P.A. prosecuting cases since 1990, said that during the George W. Bush administration, some career employees had quietly bristled at more industry-friendly environmental regulations. But at no point did they feel the alarm they do now, she said.\u201cUnless there\u2019s an abject abandoning of E.P.A.\u2019s role in the world, we\u2019ll do what we\u2019re told to do,\u201d she said.In a video to E.P.A. employees this past week, the acting administrator, Catherine R.
