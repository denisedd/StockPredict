If you don\u2019t think you can do anything about it, you won\u2019t.\u201dHis new program, \u201cBill Nye Saves the World,\u201d will premiere as a Netflix original series on April 21. In a statement, Netflix said, \u201cEach episode will tackle a topic from a scientific point of view, dispelling myths, and refuting antiscientific claims that may be espoused by politicians, religious leaders or titans of industry.\u201dMr. Nye, 61, will be joined by celebrity guests like the model Karlie Kloss, the actor Rachel Bloom and the fashion consultant Tim Gunn. A Netflix representative said the 13 episodes, each 30 minutes long, will be released all at once.A new trailer for the series was released on Wednesday.Mr. Nye is famous for his Emmy Award-winning series \u201cBill Nye the Science Guy.\u201d But fans of that kid-friendly 1990s classic may be disappointed to learn that the upcoming series will have an entirely different format \u2013 it\u2019s a talk show, not a children\u2019s\u2019 program.\u201cWe have guests, we have a panel of experts, we have what\u2019s essentially a monologue, and we have comedy video pieces that are inserted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe comedy bits,\u201d he added, \u201care brilliant!\u201dAlthough it is clear he has fundamental disagreements with much of the Republican establishment, he seems to approach hot topics like climate change and the reproductive rights of women with a measure of restraint, deliberately showing respect for opposing viewpoints even when they frustrate him.And while he may get impatient with policy makers who reject scientific findings, he sees no point in getting testy. \u201cAs good as it might make us feel to call other people names, it\u2019s probably not in our medium- or long-term interest,\u201d he said. \u201cOptimism may be counter to divisiveness.\u201dThe new show will tackle a range of subjects including sex, climate change, technology and alternative medicine. It\u2019s not necessarily meant to be a political program, but Mr. Nye acknowledges that these days, issues like climate change are inherently hot-button \u2013 even when they shouldn\u2019t be.\u201cWe in the climate science community didn\u2019t politicize it. Other people did,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who want to preserve the fossil fuel industries, the extraction industries.\u201dMr. Nye said he hoped that his show would be picked up for a second season, but there are no guarantees.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Yen\u2019 Is a Den of Family Dysfunction", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPhysical affection is a lost art in the broken family of Anna Jordan\u2019s \u201cYen,\u201d a violent play about tender feelings, which opened on Tuesday night at the Lucille Lortel Theater. For the two teenage half brothers at the center of this British drama, to touch is to violate, to attack and, as like as not, to bruise.That\u2019s the mind-set that develops, it seems, when a boy\u2019s perception of the world comes almost entirely from pornographic films and Call of Duty video games, entertainments in which our leading almost-men are immersed day and night. Gentle caresses, fraternal hugs and friendly pats on the back just aren\u2019t part of their vocabulary.These feral creatures, who live on their own in a rancid apartment in a suburban London housing project, are portrayed with equal sensitivity and fierceness by the young actors Lucas Hedges and Justice Smith. Careering into each other like runaway bumper cars, they create a gracefully graceless ballet of kinetic dysfunction, appropriate to characters who have never learned how to handle the lethal weapon that is the human body.Mr. Hedges, you\u2019ll be happy to hear, is just as comfortable being uncomfortable onstage as he is onscreen. In the role of Hench, at 16 the older of the brothers, he delivers an expert anatomy of an adolescent on the edge of explosion. Hench doesn\u2019t have a lot to say; but even in rigid repose, his most common posture, his body is eloquent with radioactive misery.The cast is effectively rounded out by Ari Graynor as Maggie, the boys\u2019 drug-and-drink-addled mom, who sporadically drops by to steal something to sell. She makes her entrance comatose, dragged into view by her sons. If you want to understand why Hench and Bobbie are so bereft of social skills, just wait until she wakes up.When we first meet them, camped out on the sofa bed before yet another porn fest on the telly, they have only a single T-shirt. They share their squalid quarters with a dog (never seen but often heard) with the weighted name of Taliban, to which they pay about as much attention as their mother pays to them.That\u2019s why Jennifer \u2014 whose father has recently died and who has moved from Wales with her mother to live with relatives \u2014 shows up, a gleaming dog lead in hand, to make the boys do right by Taliban. She is also a lonely girl, and, with a combination of adult practicality and youthful na\u00efvet\u00e9, she insinuates her way into the brothers\u2019 lives.The consequences of her doing so are mapped by Ms. Jordan in ways that can feel labored. \u201cYen\u201d is a thoughtful play, for sure, but too often you\u2019re aware of the wheels churning behind it. And while everything clicks thematically (and symbolically), you may feel that the characters are being pushed into climactic positions by authorial hands.The play has been given an appropriately assaultive physical production. Mark Wendland\u2019s bleak set is ominously accented by Ben Stanton\u2019s dingy lighting, Fitz Patton\u2019s abrasive sound design and videos by Lucy Mackinnon that feel as aggressively restless as the hyperkinetic Bobbie.Despite the resulting sensory overload, \u201cYen\u201d never quite packs the wallop it so obviously intends to. Its dialogue, while replete with a raw sexual vocabulary that its characters fail to grasp the implications of, falters when it skews sentimental. (We learn, for example, that Yen, a synonym for longing, is what Jennifer\u2019s father used to call her.)The production is most articulate at its least verbal, when the cast members give fractured physical life to their emotional confusion. Watch Mr. Smith\u2019s Bobbie mimicking domestic rituals of grooming and tidying at manically heightened speed. Or his clumsy avidity as he climbs into his mum\u2019s lap, like an overgrown mastiff that thinks it\u2019s still a puppy, or his defiant cuddling-up to the contact-averse Hench.When Hench and Jennifer find themselves alone, the bewildered longing in Mr. Hedges\u2019s face and posture are exquisitely painful. Jennifer tries to teach him how to touch, but the prospect of such connection frightens Hench, and we share his fear.First love is never easy. Here it feels almost fatally fraught.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "6 Ways \u2018Girls\u2019 Changed Television. Or Didn\u2019t.", "Date": null, "News": "Our critics look at the impact of the HBO show on television as it enters its sixth and final season.Supported byWhen \u201cGirls\u201d had its premiere on HBO in 2012, it was an instant lightning rod. A dramedy about four 20-something women searching for careers and companionship in New York, it was praised for its sexually frank, wryly satirical look at millennial angst, chastised for its lack of diversity, and dissected in an endless stream of essays and social media posts thanks to its explorations of gender politics and post-collegiate social panic.\u201cGirls,\u201d \u201cVeep,\u201d \u201cScandal,\u201d \u201cBunheads\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d debuted within months of one another, all centered on complicated women whose problems are not designed to seem adorable. Though \u201cGirls,\u201d created by Lena Dunham, who also stars as the would-be writer Hannah Horvath, is not a ratings powerhouse, it has a devoted, outspoken following and helped usher in an impressive new generation of idiosyncratic voices on television.At the start of its sixth and final season, on Feb. 12, as Hannah gets a big break as a writer, Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) embarks on a new job, Marnie (Allison Williams) endures a messy divorce, and Jessa (Jemima Kirke) holes up with Adam (Adam Driver), \u201cGirls\u201d hasn\u2019t lost its attention-grabbing ways. Six of our critics look at the impact that \u201cGirls\u201d made (and did not make) on TV.According to Hollywood, women can have completely satisfying sexual experiences without ever taking off their bras, and manage to reach euphoric orgasms within minutes. \u201cGirls\u201d never bothered with any of these tropes. From the show\u2019s first episode, the sex was sweaty, it was weird, it was jiggly, it was unflattering. Which is to say: It was realistic.The show\u2019s women had sex for the messy fun of it, for validation, even when it was fleeting, and occasionally out of obligation. Questionable moments \u2014 of which there were oh so many \u2014 were cured with humor before they turned tragic and bitter. And there were few cautionary tales. \u201cGirls\u201d could have been a BuzzFeed listicle of \u201cAwkward Sex Encounters You\u2019ll Have in Your 20s.\u201dIn Season 5, when Adam (Adam Driver) and Jessa (Jemima Kirke) finally acknowledge their slow-burning chemistry and succumb to the desire to have sex, there is nothing cinematic about it. There is no montage of them reuniting in the rain, or passionate kiss set to a Twenty One Pilots song. Instead, the camera cuts to them straddling on a creaky couch, negotiating bad backs and the limited space. The payoff comes from seeing two abrasive characters in a rare display of tenderness. When Ray and Shoshanna, played by Alex Karpovsky and Zosia Mamet, are staring down the end of their romance, they find themselves having sex. Shoshanna\u2019s face, looking extremely uncomfortable, is closest to the camera, while Ray\u2019s unaware and blissful one hovers over her. The scene telegraphs something profound about the way women endure, how they swallow their needs to service others, especially men.Perhaps Marnie (Allison Williams) has the most dramatic arc. Early on, her facial expressions during sex are shaded with shock, the punch line to an unspoken joke about how awful the whole experience seems. She often watches her partner to figure out her reaction, instead of concentrating on deriving any pleasure for herself. But a few seasons later, she comes into her own with her musician boyfriend, Desi (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), as he kneels, face buried in her behind. The look on her face is no longer confused nor uneasy. It is pure bliss.But the best moments are the ones when Hannah (Lena Dunham) unabashedly reveals the deepest veins of her pathologies. Once she takes on the role of an extremely underage child while having sex with Adam; another time she lifts a $100 bill from him and uses it to buy pizza.The show didn\u2019t make the sex easy to watch because it isn\u2019t easy for women to figure themselves out as sexual beings, to have autonomy and agency, to determine how they want to wield their femininity and sexuality. But \u201cGirls\u201d never tried to be easy.JENNA WORTHAMIt was around the third or maybe the 13th time Lena Dunham whipped off her bra in \u201cGirls\u201d that I realized she was not only a writer, director, performer as well as a millennial touchstone, sore spot and fetish, but also a body artist. Since the start of that show, she has made one woman\u2019s body in all its glorious, uncomfortably chaotic excess both the subject and object of her attention and ours. Much of the history of Western art has been a history of men creating images of women, especially white and young; Ms. Dunham is doing her part to recast that image, its production and consumption.This is changing oh-so slowly, with performers like Ms. Dunham, Mindy Kaling, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Amy Schumer, among others, challenging norms of female beauty, desirability, significance and consequence. They\u2019ve used humor to demolish old ways of seeing, dismantling, joke by joke, ideas about a woman\u2019s to-be-looked-at-ness. In some ways, they have mainstreamed the assaults on representation that are also the domain of performance artists like Karen Finley, who famously smeared chocolate on her nude body to symbolize, as she explained, how women are treated like dirt.MANOHLA DARGIS\u201cI don\u2019t want to freak you out, but I think that I may be the voice of my generation. Or at least, a voice of a generation.\u201dSo declares Lena Dunham\u2019s Hannah in the first episode of \u201cGirls,\u201d in 2012. Looking back, that wry prophecy was right and wrong: \u201cGirls\u201d has stood out for the fanfare around its millennial feminist voice, as well as for the pushback over how little the show represents the lives of the women of color who live in the same Brooklyn neighborhoods where the show is set.I always thought that conversations around race and \u201cGirls\u201d revealed a new facet of millennial feminism: the ways in which digital media elevated the voices of women of color, who traditionally did not have the same platforms as their white counterparts. Social media enabled wider audiences to engage in debates about racism and feminism that had typically taken place offline and too often only among academics and activists.Perhaps, in part, because of the \u201cGirls\u201d controversy, Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cBroad City,\u201d TBS\u2019s \u201cSearch Party\u201d and other hipster millennial shows set in New York better reflect its diversity. Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None,\u201d in which Aziz Ansari plays Dev, an Indian-American character who has a white girlfriend, Rachel (No\u00ebl Wells), and is best friends with the Taiwanese-American Brian (Kelvin Yu) and the African-American Denise (Lena Waithe), best enlarges our sense of diversity. It underscores that for the most racially diverse generation in American history, there are many millennial voices to which we should be listening.SALAMISHAH TILLETThe rhythms of that scene riff on the recipe for a traditional sitcom. It\u2019s set at the kitchen table in the apartment Hannah and Marnie share. They\u2019re Monica and Rachel but without the standard Etch A Sketch approach to half-hour relationships. The little put-downs and brush-offs really hurt. They mount and accrue. The gags are distinct from the insecurities they feed on.Lena Dunham, who developed \u201cGirls\u201d with Jenni Konner, hasn\u2019t made a movie since her first, \u201cTiny Furniture,\u201d in 2010. But \u201cGirls\u201d is a show after Mr. Mazursky\u2019s heart: a comedy that trusts you to distinguish the people for the jokes.WESLEY MORRISIn the final season of \u201cGirls,\u201d Hannah (Lena Dunham) tells a magazine editor about what she considers to be one of her strengths. \u201cI have a strong opinion about everything,\u201d she says, \u201ceven topics I\u2019m not informed on.\u201d\u201cGirls\u201d is both the ultimate obsession of think-piece culture and its most astute chronicler. It is a series about precisely the sort of young, wired, highly educated people who would have strong feelings about \u201cGirls.\u201d (Shoshanna, I suspect, watches religiously; Jessa refuses to; Ray has seen one episode and hates it, especially the Ray character.)In the final season\u2019s brilliant third episode, Hannah encounters an author (Matthew Rhys) after she writes about allegations that he\u2019s a sexual predator. It\u2019s a messy, uncomfortable confrontation \u2014 there will be think pieces! \u2014 but they also bond over their love of the provocateur supreme Philip Roth. \u201cI know I\u2019m not supposed to like him, because he\u2019s a misogynist and demeans women, but I can\u2019t help it,\u201d she says.As with Mr. Roth, controversy has raised the profile of \u201cGirls\u201d but sometimes overshadows its craft. Hannah\u2019s signature line in the pilot \u2014 \u201cI think that I may be the voice of my generation. Or at least, a voice of a generation.\u201d \u2014 has been so overread as a mission statement (says who!) that it gets short shrift for being a funny, self-deflating joke.But attention is fuel, for \u201cGirls\u201d and for its flawed protagonist. Bildungsromans about writers tend to end with them resolving to write their own stories \u2014 James Joyce\u2019s Stephen Dedalus, say, going to forge \u201cthe uncreated conscience of my race.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s where Hannah\u2019s story is headed. But it might be more fitting if it ends with her sitting on her bed, opening her laptop and writing a think piece about \u201cGirls.\u201dJAMES PONIEWOZIKHannah Horvath may or may not have been someone like you, but Ms. Dunham had done something you might also be able to try. That was the message that \u201cGirls\u201d sent out to the strivers, navel-gazers and exhibitionists of the world, who suddenly saw a route from the writers\u2019 group or the improv troupe onto the screen.A.O.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Look Now, but the Great Unbundling Has Spun Into Reverse", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe internet promised to be the great unbundler. The evisceration of distribution costs would free consumers from paying for cable television channels they never watched, allowing them to bypass cable monopolies and pay only for the shows they wanted. No longer would anyone have to buy a $99-a-month triple-play package when all they wanted was the History Channel.Over the last two decades, consumers have felt liberated as traditional bundles unraveled \u2014 from music to media to retail.For instance, Craigslist and myriad other digital start-ups siphoned lucrative job and real estate listings from traditional newspaper bundles. Meanwhile, media firms held onto the economically challenged business of delivering news and entertainment.Proponents of the breakdown of the bundle economy most often cite cable television. Superficially, the evidence is compelling: In the last six years, pay TV penetration has declined from about 90 percent to 80 percent of homes \u2014 with more than two million homes cutting the cord in the last couple of years alone.But paradoxically, the same forces that allowed classified ads and news to be so easily separated also drastically increased the economic rationale for bundling across the board.Consumers merely have swapped one bundle for another (or often, several). There are more than 65 million subscribers to cheaper \u201cover the top\u201d packages provided by Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Sling TV and others (even excluding Amazon Prime Video). One does not always think of all of these as \u201cbundles\u201d because these services do not consistently categorize their content using the commonplace TV channel taxonomy. However, their aggregation of shows looks more and more like a traditional cable bundle.We are in the age of the great rebundling, when firms use packages of services as a way to increase their scale advantage and thus deepen the moat around their businesses.In music, the story is even starker than in television. At one time, consumers used to buy a collection of songs \u2014 on vinyl, cassette and then compact disc. It was possible to buy a single song or two in these formats, but the internet facilitated more and more people downloading individual tracks.Yet, today, there is an inexorable consumer shift to all-you-can-eat bundles of music. Already more than 60 million people pay for Spotify, Apple Music and others. These music bundles will increasingly be combined with other services as well to build competitive advantage. This newspaper currently includes Spotify with certain new subscriptions. And it is easy to see how Google and Apple will increasingly integrate music packages into their broader suite of services (as Amazon already has).Bundling has always worked well for products for which consumers have widely varying tastes and willingness to pay. The magic of bundle economics allows consumers to get more for less, while also maximizing revenue for the provider. Imagine that there are two hungry diners at a burger joint where the restaurant\u2019s marginal cost of food is zero-ish. One customer is willing to fork over $5 for a burger and $1 for fries. The other will shell out $5 for fries but only $1 for a burger. By selling a la carte, the restaurant maximizes revenue by pricing each item at $5. Both consumers leave hungry, and the business takes in $10. However, both diners would snap up a $6 bundle, allowing them to sate their appetites while shelling out $12 in total. Everyone is better off (perhaps not healthwise).In the digital environment, two additional forces are driving this tidal wave of digital bundling.First, the near-zero marginal cost of distribution makes all-you-can-eat packages compelling. Even heavy users of streaming services can potentially be profitable customers if the underlying economics of rights payments are well managed.The Federal Communications Commission appears to be relaxing its position on the bundling of data and services. The agency had been investigating the practice of \u201czero-rating,\u201d whereby a wireless carrier like T-Mobile allows its subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data cap. Recently, the F.C.C. dropped this investigation \u2014 believing that this kind of bundling is now commonplace in a competitive market. Plainly this is the thin edge of the wedge for net neutrality. Connectivity and cloud computing services will most likely start to include \u201cunrated\u201d services to differentiate themselves further from other commodity providers. In the short term, this shift will most likely be a boon for consumers. Time will tell whether this stifles long-range innovation \u2014 especially in bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming.Second, firms need to mitigate the high cost of attracting and retaining online consumers. Netflix can amortize the expense of acquiring and servicing a subscriber over the hundreds of dollars of revenue they will generate if they hang around for a couple of years. Selling individual shows for a few bucks a pop would be vastly more expensive in marketing, billing and service costs.Tying several services together (even when they are not all directly complementary) increases customer loyalty. Amazon Prime has more than 66 million subscribers. Just a few years ago, it was mostly a free-shipping service. Now, it includes an extensive library of free e-books, videos and music. The large base of Prime subscribers makes life hard for would-be Amazon competitors \u2014 who have to contend not just with Amazon\u2019s scale in any particular vertical but also the combined value of the eclectic products and services that Amazon bundles together. This value may also increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning help personalize these applications. Walmart may be four times larger than Amazon in retail, but Amazon\u2019s bundle magnifies the impact of its size, reducing its scale disadvantage.For insurgents, this trend complicates the already formidable challenge of competing with the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple \u2014 all of which have been adept at weaving various interconnected services together to magnify their scale advantage.Technology investors are obsessed with network effects. These help make firms like Facebook and eBay so valuable \u2014 because additional users increase utility for everyone, making it hard for upstarts to compete. But investors often forget that network effects are just a subset of scale advantages. Superior scale is what protects most businesses from competition. It would be hard to start a business to take on Coca-Cola because of its size advantage \u2014 especially in local bottling, distribution and marketing.During the road show for the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape, its chief executive, Jim Barksdale, famously commented that there are \u201conly two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.\u201d For many firms, the bundle is not a decaying symbol of legacy distribution.

{"Headline": "Lionsgate\u2019s Bets Pay Off as Studio Makes a Big Comeback", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 In July, Lionsgate was stuck under a storm cloud.What a difference six months makes.Lionsgate\u2019s stock has climbed nearly 40 percent since mid-July. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the strong momentum,\u201d Jon Feltheimer, Lionsgate\u2019s chief executive, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday to discuss the company\u2019s third-fiscal-quarter results.For the period that ended on Dec. 31, which included almost no income from \u201cLa La Land\u201d because of its late-quarter theatrical rollout and only 23 days of Starz results, revenue grew 12 percent, to $752 million, compared with the year-earlier period. After adjusting for one-time charges, profit stood at $34 million, a 36 percent drop. The third quarter of 2015 benefited from the blockbuster finale of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d series.The question now: As Hollywood tumult increases \u2014 consumers are watching more content on smartphones; major entertainment companies are searching for chief executives; the power imbalance with technology giants has media conglomerates looking to get bigger \u2014 does Lionsgate become predator or prey?With its TV division increasing in size, which lessens exposure to the volatile film business, and its reinvigorated movie division, Lionsgate has achieved the near impossible in terms of positioning itself for the road ahead: It could be either, which is one reason it has become one of the more interesting companies in Hollywood. Alan Gould, an analyst with Brean Capital, wrote in a recent report that he had one major conclusion: \u201chow well positioned Lionsgate is as either an acquirer or an entity to be acquired.\u201dMichael Burns, Lionsgate\u2019s vice chairman, declined to comment on the guessing game surrounding his company, although he did say, \u201cWe believe that our greater scale brings great opportunity.\u201d\u201cStill not for the faint of heart,\u201d Mr. Juenger wrote of Lionsgate\u2019s stock.Tim Palen, Lionsgate\u2019s marketing chief, said that a staff reorganization since last summer \u2014 Mr. Palen now reports to Mr. Feltheimer instead of an intermediary \u2014 had improved his ability to respond to the marketplace, contributing to recent successes. \u201cHaving the marketing group plugged directly into Jon Feltheimer has made an enormous difference,\u201d Mr. Palen said, adding that morale had also improved. \u201cOne of the things that makes our jobs challenging and fun is that we have wildly different movies with wildly different release strategies.\u201dWhile still considered a midlevel performer, Starz, led by Chris Albrecht, has found momentum at a time when it is hard for any prestige-minded network outside of HBO and FX to stand out. The crime drama \u201cPower\u201d and the time travel romance \u201cOutlander,\u201d for instance, produce sizable viewership and buzz for Starz.In a sign of confidence, Starz recently moved the broadcast date for its slate of original shows from Saturday to Sunday, a more competitive terrain, going head-to-head against HBO and Showtime.John Koblin contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chris Rock Returns With Jokes and Personal Anguish", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow 52, Mr. Rock, looking trim in casual black pants and jacket, talked about his vanity, insecurities and failures with startling frankness. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a good husband,\u201d he said, standing still, shifting into a quieter register. \u201cI didn\u2019t listen. I wasn\u2019t kind. I cheated.\u201dMr. Rock paused as the audience waited for the joke. It arrived eventually, but it did not match the impact of this silent, dramatic beat. In his new set, Mr. Rock appeared to be after something more than laughs. It is rare to see a celebrity discuss his infidelity with the specificity that he did here \u2014 detailing who and how many \u2014 but he talked about this in an anguished, searching tone that fans may find surprising. At times, Mr. Rock sounded like a man confessing his sins, turning vulnerability into his latest provocation.Comedy is about surprise, and one reason Mr. Rock has been his generation\u2019s finest political stand-up is his ability to consistently go against the grain with conviction. (Unlike some, he always seems to believe the premises of his jokes.)The rise of Mr. Trump, he concluded, taking his critique to a comic extreme, stems from our battle against bullying. \u201cWe got rid of bullies,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a real one showed up, we didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dHe also discussed police shootings in an unexpected way, saying that he would think that law enforcement might try to shoot a white kid for once, \u201cjust for appearances.\u201d But he also spent time sympathizing with police officers, describing work that has zero room for error and draws pay that is far too low. If his current social commentary has a common thread, it\u2019s an alertness to how economics colors every issue. \u201cWhole Foods does not say \u2018No Blacks Allowed,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut a $7 orange does. That\u2019s the new Jim Crow.\u201dWhat stood out most about this show, however, was the personal, not the political. Mr. Rock has mostly kept the audience at a distance from his private life. He isn\u2019t the type to dwell on his demons or soul search on a podcast. So it\u2019s a surprise to see him tell jokes about the dark consequences of his addiction to pornography or the excruciating details of family court. This is not his funniest show, but it might be his most compelling, a departure even in its form. The distance between his forceful stand-up persona and the softer-spoken, more thoughtful one he displays in interviews has shrunk a bit \u2014 and his jokes are more intricate, denser. What remains firm is a lyricist\u2019s gift for concision, boiling down a thought to its comic essence. On bullying: \u201cPressure makes diamonds. Not hugs.\u201dMr. Rock\u2019s comedy has always been happily cynical about marriage, his jokes regarding relationships rooted in regressive stereotypes about men and women. He\u2019s found many laughs in sympathy for men behaving badly, blaming Hillary Clinton for her husband\u2019s cheating and pointing out how O. J. Simpson had to pay steep alimony while his former wife slept with another man. (\u201cI\u2019m not saying he should have killed her, but I understand.\u201d)When discussing his own marriage, however, he blamed only himself, repeatedly, allowing sadness to creep into his dynamic voice. He also dug into his past, telling a story about his grandmother disparaging poor men that stuck with him for years, and another about his grandfather mocking him for crying.Mr. Rock wants to tell us where he came from, and also where he hopes to go. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get a little bit of religion,\u201d he said, before backtracking: \u201cNot a lot.\u201d He added that he believes in God, but only a bit. Onstage, Mr. Rock has always had the intonations of a preacher \u2014 which his grandfather was \u2014 repeating premises until they sound like incantations. But his real religion is comedy, and at the end of this discussion of his relationship with God, he contrasted the sureness of faith with the questioning nature of a comic.But as comedians go, Mr. Rock has always been one of the most forcefully confident. What\u2019s different is he now sounds more anxious. And while the election and his divorce may have added heaviness to his gait, this evolution may also stem from simply growing older. In a line he repeated over and over on Monday, Mr. Rock explained his spiritual search in the hardheaded pragmatic terms we\u2019ve come to expect from him: \u201cI want to find God before God finds me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Does Fame Have a Recipe? Dominique Crenn\u2019s Fast Rise", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Five years ago, Dominique Crenn was just another hardworking Bay Area chef running a small, ambitious restaurant. She had been cooking since the early 1990s, when she arrived in this city from her native France, but she was still off the radar for many American food lovers. She had never won a James Beard award or served as a judge on \u201cTop Chef\u201d or hit any of the other marks of culinary stardom.Ms. Crenn herself, a little stunned by her whirlwind ascent, is one of the people wrestling hardest with those questions, including what it means to be a leading woman in what remains a male-dominated field.\u201cI hope that award won\u2019t exist in two years,\u201d she said over coffee (American drip, black) at a hipster bike shop/espresso bar near the restaurant. She considered rejecting the \u201cBest Female Chef\u201d title, which many chefs, including her, consider patronizing. \u201cBut then I thought, \u2018Am I going to fight it or am I going to do something with it?\u2019\u201dMs. Crenn is clearly up for the fight, from the soles of her retro-chic Adidas trainers to the tips of her spiky hair. She is thoughtful, outspoken, authoritative and softhearted, sometimes in the course of a single sentence. Unlike many chefs who keep their heads down and their focus on the kitchen, she is not afraid to raise her voice \u2014 about religion, immigration, entitlement, gratitude and other topics only tangentially related to food.Dinner at the jewel-box-like Atelier Crenn, which opened in 2011, begins not with a menu but with a poem on a slip of paper:The poem extends to a dozen lines, each one corresponding to a course: the meal, to more than 30 different bites, each one simultaneously delicious, elaborate and bewildering.On the plate, \u201cwhimsically ebullient blue umami\u201d translates to a shellfish course: grilled local abalone garnished with abalone liver, roasted garlic, egg \u201cjam,\u201d oyster-scented cream and a tangy gelatinized mignonette sauce.The eminent French chef Guy Savoy described himself as \u201cimmediately seduced\u201d by Ms. Crenn\u2019s cooking. \u201cHer work is so close to and respectful of the product,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen combined with her beautiful sensibility, the result is deeply affecting.\u201dStill, food that is deeply affecting is not always what Americans are comfortable eating. Some critics have called Ms. Crenn\u2019s work mystifying and pretentious, both on the plate and on the page.Ms. Crenn, 51, was raised outside Paris, in Versailles. Her father, Allain Crenn, was a politician and a painter, whom she credits with developing the awareness of the visual arts and the natural world that is always present in her work.She learned the principles of cooking from her mother, Louise Crenn, and was taken to fine restaurants from a young age. But she did not dream of becoming a chef, and never attended culinary school. She moved here after graduating from college in Paris, and has never truly left. \u201cFrance is my country, but San Francisco is my home,\u201d she said.\u201cPartly because she is one of the few chefs who can pull off a modernist menu in a way that is interesting,\u201d Mr. Hayler said. \u201cAnd partly because she is a woman, and therefore presumably able to influence more women to do what she does.\u201dBecause of rankings like World\u2019s 50 Best, in which chefs help decide the winners, success in the modern food world requires being admired by other chefs \u2014 most of them male and European \u2014 even more than by critics. Ms. Crenn is popular among other chefs, who cite her dedication to mentoring, philanthropy and environmental causes, as well as her talent.But her food is unapologetically artsy, personal and sometimes risky, and she believes this is one reason she received less credit and more criticism at the beginning of her solo career.\u201cMany people still think a creative, original artist must be a man,\u201d she said. This was long true in art, fashion, literature and many other fields, she pointed out. \u201cMy biggest role models are not chefs,\u201d she said, \u201cbut women like Coco Chanel, Simone de Beauvoir, Nina Simone.\u201d\u201cShe cooks the way the men are cooking,\u201d Michael Bauer, the longtime restaurant critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, said in an interview. \u201cLike what you\u2019d see at Benu or Quince or Le Bernardin,\u201d all restaurants with three Michelin stars, headed by men.Many women can and do cook in this au courant style, loosely called \u201cmodernist.\u201d But in the United States, so far, few of them are at the helm of their own restaurants.(In April, Ms, Crenn will pass the \u201cBest Female Chef\u201d baton to Ana Ro\u0161, a former ski champion and self-taught chef whose restaurant in rural Slovenia is dedicated to introducing the world to the native foods of the western Balkans.)Ms. Perello, of Octavia, said most female chefs lack not the ability, but the desire, to embrace modernist cooking. With its manicured compositions and technical transformations, it\u2019s a style that constantly announces the presence of the chef. \u201cFor whatever reason,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s still easier for men to stick their neck out and say: \u2018Look at me, look at what I\u2019m doing on this plate. Isn\u2019t it incredible?\u2019\u201dClearly, Ms. Crenn\u2019s breakthrough is not only about the food. \u201cYes, Dominique is more enamored of technique and equipment than any of the women chefs I know,\u201d Ms. Silverton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s her charisma and confidence, not her cooking, that cracked that boys\u2019 club open.\u201dMr. Bauer, who gave Atelier Crenn three and a half stars in a 2014 review, took that a few steps further. \u201cShe has been successful because she does have talent, and she has worked hard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest, also because she has enormous charisma, she\u2019s beautiful, and has that French accent.\u201dMs. Crenn shrugs off this assessment. She is firmly feminist, but her interest in identity politics in the kitchen is limited.\u201cBeing a chef is about feeding people, which is part of the story of all humanity,\u201d she said. \u201cMale, female, gay, straight, Jewish, Muslim, white, black: The longer I do this, the more I am sure that none of it should matter in the kitchen \u2014 or anywhere.\u201d\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll start my own list,\u201d she added. \u201cIt would not look like anything the world has seen before.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

But should it be?As the chart shows, the worst discrepancy is the San Francisco metropolitan area, where a standard house should cost about $300,000 \u2014 but in reality is more like $800,000 (based on 2013 figures). Next comes cities and counties in coastal Southern California \u2014 basically a band of overpriced housing that stretches downward from Ventura to the San Diego border.Inland cities like Sacramento, Fresno and Riverside are all much cheaper, which is why many Californians have moved eastward.Now, to remind you, these are metro area figures. So even if San Francisco, Los Angeles and their surrounding cities started a surge in building, that doesn\u2019t mean that homes in the most sought-after places like the Mission District or Santa Monica will ever be close to affordable.The research suggests the bigger problem with coastal California isn\u2019t that not enough people can afford to live exactly where they want \u2013 it\u2019s that not enough people can afford to live there at all.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Lowriding, rooted in Latino culture, emerged in Southern California in the 1940s and \u201950s as car customization became popular.Today, cars are commonly tricked out with flashy paint jobs, plush upholstery and hydraulics that make them wiggle and bounce.While out grabbing coffee in Los Angeles\u2019s Crenshaw neighborhood, Mr. Inong, 30, noticed a gathering of people and cars and went with his camera to get a closer look.When he approached, the man seen in the photo with the dollar sign tattoo asked him if he was a cop.\u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no,\u2019\u201d Mr. Inong said. \u201cAnd he told me, \u2018O.K.

The most outr\u00e9 offering I found over a long stretch of browsing was \u201cAm\u00e9lie.\u201d Which, aside from being in French with English subtitles, is hardly outr\u00e9 at all. After a bit, I decided to relive one of the more uneventful experiences of my early career as a film critic, Garry Marshall\u2019s \u201cRunaway Bride\u201d (1999), which reunited Richard Gere and Julia Roberts almost 10 years after Marshall made some kind of movie history with them in \u201cPretty Woman.\u201d The experience remained uneventful, and the presentation didn\u2019t even have Surround Sound. (On the other hand, the site did lead me down the rabbit hole of last year\u2019s first-rate, eight-hour documentary \u201cO.J.: Made In America,\u201d which I had needed to catch up with.)The mission of Vudu, on the other hand, seems very movie-oriented, with a special emphasis on delivering snazzy presentations of its titles. The company, which began its consumer life in 2008, was bought in 2010 by Walmart. One of Walmart\u2019s most prominent characteristics is that it sells high-definition flat TV displays by the aircraft carrier, so to speak. As do, of course, Costco, Target, Best Buy and the like. But I give Walmart props for attaching to its display-retail business a service with nearly 20,000 movies in high-definition. It\u2019s as if you brought a puppy or kitten home from the animal shelter and the shelter also gave you vouchers for pet food.When you first sign on to Vudu, the site goes through whatever box you\u2019re getting it through (in my case, a PlayStation 4) and tests your internet speed, to see if you can handle Vudu\u2019s truth. Then you set parental controls. You can rent or buy movies in either the standard definition format or, in many cases, in the proprietary HDX format, which delivers movies at close to Blu-ray disc quality. I\u2019m not yet equipped for 4K, or Ultra-High Definition, display, but Vudu\u2019s got that, too.Searching for a high-def experience by which I could gauge HDX, I settled on a big studio movie I hadn\u2019t yet seen, \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d I know the generations that missed out on what was called the sexual revolution need something to make them feel not left out, but I do not think this sort of thing is really the way to go. In any event, it does have very high production values, and the HDX version certainly conveyed them well. The Bach piece in the audio\u2019s rear channels certainly conveyed the refined pain of being a young billionaire with emotional problems. The experience as a whole wasn\u2019t entirely seamless, but that\u2019s not Vudu\u2019s fault.Vudu\u2019s menu pages are so skewed to studio stuff that those looking for more challenging fare might be apt to throw up their hands too soon. Services like Mubi, FilmStruck and Fandor have far more of those types of offerings, but Vudu isn\u2019t completely lacking \u2014 it\u2019s just not immediately visible. Boutique distributors such as Oscilloscope, Kino Lorber and Magnolia have movies on the site. I was able to find, for instance, \u201cMa,\u201d a very unusual dance-in-film directed by and starring Celia Rowlson-Hall, by doing a keyboard search in which, looking for something else, I\u2019d put in the letters \u201cm\u201d and \u201ca.\u201d Lucky, that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Marketers, TV Sets Are an Invaluable Pair of Eyes", "Date": "2017-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Ellen Milz and her family were watching the Olympics last summer, their TV was watching them.Ms. Milz, 48, who lives with her husband and three children in Chicago, had agreed to be a panelist for a company called TVision Insights, which monitored her viewing habits \u2014 and whether her eyes flicked down to her phone during the commercials, whether she was smiling or frowning \u2014 through a device on top of her TV.\u201cThe marketing company said, \u2018We\u2019re going to ask you to put this device in your home, connect it to your TV and they\u2019re going to watch you for the Olympics to see how you like it, what sports, your expression, who\u2019s around,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Whatever, I have nothing to hide.\u2019\u201dMs. Milz acknowledged that she had initially found the idea odd, but that those qualms had quickly faded.\u201cIt\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d she said, comparing it to the Nest security cameras in her home. She said she had initially received $60 for participating and an additional $230 after four to six months.TVision \u2014 which has worked with the Weather Channel, NBC and the Disney ABC Television Group \u2014 is one of several companies that have entered living rooms in recent years, emerging with new, granular ways for marketers to understand how people are watching television and, in particular, commercials. The appeal of this information has soared as Americans rapidly change their viewing habits, streaming an increasing number of shows weeks or months after they first air, on devices as varied as smartphones, laptops and Roku boxes, not to mention TVs.\u201cThe big thing for TV advertisers and the networks is: Are you actually looking at the screen or not?\u201d said Dan Schiffman, the chief revenue officer of TVision (pronounced Tee-Vision). \u201cWhat you looked at is interesting, but the fact that you looked away is arguably the most interesting.\u201dMr. Schiffman founded TVision, a 30-person start-up, with a classmate from the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T.But some industry executives have criticized Nielsen\u2019s methods as outdated. Nielsen selects homes at random to represent the nation\u2019s viewing audience, and measures who is watching what shows, mostly through meters connected to the sets, as well as diaries in select markets and digital tracking of certain ad-supported programs on tablets and phones.\u201cNielsen will remain the currency for the time being because it is agreed upon as the thing everyone uses,\u201d said Alan Wurtzel, an adviser at NBCUniversal and its former head of research. \u201cBut as the world becomes more complex, as it is, many more additional supplemental or complementary measures will come into play.\u201dInformation gathered by companies like TVision can help advertisers steer marketing toward shows with the most engaged audiences, not just the largest ones. And for networks, it could make a show with a committed and loyal audience as valuable as one that attracts a larger but more casual set of viewers.TVision has recruited 2,000 households, or roughly 7,500 people, in the Boston, Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth areas. The company said the information was transmitted without storing images or video and collected anonymously.Mr. Schiffman said the data would show, for example, \u201cPerson No. 124 in Household 6 was paying attention this second and not paying attention the next to a certain program or advertisement.\u201dSymphony and TVision both use technology that can recognize shows and ads through the audio or digital tags the content contains. Consumers are most likely familiar with this type of technology through the song-recognition app Shazam.Another ratings company, RealityMine, has assembled a panel of 5,000 people in the United States whom it said it paid less than $90 a year, who either have its app, a \u201chome meter\u201d plugged into their internet networks or both. In some instances, its meter may capture activity across 25 devices in a household, such as tablet, phone, Xbox, Wii, Apple TV and Google Chromecast.The aim is \u201cunderstanding what is the media day and the life of the consumer today,\u201d said Charlie Buchwalter, the chief executive of Symphony, which has worked with companies including NBCUniversal.Mr. Schiffman said that while some people were wary of TVision\u2019s technology, they were often placated after learning that it was not storing images or videos.During the Olympics, Ms. Milz wore a Fitbit so that NBC could see how her heart rate changed while she watched certain events.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to understand where people really are and what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re watching, how are they interacting, and ideally after that, how is that changing their behavior or affecting their behavior,\u201d said Jonathan Steuer, the chief research officer of Omnicom Media Group, which oversees media buying for advertisers.By measuring the level of attention a person is paying to a given show, TVision believes it can help bolster niche programs and smaller networks. For example, Mr. Schiffman said the company had found that the series \u201cLucifer,\u201d on Fox, commanded better attention metrics from viewers than \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d on CBS, even though \u201cBig Bang\u201d is one of the TV shows rated highest by Nielsen.\u201cPeople don\u2019t just tune into \u2018Lucifer.\u2019 They DVR it and watch it when they come home,\u201d he said, adding that viewers tend to be focused on the show and stay in the room when it is on.The Weather Channel used TVision\u2019s data in the fall to give it an edge over the news and lifestyle shows it is normally compared against by advertisers. It showed its audience for weather news as \u201clean forward, lean-in viewers,\u201d said Indira Venkat, who oversees research at the channel.\u201cWhat is oftentimes missing is the quality of the audience,\u201d Ms. Venkat said about Nielsen viewing data. \u201cYes, you\u2019re getting audience, but what are they doing in today\u2019s era of multitasking?\u201dFollow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter @Sapna.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Legion\u2019 Series Premiere: Where Is My Minds?", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLegionFor all their reliance on feats of derring-do, superhero films and TV shows are, creatively speaking, a risk-averse lot. Since director Bryan Singer\u2019s first \u201cX-Men\u201d film inaugurated the genre\u2019s pop-culture hegemony nearly 17 years ago, precious little variety in tone or technique has been permitted by the major spandex factories.In \u201cLegion,\u201d Hawley takes pages from his own \u201cFargo\u201d playbook. The ostentatious use of classic rock on the soundtrack, scene and spatial transitions that call attention to themselves with graphic design or camera trickery, the sense (borrowed from the Coens) that reality is a sheet of thin ice that could crack and immerse you in the chaos beneath at any moment. It\u2019s as fearless a creative statement as the genre has seen since Tim Burton\u2019s original \u201cBatman\u201d movie in 1989. Whether it\u2019s successful is yet to be decided.The government, however, knows better. Through the course of a story structure that unfolds like an origami flower, we slowly piece together that David has been captured following a horrendous incident at Clockworks (as in \u201cOrange\u201d) Psychiatric Hospital. While held there, Haller has been able to make both progress and friends, from the wisecracking \u201cGirl, Interrupted\u201d cosplay character, Lenny (Aubrey Plaza), to the psychiatrist Dr. Kissinger (as in Henry) to his girlfriend Syd Barrett (as in Pink Floyd), who has haphephobia, a fear of being touched.Syd is played by the \u201cFargo\u201d Season 2 standout Rachel Keller, and David\u2019s puppy-love attraction to her \u2014 he initiates the relationship by asking, \u201cDo you wanna be my girlfriend?,\u201d \u2014 inspires many of the premiere\u2019s most magical, and musical, moments. Their initial flush of love gets no less a soundtrack than the Rolling Stone\u2019s marvelously sappy psychedelic ballad \u201cShe\u2019s a Rainbow,\u201d and he later hallucinates an entire French-sophistipop dance routine with her in the episode\u2019s big showstopper sequence.But this is a show about a crazed psychic with godlike powers, so of course the telekinesis hits the fan eventually. The episode is punctuated by three escape sequences that offer mainline doses of C.G.I.-enhanced mutant mayhem. When David finally touches Syd, her own power to swap minds with people who make physical contact with her kicks in; David finds himself in her body (he grabs his newfound breasts in disbelief), while she finds herself in his and unleashes his full power by accident, killing Lenny and sealing all of the other inmates behind the walls of their rooms.After David is captured, he bursts free of his initial interrogation by sending every person and object in the room flying in slow-motion to the tune of Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s alt-rock anthem \u201cUp the Beach\u201d in a scene that plays like a riff on the climax of Antonioni\u2019s \u201cZabriskie Point.\u201d And when knockout gas and electric wires give his captors the upper hand once again, a team of other mutants \u2014 including Syd, long since back in her own body \u2014 wipe out the government goons in a protracted gun-and-superpower battle that litters a swimming pool with charred corpses and tosses soldiers into the sky through sheer psychic strength.Hawley\u2019s attention to detail throughout the episode is impeccable. He and his collaborators make design choices that delight and discomfit effortlessly: the rectangular indentations in the table at which David and his interrogator are ensconced, pink accents in the uniforms of his sinister handlers, a prominent goon whose throwback perm and wardrobe make him look like he should be breaking legs for Bob Hoskins in \u201cThe Long Good Friday.\u201d Amid the camp and the chaos, Hawley introduces a note of truly frightening horror, too, in the form of the hairless and corpulent \u201cdevil with yellow eyes,\u201d who occasionally pops up on the periphery, as mute and menacing as a David Lynch demon.Advertisement"}

It gives a lot of energy for the continuation.\u201dAt the moment, the continuation is all. Mr. Dundas announced the creation of his own line, to be helmed along with his partner in life and business, Evangelo Bousis, on Instagram, in tandem with the show. He worked with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s stylist, Marni Senofonte, trading references and inspirations (the Yoruban goddess Oshun, the Venus de Milo, Byzantine crowns and Art Deco) to create the gold gown she performed in, as well as the veil in which she accepted one of her two Grammys. (There was also the red-sequined gown in which she spent the remainder of the night. Beyonc\u00e9 does not limit herself to one look an evening.)\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is so sexy and so beautiful, how do you show that without looking too overt?\u201d Ms. Senofonte said. \u201cPeter has always been able to capture that, in everything he\u2019s done for us.\u201dHe is also, she added, one of the few designers whose finished work comes back looking exactly the way he sketched it.Mr. Dundas has a long history of working with the singer. (Even so, he said, there was the particular challenge of designing custom looks for a woman pregnant with twins. \u201cI would see measurements and say that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said, \u201cand she would show me and say it was very much possible.\u201d) He has created costumes for her tours (including the Mrs. Carter Show tour and her recent Formation tour), and, while at Emilio Pucci, dressed her for the Met Gala in 2011 and her performance at the presidential inauguration in 2013.\u201cI love dressing Bey,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a better first person to wear it.\u201dMr. Dundas and Mr. Bousis, who split their time between London and New York, are working to formalize the new label and interviewing investors. As of now, they have not disclosed when and where it may be revealed.\u201cWe\u2019re still evaluating the different possibilities for how to present ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it necessarily has to be a traditional fashion show during a traditional fashion week. I love doing fashion shows but I think today you have to have an open mind to what feels fresh and what is close to your own DNA. I think there are different options. Maybe it\u2019ll start with a fashion show and go to something else, but it might go the other way around as well.\u201dIt did not escape his notice that the Grammys took place right in the middle of fashion week.

{"Headline": "CBS Bets on \u2018The Good Fight\u2019 in the Streaming Wars", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a frigid December Friday in Brooklyn, a crew largely taken from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d huddled in the gray-and-cedar halls of that show\u2019s Cook County Courthouse set. The judge presiding over the courtroom was a recurring character from the original, a mellow liberal played by Jane Alexander. The case in front of her was classically \u201cGood Wife\u201d wonky: Was a surgeon operating on a suspected terrorist on the right side of the Hippocratic oath, or the wrong side of the law?And audiences won\u2019t have to wait long to see the differences between the original and its spinoff, which comes out Feb. 19. First, there is no Julianna Margulies, who played the lead character, Alicia Florrick, on \u201cWife.\u201d Second, about halfway through the first episode of \u201cFight,\u201d Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), known for an aplomb as outsize as her statement necklaces, emphatically departs from character. Learning that her savings have been wiped out by a financial scheme, she responds by swearing \u2014 and just like that, Diane\u2019s seven-season record of dignified speech is shattered.Ms. Baranski approved of the choice. \u201cNo matter how elegant and gracious a lady you are,\u201d she said, \u201cif you found out, alone in a room, that you just lost all your money, you might\u201d swear.The newfound freedom comes with risks. \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d was so intimately invested in its heroine that audiences routinely watched her simply drink in silence. But \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d shifts the focus to two former supporting characters and one new one: Ms. Baranski\u2019s Diane is flanked by Cush Jumbo\u2019s Lucca Quinn, who appeared in the final season of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d and a new character, her goddaughter Maia Rindell, played by Rose Leslie of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dThe decidedly more adult spinoff doesn\u2019t seem the most obvious choice to anchor All Access, the network\u2019s answer to services like Netflix and Hulu. The platform currently hosts existing CBS programs, football coverage and \u201cBig Brother: Over the Top,\u201d an expanded version of the long-running reality show. Those offerings don\u2019t seem designed to help the viewer make a seamless transition to an intellectual law saga like \u201cFight.\u201d\u201cThe thing that really convinced us to do a spinoff was Christine Baranski expressing interest,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cThen we found this idea, which we liked and we thought felt current. We wanted to explore the idea that family can be a corrupting influence the way we explored marriage as a corrupting influence in \u2018The Good Wife.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe Good Fight\u201d also satisfies the Kings\u2019 desire to shed some of the constraints of network television \u2014 not just more conservative content standards but the grind of producing 22 episodes per season. (\u201cThe Good Fight\u201d will have 10.) Meanwhile, CBS All Access executives needed an intelligent original to try to place the streaming network in the class of other platforms, which have momentum and have gained some critical success.\u201cThis always felt like a show yearning for a little freedom,\u201d said Marc DeBevoise, president and chief operating officer of CBS Interactive. He added that its standards would be closer to those of prime-time shows on cable.Airing \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d on traditional CBS, both parties agreed, was never explored. A slightly edited version of the first episode of \u201cFight\u201d will also run on the main network, but after that the series will live exclusively on CBS All Access.The election results prompted other changes. The day before the vote, Ms. Baranski filmed a scene in which, while packing up her old office, Diane pauses to give a lingering look to a framed photo of her with Hillary Clinton, who is the character\u2019s political touchstone. The scene was later scrapped from the pilot. Instead, the first thing audiences see is Diane sitting at home, in the dark, watching President Trump be sworn in; there\u2019s a dazed look on her face.It seems to be an appropriate kickoff for a series that has a change of course at its core. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have seen a single second of \u2018The Good Wife\u2019 to watch this show,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cWe very much mean to be starting over, and we really feel like the dilemmas for these characters all comment on what\u2019s coming down the line in the world now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Can Trump Cut Off U.C.

Bannon.As it stands, the president has no legal basis to cut off a university over a First Amendment dispute, said Donald E. Heller, the University of San Francisco provost and a professor of education.To do so would require an act of Congress, an unlikely outcome but one that could not be ruled out.\u201cI think we have to take it seriously,\u201d said David A. Bergeron, a former official at the Department of Education who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal group.Most demonstrators assembled peaceably. But dozens of masked protesters ran riot, setting fires, smashing windows and leaving multiple people injured.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post seemed to cast the university as a whole as complicit in the violence.\u201cIt\u2019s just factually incorrect,\u201d Dr. Heller said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sad thing. Very objectively, U.C. Berkeley has done everything they can to protect free speech rights.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The secessionist legacy is literally stitched into the fabric of the state flag.In 1846, a group of settlers rebelled against the weak Mexican government in power at the time and proclaimed an independent California Republic.But the Bear Flag Revolt was to be short-lived.Around the same time, the United States had gone to war with Mexico. The U.S. Army moved into California and the rebels promptly dropped their independence claim.But the flag lived on.Sales of the flag have surged since Mr. Trump won the presidency, several California flag dealers said.\u201cA lot of people are flying them instead of the U.S.A. flag,\u201d said Susan Montapert, owner of Nikki\u2019s Flags in Newport Beach.She added, \u201cI inventory my California flags every few days to make sure I have enough.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Directors From Sundance on What Happened Next", "Date": "2017-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut what about the festival filmmakers whose works are lauded and distributed, but whose career paths are less charmed? After they\u2019ve packed up their snow gear, there are tantalizing moments and deep frustrations. Many go on what\u2019s known as the \u201cwater bottle tour,\u201d meetings with development executives and agents in Los Angeles (where you\u2019re more likely to leave with a bottle of Evian than a production deal). Most don\u2019t have new scripts ready, a huge impediment, said the producer Anne Carey.For three filmmakers \u2014 Mr. Simien, 33, from Los Angeles; Ms. Candler, 42, who lives in Austin, Tex.; and Sara Colangelo, 37, based in New York \u2014 who made their feature debuts in 2014, alongside Mr. Chazelle, what happened next felt like one step forward, two back. Their paths hold lessons for other artists and offer a glimpse into how Hollywood careers are really made.\u201cDear White People\u201d struck a chord, earning a festival award for breakthrough talent. A distribution deal soon followed. \u201cI went into it just hoping that when I came out, I could at least pay my rent,\u201d Mr. Simien said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201dBut in Los Angeles afterward, he was in demand, attending dozens of development meetings for months. He understood the process: \u201cPart of being a development person is checking off the list\u201d that you\u2019ve met with Sundance alumni, he said.Yet Mr. Simien was still strapped for cash. Driving to those Beverly Hills meetings, \u201cI was afraid to pull up to the valet, because my hubcaps were falling off,\u201d he said.Mr. Simien is pleased with it but itching to get to other projects. \u201cCreatively, I just need to prove to myself and to others in the industry, I\u2019m not a one-trick pony,\u201d he said.Hiring for his series, he had noted that white male colleagues had been given more career chances. \u201cThe opportunities that I have tend to be self-made,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou just gotta keep grinding \u2014 which has worked out so far.\u201d\u201cThere were moments in the editing room where I was like, I\u2019m enormously proud, but these things might not be working,\u201d she said. Was the film too sad? How would the marketplace react? \u201cI was aware of what the challenges were.\u201dThe film came with hard-to-meet expectations. Critics at the festival praised the acting, though, and the scene-setting.Ms. Colangelo made the Los Angeles rounds that fall, and was sent a few scripts, but no jobs materialized. She made ends meet doing corporate videos. Financially, she said, \u201cthere were nine months or so where it was like, it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201dIn the meantime, she watched friends and Sundance alumni \u2014 mostly men \u2014 advance. Doubts crept in: Could she have done more on \u201cLittle Accidents\u201d? Her male counterparts were often allowed reshoots. Somehow, for them, \u201cthe money was found.\u201dShe asked herself, \u201cWhat kind of leader do you have to be to get those things? Is it charisma? Is it truly gender?\u201dShe was buoyed when Israeli producers asked her to adapt an acclaimed, female-driven foreign drama. (They declined to reveal it.) Ms. Colangelo worked on the script for months and finally signed a deal at the end of the year.\u201cThere\u2019s this feeling that the industry sometimes gives you, that you have this window of opportunity after Sundance and if you don\u2019t perform perfectly in that moment or have a perfect script, then the window shuts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a dangerous way to think about it.\u201dMomentum, she discovered, can rebound. \u201cAnd it\u2019s O.K. to retrieve it and find it later.\u201dShe knew that breakout success was rare and that her route would be tough, especially without superlative reviews.A month later, she did her water bottle week in Los Angeles. \u201cIt felt like \u2018The Amazing Race,\u2019\u201d she said, eight meetings a day. Little came of them.\u201cHellion,\u201d starring Aaron Paul of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d opened in theaters five months later, and Ms. Candler hit the road to promote it. Live Q. and A.s, Skype sessions \u2014 \u201cAnytime anybody asked, it was a yes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was exhausting, after a while. I wish someone had warned me.\u201dHer promotion helped, but not much; \u201cHellion\u201d just did not have the marketing dollars. In retrospect, she said, her efforts distracted her from \u201cputting all the pieces for another project together.\u201dBut she was halfway into a 12-month mentorship program, sponsored by the Sundance women\u2019s filmmaking initiative. \u201cThe life coach was pretty transformative,\u201d she said. She shelved her jealousy about others\u2019 deals. \u201cI can go write for four hours and feel a sense of accomplishment,\u201d she said.\u201cSometimes you just wonder, how much harder do I have to work to prove myself?\u201d Ms. Candler said. Her life coach offered a mantra: You belong in the room. So at every meeting, she said, \u201cI tell myself, \u2018You\u2019ve earned your space.\u2019\u201dIn the summer, she shot a campaign for Canon. Besides money from teaching a college class, it was her first real paycheck in years. Still, she worried about car insurance payments and other bills.A turning point came in the spring, when she shot two episodes of \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d the series created by Ava DuVernay that employs only female directors. No pitch meetings were necessary; they knew each other through the festival circuit.The paucity of female directors has been a hot topic in Hollywood, but Ms. Candler was over it. \u201cJust hire,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t that hard.\u201dMs. Candler went on to shoot episodes of other series. She has work lined up through 2018.She felt confident before \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that people had confidence in us. Ava legitimized all of us.\u201dAfter 17 years in the field, she said, she was at last making a living as a filmmaker.Advertisement"}

But in the end, he said, \u201cwe got a deal done.\u201dThe company\u2019s partnerships with cable and cellphone operators worldwide give it almost instantaneous access to potential new users without having to spend a fortune on advertising and distribution deals in markets where its brand and content are often still relatively unknown.This growing symbiotic relationship will take center stage on Monday when Reed Hastings, the company\u2019s chief executive, gives the keynote address on the first day of the Mobile World Congress. The conference is an annual trade show in Barcelona, Spain, where executives from across the telecom, media and technology worlds gather to meet and, potentially, sign new deals.Mr. Hastings\u2019s headline act \u2014 part sales pitch, part industry update \u2014 comes as Netflix\u2019s attention has increasingly turned to its overseas subscribers.The Orange deal, one of Netflix\u2019s first international partnerships, is a case in point.But the talks were not all smooth sailing.Along with the typical back-and-forth about how much revenue each side would receive from the deal, Orange was concerned that Netflix, whose European headquarters are in Amsterdam, had not signed on to French rules requiring online video distributors to fund local-language content.St\u00e9phane Richard, the company\u2019s chief executive, also had said he would not work with Netflix, fearful that Orange would become a \u201cTrojan horse,\u201d potentially helping the streaming service gain a global following, only to then cast Orange aside.But for cable and cellphone companies from Bulgaria to Bolivia, the calculation is simple. Though many of them initially resisted such deals with online content providers, gaining access to Netflix\u2019s exclusive programming helps set them apart from local rivals, just as customers\u2019 online habits have shifted toward video, particularly on their smartphones and other mobile devices.\u201cNetflix wants to be exposed to as many people as it can,\u201d said Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders Analysis, a media and telecom industry research company in London. \u201cTelecom operators want to keep people inside their walls, so they are willing to let Netflix in.\u201dNetflix\u2019s American revenue, $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, still constitutes a majority of its sales. But after a somewhat stuttering start to its global expansion, its international revenue is quickly catching up, hitting almost a billion dollars in the three months through December.Even Netflix\u2019s senior executives equate much of that growth to the company\u2019s strengthened ties with cable and cellphone operators around the globe.Such bonhomie between Netflix and carriers is a relatively recent phenomenon, and there are still teething pains whenever the company wades into international markets.Overseas, Sky, the British content and cable provider, has refused to include Netflix on its own set-top box, primarily because it views the streaming service as a direct competitor to its own original programming.Analysts say many operators, even those that have signed partnership deals, still fret that Netflix \u2014 alongside other American tech giants like Google and Facebook \u2014 will benefit more from these relationships than they will. Avid television watchers, for instance, have invested emotional capital into popular Netflix shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cNarcos,\u201d and often view their cable provider as a mere conduit to watching such digital content.\u201cNetflix\u2019s exclusive shows are dominating people\u2019s water cooler moments,\u201d said Tony Gunnarsson, a senior analyst at Ovum, a technology research firm, in London. \u201cConsumers are already watching Netflix, so it\u2019s better for operators to add Netflix to their services or people will go elsewhere.\u201dFor Bob Greene, managing director of online entertainment at Liberty Global, a cable giant controlled by the billionaire John C. Malone, his relationship with Netflix is rooted in the new realities of how people watch content online.At first, Mr. Greene said, Liberty Global limited the partnership to Britain, including the Netflix app on its cable service but keeping billing separate. (It takes an undisclosed of percentage of revenue from its subscribers signing up to Netflix.)Yet as Liberty Global crunched the numbers, it realized that its British customers who watched Netflix were less likely to jump to rival products and showed more loyalty to its own services.\u201cIf our customers want Netflix and we don\u2019t offer it, they\u2019ll find another way to get it,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cWe\u2019re better off if they don\u2019t have to go elsewhere to find what they want.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Rather than grow bitter and have affairs, Sheila sips human smoothies and gets happier.

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018The OA\u2019 and the Transformative Power of Dance", "Date": "2017-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven more than dialogue, this story reveals itself through movement \u2014 five movements, to be exact. When executed in unison by five people, these actions have the power to liberate the body. They bring a dead man back to life. And they create the ability to open the door to another dimension.For a group of characters imprisoned behind glass in an underground laboratory, the movements, which they discover over time, are their only chance for escape. Their captor, a scientist, has chosen them because they survived near-death experiences.It\u2019s true that \u201cThe OA\u201d requires patience (the movements don\u2019t even appear until midway through) and a boundless suspension of disbelief, but it puts across an eerily poetic idea: that movement, or dance, heals if it is performed with the right effort and intensity.Brit Marling, who stars in \u201cThe OA\u201d and created it with Zal Batmanglij, said in an interview that violence has often been used as a way to wake up an audience. They wanted to try something else. \u201cWe started to ask ourselves, is there something else that was also uniquely cinematic that could be a kind of antidote to violence or that could be an expression that could similarly shock or to awaken that would be a counterbalance?\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why the idea of using movement as a language started to percolate.\u201dJerky and askew, yet primal, the five moments, or dance phrases, create a sense of order and ritual: A hand, positioned like a triangle and pressed against the chest, pushes forward. Fingers wiggle out like tentacles. Both arms stretch out for a moment like wings, and then the elbows pull in sharply and the chin lifts to reveal the face. As abstract as it is, the choreography builds emotion through repetition and allows sensation rather than words to guide the story.\u201cI didn\u2019t want it to become this postmodern contemporary dance routine that made no sense,\u201d said Mr. Heffington, who has known the show\u2019s creators for 15 years and worked on their 2013 film \u201cThe East.\u201d On \u201cThe OA,\u201d he said, the characters perform the movements \u201ceye to eye, breath to breath, face to face \u2014 that feels so real.\u201d\u201cZal and I are real believers in practice, and that\u2019s an aspect of the story,\u201d Ms. Marling said. \u201cWhat about it taking a long time to get good at something and the investment of time being part of the reward?\u201dMr. Heffington\u2019s choreography is complex \u2014 for its precision, speed and timing \u2014 so the cast needed to be drilled incessantly. \u201cWhat is so impressive is the effort,\u201d Mr. Heffington said. \u201cYou see it on camera, you see it in their faces, you see it in their bodies. They go to the extreme.\u201dFor a long time, Ms. Marling said, the script would simply say in capital letters: \u201cAnd then they do the movements here.\u201d As to what that meant, she and Mr. Batmanglij agreed that instead of anything resembling formal dance, it would be \u201ckind of impolite and raw, mixing the mundane and the extraordinary.\u201dIt makes sense that the work of the choreographer Elizabeth Streb, who refers to herself as an action architect, came up at writers\u2019 meetings. Ms. Streb\u2019s dance experiments are daring and acrobatic: Imagine a swan dive from a platform 25 feet in the air and a face-first landing.\u201cShe calls her dancers action heroes,\u201d Ms. Marling said. \u201cThat seemed close to me to the inherent risk and danger in standing up to fear and moving differently in the face of it.\u201dMs. Marling said she had some experience dancing while growing up but never trained seriously; practicing the movements, for her, was an extraordinary experience. \u201cI would feel this kind of alertness in all of my senses and some kind of radical aliveness,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a return to the present tense rather than thoughts of the future and doubts about the future or traps to the past.\u201dWhen she and Emory Cohen, who plays Homer Roberts, another prisoner, were learning the choreography, they faced the mirror to learn how to move in sync. They attained accuracy, but something was missing. One day, Denna Thomsen, who works with Mr. Heffington, told them to ignore the mirror and to perform for each other. \u201cThe movements became so possessed of narrative and story and a deep need to communicate that it became quite literally a language,\u201d Ms. Marling said. \u201cIt was so intense and so full of feeling that we actually had to stop doing it until we were on set. It was unsustainable.\u201dBefore shooting, the crew didn\u2019t know what the movements would look like. Of her first scene performing them with Mr. Cohen, Ms. Marling said: \u201cEverything fell away. We were just two people stuck in our bodies, wanting to break all constraints, wanting to tell each other complex things about need and betrayal and loss and love and only having these movements with which to do it. It touched something so sublime.\u201dCan dance change lives? In \u201cThe OA,\u201d it does. \u201cWhen people say, \u2018I was crying when I was watching it,\u2019 it\u2019s like, exactly,\u201d Mr. Heffington said. \u201cThat is exactly what dance has the power to do. Whether or not it\u2019s true \u2014 which I think is a beautiful question in the series \u2014 I know that it can heal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His joke, he said, reflected a deeper frustration.\u201cAs a black man, Black Lives Matter is sort of important to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Trump supporters aren\u2019t known for their fondness of that movement.\u201dHe said he was open to living with anyone, but added that the pool of potential roommates who share his political beliefs was small.\u201cD.C. is a small town,\u201d Mr. Lyle said. \u201cRepublican D.C. is a smaller town, and conservative Republican D.C. is tiny.\u201dMr. Lyle, 27, a former intern with the conservative Heritage Foundation, is for the moment staying in the think tank\u2019s intern residence.

{"Headline": "Oscar-Nominated Movies, Sometimes Streaming Near You", "Date": "2017-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingOne common complaint about the Oscars addresses the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 perceived tendency to honor movies that ostensibly no one has seen. In some cases, the complainants are talking about prestige films that didn\u2019t do a lot at the box office. A couple of months ago, I was listening to a podcast featuring two of the West Coast\u2019s more colorful Oscar commentators, and one of them excitedly put \u201cLa La Land\u201d in the category of films no one has seen. At the time, the movie, a critical favorite among festivalgoers, had not yet been released. Oscar commentators can be very silly people.\u201cLa La Land\u201d has since gone into something like wide release \u2014 it\u2019s in about 2,000 theaters, about half the number that super-wide releases will be in at the height of their glory \u2014 and is doing well enough that you can say some people have seen it, and now that it has garnered 14 Oscar nominations, more people will.This year, streaming video services are beginning to change how Oscar-nominated movies are seen, for one very simple reason: These services are financing, producing and distributing movies they hope will win Oscars. \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d distributed by Amazon Studios, landed six nominations, including for best picture. While it\u2019s still playing in theaters (a little over 500, as of this writing), it will hit video on demand and be available for download for a fee from Amazon and other services, including FandangoNow, in early February. It will start streaming on Amazon in May, when it will be free for Prime members.Right now, one of the five nominees for best documentary, Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201c13th,\u201d is on Netflix, the company that produced the movie. One of this year\u2019s other best documentary nominees, \u201cO.J.: Made in America,\u201d in fact, aired as a television mini-series after a brief theatrical qualifying run, and has been available on demand since it first ran on ESPN.Of the other nominees for best picture besides \u201cManchester,\u201d only the crime thriller \u201cHell or High Water\u201d (which also drew a best supporting actor nod for Jeff Bridges and an original screenplay one for Taylor Sheridan) can be seen on YouTube, Amazon Video, iTunes, Vudu and Google Play at prices from $2.99 to $14.99 depending on the rent-buy option you choose. Viggo Mortensen\u2019s nominated leading-man turn in the hippie-family tear-jerker \u201cCaptain Fantastic\u201d can also be viewed via those services. So, too, can one of the more distinctive of the best animated feature nominees, \u201cKubo and the Two Strings.\u201dMeryl Streep in the title role of the tragicomic biopic \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d can be seen via all the same services save Amazon. Another best actress nominee, Ruth Negga, was recognized for her work in the fact-based civil rights drama \u201cLoving\u201d; that picture can be seen for a fee on Vudu, Amazon and iTunes. Michael Shannon was considered a surprise in the best supporting actor category for his work in \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d; the movie is not coming to streaming as such, but it will debut on demand on Feb. 21, the same day the Blu-ray and DVD package, which includes access to a digital download, comes out.I was actually a little surprised, looking at the home pages of several streaming services on Tuesday, when the nominations were announced, to not see much in the way of Oscar promotion. However many viewers tune in on the big night or not, the Oscars are an arguably potent form of clickbait, and even if major nominated films haven\u2019t made it to streaming yet, the services themselves teem with work by the nominees.The Greek cinematic provocateur Yorgos Lanthimos earned a screenplay nomination for \u201cThe Lobster\u201d (available on Amazon Video); his discomfiting earlier features \u201cDogtooth\u201d and \u201cAlps\u201d are on Fandor, a conscientious cinephile site that gives Amazon Prime users a free trial. \u201cMedicine for Melancholy,\u201d the first feature by Barry Jenkins, whose haunting \u201cMoonlight\u201d garnered eight nominations, including best picture and director, is on iTunes and Amazon. Given that \u201cMoonlight\u201d is just Mr. Jenkins\u2019s second feature, there\u2019s not much of a remove between the films.Similarly, one can view all of the previous features of Damien Chazelle, the director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d via Amazon Prime. Fandor has his \u201cGuy and Madeline on a Park Bench\u201d (2009), while Prime carries \u201cWhiplash\u201d (2014). For good measure, on Amazon there\u2019s also another music-themed picture for which Chazelle wrote the screenplay, the 2013 novelty thriller \u201cGrand Piano.\u201d (Amazon has \u201cThe Last Exorcism 2,\u201d which was partly written by Mr. Chazelle; he is also one of five credited screenwriters on the more respectable horror movie \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d for rent or purchase on major sites.)Finally, a warning: Be on the lookout for purveyors of pirated content who piggyback on legitimate services like Vimeo. For example, in my searches I came across results saying the animated film \u201cTrolls\u201d (yes, it has an Oscar nominee for best song: Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling!\u201d) and \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d were streaming in full on the aforementioned site. But they are not. (And \u201cAnimals\u201d has since been removed.) Once you hit play and the studio logo comes up, you are asked to \u201cregister\u201d and log in with a separate \u201cservice.\u201d I declined to do this, and I would advise you to do the same.An earlier version of this article misstated the format in which \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d will be released in February. It will be available for download for a fee. It will not begin streaming until May on Amazon. The article also misstated the date that \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d will debut on demand. It is Feb. 21, not earlier in the month.Advertisement"}

Apple, the richest company in technology, is finally moving into original video content.Apple said Monday night that it would introduce its first two television-style video series on Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, in the spring.Other original videos, including scripted dramas, are planned over the next year as Apple tries to build Apple Music into a cultural platform, said Jimmy Iovine, who heads the $10-a-month service.\u201cThere are a bunch of projects.

There are no obvious heroes or villains and no clear quest for the main character beyond figuring out who he is.\u201cWe want to be very, very different,\u201d Ms. Donner said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that anybody would watch \u2018Legion\u2019 and go, \u2018Ugh, I saw that already.\u2019\u201dMore than 20 years ago, Ms. Donner (who has also produced films like \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d and \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d) optioned the rights for X-Men. That deal, she said, contained \u201cthe whole toy chest,\u201d with more than 100 characters.There have since been two trilogies of \u201cX-Men\u201d movies, three Wolverine films (including \u201cLogan,\u201d this March) and \u201cDeadpool\u201d released by Fox \u2014 not to mention a superhero resurgence led by Marvel\u2019s films and shows, DC\u2019s new movies and its interconnected CW programs, among many others.Mr. Hawley was ambivalent at first when asked if he was interested in doing his own X-Men series.In a typical TV adaptation of a comic, Mr. Hawley said, \u201cThey say, \u2018Let\u2019s take Issues 113 through 120 and call that Season 1.\u2019\u201dHe added, \u201cYou can never really deliver the exact story that people read and loved, so you\u2019re setting yourself up for disappointment.\u201dThough Ms. Donner and her colleagues approached Mr. Hawley with some specific X-pitches (they declined to describe them), Mr. Hawley said he instead wanted to tell \u201ca more existential story \u2014 what is it really like to have these abilities?\u201dThat led them to the character of Legion, introduced in the comics in the 1980s as the son of Professor X and a powerful mutant with a multiple-personality disorder.The premise was grounded enough in the world of the X-Men, while focusing on a character who is never entirely sure of his perceptions of reality, allowing Mr. Hawley to establish a heightened, dreamlike aesthetic that recalls shows like \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and \u201cHannibal.\u201dMr. Stevens, a star of \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d said he is often asked if he might play a superhero character \u2014 \u201cWhen are you going to put on a cape and do a thing?\u201d he said \u2014 and taking on a comic-book series without wearing tights or spandex felt oddly liberating.The depiction on \u201cLegion\u201d of a character with a possible mental illness was unlike any Mr. Stevens said he had seen before. \u201cPeople always assume that madness is, you\u2019re in one mode that is normal, quote-unquote, and then everything else is craaaaazy,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s all very neatly flagged.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t see it like that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has to be present for all the possible realities that are occurring around him.\u201dNot that Mr. Stevens could offer his co-stars (who include Rachel Keller, Aubrey Plaza and Jean Smart) deeper insight about Mr. Hawley\u2019s recursive story line, which revisits and rewrites its own history.\u201cA lot of the other cast members were looking to me like, \u2018You\u2019ve been to the mountaintop \u2014 what did the prophet say?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly in those first few episodes, David\u2019s not supposed to know what the hell is going on. I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m just David, let me do my thing.\u2019\u201dMarvel, which is also a producer on \u201cLegion,\u201d acknowledged that it took a more abstract, elusive approach to storytelling than is seen on, say, its Netflix shows or ABC\u2019s \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,\u201d but welcomed Mr. Hawley\u2019s vision.\u201cOur name is on it, but we want all of our shows to have a different flavor to them,\u201d said Jeph Loeb, Marvel\u2019s head of television.\u201cLegion\u201d also allows Mr. Hawley the flexibility to create his own characters.Knowing, for example, that he would need a mutant who could take David back into his own memories, Mr. Hawley said, \u201cYou often get into trouble when you take an existing character and want to use it in an unorthodox way.\u201cRather than search the X-Men canon to see if there was such a thing, I just invented a character that allowed me the freedom to do whatever I needed to do.\u201dMr. Hawley was intentionally vague about whether \u201cLegion\u201d would ever connect directly with the \u201cX-Men\u201d movies.He compared the show to his \u201cFargo\u201d series, which only gradually introduced elements from the film, after viewers had seen several episodes focused on an original story. (Marvel\u2019s Mr. Loeb said simply, \u201cStay tuned.\u201d)The Fox network has already ordered its own series pilot set in the world of X-Men\u2019s mutants (written by Matt Nix, the creator of \u201cBurn Notice,\u201d and directed by Bryan Singer), and Marvel hopes to create more shows for FX.Mr. Hawley said his own abilities are already taxed to their maximum.

But there was also far too strong a whiff of the work of Demna Gvasalia, the designer of Vetements and Balenciaga, down to their shared stylist.Or that fantasy could be into full-on fantasia. That was the journey Mary Katrantzou made. She began her fall collection looking at the tough, determined dames of 1940s film noir \u2014 femme fatales who lent their small-waisted silhouettes to the collection \u2014 but finished it with Disney\u2019s 1940 classic \u201cFantasia\u201d: same period, different outlook, a switch flipped from black-and-white to Technicolor.Ms. Katrantzou worked with Disney to borrow motifs from the film, poring over stills until she found what suited her honeyed world. A coquettish \u201ccentaurette,\u201d her tail braided by cherubs, was printed on a double-breasted velvet suit, piling richness on richness. It didn\u2019t let up. Though there were wonders throughout \u2014 layers of lace, tulle, beading and gems \u2014 they threatened to overwhelm wearer and spectator alike. The mix worked best when Ms. Katrantzou let her wild creations breathe a bit, as when a simple sweater set off the wild splendor of a bead-fringed \u201cFantasia\u201d-floral skirt.Richness reigned on Erdem Moralioglu\u2019s runway, too, which married the sumptuousness of Ottoman dress, its rich fabrics and gilded details, with a daintier, English prettiness. He, too, had started with film: Alain Robbe-Grillet\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Immortelle\u201d from 1963, about the culture clash of a foreign man adrift in Istanbul.But, as is often the case with designers, you shall know them by their Netflix queues.It had been much the same over the weekend, when Gareth Pugh said that his dark, menacing show on Saturday night \u2014 a depiction of a world \u201con the precipice of anarchy,\u201d with specific reference to Mr. Trump \u2014 had been informed by film: the twin phantoms of Bob Fosse\u2019s \u201cCabaret\u201d and Liliana Cavani\u2019s \u201cThe Night Porter,\u201d about the looming specter and the brutal reality and aftermath of World War II.On Monday, Mr. Moralioglu found himself thinking of his own story. Half English and half Turkish (though raised in Canada), he imagined a meeting between his great-grandmothers, whom he never knew: one from Britain, one from Turkey near the Syrian border.He brought them together in dresses that spliced English florals and the suggestion of tartan, with the cut and shape of dresses borrowed from Ottoman paintings. In a ribbon-bound booklet put on every seat, Mr. Moralioglu left a small record of his inspirations, including a painting of a dervish midspin, skirts flying. That silhouette was reflected on the runway in long dresses with slim bodices and long, swishing skirts, a proportion that may be challenging to any woman who is shorter than runway-standard.But even in its past-looking escapism, the collection was charged by the politicized present. Disputes about which influences from abroad are allowed in and which are barred \u2014 from Britain, from the United States and from the West \u2014 are enough to send concerned citizens shouting in the streets. Mr. Moralioglu didn\u2019t deny that aspect, either.\u201cOf course, we live in this strange time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of reflecting on my background: It felt like the right time to do that. I\u2019m the product of two people from two very different countries, and I felt like the collection should be a celebration of that. Now more than ever, maybe that\u2019s kind of interesting.\u201dIt may be that sweet, frothy luxury of the sort in which Mr. Moralioglu specializes feels like folly at the moment. Or it may be that, as grimness creeps in, celebration is a strong defense, and living well and beautifully, the best revenge.78 PhotosAfter last season, which seemed more dutiful than heartfelt, Mr. Bailey\u2019s belief was on clear display, but the collection wasn\u2019t entirely convincing. Mr. Moore\u2019s take on the human form was incisive and questioning but not necessarily flattering. Mr. Bailey\u2019s interpretation of it \u2014 yanking garments off their usual axes to mimic the sculpted forms, and exaggerating and amplifying certain areas (especially the shoulders) at the expense of others \u2014 wasn\u2019t always, either. Much of the collection felt overdesigned.Maybe the bolder gestures will be toned down at the Burberry shops, where this collection is available immediately. Or maybe its true heart is the all-or-nothing commitment of the custom cape on every one of its 78 models as they closed the show, which seemed to span history, from medieval armor to Elizabeth ruffs, and every conceivable or inconceivable material (one was cobbled together from a dismantled vintage chandelier). They will be made to order for any customer who wants one.Say this for Burberry: Mr. Bailey showed his heart and his seams. They sliced through the collection, from tops to brogues. \u201cIt was very much about the work in process,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked very closely with the foundation on how Henry Moore worked, not just the beautiful finished pieces.\u201dBut then, Mr. Kane has always had a mad-science streak. It was what led him to court beauty on one hand (here, he reworked a French silk damask dating to 1750) and subvert it on the other. He laughed at his own attraction to grease and grime, which led him to foil a cashmere dress to resemble an oil slick, \u201cdestroying it and making it even more expensive.\u201d Along the way there were holograms and Velcro, sponge-lined stilettos and fur-trimmed Crocs. By the end, as if by scientific experiment, he had coaxed glittering flowers more vivid than natural into bloom.The collection was odd and otherworldly, with the kind of creative fantasy and head-scratching discoveries that Mr. Kane seems uniquely qualified to provide. And if he has doubled down on anything, it is his commitment to provide them.\u201cWe always look back,\u201d Mr. Kane said, \u201cand this season we didn\u2019t look back. We didn\u2019t look at any archive. We didn\u2019t look at anything we\u2019ve done before. I just sat down and drew, drew, drew.\u201dslide showslide showslide showslide showAdvertisement"}

FX also broadcasts \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d (both products from Mr. Murphy) and \u201cFargo.\u201dThe Charles and Diana season of \u201cFeud\u201d will not begin until next year, the network said, which means Mr. Murphy has a remarkably busy stretch ahead of him, even by the standards of TV\u2019s busiest producers.Mr. Murphy has said that the fourth season of the show \u2014 which is still a year away from a second season \u2014 will be about Monica Lewinsky and the Clinton White House.Mr. Murphy is also at work on the next season of \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d which he said would be inspired by the 2016 presidential election.A Charles and Diana plotline for \u201cFeud\u201d means that FX will feature another dramatization of a tabloid news favorite, like the O.J. Simpson case, from a couple of decades ago. And if FX winds up showing it in 2018, the series will surely leapfrog a Princess Diana plotline from Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d a Golden Globe-winning drama about the life of Queen Elizabeth. The second season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d which is expected to premiere later this year, will take place during the 1960s.It was also not long ago that FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, was critical of a trend that Netflix popularized: ordering second seasons of shows that have not even been shown yet.\u201cJust because a programmer, who wishes to look infallible, proclaims every one of its shows a success doesn\u2019t make it true,\u201d Mr. Landgraf said in August 2015. \u201cThe fact that a second season of a show gets ordered before the first season has even premiered says nothing about how many people are watching it or how good they think it is.\u201dFX and Mr. Murphy have been fans of expanding limited series in TV for more than a year. The limited time commitment enables networks to tap movie talent that would turn down longer TV projects. In the first season of \u201cFeud,\u201d for instance, Susan Sarandon plays Bette Davis and Jessica Lange stars as Joan Crawford. Likewise, HBO\u2019s current seven-episode series, \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d is brimming with top Hollywood talent \u2014 including Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Alexander Skarsgard.No casting decisions were announced for the second season of \u201cFeud.\u201dFX\u2019s executives and Mr. Murphy have also argued that at a time when there is more scripted TV than ever \u2014 more than 450 such shows were broadcast in 2016 \u2014 shorter series of seven to 10 episodes make it easier to draw in viewers.All they have to do now is start showing them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Nicole Kidman Puts Women First in Hollywood", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "With her production company and her new HBO show, \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Ms. Kidman is helping to ensure that complicated stories about women reach the screen.Supported byThe subject was \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d the seven-episode series that she co-produced (and stars in) with Reese Witherspoon and that will begin airing on HBO on Sunday, Feb. 19. Based on the best-selling book by Liane Moriarty, the series features five women \u2014 the other three are played by Shailene Woodley, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern \u2014 in an upscale part of Monterey, Calif., that lends itself to social satire. As the story opens, parental warfare is threatening to break out following an unpleasant incident at the local elementary school.First on the agenda: how to market \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d to reflect the humor, but also the serious drama and frothy melodrama.Ms. Kidman said she wanted to ensure that domestic violence, perhaps the story\u2019s darkest theme (unless you count homicide) received proper public attention and was not overshadowed by the outr\u00e9 histrionics. \u201cWe want to navigate it properly and to instigate some discussion about it around the show,\u201d she said.Len Amato, president of HBO Films, said it was tricky to get the right balance. \u201cIf you only see a small bit of it, it could be really reductive.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 here. Nothing against \u2018Desperate Housewives,\u2019 but that wasn\u2019t the focal point of why people wanted to make the series.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to shape my career in terms of being able to find things that I may not get offered, that I wouldn\u2019t get the opportunity for,\u201d Ms. Kidman said in an interview after the meeting.On this Monday in January, Ms. Kidman commanded the room, though she was relaxed, and at times playful (introducing her producing partner, Per Saari, she said the two are so close that \u201cwe\u2019ve been married for 14 years\u201d). Wearing navy tailored trousers and a crisp white shirt, she seemed taller in person, her Australian accent all the more striking because her non-Australian accents in her work are so familiar.She said she has no real career plan, other than gravitating toward material that interests her, and seeking out writers and directors who are talented but unknown. Blossom commissions scripts out of pocket, to minimize what Ms. Kidman called in an email \u201cthe red tape.\u201d She continues to act in projects she doesn\u2019t produce, and vice versa. \u201cI\u2019m only going for the things that I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise I can sit at home in Nashville and take care of my children\u201d \u2014 referring to her two young daughters with her husband, the country singer Keith Urban \u2014 \u201cand be very happy.\u201dLast year, she shot \u201cThe Beguiled,\u201d a Civil War-era film set in Virginia directed by Sofia Coppola, and \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer,\u201d the latest film, now in postproduction, from Yorgos Lanthimos, who directed \u201cThe Lobster.\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a very safe place in my life right now, a place of feeling far more comfortable with myself so that I can be more extroverted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also means that I can work with people I like.\u201dIt makes sense that \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d became a series on HBO rather than a feature film at a major studio. As superhero and other tentpole movies dominate the release schedules of the major studios, even bona fide movie stars like Natalie Portman, Daniel Craig and Bradley Cooper are bringing their projects to places like HBO, Showtime, Amazon and Netflix.\u201cThere\u2019s not as much of a separation anymore,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a bigger pool to work in, the talent base is much broader than it used to be, and it\u2019s become sort of a blur \u2014 what is television, what is a movie?\u201dJust two and a half years elapsed between conception to finished project. In the spring of 2014, Bruna Pappandrea, Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s former partner in her production company (Pacific Standard), who is also friends with Ms. Kidman, read a galley of \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d thought it was great and called Ms. Witherspoon, who was in New Orleans shooting \u201cHot Pursuit.\u201d Entranced by the book, Ms. Witherspoon got Ms. Kidman, an old friend, to read it, too.Ms. Kidman said she was drawn in by the many moods of the book, by its strong female characters, and that \u201cas much as it\u2019s about women who are feuding, who are trying to destroy one another, it\u2019s also about friendships.\u201d (The character she plays, Celeste, seems to have a perfect life, including a hunky younger husband played by Alexander Skarsgard, but it\u2019s a facade that begins to peel away as the series goes on.)She called Ms. Witherspoon back. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m in if you\u2019re in,\u2019\u201d Ms. Kidman recalled. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018I\u2019m in. Now all we have to do is get it.\u2019\u201d That meant persuading the author, Ms. Moriarty, at home in Australia, to sell them the exclusive rights.Ms. Kidman was on her way there for a vacation, and she and Ms. Moriarty met in a coffee shop in Sydney. Ms. Moriarty said she had not expected much from the meeting. \u201cI\u2019ve had other books optioned before, and other authors have said, \u2018Never get too excited until the day they start shooting,\u2019\u201d she said by telephone. \u201cAnd Nicole said, \u2018If I option it, get excited because I don\u2019t just option things for the sake of it.\u2019\u201dMs. Witherspoon then enlisted Jean-Marc Vallee, who directed Ms. Witherspoon in \u201cWild\u201d \u2014 \u201cAnd then Reese sends Jean-Marc an email,\u2019\u201d is how Ms. Kidman described it \u2014 and the two women then hired David E. Kelley (\u201cAlly McBeal,\u201d \u201cThe Practice\u201d) to write the screenplay.What ensued was a burst of all-female networking activity that Ms. Kidman compared to the way the A-list friends from the \u201cOcean\u2019s 11\u201d films conduct their business. She and Ms. Witherspoon began working the phones. \u201cReese and I were like, \u2018\u201cO.K., let\u2019s go for it,\u2019 and suddenly Shay was in\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s Ms. Woodley \u2014 \u201cand she signs on because Laura Dern, who\u2019s one of her best friends, goes, \u2018I\u2019m in and I\u2019ll talk to Shay,\u201d Ms. Kidman said.With HBO, Ms. Kidman is also working on the dramatization of another novel she optioned, \u201cReconstructing Amelia,\u201d about a mother who sets out to find out why her daughter committed suicide. (Naomi Watts is in discussions to play the main character, Mr. Amato said.) Ms. Kidman said she feels intuitively that this one ought to be a film, rather than a limited series, which appears to be fine with HBO. \u201cIt\u2019s delicate, the balance, how you make these things,\u201d Ms. Kidman said, of the decision to embark on a series or a feature.Mr. Amato\u2019s job means that he meets a great many people pitching their projects. Many actors have production companies, or wish they had production companies, but their levels of commitment and engagement vary wildly, he said.\u201cNot all big stars are as in the weeds as Nicole and Reese are on \u2018Big Little Lies,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual when you have a megastar who\u2019s also a producer sitting around the table doing their homework. It\u2019s meaningful when it comes from people who found the project, who put all the elements together and who are also going to put themselves on the line as actors.\u201dThe two women\u2019s involvement included making decisions about locations and budgets, helping shape character arcs and taking part in script meetings. \u201cWe got to put loads of ideas on the table,\u201d Ms. Kidman said. \u201cAs an actor, you don\u2019t get to do that, but as a producer you have to be there.\u201d\u201cDid you option that?\u201d Mr. Amato asked.\u201cYes, we\u2019ve got a script, and it\u2019s out with a director,\u201d Ms. Kidman responded. She remained mysterious on the subject of where it might end up.Ms. Kidman said that the transformation of television had created a vast menu of possibility for actors, and for producers.\u201cThere are so many great stories out there and so many talented people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe probably would not have been able to do this \u2014 \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 probably wouldn\u2019t have been made \u2014 if it hadn\u2019t been made for TV.\u201dAn article last Sunday about Nicole Kidman referred incorrectly to the film \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d It is a Civil War-era film set in Virginia, not a \u201cCivil War western.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And that is when he nearly had an ending much like that of Oberyn Martell, the character he played on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dWhile crossing the street, he looked left when he should have looked right (classic error of the tourist in London), and a double-decker bus came thisclose.He barely had a moment to compose himself when he was spotted.\u201cPascal Pedro!\u201d said a young man, getting his name almost right. \u201cCan we get a photo?

As he described it, he has gone from decades of anonymity to becoming the \u201caren\u2019t you the guy from \u2026 ?\u201d guy.Soon enough, fans may even get his name right. In addition to his role on \u201cNarcos,\u201d Mr. Pascal appears in \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d a big-budget fantasy filmed mostly in Beijing that will be released in the United States on Feb. 17, after its splashy China debut. He will also have a lead role in the \u201cKingsman\u201d sequel, set for release later this year.After years of making ends meet with TV work and a prolific theater career, Mr. Pascal is not about to waste his chance. \u201cThe smallest of opportunities kept me going,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much so that I resolved to struggle until I couldn\u2019t walk anymore.\u201dAs the actress Sarah Paulson, one of his closest friends, put it: \u201cMost people don\u2019t get to be in their early 40s and have their lives change, workwise, in this business.\u201dThe change in his success means that Mr. Pascal has seen little of his apartment in West Hollywood, Calif., the past few years. He was in Europe for \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Colombia for \u201cNarcos,\u201d China for \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d and London for \u201cKingsman.\u201dAnd that\u2019s what brought him to a shop here on an afternoon before Christmas. He would be flying to Chile the next day to visit his family, and now, with the big paychecks coming in, he could spend a couple of hundred pounds to get Aesop soaps for his brother and adorable pajamas for his sister.\u201cI like to spoil her,\u201d he said, noting that he could never do it before.Mr. Pascal was born in Santiago, Chile, and raised in San Antonio and Orange County, Calif. He grew up dreaming of movies, which did little to help his social life. \u201cI was the one who wouldn\u2019t shut up about \u2018Empire of the Sun,\u2019\u201d he said.His parents fled Chile in the 1970s during the military junta and worked out a life of comfort in the United States. His father was a fertility doctor, and his mother, a former child psychologist, handed him the keys to her Volvo when he turned 16.Mr. Pascal and his sister did not join the rest of the family, sharing a shoe box apartment on Elizabeth Street in Manhattan as he pursued acting work. Theater assignments piled up, as did a few TV roles, including one-offs on \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cTouched by an Angel.\u201d Money was tight. At the Manhattan Theater Club, Mr. Pascal brought in about $515 a week.\u201cThe TV stuff means you\u2019re getting, in about three to eight days of work, more money than an entire run Off Broadway,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even a lot of money. You want \u2018Law & Order\u2019 so badly that you just want to die.\u201dAsked if he was ever typecast as a Latino, he said, \u201cI was desperate to be typecast so I could get a job.\u201d On the stages of New York, he said, he played a series of masculine gay men and vaguely ethnic characters. But breakout roles, both onstage and on television, proved elusive, and there were plenty of times when he was ready to quit.\u201cHe has a rather righteous sense of self,\u201d Ms. Paulson said. \u201cWhen I look back at it now, I do know there was always this voice deep down inside him that said someday he was going to do what he wanted to do in the manner in which he wanted to do it.\u201cBut the more you\u2019re told no, that little voice starts to get quieter and quieter, and it gets further and further away.\u201dThings changed about four years ago, thanks to a bit of hustling.While Mr. Pascal was mentoring a student at the University of Southern California, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was preparing to audition for a role as a late-30-something bisexual Lothario in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The student, in his 20s, was too young for the part, and when Mr. Pascal read the script, he was blown away. The role seemed made for him.He put together an audition tape, which he failed to mention to his younger friend. (For the record, the student, Francisco Garat, said in an interview that he was thrilled for Mr. Pascal\u2019s success.)Mr. Pascal asked Ms. Paulson if she could possibly, maybe pass along the tape to her best friend, Amanda Peet, who is married to the \u201cThrones\u201d co-creator David Benioff. Mr. Benioff, Ms. Peet and the show\u2019s other mastermind, D. B. Weiss, watched Mr. Pascal and the reviews were ecstatic. Ms. Paulson called to tell him.In 2014, Mr. Pascal became a fan favorite on the show as the swaggering Red Viper, a role that ended after one season, when his head was crushed by a character called the Mountain. But Mr. Pascal wasn\u2019t out of work for long. He was quickly cast in \u201cNarcos,\u201d a drama about the Colombian drug trade.When the director Matthew Vaughn was watching \u201cNarcos,\u201d he kept thinking, \u201cWho\u2019s this Burt Reynolds guy?\u201d He asked him to audition for \u201cKingsman,\u201d an action movie he was about to direct. The actor Mr. Vaughn saw before him was shaped by years of obscurity and missed chances.\u201cHe had this swagger and confidence,\u201d Mr. Vaughn said, \u201cbut at the same time such vulnerability of expecting to be rejected.\u201dSoon Mr. Pascal was fighting computer-generated mythical beasts alongside Matt Damon in \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d a Zhang Yimou epic that the Chinese film industry has positioned as a global blockbuster.Early box office returns have fallen short of expectations, but no matter. When Mr. Pascal started to reflect on his sudden star turn, he recalled a moment during his 40th birthday, when he was filming in Beijing.Mr. Damon and a producer asked to have a word with him. For an actor long accustomed to coming up short, it was an unnerving request. As they led him off the set, the cast and crew surrounded him. Next thing he knew, a giant birthday cake was being rolled out and fireworks lit up the sky.\u201cI\u2019m turning 40 and I\u2019m in Beijing,\u201d Mr. Pascal said. \u201cI am absolutely fine with experiencing my birthday anonymously and with a day at work.

{"Headline": "What Does a Diverse Hollywood Look Like? This Brooklyn Film School", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmanda Reyes was auditioning for her umpteenth acting role in New York City recently when the casting director asked her to \u201cbe more ghetto.\u201d It was nothing new. She had worked for several years in Los Angeles, and the acting parts for Latinas were for teenage moms, gang bangers and hustlers \u2014 never the protagonist \u2014 and more often than not, an offensive stereotype.\u201cI go through this almost every audition,\u201d Ms. Reyes, 27, said. \u201cIt beats you down.\u201d So a few years ago, before the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, she decided to take action and study screenwriting close to home, at the University of North Texas in Denton.\u201cI had to see if I could write genuine Latina roles,\u201d she said. She developed a short film, which made it into some small festivals. Then she applied to the new Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema in Brooklyn, which opened its doors a year and a half ago.Feirstein is part of the City University of New York, set on the Steiner Studio lot at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and it is surprisingly under the radar. It costs a third of most other film schools \u2014 $18,400 a year \u2014 and part of its mission is to admit women and minorities whose stories aren\u2019t usually told.If you walk through the classrooms, people of every shade are quietly discussing their schoolwork, hugging friends as they trickle back from winter break, having lunch in the campus commissary.But in those quiet exchanges, and in the work they\u2019re producing, a small army of students \u2014 African-American, Asian, Middle Eastern, Latino, East Asian, women and, yes, even some white men, including at least one with a man bun and beard \u2014 are talking about change.Every few decades, Hollywood gets a reboot. In the 1960s and \u201970s, there was the collapse of the old studio system and the rise of young mavericks like Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg. In the 1990s, there was the independent film revolution led by people like Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino. Thanks to technology and the changing means of distribution, filmmaking is due for another sea change. While more black actors and directors were acknowledged last Sunday at the Academy Awards, with \u201cMoonlight\u201d dramatically winning the Oscar for best picture, there remains a chasm between these few and the thousands of filmmakers and technicians who make the movies and cast their ballots.\u201cHollywood is in crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Wacks, the founding director of Feirstein. With the rise of services like Netflix and Hulu, and the ability to film a movie on an iPhone, \u201cplus the realization that movies don\u2019t have to be confined to the same constituency they\u2019ve always been confined to, white males, there\u2019s really some shift in momentum,\u201d Mr. Wacks said. \u201cSometimes it takes a while to be able to look back and say, in \u201915, \u201916, \u201917, there was this pivotal shift.\u201dBut a shift, as big as continental drift, seems to be happening on the streets of Brooklyn.It\u2019s unfolding on the site of one of the nation\u2019s most historic spots, the Navy Yard \u2014 a place where Revolutionary War prisoners died by the thousands; where ships were engineered and built to battle foes including the Confederates and the Japanese. A place of innovation and invention, where a new kind of battle is being waged.Mr. Wacks said opening the film school experience up to new voices seemed like a natural solution to some of the biggest problems in Hollywood. Right now, Feirstein has 174 students in its program and expects to be granting its first M.F.A. degrees in 2018.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly enough blame to go around about why there aren\u2019t more women and more people of color at the top level of the industry,\u201d said Mr. Wacks, a South African immigrant who produced the cult classic \u201cRepo Man,\u201d directed \u201cPowwow Highway\u201d and ran the highly regarded film program at Emerson College in Boston from 2010 to 2013. \u201cYou also have to recognize that it begins with film school. I\u2019ve been to many film schools where if women were 20 percent of the population, that was a lot.\u201dAt Feirstein, women make up half the student population. And typically underrepresented groups, such as Latinos and African-Americans, make up 45 percent.Annette Insdorf, a film professor at Columbia who ran the undergraduate program there from 1987 to 2014, said she welcomed Feirstein into the mix and was thrilled about having another option for budding filmmakers.\u201cSince Columbia and N.Y.U. are indeed exceedingly expensive, Feirstein is an alternative, especially for New Yorkers who cannot afford high tuition,\u201d Professor Insdorf said. \u201cSome of our M.F.A. alumni have been hired to teach there. It seems to me like a win-win situation.\u201dShe said that bringing in new and different student voices was one of the solutions to the current lack of diversity in the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s also necessary to the growth of independent filmmaking in New York,\u201d she said.Though the Feirstein tuition is low-budget, the facilities are not. The two-floor campus is state of the art, housed in a rehabbed building once used as Navy headquarters during World War II. There are four sound stages, including one that is 4,000 square feet. No other film school except the University of Southern California has one so large. There is a motion capture studio, a Foley stage to record sound effects, lecture rooms and screening rooms equipped with surround sound and 4K projection (what you see in the movie theater), a render farm for computer animation and an Avid server and software, which allows students and professors to access any part of a film from anywhere at anytime. No need to transfer or download huge files.Except for four full-time professors, the instructors are adjunct and are very active in the industry. Some also teach at Columbia and N.Y.U.And then there\u2019s the view. Except for the screening rooms and editing studios, which are windowless to avoid interfering light, every room has a sweeping panorama of the Manhattan skyline. Steiner Studios also occupies the floors above and below the film school.\u201cIf you want to be a doctor, you do your internship in a hospital,\u201d Mr. Wacks said. \u201cIf you want to be a filmmaker, you do it on a film lot.\u201dThe film producer Celia Costas, a member of the school\u2019s advisory council, said being on the Steiner lot was one of the most amazing things about the school. Steiner, the largest studio complex outside of Hollywood, produces major films and music videos, among other things, on its 10 soundstages. \u201cBridge of Spies,\u201d \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and episodes of \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d have been filmed on the 580,000 square-foot lot.\u201cThe location is so unique,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re on a campus on a functioning studio, which doesn\u2019t happen anywhere else.\u201d Ms. Costas, who is the executive producer on Mindy Kaling\u2019s new film, said she was talking to Mr. Wacks about using interns from Feirstein once her crew started filming on the Steiner lot.Ms. Costas, who grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, in a Greek family, said she was excited the school was making a career in film possible to people who would normally not have access to it. When she was young, she would go to the movies with her father and search for Greek names in the credits.Ms. Costas started out in the industry as a secretary and fought her way to the top, working as a location manager for \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice,\u201d which was shot in Brooklyn, and eventually worked as executive producer on films like \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d and \u201cThe Intern.\u201d One of the things she loves about Feirstein is its insistence that each student follow one of eight three-year M.F.A. tracks: directing, producing, screenwriting, cinematography, postproduction, scoring, sonic arts, and digital animation and visual affects. (Feirstein also offer a two-year master of arts in screen studies.) Students are then paired to create a thesis project in their third and final year, rather than everyone working on their own.\u201cIt\u2019s very practical,\u201d Ms. Costas said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trade school, but it prepares these kids to work out in the real world. Not everyone is studying to be a director.\u201dMr. Soderbergh, another council member, has been busy trying to secure guest lecturers and helping with curriculum. He didn\u2019t attend film school but was lucky to go to a special high school on the Louisiana State University campus in Baton Rouge, where he embedded himself with the student filmmakers. He thinks one of the great benefits of being in film school, though, is connecting with other filmmakers.\u201cYou need to be part of a gang,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing part of a gang helps you in both a literal and philosophical sense. You can\u2019t exist in this art form totally isolated and alone.\u201d He said being at Feirstein would help students forge connections to last a lifetime. \u201cThe gang I was hanging out with in my day was diverse, but not as diverse as this group,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that alone is worth the price of admission.\u201dOne recent afternoon at Feirstein, a gang seemed to be forming. Though he had seen them around campus before, David Etienne, a first-year screenwriting student, had never before spoken to his fellow students Katherine Tolentino, 27, and Ms. Reyes.Mr. Etienne, 25, who moved to Brooklyn with his family in 2004 from Haiti and attended Brooklyn College as an undergraduate, was talking about making a movie musical based on a recent visit to his old stomping ground, Brooklyn International High School. There were so many kids, he said, who were worried what effect President Trump was going to have on their lives. Would they be deported? Arrested? And he decided he wanted to approach the problem through songs that these kids would sing.Not like \u201cLa La Land,\u201d exactly. \u201cI want it to be as depressing as possible,\u201d Mr. Etienne said with a laugh.\u201cI can write the words,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know anything about writing music.\u201d\u201cDo you know Simon?\u201d Ms. Tolentino asked excitedly. \u201cHe has tons of songs he\u2019s written. He\u2019s really getting into the political scene. He\u2019d be really interested. You have to talk to Simon.\u201dMs. Reyes jumped in and asked Mr. Etienne if he knew Melanie, who could help with mixing.Ms. Tolentino then went on to describe her film idea about parachute kids, troubled Chinese students who are sent to America to study and the challenges they face. Originally from Silicon Valley, Ms. Tolentino is half Chinese and half Latina. She started as an English major and worked a while as a radio broadcaster, earned her masters at Oxford and then freelanced on film crews before landing at Feirstein this year to study film directing. Her main worry about her new project was presenting the Chinese families in the film too harshly.Ms. Reyes, a second-year directing student, nodded in agreement. \u201cThe challenge is not exploiting the family, something I came up against in my own work,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the line between exploration and exploitation? Am I exploiting these people in order to get into festivals?\u201dFeirstein, Ms. Reyes explained, was helping her work through those issues as a filmmaker. Several of her early films deal with the arrest of her brother, who was sentenced to eight years in prison. Her films examine the effect his imprisonment has had on her and her family.With each new incarnation of the story, Ms. Reyes\u2019s narrative has become more and more nuanced, representing a viewpoint not often seen in Hollywood features.Mr. Etienne told Ms. Reyes he admired her for telling a story so close to home. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be put in a box, so I\u2019ve stayed away from writing about what I look like or where I\u2019m from,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you choosing to do it is empowerment. That\u2019s not a box.\u201dMs. Reyes bowed her head for a moment at the compliment, but then laughed out loud. \u201cI\u2019m trying to break down the box and burn it and throw it away!\u201d she shouted. Mr. Etienne and Ms. Tolentino laughed along with her. And when they quieted down, Mr. Etienne turned back to Ms. Reyes and said, \u201cI might have a story for you if you want to direct something.\u201dFeirstein started seven years ago as an idea growing out of the undergraduate film program at Brooklyn College. The project seemed like a good one, and soon a powerful coalition was on board, including Hollywood executives, Mayors Michael R. Bloomberg and Bill de Blasio, a small group of financiers and Doug Steiner, chairman of the Navy Yard studios. The former hedge fund manager Barry Feirstein supplied the initial $5 million and was joined by the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, the State of New York and private donors, all of which eventually raised $30 million for construction and equipment. The borough contributed $1 million. Scholarships were set up, including $10,000 for any thesis project in need, helping to level the playing field between the students with money and those with none.\u201cWe are the first public graduate film school in New York,\u201d Mr. Wacks said, \u201cthe same way California has U.C.L.A. New York didn\u2019t have that before.\u201dThough Mr. Wacks wasn\u2019t in on the original idea, he was hired in 2013 to make it work. He brought in several filmmakers to the board, including his old friend Ethan Hawke and Mr. Soderbergh.Mr. Hawke, who was recently working on a film down the street with Paul Schrader, said he was excited about the student films that would be coming out of Feirstein in the next few years. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so important, giving these kids time to grow and develop their talent,\u201d he said.He had just seen the film \u201cSongs My Brother Taught Me,\u201d about life on an Indian reservation. He said: \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Why do I see so few movies about life on an Indian reservation? There should be tons of them.\u2019 That\u2019s why this place has to succeed. It\u2019s really so important.\u201d He compared what is happening in film now with what happened to writing over a century ago.\u201cBack then only the rich wrote novels,\u201d Mr. Hawke said. \u201cThey were the only ones educated and with access to that kind of life. But slowly, people realized that all you needed was a pen and paper. And the world of ideas got a lot wider because of it. We became more compassionate about other people. Coppola talked about this years ago \u2014 that that same idea was going to happen in cinema someday.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot coming together that\u2019s exciting and transformative,\u201d Ms. Anderson said, \u201cnot just for the lives of the students but also for the cultural landscape.\u201d Hollywood, she said, would change in the next few years. \u201cAnd this,\u201d she added, \u201cis an engine for that transformation.\u201dThough Feirstein is taking a lead in diversity, it still faces hurdles. The school is trying to attract more diverse council members, and it recently reached out to Barry Jenkins, the director of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d and to Ava DuVernay, who directed \u201cSelma\u201d and \u201c13th.\u201d The school is still waiting for them to respond.Mr. Etienne, the student from Haiti, is thrilled to have accomplished filmmakers giving him advice, but said \u201cit\u2019s very disappointing to me that none of those advisory people are people of color.\u201d\u201cAs a young black kid who looks up to many of those filmmakers and actors,\u201d he continued, \u201cit would be a huge deal having a network and getting advice from them.\u201dA few weekends ago, a second-year student at Feirstein was returning from a working trip to Pakistan. Khaula Malik, 30, a budding producer, was visiting Rawalpindi with a fellow student and cinematographer, Alexandra Brown, 26, to shoot a documentary about a group of transgender people working on a campus there. Ms. Malik\u2019s goal was to provide a platform for her real-life characters, Sharmeeli, Bubbly, Ishaa and Diya. \u201cThe government recognizes them as this third gender,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re part of the census.\u201dWhat she encountered on the other end of her trip was a bit more disconcerting. Ms. Malik came through Kennedy International Airport the day that immigrants were being held as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban. Though Pakistan was not part of the ban, Ms. Malik was alarmed. \u201cWe came through a different terminal, but we knew what was going on,\u201d she said. The new climate here has made immigrant stories and viewpoints even more crucial than ever, she said.Though Ms. Malik was born in Pakistan, she is an American citizen who grew up outside Washington \u2014 one with a specific voice, which took a while to be heard. She worked in public relations after college and eventually became a researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.

{"Headline": "When a Teenager\u2019s Coping Mechanism Is SpongeBob", "Date": "2017-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdolescenceParents are often surprised to find that, even late into high school, teenagers return to the books, movies and TV shows they enjoyed when they were younger. When I ask adolescents to share how they like to recharge when feeling stressed, they consistently volunteer that they reread juvenile books like Percy Jackson, rewatch their favorite Disney movies, or mine Netflix for goofy shows like \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants.\u201dAs Samantha Eisner, a 15-year-old student at Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, explained, childhood pleasures offer comfort because \u201cthey take you back to the days when the biggest problem you had was choosing what crayon to color your dress in your third grade self-portrait.\u201dWhen teenagers aren\u2019t revisiting their early days, they sometimes turn to simple or repetitive activities to escape the ever-rising and shifting expectations that come with adolescence. In their efforts to gain a sense or mastery and control, some teenagers will go outside to drop in dozens of layups while others will rearrange their closets for the umpteenth time. \u201cWhen I have really had it,\u201d one adolescent told me, \u201cI rip up a piece of paper and tape it back together again.\u201dBeing a teenager isn\u2019t easy. Thanks to puberty, neurological and hormonal developments introduce teenagers to an era of emotional fragility so it\u2019s no surprise that adolescents find handy, if sometimes quirky, ways to reset when they are feeling overwhelmed.Should parents stand back and admire their teenagers\u2019 inventive coping styles or should they step in with support and guidance? The answer, according to experts, depends on how much control the teenagers have over the source of their stress.According to Michael Lyons, the study\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor of education at the University of Virginia, \u201capproach coping is about trying to change the stressor itself.\u201d For example, a teenager in a fight with a friend might talk with the peer about the conflict or \u201clook to others to find a different way to make sense of the situation.\u201d By contrast, Dr. Lyons notes that teenagers who rely on avoidance coping might instead dodge the friend, or \u201cengage in a negative way, such as gossiping about the peer or ruminating about the problem.\u201dBut what about when teenagers face stressors that defy straightforward solutions, such as unrelenting school or social pressures? In that case, looking at old photos or playing an easy video game might be just what the doctor ordered.Of course, a coping strategy stops being adaptive if it gets in the way of real responsibilities. A teenager in the middle of an unpredictable social drama can easily lose track of time while taking refuge in the known plots and predictable twists of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d reruns. Under these conditions, a parent might gently say something in the spirit of: \u201cI know that what you are doing helps you to relax. Just be careful not to pile on more stress by running out of time to tackle tonight\u2019s homework.\u201dParents can suggest ways for teenagers to regain their equilibrium while being sensitive to the fact that coping strategies tend to be highly personal. When I\u2019ve asked groups of students how they like to rebound from a hard day, it\u2019s not unusual for the bulk of the group to recoil in horror when a peer volunteers that he straightens up his room to feel better. According to Dr. Lyons, these conversations between parent and teenager about coping strategies might be \u201cless about moving a teenager toward one approach and more about walking alongside them to discover what works best.\u201dIt falls to adults to be on the lookout for teenagers who are dealing with stressors far beyond what any adolescent should be expected to handle, such as traumatic events, the death of a loved one or even extraordinary academic pressures. And we should marshal professional support for teenagers who rely on self-destructive tactics, such as abusing substances or harming themselves, to cope with emotional discomfort.But most of the time, parents are helping their teenagers weather the normal trials that come with adolescence. As we take up this day-to-day work, Dr. Compas encourages us to remind teenagers that there are two types of problems: Those we can do something about and those we need to find a way to accept. \u201cThen we can ask our teens,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat do you want to do about the ones you can change, and how are you going to manage the ones you can\u2019t?\u201dParents cannot shield teenagers from ordinary stress, nor should we try to. Yet we can still lend support. According to Dr. Compas, \u201cif parents can guide kids to slow down and simply size up the nature of the stress, that, in and of itself, would help an enormous amount.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of a TV show.

{"Headline": "If These Guys Were Able to Fix Their Lives, You Can, Too", "Date": "2017-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Male AnimalIt was dark when Shay Nartker drove to a quiet spot alongside the Ohio River.Earlier that day, he had met with a friend who had driven down from Columbus, Ohio, to Cincinnati to speak with him about his concerns over what was, or what wasn\u2019t, happening in Mr. Nartker\u2019s life.His friend saw unrealized potential in him. But Mr. Nartker, who was divorced from a woman he had married in his early 20s, was drinking too much, and his diet consisted of the fast food he ate while falling asleep to Netflix. He trudged through his job as a content creator for an eyewear company, doing semi-adequate work.Hours after the talk with his friend, he sat in relative calm on the riverside.\u201cI think it really hit hard for me, that he would take that much time to see me,\u201d Mr. Nartker, now 27, said. \u201cIt was important to sit me down and give me the hard truth, not sugarcoat it, but just say, \u2018Hey, you have to get it back together and pull yourself up.\u2019\u201dTo do so required the small, incremental changes that we often promise to make but never seem to get around to. But there are those who have managed to pull it off, like Mr. Nartker.He soon joined a gym and started exercising up to four times a week. He decided he wouldn\u2019t keep any alcohol in the house and would cut back his drinking to an occasional beer or wine at social events. He stocked his kitchen with fruits and vegetables, and avoided anything with added sugar. Soon the idea of fast food repulsed him.The physical and emotional changes were almost automatic. His weight dropped to 198 pounds from 230. He reconnected with old friends. He had more energy and was more focused in his work. His confidence improved enough that he applied for, and got, a job building promotional content at MadTree Brewing Company.\u201cI had a renewed sense of purpose, because I had finally cut out all the bad stuff,\u201d Mr. Nartker said of the new job. \u201cAnd since I made all those other changes, I had the motivation to push through and go after it. You have to take care of yourself.\u201dUnlike Mr. Nartker, Jamil Muhaisen, 42, didn\u2019t start his self-improvement program from scratch. In 2007, he and his wife, DeeAnne Bullard, left Brooklyn, N.Y., and moved to Austin, Tex., where they became part owners of a successful sandwich shop, Fricano\u2019s Deli & Catering. They had a child and a rewarding life together. All the same, Mr. Muhaisen decided it was time for him \u201cto fix my life,\u201d as he put it.It started with his weight. After watching his wife shed the pounds she had gained during pregnancy, he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a \u201cfat blob.\u201d By limiting his portions and exercising, he dropped to 185 pounds from 215. He found himself more focused at work, with enough energy to tackle various projects he would not have taken on before.\u201cIt just had this snowball effect of confidence and problem solving and self-improvement,\u201d Mr. Muhaisen said.When the deli\u2019s soda fountain broke down, he learned how to build one himself. Then he repaired an industrial-grade toilet. At home, he learned how to repair his washing machine and dishwasher.\u201cI\u2019ve done more fixing and figuring out things on my own after I lost the weight,\u201d Mr. Muhaisen said. \u201cI think I have had more confidence to tackle projects and figure stuff out. We refloored our house Christmas Day a year ago, and I saved thousands of dollars by doing it myself. I never put a floor in before, but I figured it out.\u201d\u201cI always like to be my own boss,\u201d he added. \u201cI guess that\u2019s the same idea, as far as self-improvement \u2014 doing it myself. Self-improvement. Lifestyle improvement. Home improvement. It\u2019s all improvement.\u201dDan Shaver fell into a rut of a different kind in the late 1990s. He was doing well in his job as director of marketing at the Sigma Chi Fraternity headquarters in Evanston, Ill., and had started his own business enforcing trademark rights on the side. But somehow he felt adrift. His personal life needed work.\u201cI was very ambition-focused at that time,\u201d said Mr. Shaver, 46, who now lives outside of San Diego with his wife, Karina, and their two children. \u201cI achieved these things at work. I was probably drinking too much in those days and just had this feeling of, \u2018Is this really what life has in store for me?\u2019 I had this overwhelming feeling that it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201dOne afternoon while in the Uptown neighborhood in Chicago, Mr. Shaver stood staring at a scene outside the bay window of the condominium he and a friend had bought. Children from a nearby housing project had found an old mattress and were using it as a trampoline. He felt envious. These children had found a way to make their own happiness. He needed to do the same.The routine of being there for someone else made a difference. Mr. Shaver noticed that he was changing, that he was more patient with other people. When he met the woman whom he would eventually marry, she could see in him the kind of father he might become someday. Working as a volunteer had revealed something in Mr. Shaver that he may not have realized was there.\u201cI absolutely think you can transform your life though a series of rituals, even when they are unintended,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in this case, it wasn\u2019t something like the ritual of going to a church or going to meditation or going for a massage. I would call this an accidental ritual that I ended up falling in love with, and it really redefined a stage of my life that ended up changing how I feel about myself.\u201dIn 2008, Chris Tamas, recently divorced, lost his job as a lab technician at a Toronto hospital and began living off his eight-month severance pay. He was now free. But to what end? It didn\u2019t go well at first.\u201cI did not take care of myself,\u201d Mr. Tamas said. \u201cAt different points, I stayed at home for two weeks straight, just ordering pizzas and stuff like that. There were definitely periods of hopelessness.\u201dWhen the eight months were nearly up, Mr. Tamas, 37, knew he had to act. He decided to pursue his passion: photography. He built a portfolio while regaining healthy habits. This included the understanding that he needed to treat what many see as a hobby like a profession. Now, he said, he earns more as a freelance photographer than he did as a lab technician.\u201cI looked at other people,\u201d Mr. Tamas said, \u201cand everyone is complaining about how they are financially in a bad situation and can\u2019t afford anything, but they are drinking all night long and sleeping in really late. I just decided that I was getting too old for that.\u201cNow I get up early and I get tired by 10 p.m., so I go to sleep,\u201d he continued. \u201cJust over all, everything feels better. There is just a lot more productivity in the daytime, and even though some of my work involves late-night concerts, I stick to my schedule. I feel better, and my life is completely in order. Everything gets done.\u201dMr. Nartker \u2014 the man who had a moment of reflection on the riverside \u2014 feels the same way. He says he is six months into a new relationship, one he believes would never have been available to him had he not decided to fix his life.\u201cIt\u2019s like this whole new motivation I have,\u201d he said, adding that it was about getting \u201cout of bed and experiencing the world around me instead of sitting at home. And I\u2019m going to do everything I can, because you only get one chance at it. So why waste it?\u201dTwo illustrations on Page D6 today with an article about men who have improved their lives are reversed. Chris Tamas, who comments on his morning routine, is the man with the long hair, and Dan Shaver, who is quoted about the transformative power of rituals, is the man with the shaved head.Advertisement"}

Oh, and it\u2019s a superhero show!It\u2019s a nifty, layered premise. For one thing, it\u2019s a dig at the big, soulless tentpole movies in which teams of heroes lay waste to cities full of screaming little humans, particularly the \u201cAvengers\u201d films from DC\u2019s rival, Marvel. Seen from another angle \u2014 as a traditional workplace sitcom \u2014 the in-the-shadow-of-the-superheroes angle works just as well. What office doesn\u2019t make people feel powerless?It\u2019s hard to judge how that premise will be developed, though, because NBC made only one episode available for review. (The pilot was originally commissioned in 2015, and since then the show\u2019s creator, Ben Queen, has left.) It\u2019s quirky and pleasant but not terribly funny, and the comic situations are standard office sitcom: The new supervisor is hazed; the disgruntled workers sort out into nice, mean and wacky stereotypes; the boss spends all his time trying to get his cousin Bruce on the phone.Vanessa Hudgens (\u201cSpring Breakers\u201d) stars as the company\u2019s relentlessly perky new head of R&D, but if the show succeeds it will be because of an ensemble that includes distinctive performers like Alan Tudyk as the feckless Van Wayne and Danny Pudi, Ron Funches and Christina Kirk as the cranky workers waiting to be whipped into shape.In the pilot, costumed heroes appear only in the amusing credits sequence and in an opening on an elevated train that plays like an ooh-it\u2019s-the-big-city scene from a Hollywood musical. Add a few songs, and it could be from \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d except for the supervillain tearing up the train tracks and the superhero \u2014 an actual DC character, Crimson Fox \u2014 who saves the day.It\u2019s clever and invigorating, and about the only thing in the pilot that actually makes the connection between office workers and superheroes. \u201cPowerless\u201d is a cute idea for a show, but it will need a lot more scenes like that to turn into a worthwhile series.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blaxploitation Movies Are Ready to Stream, Nostalgia Included", "Date": "2017-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingIt was through cheaply made, sex-and-violence laden genre films that Hollywood, or at least a group of mini-studios therein, opted to attract an audience. These movies were frequently conceived and executed by white filmmakers; the black artists were on the screen and on the soundtrack, but not, with some notable exceptions, behind the cameras. So their connection to a genuine black culture in America was compromised, at best. For all that, they put black heroes on the screen.The first movie I watched on the site isn\u2019t even American. \u201cThe Harder They Come\u201d is a 1972 Jamaican film (co-written and directed by Perry Henzell), a semi-underground classic that remains one of the most potent pop outlaw movies ever made: Its hero, played by the reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, simultaneously becomes Jamaica\u2019s most wanted criminal and its record chart topper. Tough, funny and fueled by a spectacular reggae soundtrack, it was one of the first movies in English that included subtitles for American audiences (because of the Jamaican patois spoken by the characters), and it holds up quite well.That\u2019s not the case with either \u201cBlack Caesar\u201d or \u201cHell Up in Harlem,\u201d two \u201970s films written and directed by Larry Cohen, who was then a veteran TV writer whose directorial debut, \u201cBone\u201d (not on the service), was a shockingly funny and corrosive look at intimate race relations in Los Angeles.Like many blaxploitation films, these are, in some ways, exercises in speculative metafiction. A good number of blaxploitation movies took narrative outlines and antihero trappings from classic crime films and changed the ethnicity. \u201cBlack Caesar,\u201d in particular, is a remake of the 1931 gangster picture \u201cThe Public Enemy\u201d transposed to Harlem of the 1970s. Despite the sardonic way Mr. Cohen\u2019s films equate gangsterism with all-American capitalism, there\u2019s not much in the way of effective subversion, subtextual or otherwise.Similarly, the films that the actress Pam Grier made with the director Jack Hill, \u201cCoffy\u201d (1973) and \u201cFoxy Brown\u201d (1974), flip the script on grimy sadistic low-budget revenge films by making the avenger a strong black woman, but that\u2019s pretty much it. And in some respects, that\u2019s sufficient for satisfyingly offbeat, lurid entertainment.More than a couple of the films don\u2019t quite fit the \u201cbadass\u201d honorific the site bestows on its own library. The screen beauty Jacqueline Bisset had an early lead role in \u201cThe Grasshopper\u201d (1970), a grim cautionary tale of a dreamer turned call girl (co-produced by Garry Marshall, many years before he directed \u201cPretty Woman\u201d), in which she has an interracial romance with Jim Brown before a few bad things happen.\u201cMr. Ricco,\u201d which you don\u2019t read about in histories of Hollywood\u2019s \u201970s cinema renaissance, is a platitudinous drama from 1975 starring Dean Martin as a San Francisco lawyer whose successful defense of a black client backfires on him. Despite the presence of Thalmus Rasulala as the client, the picture is of more interest to Martin completists than any other demographic. (Sample dialogue exchange: Martin: \u201cYou really see yourself as a big black hero, don\u2019t you?\u201d Rasulala: \u201cWhen was the last time you volunteered to have your taxes audited?\u201d)\u201cMr. Ricco\u201d was directed by Paul Bogart, who also made \u201cHalls of Anger\u201d (1970), an extra-turgid high school integration drama starring Calvin Lockhart and featuring early turns from Rob Reiner and Jeff Bridges. That movie features a scene in which an attractive white female student is harassed and forcibly stripped by several black teen girls who want to determine if the white student is \u201cblond all over.\u201dThe site does offer two landmarks of African-American cinema, Melvin Van Peebles\u2019s tortured, bluntly confrontational \u201cSweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song\u201d (1971) and Bill Gunn\u2019s \u201cGanja & Hess\u201d (1973), a vampire story that consistently upends the conventions of all the genres from which it draws. One of the stars, Duane Jones, is the superb actor who starred in the 1968 horror classic \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and whose career never broke out of genre films \u2014 with the exception of the 1982 drama \u201cLosing Ground,\u201d directed by Kathleen Collins.Brown Sugar, which charges subscribers $3.99 a month, has a library of just over 100 films available. Jim Weiss, a communications executive at Bounce TV, said in an email, \u201cOur goal is for Brown Sugar to have the widest and deepest collection of movies possible; refreshing our library and delighting our consumers with new titles monthly is at the heart of our mission.\u201dI\u2019m not in the business of telling other businesses their business, but it seems to me that if the service wants to build on its existing formula, expanding its own parameters to include work by maverick African-American filmmakers both past and present wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea. The aesthetic, or at least the ideological, distance between, say, \u201cGanja & Hess\u201d and Haile Gerima\u2019s searing \u201cAshes and Embers\u201d (1982) is not as great as one might immediately presume.Advertisement"}

While Mr. Trump is rarely one to shun the cameras, on this day I hope he will reconsider, and give the nation an opportunity to enjoy the game free of his presence.Andrew Breitbart, whose namesake publication was an important factor in the election of Mr. Trump, was fond of saying that American politics is downstream from culture. Yet in the early days of the Trump era, it seems clear that the reverse is true. From television to comedy to sports, politics surrounds and engulfs us, leaving us no space to gather as citizens without giving a thought to it.American culture today is infected with politics to a degree that it hurts our ability to share cultural moments and experiences with people who have different views. The problem isn\u2019t the CNN \u201cbreaking news\u201d headlines that increase blood pressure for the political addicts among us. It is that it is now impossible to consume media without the constant encroachment of political divisiveness and partisan tribalism.Conservatives are used to the political speeches of celebrities given a microphone at, say, the Academy Awards. But now the endless speechifying has spread beyond the celebrity circuit to infect comedy shows and sports commentary as well.If you hoped that 2017 would bring a respite from a year and a half of constant political coverage, you were wrong. Instead it has brought us Meryl Streep denouncing Mr. Trump at the Golden Globes and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d singing a maudlin farewell to Barack Obama.

The most recent season of the critically acclaimed animated series \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d featured a subplot affirming abortion, and Brit Marling\u2019s new science fiction series, \u201cThe OA,\u201d turns into a bizarre commentary on guns and school shootings. A star of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d David Harbour, invoked his police chief character at the Screen Actors Guild awards this week in an acceptance speech on why we should \u201cpunch some people in the face when they seek to destroy the weak and the disenfranchised and the marginalized\u201d to loud applause.In his time, President Obama made regular appearances on ESPN, announcing his March Madness bracket live on the channel and participating most recently in a town hall on race relations. I can only imagine, if you voted against him, what it would feel like to have a similar level of infiltration of sports channels by President Trump.Yet ESPN seems uninterested in pulling back from political conversations. When asked about the new 6 p.m. \u201cSportsCenter\u201d starting after the Super Bowl, the ESPN hosts Jemele Hill and Michael Smith recently promised fewer highlights of games and warned viewers not to expect them to \u201cstick to sports.\u201dOf course, this is their right. Celebrities, comedians and sportscasters have political opinions, and they are entitled to them. But they need to understand that once they express a strong political opinion, they lessen something important entertainment provides: a break from the ardent and all-encompassing politics that have left Americans feeling divided, anxious and angry.When you \u201cstick to sports,\u201d you are doing more than confining yourself to the field and the court. You are providing a way for people who may have diametrically opposed politics to share a beer at a bar discussing quarterbacks instead of executive orders. We should recognize this is valuable, particularly given that one of the factors that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s rise is a market for outrage, on the right and the left, which acts as a consuming fire. There is always another inch to be won, another point to be defended, and this hyperpoliticization limits the space free from the culture wars Mr. Trump exploited to great effect.In his new book, \u201cThe Art of Being Free: How Alexis de Tocqueville Can Save Us From Ourselves,\u201d James Poulos recognizes the value these cultural outlets have for us in times of anxiety and tribalism. \u201cWhen we\u2019re alone, Netflix and smartphone binges give us a chance at play that\u2019s safe from the craziness of other (real-life) people,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd when we venture out into the world, team sports and infotainment and the other competitive fields of professional play entertain and divert us in ways that typically make us feel much less lonely.\u201dBonding over sports, television, comedy, the latest Netflix series and more is healthy and valuable. President Obama\u2019s farewell address in Chicago asked us to do as much: \u201cIf you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try talking with one of them in real life.\u201dBreaking down the walls between us is easier to do when our culture is not so politicized \u2014 when we can feel free to watch, laugh and cheer alongside our fellow Americans without catching ourselves wondering how they voted. That is the healthier way to live, particularly in the era of Donald Trump.Benjamin Domenech is the publisher of The Federalist.Advertisement"}
