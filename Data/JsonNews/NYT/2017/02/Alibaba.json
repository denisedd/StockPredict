{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s \u2018Winter White House\u2019: A Peek at the Exclusive Members\u2019 List at Mar-a-Lago", "Date": "2017-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn any given weekend, you might catch President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and top Mideast dealmaker, Jared Kushner, by the beachside soft-serve ice cream machine, or his reclusive chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, on the dining patio. If you are lucky, the president himself could stop by your table for a quick chat. But you will have to pay $200,000 for the privilege \u2014 and the few available spots are going fast.Virtually overnight, Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s members-only Palm Beach, Fla., club, has been transformed into the part-time capital of American government, a so-called winter White House where Mr. Trump has entertained a foreign head of state, health care industry executives and other presidential guests.But Mr. Trump\u2019s gatherings at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 he arrived there on Friday afternoon, his third weekend visit in a row \u2014 have also created an arena for potential political influence rarely seen in American history: a kind of Washington steakhouse on steroids, situated in a sunny playground of the rich and powerful, where members and their guests enjoy a level of access that could elude even the best-connected of lobbyists.President Trump was shown responding to a national security crisis during dinner on Saturday night at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach Fla., as members and guests looked on.Membership lists reviewed by The New York Times show that the club\u2019s nearly 500 paying members include dozens of real estate developers, Wall Street financiers, energy executives and others whose businesses could be affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. At least three club members are under consideration for an ambassadorship. Most of the 500 have had memberships predating Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and there are a limited number of memberships still available.William I. Koch, who oversees a major mining and fuels company, belongs to Mar-a-Lago, as does the billionaire trader Thomas Peterffy, who spent more than $8 million on political ads in 2012 warning of creeping socialism in America.Bruce Toll, a real estate executive who co-founded Toll Brothers, one of the nation\u2019s largest home builders, and who is still active in the industry, owns a home nearby and frequently sees Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, he said. While they did not discuss any of Mr. Toll\u2019s specific projects, he said, the two would occasionally discuss national issues, such as Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to increase spending on highways and other infrastructure projects.\u201cMaybe you ought to do this or that,\u201d Mr. Toll said of the kind of advice that Mr. Trump got from club members.Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric, in an interview on Friday, rejected suggestions that his family was offering access to his father and profiting from it. First, he said, only 20 to 40 new members are admitted per year, and second, the wealthy business executives who frequent the club, among others, have many ways to communicate with the federal government if they want to.\u201cIt assumes the worst of us and everyone, and that is unfair,\u201d Eric Trump said.Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, said the president had no conflicts of interest, a reference to the fact that federal law exempts him from provisions prohibiting federal employees from taking actions that could benefit themselves financially.\u201cBut regardless, he has not and will not be discussing policy with club members,\u201d she said in a written statement.Mar-a-Lago, she added, is \u201cone of the most successful private clubs in the world,\u201d and it \u201cwas intended to be the Southern White House, and the president looks forward to hosting many world leaders at this remarkable property.\u201d\u201cNo one needs to have a long sit-down with Donald Trump,\u201d said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \u201cIf you can whisper in his ear for 40 seconds, that can be decisive on your policy.\u201dBrad Goldstein, a spokesman for William Koch, said that he did not know whether the two men had ever discussed policy matters. \u201cIf I did know,\u201d Mr. Goldstein added, \u201cthe answer would be that I decline to comment.\u201dHistorically, of course, American presidents have often been rich men with mansions, who sometimes conducted the people\u2019s business in weekend haunts of the wealthy: the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Me., for example, or the Kennedy family home in Hyannisport, Mass.But Mr. Trump\u2019s weekend White House appears to be unprecedented in American history, as it is the first one with customers paying a company owned by the president, several historians said.\u201cMar-a-Lago represents a commercialization of the presidency that has few if any precedents in American history,\u201d said Jon Meacham, a presidential historian and Andrew Jackson biographer. \u201cPresidents have always spent time with the affluent,\u201d he added. \u201cBut a club where people pay you as president to spend time in his company is new. It is kind of amazing.\u201d\u201cMost presidents feel very strongly about the dignity of the office they hold,\u201d Mr. Dean said. \u201cMr. Trump has busted every norm in campaigning, and he seems to be doing the same with the traditions of his office.\u201dLike other members interviewed for this article, Mr. Duberstein said he did not bring up business matters with any Trump administration officials when visiting the club, which also is near a home he owns.\u201cIt is a social thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a business thing.\u201dChristopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime donor to and a friend of the president, said Mr. Trump had always conducted what amounted to informal focus groups on a variety of topics, but that face time with him since the election had become restricted to family and old friends.\u201cIt\u2019s a myth to think that anybody could just join the club and go speak to the president,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said, adding that the Secret Service has instituted a de facto rope line around the president\u2019s table in recent weeks, which several other club members confirmed.But the weekly gatherings at Mar-a-Lago have already drawn some scrutiny from Democrats in the Senate, who called for Mr. Trump to release a list of all of the members.Mar-a-Lago has never been snooty in the manner of some private clubs in Palm Beach; under Mr. Trump, it has long welcomed Jews, gay couples, Republicans and Democrats. (So long as they could afford the entry fee, that is: Mar-a-Lago doubled that fee to $200,000 shortly after Mr. Trump was elected; members also pay $14,000 in annual dues.) Mr. Trump spent years populating his club with people rejected by rival clubs, while also urging his friends to join.Several members said Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on hot-button topics such as immigration \u2014 and in particular his recent move to ban visas for visitors from certain nations \u2014 had caused some friction among the members at Mar-a-Lago. But Bernd Lembcke, the club\u2019s managing director, said that applications had risen since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\u201cIt enhances it \u2014 his presidency does,\u201d Mr. Lembcke said, referring to membership in the club. \u201cPeople are now even more interested in becoming members. But we are very careful in vetting them.\u201d And potential members must be sponsored by a current one, he said. \u201cYou still have to be introduced.\u201dThe list of members is a who\u2019s who of the world of global finance and real estate, but it is also sprinkled with other boldface names, like Howie Carr, the Boston radio show host, and Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots, according to three lists reviewed by The Times, from 2015 through earlier this year.Several members are also major campaign contributors to Mr. Trump, like Mr. Ruddy and Brian Burns, a businessman and lawyer whom Mr. Trump has indicated he now intends to nominate as ambassador to Ireland, records show.One longtime member is Richard LeFrak, a fellow New York developer and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest friends, who in turn has recruited some of his own friends to join. Jeff Greene, a Senate candidate in Florida in 2010, said he had joined at the urging of Mr. LeFrak.But Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Trump\u2019s old New York circle blurs easily into his presidency, is now a place where the president of the United States might seek guidance on a major government project the way another New Yorker might ask around for a good orthopedist.When Mr. LeFrak paid a visit to Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend, he appeared a little startled when Mr. Trump, in a brief interlude during the conversation, told him that the Department of Homeland Security was quoting a price of more than $20 billion for the proposed border wall with Mexico.\u201cHe said, would I consider doing it? And then he suggested that the price that was being quoted in the media seemed absurdly high to him,\u201d Mr. LeFrak said. He is not interested in the work, but said, \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t react to him one way or the other because I don\u2019t know what the facts are.\u201dMr. LeFrak said to the president, \u201cI thought you were going to have homeland security deal with this,\u201d he recalled, describing Mr. Trump as stymied by the bureaucracy. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Yes, maybe General Kelly will call you.\u2019\u201dKitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SoftBank of Japan Will Buy U.S. Private Equity Giant Fortress", "Date": "2017-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver its three-decade existence, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and its founder, Masayoshi Son, have been known for ambitious and sometimes head-scratching moves.Now, SoftBank is nearing its most unusual move yet: It is buying Fortress Investment Group, an American private equity giant that oversees around $70 billion in assets.Over the past three decades, SoftBank has become one of Japan\u2019s most formidable technology companies. It is perhaps best known for its telecommunications empire, which stretches from Japan to Sprint in the United States. SoftBank also has portfolio of investments that includes stakes in the Alibaba Group of China, the Japanese affiliate of Yahoo and start-ups like the online lender SoFi. At its helm, the entire time, has been Mr. Son.An American-trained businessman, Mr. Son began the business as a software distributor, but eventually moved into cellphone service and became the first Japanese carrier to embrace the iPhone. He has never been known for his modesty, repeatedly boasting about outsize ambitions like dethroning Verizon and AT&T atop the American wireless industry with Sprint.SoftBank will be paying $3.3 billion for Fortress, a premium to the company\u2019s stock market value of $2.3 billion. As part of the agreement, SoftBank has the option of bringing in partners to help cover the cost of the deal and who may want to become investors in Fortress funds, too, thus increasing assets under management.The deal frees up Peter L. Briger Jr. and Wesley R. Edens of Fortress to focus on their strengths as fund managers \u2014 several of their private equity funds have produced double-digit returns over time \u2014 without having to deal with the headaches of running a public company. As leaders of a public company, they struggled mightily to bolster their stock, more so than their competitors. Recently, the firm shut down its flagship hedge fund.The purchase of Fortress, a prominent private equity firm with a specialty in investing in distressed assets, was driven by Rajeev Misra, a former top derivatives expert at Deutsche Bank who has taken a leading role in setting investment strategy for the SoftBank Vision Fund.After leaving Deutsche Bank in 2008, where he had worked closely with Anshu Jain, who headed the bank\u2019s global markets operations, Mr. Misra went to UBS and then spent several months at Fortress, where he came to know the firm\u2019s chairmen, Mr. Briger and Mr. Edens, well.Now, Mr. Misra will be helping steer an enormous new fund that is intended to invest in technology companies worldwide, often by taking huge stakes. SoftBank is expected to contribute at least $25 billion to the fund, while partners in the fund include Saudi Arabia and Apple.All told, SoftBank will now oversee assets under management of $170 billion, making it one of the largest private investors in the world after the Blackstone Group, which manages about $330 billion.While private equity firms have performed poorly as publicly traded stocks, they are attractive in part because of their ability to lock up money for multiple years and charge high fees.As an entity that is regulated \u2014 if relatively lightly compared with, say, a bank \u2014 Fortress will have to operate at arm\u2019s length from the $100 billion Vision Fund when it comes to making investments. And the team of investors under Mr. Misra and Mr. Son will also remain unchanged.Still, it expected that there will be ample opportunity for the Vision Fund to benefit from shared intelligence between the two entities. That could mean Fortress seeing a deal in a telecommunications company that does not fit its mandate and passing it along to the Vision Fund. The transaction also widens the Vision Fund\u2019s capacity to source new investments, given Fortress\u2019s global network.For Fortress, the motivation was to join with one of the world\u2019s most innovative investors and to enter global markets, like the Middle East, where they have trailed some of their peers.Fortress went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2007, before the financial crisis. But shares of Fortress, like shares of other publicly traded private equity firms, have performed poorly in recent years. Fortress\u2019s stock price is down 80 percent since it began trading, and its executives have made no secret that the joy of being a public company has largely evaporated.The firm\u2019s struggles trace to the financial crisis, when it was slow to exit the subprime loan business, forcing heavy losses. The stock dipped below $1, and the firm did not consistently return to profitability until 2012.At the same time, Mr. Edens positioned the firm to capitalize on the economic recovery, piling back into the subprime business through its purchase of the mortgage servicer Nationstar and consumer lender Springleaf, now known as OneMain Financial. Mr. Edens, a former Lehman Brothers partner who co-founded Fortress, has turned the firm\u2019s $124 million Springleaf investment into a stake valued at roughly $2 billion.Under the terms of the deal, Fortress will become an independent subsidiary of SoftBank. Fortress\u2019s principals, who control roughly a third of the firm\u2019s voting shares, have agreed to vote in favor of the sale, which is expected to close by year\u2019s end.On Tuesday, before the deal was announced, shares of Fortress rose 6.5 percent on unusually heavy trading volume.Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Do Billionaires Have in Common? Big Bucks, and Not Much Else", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat do Larry Ellison and Ingvar Kamprad have in common? They are both billionaires. But that may be one of the few characteristics they share.Billionaires may have enormous spending potential, but they certainly exercise that power differently. Some live lavishly and enjoy being in the headlines, while others live frugally, if not anonymously. There are big spenders and those who give it away.His fellow billionaire Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, bought 74-acre Necker Island in the Caribbean in 1979. It operates as a private luxury resort, with room for 34 adults and six children at about $2,300 each per night. He also bought nearby Mosquito Island in 2007, the site of former President Barack Obama\u2019s recent vacation. Mr. Branson is a serial blogger and Twitter user, sending out inspirational messages about entrepreneurship, conservation, music and travel.Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, is unmistakable on the high seas in his $250 million superyacht, Octopus, which has two helicopter pads, a submarine, a glass-bottom swimming pool and a recording studio, not to mention room for 26 guests. Recently, he has been known to host a celebrity-studded party on Octopus during the Cannes Film Festival. But he has a serious side, too. Mr. Allen last year gave $295 million to brain and cell science, wildlife conservation, global health and climate change.But not all billionaires like to be so obvious. Chuck Feeney, who built an empire of duty-free shops and a multibillion-dollar fortune along the way, has worked since the 1980s to give all that money away, as quietly as possible.Forbes magazine once called him the \u201cJames Bond of philanthropy\u201d for his work through his charity, the Atlantic Philanthropies. The foundation has given away $8 billion to education, science, health care and human rights projects around the world and made its final grant last year. It plans to close for good in 2020.The fact is, most \u201cordinary\u201d billionaires live quietly. \u201cUnlike what the public thinks, the majority of these people come out of the middle class or even poverty,\u201d said Jim Grubman, a clinical psychologist who wrote \u201cStrangers in Paradise,\u201d a book about how people adjust to becoming wealthy.\u201cThe billionaire lifestyle makes for good TV, but below the surface is a much bigger portion of people who are salt-of-the-earth families just concentrating on raising their kids and running their businesses,\u201d said Mr. Grubman, who is a consultant at Cambridge Family Enterprise Group, an adviser to wealthy families.Asia is an active area of billionaire creation, with one person reaching that threshold every three days, according to a study released in October by UBS and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.Asia\u2019s two richest men are Jack Ma, founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, with a $26 billion net worth, and Wang Jianlin, a real estate mogul with $29 billion to his name who also holds stakes in a Spanish soccer club and the Hollywood film production company Legendary Entertainment.In 2015, The Economist reported on the party Mr. Wang held to celebrate his deal to buy Infront Sports & Media, which has marketing rights to World Cup soccer. The magazine said that Mr. Wang favored \u201cprivate jets and flashy yachts (he owns Sunseeker, the British maker of the sleek craft seen in James Bond films),\u201d and that the party featured strobe lights, disco music and leggy beauties.In the winter, many flock to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland; the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah; and New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations on St. Barts, where people can rent their own eight-bedroom beachfront villa for $420,000 a week.In the summer, some of the richest flock to Britain for the Henley Royal Regatta, the Royal Ascot horse races, and Wimbledon, where a center-court season ticket at the men\u2019s championship final this year has a market value of $3,300.So far, 156 billionaires and their families have committed to the cause, according to the profiles listed on the pledge\u2019s website. The group also includes the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, his wife, Priscilla Chan, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk and the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Verizon Will Pay $350 Million Less for Yahoo", "Date": "2017-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Verizon store in Chicago. Verizon will pay $4.48 billion for Yahoo, about $350 million less than it initially offered after security breaches that were disclosed last year.The revised agreement, now valued at $4.48 billion, paves the way for the deal to proceed to a shareholder vote as early as April, although securities regulators are still assessing how Yahoo disclosed information about the breaches to investors. Yahoo, which is winding down its own investigation of the breaches, will share more details about the incidents and their impact in the next few weeks when it makes required regulatory filings.Consummation of the sale to Verizon would bring closure to a negotiation that has stretched on for nearly three years as Yahoo\u2019s board and its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, considered various plans to separate the company\u2019s fading internet businesses from its much more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group.Verizon and Yahoo, whose internet advertising businesses are tiny compared with juggernauts like Google and Facebook, are eager to move forward on integrating their internet operations.\u201cWe have always believed this acquisition makes strategic sense,\u201d Marni M. Walden, the Verizon executive vice president who oversees product innovation and new businesses, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to moving ahead expeditiously so that we can quickly welcome Yahoo\u2019s tremendous talent and assets into our expanding portfolio in the digital advertising space.\u201dVerizon intends to keep the Yahoo brand separate from AOL, another internet pioneer that it acquired in 2015. But executives hope to use digital advertising technology and a unified sales force to court advertisers who want to reach the companies\u2019 combined audience of well over one billion active internet users.Yahoo still attracts large audiences to its sports, news and financial sites, and its email service retains a loyal audience. Although Yahoo and AOL do not carry the clout they had during the early days of the web, marketers do want to preserve alternatives to Google and Facebook, which increasingly dominate digital advertising.It\u2019s unclear whether Ms. Mayer, a former Google executive who was hired as Yahoo\u2019s chief in 2012, will remain with Verizon after the deal closes. Ms. Mayer failed to turn around Yahoo\u2019s struggling internet businesses and was forced to write off much of the value of Tumblr, her biggest acquisition.After the sale, Yahoo\u2019s Asian investments will remain in a stub company, called Altaba, which will study how to extract the maximum value from them. The Alibaba stake has a face value of about $39 billion and the Yahoo Japan stake is worth about $9 billion, but any transactions to dispose of the shares are likely to incur multibillion-dollar tax bills.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Tried to Upend Banks. Now It Works With Them.", "Date": "2017-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2011, Brett King was promoting his book, \u201cBreaking Banks,\u201d and creating a start-up that he hoped would do to the banks what Amazon did to the retail industry and Facebook did to media.\u201cWe had grand ideas of being the Facebook of banking, and being a new form of bank account,\u201d Mr. King said recently.Six years later, his company, Moven, has opened only 60,000 of those new bank accounts. Mr. King has now transitioned to selling his software to the banks he once scorned, who use it as a component of their mobile apps.\u201cWe realized that if you want millions of users as a bank, it is a very different proposition than building a social media network,\u201d he said.Silicon Valley has upended a growing number of industries, and it had seemed not too long ago that Wall Street would soon be next. A flurry of financial start-ups rose quickly and grabbed billions of dollars in investments.Mr. King is just one of the many technology entrepreneurs who have since recently run into the enormous moats that surround and protect the existing financial industry.The venture capitalists who have invested billions of dollars in this wave of new financial technology \u2014 think Venmo and Bitcoin \u2014 have been left waiting for a breakout star that actually looks like a threat to even a part of the big banks\u2019 business.\u201cA lot of people set out saying, \u2018We are going to displace the banks,\u2019\u201d said Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist at 500 Startups who focuses on financial technology. \u201cWe realized along the way that you really have no choice but to work with the banks.\u201dAnd the difficulty of denting the influence and power of the big banks is only likely to get harder under the Trump administration.President Trump has said he wants to encourage innovation and new business by cutting back on regulations of all sorts, including financial regulations.Yet it was the regulations passed after the financial crisis that forced the big banks to reduce their risks in many areas and provided an opening for start-ups like Moven, which were willing to take more risks.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle those post-crisis regulations is widely expected to give the big banks more free rein and close the window of opportunity for newcomers.\u201cThe degree to which banks have been caught under the yoke of regulatory obligations is very likely to lighten up under Trump,\u201d said Arjan Sch\u00fctte, the founder of the venture capital firm Core Innovation Capital, which focuses on financial technology.Mr. Sch\u00fctte has been moving his firm\u2019s investments away from bank disrupters and toward start-ups that are set up to partner with existing financial institutions.Even if there has not been a disruption of the big banks, basic financial services available to consumers are changing rapidly, nonetheless.Americans are now able to send each other money instantly from their phones, thanks to Venmo, and can get approved for a loan in minutes, also from their phone.The consulting firm McKinsey estimated in a report last month that digital disruption could put $90 billion, or 25 percent of bank profits, at risk over the next three years as services become more automated and more tellers are replaced by chatbots.Much of this change, however, is now expected to come from the banks themselves as they absorb new ideas from the technology world and shrink their own operations, without necessarily losing significant numbers of customers to start-ups.Venmo, for, instance, has captured the wallets of many young Americans, but the largest banks have all begun their own versions of the service and some of them say that they already process, as single banks, more instant personal payments than Venmo.The large banks are also teaming up to start a cross-industry mobile phone application, Zelle, that will take Venmo head-on in 2017.Venmo, which was acquired by PayPal, is still trying to find a way to make money from the business, which is currently offered primarily as a free service.Financial start-ups are not facing the same challenges everywhere in the world. In China, the technology company Ant Financial has grown to 450 million users since spinning off from the e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Ant Financial now processes a majority of online payments in China.Ant Financial has used its position as an electronic, phone-based wallet to grab lots of other financial business from Chinese consumers, offering online loans, insurance and investment advice to its hundreds of millions of customers.China has four of the five most valuable financial technology start-ups in the world, according to CB Insights, with Ant Financial leading the way at $60 billion. And investments in financial technology rose 64 percent in China last year, while they were falling 29 percent in the United States, according to CB Insights.In Africa, the financial industry has been shaken up by the rise of new forms of mobile phone-based payment systems like M-Pesa, in Kenya, which was started by the local mobile phone operator rather than a bank, and has risen to become the dominant form of payment in the country.The obvious reason that financial start-ups have not achieved the same level of growth in the United States is that most Americans already have access to a relatively functional set of financial products, unlike in Africa and China.Some start-ups looked at becoming banks, so they could offer deposit insurance \u2014 among other things \u2014 but they generally found that getting a bank charter required more time and money than is available to even the most successful start-ups. This left most start-ups reliant on banks to hold and move any money they collected from customers.\u201cOperating in America, you needed to get a gatekeeper to approve your access to the networks,\u201d said Josh Reich, who sold his banking start-up, Simple, to the Spanish banking giant BBVA. \u201cIf we wanted to touch their money, we needed to be part of the banking system.\u201dOnline lenders were particularly ambitious in trying to take on the banks from outside the system. Lending Club, which makes personal loans, and OnDeck, which focuses on small business loans, initially grew swiftly and went public, but both companies have run up against the limits of how fast a lending business can grow without being a bank.The online lenders have struggled with the high cost of acquiring new customers through marketing, which is not as necessary in other industries that have been disrupted by technology.At a more fundamental level, online lenders realized how hard it was to fund the new loans they wanted to give out without having access to cheap deposits, as the banks do.The shares of both Lending Club and OnDeck are now trading far below where they were on the day they went public.One notable success among the new lenders has been SoFi, or Social Finance, but even it has captured only about 250,000 customers, as compared to the 160 million users of Snapchat, the social network that was founded the same year.Start-ups focused on improving payments have had more success \u2014 the most valuable recent American technology start-up is Stripe, which helps new companies accept online payments.But Stripe and other payment start-ups like Square are all built on top of the existing credit card and banking infrastructure and have not posed any type of fundamental threat or challenge to the existing giants.\u201cWe are explicitly not a threat to the banks,\u201d Tim Drinan, a spokesman for Stripe, said. \u201cFrom our perspective the banks and card networks have built something pretty good and pretty hard to replicate.\u201dPerhaps the most ambitious recent project aimed at upending the banks was Bitcoin, which promised a new way to hold and move money, totally outside the existing banking system.The virtual currency has not taken off as a way to hold and spend money on a day-to-day basis, as many of its enthusiasts had predicted.At the same time, in a pattern that has been repeated elsewhere in the financial industry, the big banks have been making big investments aimed at harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin \u2014 known as the blockchain \u2014 for their own purposes.Tim Swanson, an early Bitcoin follower and analyst who now works with the blockchain consulting firm R3, said that Bitcoin wasn\u2019t able to fulfill the marketing promises that were made for it back in 2012.\u201cIt may take some time, but if there is anyone that has the capital base and the developer base to see this through, it\u2019s the banks for sure,\u201d Mr. Swanson said.An article on Thursday about technology start-ups\u2019 efforts to take on the financial industry misstated the year that PayPal acquired Venmo. It was 2013, not 2009.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employees of Missing Hong Kong Billionaire Are Barred From Leaving China", "Date": "2017-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 At least 30 employees of a Hong Kong billionaire who was whisked to China about two weeks ago have been stopped from leaving the mainland, with many more probably unable to travel, two people familiar with the matter said Monday.It has become increasingly apparent that Beijing\u2019s dragnet extends far beyond the billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, and is now closing in on dozens, if not hundreds, of his employees in one of the most far-reaching crackdowns on a private Chinese conglomerate in the nearly four decades since the country began to embrace free markets.Mr. Xiao\u2019s inside knowledge of the financial dealings of China\u2019s most powerful families may have overridden any concerns about violating Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement.In another development, an employee who worked on the computer systems at Mr. Xiao\u2019s companies was detained at the Hong Kong airport on Sunday evening, suspected of committing passport violations while trying to fly to Japan, the people familiar with the matter said.The employee, who is still being held, was in Hong Kong working on securing the companies\u2019 networks, one of the people said.The moves signal that Mr. Xiao, 45, is in serious trouble and that his companies are unlikely to be spared amid a widening crackdown.Companies under Mr. Xiao\u2019s Tomorrow Group, which was founded in 1999, control tens of billions of dollars in assets, and its holdings have included stakes in more than 30 financial institutions, including Ping An, one of China\u2019s biggest insurers, as well as Harbin Bank and Industrial Bank.His apparent abduction comes before an important Communist Party meeting expected to take place in October or November. There, the party will name as many as five new members to the Politburo Standing Committee, the group of seven men at the pinnacle of political power in China.In the months leading up to the conclave, held once every five years, the party puts stability at a premium, and Mr. Xiao, through his substantial holdings, is seen as having the potential to bring instability to China\u2019s stock markets.\u201cIt seems like a no-lose move for Wang and Xi,\u201d Mr. Bishop said by email.The employee currently detained by Hong Kong\u2019s Immigration Department was stopped while trying to fly to Tokyo from Hong Kong International Airport on Sunday night, two people said. The man, Yao Long, worked in information technology at one of Mr. Xiao\u2019s companies and had come to Hong Kong to work on strengthening the company\u2019s cybersecurity within China, one person said.The Immigration Department, which is still holding Mr. Yao, is investigating whether his travel documents are valid, the person said. It is unclear how Mr. Yao would have been able to enter Hong Kong without valid travel documents, but one possibility is that China invalidated the passport while he was in Hong Kong, the person said.A spokesman for the Hong Kong Immigration Department declined to comment, saying the agency did not discuss individual cases.But invalidating a passport would not be particularly abnormal, according to Jonathan Man, a lawyer who advised Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor.\u201cIt\u2019s done by other countries; with Snowden, the U.S. revoked his passport \u2014 it\u2019s quite a normal way if you want to get a person,\u201d Mr. Man said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou cancel his passport to prevent him from going anywhere else,\u201d he said, adding that Beijing has a number of ways to get people to come back over the border.While it is not clear what will happen to Mr. Yao, Mr. Man said that the Immigration Department would probably have to decide whether to charge him with a crime within 48 hours. At that point, if he is not charged but has an invalid passport, he would probably be unable to travel anywhere other than China.Attempts to contact Mr. Yao were unsuccessful.The magazine, citing people it did not identify, reported that one of the country\u2019s top newspapers covering the Chinese stock market, Securities Daily, had been controlled by Mr. Xiao\u2019s Tomorrow Group. Through three corporate shareholders, Tomorrow owned more than a third of the media company and influenced its editorial decisions to portray Tomorrow and its affiliates in a positive light, the magazine said.Caixin reported that the newspaper\u2019s top official had been removed from his post and expelled from the Communist Party for \u201cserious disciplinary violations,\u201d which usually means corruption.Kiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo and Verizon Are Said to Be Near a Cheaper Deal", "Date": "2017-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Soon after Yahoo disclosed the first of two enormous data breaches that threatened to upend a $4.8 billion deal it had reached with Verizon Communications, the embattled company began to confront an unpleasant potential future.Yahoo could have battled Verizon to preserve the original price tag, a campaign that could have ended up in a Delaware courtroom \u2014 and led to months of bitter legal wrangling. Moreover, that strategy would have run the risk of allowing Verizon to walk away from the purchase altogether.Instead, Yahoo is close to renegotiating its original deal, choosing to take close to $300 million off the price to preserve the sale, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.Under the revised terms, the two companies are expected to share legal responsibility and costs for the data breaches, the person with knowledge of the matter said.The new deal is expected to be announced within days, this person added.Representatives for both companies declined to comment on the discussions.On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed additional information stemming from the breaches, notifying some users that it had found evidence of attempts to log in to their accounts without a password. Those attempts were made using data stolen in the 2014 hacking.Yahoo did not ask the users to change their passwords but urged them to use account key, an optional feature that uses a smartphone to validate all attempted logins on a Yahoo account.Verizon executives had earlier mused publicly about the severity of the Yahoo breaches and whether they had a material effect on the companies\u2019 deal, announced in July.Analysts, however, said Verizon, a telecommunications giant, had plenty of reasons to complete the transaction quickly, particularly to build up its digital media business.Verizon\u2019s core business, wireless phone service, is being hurt by stiffened competition from AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. Verizon was recently forced to bring back unlimited data plans to match its rivals\u2019 offerings.For Yahoo, salvaging the deal was even more vital.In putting its core internet business \u2014 including its still-popular email service, Yahoo Finance and sports arms \u2014 up for sale last year, the company sought to end years of questions about its declining business and whether it could effect a turnaround. A succession of chief executives, most recently Marissa Mayer, tried but failed, and investor discontent was high.After a highly public sales process, Verizon emerged the winner.Verizon sought Yahoo as part of its effort to build a digital media empire anchored by its earlier purchase of AOL, another aging internet property. AOL could not achieve the scale necessary to challenge Google and Facebook on its own, and Yahoo\u2019s business was meant to play a crucial role, bringing in more than a billion users.Verizon\u2019s archrival, AT&T, is also building a new business line in media. But in seeking to acquire Time Warner for $85 billion, it is aiming for a much greater scale more quickly.Still, the hacking disclosures appeared to rattle Verizon\u2019s plans.In September, Yahoo revealed that intruders it believed were backed by a foreign government had stolen the data, including encrypted passwords, of 500 million user accounts in 2014.Two months ago, Yahoo announced that an even larger breach, involving a billion accounts, had occurred in 2013. That breach compromised additional data, including security questions used to reset passwords. Yahoo forced all of the affected users to change their passwords.In both cases, there is evidence that Yahoo knew about the intrusions for some time before they were publicly disclosed.Yahoo has shared few additional details in recent months, citing continuing investigations by outside security firms, its board of directors and law enforcement authorities.Its reticence drew the ire last week of the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who sent a letter to Ms. Mayer demanding more information about the breaches and what Yahoo had done to protect its users since then.Yahoo said last month that it was confident its deal with Verizon would close by the end of June.The long delay has taken a toll on Yahoo\u2019s business. The company has continued to lose market share in digital advertising as Facebook and Google expand their dominance and shiny newcomers like Snapchat attract the attention of marketers.While waiting for the deal, Yahoo\u2019s management has focused on cutting costs, eliminating more than 2,100 jobs in the last year.Yahoo stockholders are eager to see the deal close so that Yahoo can focus on finding ways to extract the value of its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, and its 36 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, an affiliated company controlled by SoftBank Group.Those investments, which are supposed to remain in a stub company called Altaba, are worth about $48 billion combined.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "WhatsApp\u2019s New Feature Continues Facebook\u2019s Snapchat Mimicry", "Date": "2017-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since, Facebook and some of its top apps \u2014 including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 have been trying to tap into the explosively popular photo-sharing features pioneered by Snapchat.The latest sign of that came on Monday as WhatsApp, a mobile messaging application used by 1.2 billion people, unveiled a version of its Status feature that takes a significant number of cues from Snapchat. Similar to Snapchat\u2019s Stories feature, WhatsApp\u2019s Status now lets people share images, GIFs and videos as a status update, all of which last for 24 hours before disappearing.Even if imitation is the highest compliment, WhatsApp executives are not admitting it. \u201cWe build things because we really hope people will want to use them even more,\u201d Randall Sarafa, a product manager at WhatsApp, said in an interview about the new version of Status. Avoiding any direct mention of Snapchat, he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t really think about building things for other reasons.\u201dA WhatsApp spokeswoman declined to comment further.A Snapchat spokeswoman declined to comment on the similarities with WhatsApp, and a press officer for Instagram declined to comment beyond past public statements. But the Facebook Messenger spokeswoman Jennifer Hakes said: \u201cIn some ways, the camera is now replacing the keyboard. As more people use Messenger in their everyday lives, we wanted to make it faster, simpler and more fun to send photos and videos \u2014 so we built the new Messenger camera.\u201dFacebook\u2019s emulation of Snapchat has a broader significance in that the network and its apps are moving toward a more visual and interactive form of communication.For years, applications like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter were primarily text-based. Twitter rose to popularity by capitalizing on SMS short-form texts, and the majority of the more than than 50 billion WhatsApp messages sent on a daily basis are text-based.But in 2011, Mr. Spiegel saw a new possibility when he and Bobby Murphy, his Stanford University fraternity brother, founded Snapchat. Their focus was on making it simple to send photos and videos to friends. Making the camera the focus \u2014 unlike competitors, Snapchat makes it the first thing you see after opening the app \u2014 allows people to send images much faster than with other apps, which often require two or three steps to open the camera.How much coordination there is within Facebook and among WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger over how to grapple with Snapchat is unclear. While executives at the company regularly meet with Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to check in and give updates on long-term product strategy, they have said in past interviews that they maintain a level of workplace autonomy.\u201cWe operate in a largely independent way from Facebook,\u201d Mr. Sarafa, of WhatsApp, said in a recent interview.Still, many of the product executives at these companies acknowledge that some of their updates are not entirely original and give credit to Snapchat for creating a new kind of \u201cformat.\u201dIn an interview in August, Kevin Systrom, a founder and the chief executive of Instagram, did not mention Snapchat by name but acknowledged that \u201cother companies deserve all the credit\u201d for popularizing disappearing photos and videos.\u201cThis format unlocks a new version of creativity for us,\u201d Mr. Systrom said. \u201cI think Instagram will be judged by where we go from here and what we make of it in the future.\u201dInstagram\u2019s Stories product \u2014 the Snapchat look-alike \u2014 has since become a hit: More than 150 million people use it daily. In its initial public offering filing, Snap cited the direction of Instagram as a potential risk factor to its own growth.At WhatsApp, the Status feature was originally conceived as a text-based away message, similar to the one in AOL\u2019s Instant Messenger product of the 1990s, which made it easy to let friends know if you were around to text or if you were too busy.The updated Status feature replaces that text with richer multimedia. Now, as with Snapchat\u2019s Stories, WhatsApp users can post photos, videos and GIFs as their status, which lasts for 24 hours before disappearing. WhatsApp users can also send their status updates as messages to individual or multiple friends at once, much the way Snapchat\u2019s messaging system is structured.WhatsApp recognizes that its latest feature may not be completely original. But it still hopes it will bring the app similar success.\u201cObviously we\u2019re all seeing broad adoption of this format across the industry right now,\u201d Mr. Sarafa said. \u201cOur hope is that with this update, people will find new ways to share and consume media on WhatsApp, too.\u201dKatie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where the Billionaires Come From", "Date": "2017-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the early 20th century, a young journalist named Napoleon Hill embarked on the assignment of a lifetime.Mr. Hill set out to study hundreds of the nation\u2019s most successful people and write a book about how they became so accomplished.Mr. Hill spent two decades analyzing the life stories, strategies and personal philosophies of entrepreneurs and industrialists like Henry Ford, William Wrigley and John D. Rockefeller.The resulting book, \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d was published in 1937 and became a self-help guide for everyday Americans seeking great wealth.Mr. Hill tried to convince his readers \u2014 many of them emotionally and financially battered by the Great Depression \u2014 that with the right attitude they, too, could amass a fortune.\u201cOne must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes first did a certain amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, desiring and planning before they acquired money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Eighty years later, Mr. Hill\u2019s egalitarian notions seem to ring hollow on many levels. There is a troublingly wide gap between the economic fortunes of the rich and the poor \u2014 an inequality that has helped unleash political populism in Europe and the United States. (Ironically, President Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire, rode that resentment to the White House.)The idea that the secret to great wealth comes from a combination of discipline, perseverance and belief in yourself sounds Pollyannaish in an era of widespread disillusionment with how the economy and society actually works.Indeed, the chance of becoming a billionaire remains incredibly slim. Wealth-X, a research firm that tracks global wealth, said there were 2,473 billionaires in 2015, an increase of 148 from the year before and about 0.00003 percent of the world\u2019s 7.3 billion people.Still, an optimist like Mr. Hill, who died in 1970, might take heart in one data point from Wealth-X: More than half of the world\u2019s billionaires are self-made.And that number is increasing. Self-made billionaires represent 57 percent of total billionaire wealth, or more than $4.3 trillion, a figure that was up 7 percent from 2014. Meanwhile, the number of billionaires with inherited wealth \u2014 323, according to Wealth-X \u2014 fell by 29 percent from 2014.The booming technology sector has minted many of the recent self-made titans \u2014 entrepreneurs like Travis Kalanick, a co-founder and the chief executive of Uber, and the co-founders of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk.\u201cMany people have great ideas. But to grow an idea into a huge business is a different matter,\u201d said Maya Imberg, custom research director at Wealth-X. \u201cBillionaires tend to be incredibly focused.\u201dIn his book, Mr. Hill tried to show that qualities like focus and perseverance were within everyone.He told the story of how Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he perfected the incandescent electric light bulb and how Henry Ford pushed his engineers to develop the V-8 motor despite the technical challenges.\u201cA thousand people could be pointed out who have a better education than Ford\u2019s, yet they live in poverty because they do not possess the right plan for the accumulation of money,\u201d Mr. Hill wrote.Wealth-X is the big data equivalent to Mr. Hill\u2019s one-man reporting project. The firm employs about 150 researchers across the world who collect and analyze data about the richest people.Based on that data, you may have a slightly better chance of becoming a billionaire if you went to Harvard, which was the most popular school among billionaires by a wide margin. (Stanford came in second.)Engineering degrees were the most popular among billionaires, followed by business, according to Approved Index, another firm that researches the wealthy. There are some notable billionaires with humanities degrees, like the financier Carl Icahn, who majored in philosophy at Princeton. Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has a teaching degree.It is well known that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft dropped out of Harvard to start their businesses. But they are not alone. About 30 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires never obtain a college degree.\u201cIt is counterintuitive to what you are told growing up,\u201d said Grace Garland, head of research at Approved Index.If the sheer numbers are any guide, your chances of becoming a billionaire as a woman are especially remote. In 2015, 140 of the 148 people who broke into the billionaire ranks were men. All of the top 10 billionaires are men, according to Wealth-X.And yet for all the male-dominated, Ivy League exclusivity of the billionaire\u2019s club, self-help gurus and ordinary people continue to pore over the biographies and public statements of the ultrawealthy, looking for the secret sauce.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, and the investor Warren E. Buffett are said to be avid readers. Mr. Gates once said that \u201creading is still the main way that I both learn new things and test my understanding.\u201dMr. Collins said many of these wealthy men had parents who helped them to succeed.Mr. Gates\u2019 parents arranged for him to take time off from classes during his senior year in high school to work on code for the electrical grid management system at a local power plant.Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of Virgin Group, said his father, a lawyer, taught him the importance of dreaming big and instilled in him a desire for excellence.Mr. Collins said that while he was growing up in Australia, his father made him read \u201cThink and Grow Rich,\u201d and taught him how to think about making money in different ways to accumulate wealth.\u201cThe people who say that entrepreneurs are born, that is ridiculous. They are made,\u201d he said.\u201cYou need grit and unwavering personal confidence. Those are nonnegotiable in a billionaire,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asian Tech Titans Take a Page From Trump\u2019s Book", "Date": "2017-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 In his book on deal making, President Trump offered a key piece of advice on getting what you want: Promise big.\u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies,\u201d he said in 1987\u2019s \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cPeople want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201dSome of Asia\u2019s biggest deal makers already understand that principle \u2014 and are making big promises accordingly.In recent months, Alibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma; the Japanese tech investor Masayoshi Son; and the head of Foxconn, Terry Gou, have made big, public plans to invest in America. Together, the deals proposed would help to create more than a million new American jobs and tens of billions of dollars in new investments.Their promises have set off a host of other offerings from Asia in recent weeks \u2014 even if those offerings are not entirely new or solid. Toyota Motor of Japan promised last month to spend $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, which would essentially match its previous spending levels. News reports that Samsung of South Korea may also build an American plant won praise from Mr. Trump on Twitter. Samsung said it continued \u201cto evaluate new investment needs in the U.S. that can help us best serve our customers.\u201dThe promises from the big Asian business leaders will be tough to keep, experts say. But they show that Asia\u2019s tech titans see a familiar figure in Mr. Trump.\u201cThey see where this guy Trump is coming from, and, at a visceral level, identify with him,\u201d said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.\u201cIt plays directly into their style,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys are political animals. They live in Asia, where things are different. There\u2019s more autocracy and more connected transactions. In the U.S., people still expect things to be fair.\u201dThe Asian executives come from a region Mr. Trump accuses of using unfair trade practices and stealing American jobs \u2014 and all three have a lot to lose. It is not clear whether their lofty promises will lead to better treatment from the Trump administration.A SoftBank spokesman said, \u201cMr. Son was greatly encouraged by the economic agenda of the new administration, and he intends to invest significant resources in the U.S. in the years ahead.\u201d A Foxconn spokeswoman said that the company was evaluating an investment in America and that it expected a new American project would create \u201cmany direct and indirect job opportunities.\u201d An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment.Of course, the United States has a long history of supporting its homegrown industries. Still, East Asian governments often intervene more directly in business, and many of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals suggest he wants to adopt similar strategies.In China, government officials give public and financial support to building up industries to make the country less dependent on exports. In Japan, the government is supporting a new effort to build an aerospace industry. In South Korea, the government has lavished subsidies and tax breaks on its largest exporters, like Hyundai and Samsung.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s public praise and cajoling, including the photo ops in Trump Tower and the Twitter posts broadcasting investment vows as political victories, have an East Asian feel.\u201cIn Japan and China you need to go through these rituals,\u201d said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cYou could argue that looking at Mr. Trump, they\u2019re saying, \u2018O.K., I have to figure out what the ritual is and go through it,\u2019 and these guys know how to do that stuff.\u201dIn all three cases, the Asian companies appear to have fostered good will.After meeting with Mr. Ma, Mr. Trump said that the Alibaba founder loved America and China and that the two of them would \u201cdo some great things.\u201dIt is not clear how many of the pledges will come to pass.Mr. Gou has cautioned that the Pennsylvania plant is more a wish than a promise. Putting a flat-panel production center in Pennsylvania places it far from the electronics supply chain that crisscrosses Asia. There is also less experience in building such factories in the United States, and regulatory risks could threaten to turn a multibillion-dollar investment into a big money loser if there are delays in opening it.\u201cThey\u2019re making these promises that I wouldn\u2019t say they have no intention of keeping, but they\u2019re less a promise than an aspiration,\u201d Mr. Moel said. \u201cIf they have to they\u2019ll do it, but they\u2019d rather not.\u201dAll three of the tech leaders are consummate showmen and self-promoters. Mr. Ma says he would like Alibaba to span three centuries by sticking around for at least 102 years. In a recent investor letter he said that in the next 20 years the company would create 100 million jobs. Mr. Son has a 300-year plan for SoftBank, and he often follows up big deals with big promises.\u201cWe got to bring back the jobs from China, we got to bring back the jobs from Japan, and all these countries that are ripping us off,\u201d he said at one campaign event. But he added, \u201cI don\u2019t hold it against these other countries. I mean, if they can get away with it, let them do it. I want to get away with things.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
