{"Headline": "C.I.A. Developed Tools to Spy on Mac Computers, WikiLeaks Disclosure Shows", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byApple said in a statement Thursday evening that its preliminary assessment of the leaked information indicated that the Mac vulnerabilities described in the disclosure were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013.However, the documents also indicated that the Central Intelligence Agency was developing a new version of one tool last year to work with current software.All of the surveillance tools that have been disclosed were designed to be installed on individual phones or computers. But the effects could be much wider. Cisco Systems, for example, warned customers this week that many of its popular routers, the backbone of computer networks, could be hacked using the C.I.A.\u2019s techniques.Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has offered to share the precise software code used by the C.I.A.\u2019s cyberweapons with the affected companies. But major tech companies have been reluctant to directly engage with him for fear of violating American laws governing the receipt of classified information.At a news conference Thursday, Mr. Assange criticized the government policies that restricted such communications but said that Apple had nonetheless been willing to work with representatives of his anti-secrecy organization.Google and Microsoft, he said, had simply pointed WikiLeaks to its existing channels for anyone to report a security flaw.In its statement, Apple denied negotiating with WikiLeaks. \u201cWe have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms,\u201d the company said. \u201cThus far, we have not received any information from them that isn\u2019t in the public domain. We are tireless defenders of our users\u2019 security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.\u201dThe spy software described in the latest documents was designed to be injected into a Mac\u2019s firmware, a type of software preloaded in the computer\u2019s chips. It would then act as a \u201clistening post,\u201d broadcasting the user\u2019s activities to the C.I.A. whenever the machine was connected to the internet.A similar tool called NightSkies was developed in 2009 to spy on iPhones, the documents said, with the agency figuring out how to install it undetected before a new phone was turned on for the first time. (Apple said that flaw affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed in all later models.)Although most of the tools targeted outdated versions of the Apple devices\u2019 software, the C.I.A.\u2019s general approach raises new security concerns for the industry, said Eric Ahlm, who studies cybersecurity at Gartner, a research firm. By rewriting the most basic software of a computer or a phone, tools that operate at the chip level can hide their existence and avoid being wiped out by routine software updates.Under an agreement struck during the Obama administration, intelligence agencies were supposed to share their knowledge of most security vulnerabilities with tech companies so they could be fixed. The C.I.A. documents suggest that some key vulnerabilities were kept secret for the government\u2019s use.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump-SoftBank-Saudi Connection", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byDealBookAs camera lights flashed, President-elect Donald J. Trump strode across the lobby of Trump Tower with Masayoshi Son, the colorful Japanese entrepreneur, in December.The photo op was intended to be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign.This is not a secret to anyone who has been paying even a modicum of attention to the news that has dribbled out about the fund.While Mr. Son has pledged to provide a quarter of the fund himself, hardly any of the money comes from investors in the United States \u2014 with the exception of several nominal $1 billion investments, including from Apple, Qualcomm and Larry Ellison of Oracle.Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Mr. Son, and therefore Saudi Arabia, to take over some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most promising companies and intellectual property could be seen as being at odds with his nationalistic talk.\u201cWould you take money from the Saudis?\u201d Sean Hannity of Fox News asked him last year.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, without missing a beat.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Riyadh. \u201cCrooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Facebook. \u201cI am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!\u201dThose references were made in the context of politics, but should they also extend to business?This column isn\u2019t taking a position on the politics or the morality of taking money from Saudi Arabia. But it is a conversation that is worth having.Just as the United States has tried to become energy independent from the Middle East for economic and political reasons, we may be on the verge of taking the opposite tack when it comes to our innovative start-ups.While Mr. Trump wants to stimulate foreign investment in the United States, he has also talked tough about the Middle East and terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were citizens of Saudi Arabia.In true Trumpian style, he has made somewhat contradictory statements about Saudi Arabia: \u201cSaudi Arabia \u2014 and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a campaign stop. \u201cThey spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\u201dSaudi Arabia\u2019s laws are antithetical to many Americans and even to Mr. Trump\u2019s most conservative views: Women are not allowed to drive, homosexuality is punishable by stoning to death, and freedom of religion is not permitted.Which makes it all the more surprising that when Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince, came to California last year, a who\u2019s who of technology and venture capital chief executives lined up to meet with him. The tour included meetings with Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and venture capital investors like Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel.Or maybe it is not surprising if you take the view that an influx of cash from Saudi Arabia will most likely lift the valuations of all Silicon Valley companies. Cash is cash.In fairness to Mr. Trump, if he does want to bring huge investment sums to the United States, it is hard do that without involving some countries with which we have had complicated relationships. Some of the largest money is tied up in vast sovereign wealth funds.Not all of the $50 billion investment that Mr. Son pledged to make here is likely to come from SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, the one backed by Saudi Arabia. Some of it may come directly from SoftBank, which owns Sprint and is hoping to merge it with T-Mobile.All that said, can you imagine if Mr. Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower with Prince Mohammed talking about a $50 billion investment in the United States from Saudi Arabia?It\u2019s hard to see \u2014 but then again, we live in strange times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In AMC\u2019s Western \u2018The Son,\u2019 the Novelist Philipp Meyer Lassoes TV", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byDRIFTWOOD, Tex. \u2014 On a blistering day last August, the novelist Philipp Meyer was at a cattle ranch in the grassy Hill Country of Central Texas, standing in a field that had been turned into a replica of a Comanche camp.Mr. Meyer watched as makeup artists applied fake blood and ash to the prosthetic limbs of a white buffalo hunter who had been captured and tortured by the Comanches.\u201cThis is great!\u201d he said. He studied the scene more closely, and then suggested making the charred ground around the actor\u2019s limbs bigger. After all, he noted, the fires would have been burning for hours.It\u2019s rare for novelists to wield this much influence over screen adaptations of their work. They may get an executive producer credit and an occasional ceremonial visit to the set, yet typically they just cash their checks and move on to their next novels. But Mr. Meyer is far from typical. Bald and muscular, with a square jaw and thick beard, he\u2019s handy with pistols, rifles and hunting bows, and looks more at home on a working cattle ranch than most M.F.A. graduates. He wrote three of the episodes in the first season, and rewrote the rest. And he was a near constant presence on the set throughout the five months of filming, weighing in on casting, props, costumes and the choreography of battle scenes.\u201cHe was heavily involved in everything,\u201d Mr. Brosnan, who spoke admiringly of Mr. Meyer\u2019s \u201cswagger,\u201d said. \u201cHe\u2019s a gung-ho weapons nut, with his own arsenal, and he was very specific in the choice of weapons I would use.\u201dMr. Meyer admits his obsession with historical details was \u201cprobably annoying\u201d to the other writers and producers. But his scrupulous oversight of even minute aspects of the production was always part of the bargain.\u201cHe\u2019s definitely put his fingerprints on the show,\u201d said Joel Stillerman, the president of original programming and development for AMC and SundanceTV. \u201cIt was clear that he was not comfortable just walking away, and he felt like he had something to contribute.\u201d\u201cNovelists, who are the most qualified people when it comes to the world of the books they\u2019ve written, are the first people to be benched in this process,\u201d said Mr. McGreevy, who was a writer and executive producer on the Netflix adaptation of his horror novel, \u201cHemlock Grove.\u201dTelevision has become an increasingly attractive medium for novelists (like Richard Price, Tom Perrotta and Nic Pizzolatto), who see it as an ideal form for teasing out long story arcs and subtle character development. But it\u2019s rare for them to have as much of a creative stake as Mr. Meyer does in \u201cThe Son,\u201d and he\u2019s feeling the pressure. Whether \u201cThe Son\u201d succeeds, critically and commercially, could determine whether El Jefe becomes a big player in the already heated competition for literary properties, which have become a staple of prestige television.\u201cThere\u2019s this sinking feeling of, \u2018Oh, this is years of my life,\u2019\u201d he said, using an expletive. \u201cIt almost feels like writing a first novel.\u201dSo when \u201cThe Son,\u201d which became a critically acclaimed best seller that sold 300,000 copies and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, caught the interest of several production companies, he agreed to Mr. McGreevy\u2019s pitch.\u201cI said, you can go with these heavy hitters who will back up dump trucks of money to your house but will likely marginalize you in the process, if the thing gets made at all,\u201d Mr. McGreevy said, \u201cor you can take the risk of us doing this together.\u201dMr. Meyer chose the riskier option. In the spring of 2013, he and Mr. McGreevy and Mr. Shipman wrote a 126-page script for \u201cThe Son\u201d and started shopping it to TV networks. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Entertainment Studios made on offer on the series but never followed through, and the fledgling studio later shut down.To make the multigenerational epic work dramatically, the source material underwent some major changes. In the show, one of the book\u2019s major characters, Jeanne Anne, is Eli\u2019s granddaughter, rather than his great-granddaughter, which compressed Mr. Meyer\u2019s sprawling novel into two parallel narratives, in 1849 and 1915. (The original story spans more than 160 years.)\u201cPhilipp understood that anything we did to his book didn\u2019t unwrite the book,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, the showrunner and executive producer for \u201cThe Son.\u201dStill, Mr. Meyer wasn\u2019t content to cede control. \u201cPhilipp has zero on-set experience, zero television experience, but his ideas are taken, they are valuable,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.Mr. Meyer takes a method-acting approach to writing. While researching the book, he went to extreme lengths to learn about Comanche customs and life in 19th-century Texas. At a ranch in Southwest Texas, he shot a buffalo and drank a mug full of its blood, so that he could accurately describe the taste when young Eli eats a raw buffalo liver. He studied animal tracking, fire building and plant identification at a wilderness-survival school, and learned enough Comanche to write dialogue.Mr. Meyer brought the same obsessive attention to detail to the show.\u201cIt\u2019s taken me weeks to memorize,\u201d said Zahn McClarnon, who plays Toshaway, a Comanche warrior who takes Eli under his wing. \u201cWe, as native actors, don\u2019t get any credit for that. It\u2019s like Tom Cruise learning Japanese.\u201dOccasionally, Mr. Meyer\u2019s commitment to historical accuracy created uncomfortable moments. Some of the Native American actors expressed concern that the Comanches were portrayed as savages who relished rape and torture. Mr. Meyer and the other writers made some changes to the script, like cutting the depiction of a rape.\u201cAs native people, we have been portrayed in a certain way throughout the history of television, with stereotypes,\u201d said Mr. McClarnon, who is of Lakota descent. \u201cThe producers were very open about changing things and listening to the cast and to the native advisers, and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201dStanding near the mangled body of the buffalo hunter on the set, Mr. Meyer said he was aiming to capture a bloody chapter in American history, from which no one emerged innocent. That day, they were filming some brutal scenes from an episode that takes place in the Comanche camp. The episode features Jacob Lofland as young Eli, who\u2019s been living with the tribe and feels torn over the fate of another captive, a white buffalo hunter who is being tortured to death.\u201cThey were pretty inventive with torture stuff,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cThe best political stance to take is honesty. White people did horrible things, Native Americans did horrible things.\u201dWorking on a TV show has taken a bit of a toll on his fiction writing. Mr. Meyer said he\u2019s been struggling to finish his next novel, which is overdue to his publisher.\u201cThe crazy thing is, now I have to make sure I have time to write novels,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blockchain: A Better Way to Track Pork Chops, Bonds, Bad Peanut Butter?", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byFrank Yiannas has spent years looking in vain for a better way to track lettuce, steaks and snack cakes from farm and factory to the shelves of Walmart, where he is the vice president for food safety. When the company dealt with salmonella outbreaks, it often took weeks to trace where the bad ingredients came from.Then, last year, IBM executives flew to Walmart\u2019s headquarters in Arkansas to propose a solution: the blockchain.As Mr. Yiannas studied their pitch, he said, \u201cI became increasingly convinced that maybe we were onto the holy grail.\u201dThe blockchain \u2014 the buzzy, bewildering technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin \u2014 is starting to be applied to real-world problems like tracking pork chops, shipping containers and footwear with a speed and security not currently possible. The IBM-Walmart partnership is one of the biggest practical tests to date.At its heart, blockchain simply refers to a bookkeeping method that \u201cchains\u201d together entries so that they are very difficult to modify later. It provides a way for large groups of unrelated companies to jointly keep a secure and reliable record of their transactions.IBM is trying to position itself at the forefront of the heated competition for practical uses of this arcane idea. Walmart is just one of 400 IBM clients testing it out, and IBM now has around 650 employees dedicated to the technology.Yet success is far from assured.\u201cWe believe with 100 percent certainty that it\u2019s going to matter,\u201d Mark Russinovich, the head of Microsoft\u2019s blockchain efforts, said of the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of where\u2019s its going to matter and how it\u2019s going to matter.\u201dIt was Bitcoin that first caught the attention of IBM researchers, and everyone else.Bitcoin, born in 2009, represented a novel idea in the financial world. Unlike, say, dollars or yen, Bitcoins are virtual tokens, unaffiliated with any nation. Anyone can open a wallet and receive Bitcoins \u2014 without providing any identifying information \u2014 and transactions are recorded on a universal ledger that is visible to everyone.Drug dealers have embraced its relative anonymity. And people who live in countries that strictly control their financial systems, like China and Venezuela, have used Bitcoin to store their money beyond the watchful eye of the government.But while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin\u2019s underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into \u201cblocks,\u201d and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction \u2014 a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact.In 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM.\u201cI was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM.But a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM\u2019s central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology.They explained that this was about more than just a currency \u2014 it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it.\u201cThat was the \u2018aha\u2019 for me,\u201d Mr. Krishna said. \u201cThis was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.\u201d He called it \u201ca technology that can change the world.\u201dThere are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers.But blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information.A few months after Mr. Krishna\u2019s aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM\u2019s top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities \u2014 or threats \u2014 to IBM\u2019s business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, gave the green light to.She turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, \u201cYou run with this,\u201d he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months.Her hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM\u2019s eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software.But growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers.IBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, \u201cThe first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.\u201dAfter getting Ms. Rometty\u2019s push on the blockchain, the IBM team\u2019s first move was to make its software \u201copen source,\u201d meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM\u2019s bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology.It was the chairman of IBM Europe, Erich Clementi, who personally pitched the concept to the top technology executive at Maersk. Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe.For Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships \u2014 instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities.While the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world.What\u2019s more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year.Maersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved \u2014 including Maersk and government authorities \u2014 could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged.The first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California.The difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it\u2019s unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system.\u201cYou need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,\u201d said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult part.\u201dIBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark.Not everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach.Many technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains \u2014 like the one being built by IBM \u2014 are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin\u2019s success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM\u2019s.That could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, \u201cit still concentrates power in a handful of entities,\u201d said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems.IBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come.But the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project.\u201cThey have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,\u201d Mr. Behlendorf said. \u201cWe are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.\u201dBut IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. \u201cThis is the most well-thought-out project in the space,\u201d said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor.Now all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work.At Maersk, Mr. Stausholm said it could take five or even 10 years for that to happen, given all the partners \u2014 manufacturers, customs officials and farmers \u2014 that need to come together. \u201cI really do believe in it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how fast it will be able to take off.\u201dAt Walmart, Mr. Yiannas is more optimistic. His company has already completed two pilots with IBM \u2014 moving pork from Chinese farms to Chinese stores, and produce from Latin America to the United States \u2014 and he is confident a finished version can be put together within a few years. \u201cI think this is our one best hope for getting it right,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Miscue Calls Attention to Amazon\u2019s Dominance in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 There have been many opportunities to consider how crucial Amazon has become to the smooth operation of the internet over the past few years.Among the many consequences of the shutdown: Users of the business messaging service Slack couldn\u2019t upload files. Photos on the technology news site The Verge didn\u2019t display. Quora, a popular question-and-answer site, couldn\u2019t be reached.It was a rare fumble for Amazon in cloud computing, in which companies pay to run their online applications in data centers operated by big providers.Amazon\u2019s service interruption, though not nearly bad enough to spark a panic among customers, was viewed by some as a moment for reflection.\u201cIt really is a wake-up call to enterprises,\u201d said Craig McLuckie, a former Google technologist who is now chief executive of Heptio, a start-up that makes software tools for more easily moving applications between clouds. \u201cThey certainly need to understand to what level of dependency they have on a single provider.\u201dAmazon\u2019s error was still fresh in people\u2019s minds last week at the Google Cloud Next conference, a jamboree for the search giant to show off its seriousness in cloud computing. At the beginning of her keynote speech, Diane Greene, Google Cloud\u2019s chief executive, boasted about how reliable Google\u2019s cloud service was last year. Taking a jab at Amazon, she quipped that \u201cso far, 2017 looks promising, too.\u201dIt was part of a barrage unleashed by Google to persuade potential customers that they should piggyback on the $30 billion of infrastructure investment it had made over the years.\u201cWe\u2019re here for real; this is an incredibly serious mission,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cWe have the money, means and commitment to pull off a new platform of computation globally for everyone who needs it.\u201dBut even big customers Google showcased at its conference emphasized the importance of not relying exclusively on one company. Darryl West, global chief information officer of HSBC, said at the event that the bank used Google, Amazon and Microsoft for cloud services, noting that each company has its strengths.Paul Gaffney, Home Depot senior vice president of information technology, who also spoke at the Google event, said, \u201cAll of us have a role as consumers to drive competition so multi-cloud is a very important part of doing that.\u201dOne fear among businesses is that Amazon\u2019s dominance could lead to a new form of \u201clock-in,\u201d giving it huge leverage over customers because of the costs of switching providers. In the 1980s and 1990s, those costs helped Microsoft gain a seemingly unshakable grip on personal computing. Microsoft is betting that won\u2019t happen this time.\u201cThis won\u2019t be a winner-take-all scenario,\u201d said Judson Althoff, executive vice president of Microsoft\u2019s worldwide commercial business.Although they have become credible competitors to Amazon in the past few years \u2014 especially Microsoft \u2014 the newcomers to cloud computing have a long way to go. In the fourth quarter, Amazon accounted for 40 percent of the worldwide market for public cloud services, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft and 6 percent for Google, which was tied for third place with IBM, according to Synergy Research Group.Disruptions like the one in late February in what Amazon calls its simple storage service remain rare, especially in relation to comparable computing services operated privately by companies within their own walls. Even with the problem, which lasted for about four hours, the Amazon storage service was up and running more than 99.98 percent of the time in the United States and Europe over the last 90 days, according to CloudHarmony, a cloud measurement service owned by the technology research firm Gartner.Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, did not expect what transpired to cause a rush of companies to shift their cloud computing away from Amazon. She said it was highly unusual for companies to run the same application in more than one cloud because it introduced new complexities and costs.To avoid being knocked offline, companies can set up their applications to run in multiple regions, across the company\u2019s network of data centers. All of the big cloud providers offer volume discounts, the full benefits of which customers don\u2019t get to enjoy if they divide their use of cloud services among multiple providers.Still, there are some compelling reasons to use multiple providers, Ms. Leong said. Often companies rely mostly on Amazon for cloud service, while a specific development team inside the company familiar with Microsoft technologies will use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service.A few years ago, Hearst, the media company, was exclusively using Amazon for cloud computing, but later added services from Microsoft and Google, said Philip R. Wiser, Hearst\u2019s chief technology officer. He said some of the company\u2019s internal online services had been affected by Amazon\u2019s interruption, but nothing the public would have noticed.Because it\u2019s relatively early in the emergence of cloud computing, Mr. Wiser said he believed it was important to spread one\u2019s bets around.\u201cBeing multi-cloud as a company and having the skill and understanding of how to move between investments \u2014 that is an asset,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have that as a stated mission for all of our infrastructure team.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed to this story from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Other fans hailed a \u201clast laugh.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve gotten some very nice emails from some of them saying, \u2018Now that you\u2019re submitting, you are my mortal enemy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mankoff said in a telephone interview. \u201cI think I might have to steal all the ideas that have been sent to me over the years.\u201dHe\u2019s kidding, though with him it can sometimes be hard to tell. \u201cMy mantra is to leave no joke unjoked,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel that being funny is being awake.\u201dWe talked with Mr. Mankoff, who officially departs at the end of April, about some of his favorites from among the hundreds of his own cartoons that have appeared in The New Yorker, \u201cwonky humor theory\u201d and that time he discovered that one of his punch lines had been repurposed on a thong. The excerpts here have been edited and condensed.\u201cThis is my most famous cartoon, and the punch line has been ripped off on T-shirts, even a thong. That one is a little tricky \u2014 why would you have that on a thong? I now own the trademark to the phrase. Initially, the Trademark Office denied it, but I was able to show that my cartoon is actually where this phrase, which has been cited many times, comes from.\u201d\u201cThis is an idea that comes from just seeing something. The New Yorker used to be on 42nd Street, and we could look out on the Empire State Building, a huge phallic symbolic if there ever was one. It just taps into all our obsessions, or at least men\u2019s obsessions.\u201d\u201cI did this after that Heaven\u2019s Gate cult [the group involved in a mass suicide in 1997 in California]. That\u2019s what I liked about it \u2014 it would appear that week or after, and people would associate it with that. At the same time, it would work on another level and continue to be funny. This one has been reproduced a lot. From my point of view as an atheist, it\u2019s a cartoon about religion. But it can also just be about mindlessly following a leader.\u201d\u201cA lot of my creativity comes out of my speech. It\u2019s almost like as I\u2019m talking, another editor is working, trying to finish the line. I often start a phrase and then try to flip it or exaggerate it. I\u2019m a little hard of hearing, and sometimes I\u2019ll say to my wife: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear you,\u2019 and she\u2019ll say, \u2018How far back?\u2019 This punch line is an exaggeration, but there\u2019s also a deeper truth relating to how much you actually listen to the person you\u2019re with.\u201d\u201cA lot of cartoons take place in very generic settings: two people at dinner, or sitting on the couch. Sometimes I see cartoons that are too well drawn, and I tell the cartoonists to take it back a notch \u2014 still draw well, but don\u2019t illustrate, which deadens it. There\u2019s something really nice about the simplicity of cartoons. You don\u2019t want the image to mug too much.\u201d\u201cThis is a really dumb joke that everybody loves. I loved doing this cartoon, but at the same time I thought it was dumb. But then I realized it was dumb to keep thinking it was dumb. One of the things you have to recognize about humor is that at its heart it\u2019s stupid, and we should enjoy that stupidity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dole Case Illustrates Problems in Shareholder System", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe share ownership system in the United States is fraying. And while its shortcomings have been largely behind the scenes, now they are going to cost some innocent shareholders money.Former Dole shareholders will receive $2.74 a share \u2014 a nice chunk of change in addition to the $13.50 a share originally paid in the deal. Still, because of the shareholder ownership system, some of those Dole shareholders may not get that money.The reason is that while shareholders think they own the shares they buy, they don\u2019t in a sense.That may come as a surprise to those who check their online brokerage accounts daily or see traders on a floor of an exchange reacting to price movements. A market that in many ways is open and transparent is underpinned by a system of share ownership that can be anything but.Share ownership in the United States is conducted through the Depository Trust Company, which was formed after the back-office scandal of the early 1970s. At that time, trading volume on Wall Street became too much to handle, and brokerage firms were swamped by paperwork, falling months behind.The idea was to freeze ownership of company shares in one place. Now, when Apple or Microsoft look at their share register they see only the Depository Trust Company. When trading occurred, brokers would now transfer shares among accounts at the trust company. The brokers hold the shares on behalf of customers who were the ultimate beneficial owners.The result was that the Wall Street firms could now more easily track shares by having to deal only with themselves and the Depository Trust Company. Companies were taken out of the process.Because shareholders are actually only beneficial owners, lots of odd things can happen.For example, instead of executing a trade in the market, a broker may just transfer shares among clients and mark the trade as a sale. (The broker is still required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to get the best price.)Alternatively, if a person wants to short a stock by borrowing it and selling it in the market \u2014 betting that the stock price will drop \u2014 the broker may \u201clend\u201d your shares without you knowing it.These issues have been brought to the forefront by the Dole case. In the settlement, 4,662 people and entities claimed 49,164,415 shares at $2.74 per share.There is just one problem: Dole had only 36,793,758 shares outstanding.These are probably not false claims. They go directly to the problems with the share ownership system.The first problem is that the Depository Trust Company sometimes doesn\u2019t keep track of shares. When this happens, it puts a \u201cchill\u201d on the shares, meaning that it stops tracking them because of established procedures for the final three trading days up to the closing of a merger.Instead, the money in a merger is simply paid to the brokers who are supposed to filter it down to the investors. Usually this works, but apparently in the Dole buyout, there may have been some problems with this process.The bigger problem, however, is the shorting issue. Normally, when someone shorts shares, they borrow them and then sell them. When the short position is closed, the investor buys back the shares and restores them to their lender.In a merger, the shorting party simply pays the merger consideration.There seemed to have been many shorts in Dole. Expectations that the company would obtain a higher sale price lifted Dole\u2019s shares above the terms of the buyout offer.Other investors were apparently skeptical that would happen, and more than 2.9 million shares were shorted on the last day that the trust company tracked the trading of Dole shares.For good measure, the judge, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery, noted that \u201cit bears noting for future merger cases that the problems raised by short sales and trades during the three days before closing appear endemic to the depository system and hence likely infect every claims process.\u2019\u2019In other words, this happens every time. It became a problem in the Dole settlement only because with so much money being paid out, more shareholders than usual took the trouble to submit a claim.But there is not enough money. When short sellers borrowed shares they sold them to other shareholders in the market. Under the ruling, those third parties who unknowingly bought shares that were shorted will now not be paid. Instead, the holders of the shares that were lent out will be paid. Those who bought shorted shares will be left to look to the shorters.The Dole settlement highlights that as our capital markets become ever more complex, share trading and ownership are getting harder track. But in an age when computing power is cheap, why can\u2019t we keep track of shares?But is that really necessary? The system might be fixed just by adding some computing power to better trace shares. Of course, this would require the people who control the plumbing of the markets to invest millions and millions of dollars in improvements.Alas, there is no profit to be made on an upgrade. This is an area where the nation\u2019s chief market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, needs to step in.But even this will not solve the shorting issue. When you sign up with your broker you are signing up to short shares, whether you like it or not. People are then buying shares without your knowledge.This is a problem that the brokerage firms have created, and hopefully they will fix. At a minimum, they need to stand behind the shareholders here. After all, they helped create this mess.The Deal Professor column on March 22, about a Delaware court case over shares of Dole Food, described incorrectly the capabilities of the Depository Trust Company, which provides clearing and settlement services to the stock market. The trust company does in fact have the ability to track the ownership of shares; it is not the case that the trust company does not track the shares because it is too hard or too expensive to do so. (In the case of cash buyouts like that of Dole, regulatory processes and practices dictate how payment is made on settled positions and unsettled trades.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Profitable Companies, No Taxes: Here\u2019s How They Did It", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byYet if the level is so high, why have so many companies\u2019 income tax bills added up to zero?Although the top corporate rate is 35 percent, hardly any company actually pays that. The report, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research group in Washington, found that 100 of them \u2014 nearly 40 percent \u2014 paid no taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015. Eighteen, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E, incurred a total federal income tax bill of less than zero over the entire eight-year period \u2014 meaning they received rebates. The institute used the companies\u2019 own regulatory filings to compute their tax rates.Companies take advantage of an array of tax loopholes and aggressive strategies that enable them to legally avoid paying what they owe. The institute\u2019s report cites these examples:Citing evidence in the report, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, introduced a bill on Thursday to eliminate tax loopholes that encourage companies to shift activities offshore. \u201cThe truth is that we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations,\u201d Senator Sanders said. \u201cOffshore tax haven abuse has become so absurd that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is now the \u2018home\u2019 to more than 18,000 corporations.\u201dOthers, like American Electric Power, Con Ed and Comcast, qualified for accelerated depreciation, enabling them to write off most of the cost of equipment and machinery before it wore out.Individual industries have successfully lobbied for specific tax breaks that function as subsidies: for instance, drilling for gas and oil, building Nascar racetracks or railroad tracks, roasting coffee, undertaking certain kinds of research, producing ethanol or making movies (which saved the Walt Disney Company $1.48 billion over eight years, the report says).These industry-specific subsidies mean that the goodies were not evenly distributed. Utilities logged an effective tax rate of just 3.1 percent over the eight-year period. Industrial machinery, telecommunications and oil, gas and pipeline companies paid roughly 11.5 percent. Internet services paid 15.6 percent. In just two sectors \u2014 health care and retail \u2014 companies paid more than 30 percent of their profits in federal income tax.\u201cOne of the things that jumps out pretty starkly is there\u2019s a real gap between the tax rates paid by different industries,\u201d said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the institute and a co-author of the study. \u201cWhen the biggest companies aren\u2019t paying their fair share, that means the rest of us are left to pick up the slack. It means small business and middle-income families are paying more.\u201dBut Tara DiJulio, a spokeswoman for General Electric, called the report \u201cdeeply flawed and misleading.\u201d\u201cG.E. is one of the largest payers of corporate income taxes,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the last decade, G.E. paid $32.9 billion in cash income taxes worldwide, including in the U.S., and pays more than $1 billion annually in other U.S. state, local and federal taxes.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe tax code is complex and outdated, which is exactly why tax reform must happen this year. G.E. has long been advocating to simplify and modernize the tax system \u2014 even if it means we pay more in taxes.\u201dCompanies with the biggest tax subsidies over the eight years, the institute\u2019s report said, included:Some of the tax incentives, including those enacted during the recession, were meant to increase economic growth and hiring, but the institute\u2019s report said they often didn\u2019t work that way.Republicans say their tax overhaul will eliminate some of the biggest loopholes, although critics counter that the substitute will end up further reducing companies\u2019 tax bills.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Push for Internet Privacy Rules Moves to Statehouses", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported byNow that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers\u2019 online data. States have other ideas.Illinois legislators are considering a \u201cright to know\u201d bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates.Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers\u2019 locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in internet-connected devices like mobile phones, smart TVs and personal assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo.Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois \u2014 because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of state- and country-specific features to localize their effects.Congressional Republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also assert, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation.Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction.California and Connecticut, for instance, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like email, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees\u2019 social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants.\u201cMore and more, states have taken the position that, if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,\u201d said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said.States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle.In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking to roll back regulations, not create them.But federal blockage can create local opportunities.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts \u2014 not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,\u201d said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it\u2019s going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy.\u201d\u201cI think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,\u201d said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure.Mr. Hastings said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation.In an interview, Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating email lists or giving online support to customers.\u201cHiring attorneys to write privacy policies, coming up with terms of service \u2014 that will be a real burden for small businesses,\u201d he said.\u201cWe were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive,\u201d said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC. \u201cIt\u2019s important because the Trump administration is doing so much to roll back privacy rights, so there is going to be a huge shift to state lawmakers and state attorneys general.\u201dCecilia Kang contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

It made me wonder if I need one at all. So I asked Kimber Streams, who tests laptops at The Wirecutter, a product reviews website owned by The New York Times, for some advice.For people who basically use their laptop to browse the web and send email, is there a cheap option?With a Chromebook, can I use all the Google apps and store documents and spreadsheets on Google Drive?Yes. Google\u2019s apps (which I use all the time for work) can open spreadsheets and documents, including those created in Microsoft Office. And most Chromebooks come with 100 gigabytes of free Google Drive storage for two years. Chromebooks encourage people to store documents in the cloud, because the machines have very little local storage (usually about 32 gigabytes).Microsoft also offers Office 365, a way to access Word, Excel and such on the web, if you need to use those particular programs.What\u2019s the cheapest Chromebook to buy and what do you recommend?There are $200 Chromebooks, but we don\u2019t recommend them because they usually have two gigabytes of memory and poor processors, which means you can\u2019t have more than a couple of tabs open and everything loads very slowly. They\u2019re truly painful to use, even for light browsing.I always wondered why these things can\u2019t run the apps that can run on phones, so I can do more things with them.Well, Google\u2019s working on that! But it\u2019s pretty rough around the edges right now. Google perpetually updates Chrome OS, so it\u2019s possible apps will improve over the next couple of years.When I buy a laptop, do I still need to be concerned about specs?Yes, but only a little bit.Right now, a Chromebook shouldn\u2019t have fewer than four gigabytes of memory, and a Celeron processor. A Windows laptop for everyday work needs at least eight gigs, and we recommend a Core i3 or Core i5 processor and a solid-state drive. For gaming or video editing, you\u2019ll need 16 gigabytes of memory, at least a Core i5 or i7 processor, a dedicated graphics card and a solid-state drive.Processors aren\u2019t improving as quickly as before, so any of the past few generations are fine, as long as they\u2019re Core i processors.If I still need a real laptop, what should I be thinking about? Do you even recommend the best cheap Windows machine?If you have only $500 to spend, then the cheap Windows laptop is your only option.

{"Headline": "Nintendo Switch: A Blast at Home, So-So on the Go", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byTech FixThere\u2019s a new gadget that you can count on to soon zoom to the top of people\u2019s wish lists: the Nintendo Switch.Last week, I took possession of a Switch from Nintendo to get a closer look at what the hype was all about. At home, I put the Switch on a dock to play games on my big-screen television. Over the weekend, I took the Switch off the dock for a trip to Los Angeles and used the gadget\u2019s embedded screen and attached controllers to play games while out and about.Playing with the Switch was a blast. The hardware is well designed and capable of delivering powerful graphics. And early Switch games I tested made clever use of the included motion controllers.So what\u2019s to lose? There won\u2019t be many games available for the Switch on Day 1, with only 10 titles releasing alongside the device on Friday. There were also some bugs in the unit I tested, including one that made the device fail to power on for a day.Still, getting the Switch is a risk worth taking. Its games offer an intimate form of gameplay unseen on rival consoles, and over all the system\u2019s versatility makes it worth the money.What I hated about Wii U was how much space it took up. Not only was there a console box, but there was also a superfluous, bulky touch pad controller, along with all the Wiimotes, the rectangular controllers, which had to be charged between gaming sessions. In a recent purge, I packed the system and its jungle of power cables into a trash bag and gave it to a friend without even asking for a burrito in return.With the Switch, Nintendo appears to have learned as much as it could from the negative feedback about Wii U. The setup of the Switch is a breeze: You use two cables to connect a dock to your television and a power outlet. From there, you mount the Switch to the dock so the image shows up on your TV.On the sides of the Switch are strips with physical buttons, which are actually detachable wireless controllers called Joy-Cons. Press a button to remove them, and voil\u00e0, each strip is a controller for two players. If you want to take the Switch somewhere, just reattach the Joy-Cons and remove the device from the dock.The Switch hardware felt sturdy and well made. The controllers smoothly slide on and off the device, and docking the Switch is as easy as dropping it in and letting it snap in place.There are more than two dozen minigames in 1-2-Switch, including one in which players compete while milking a virtual cow. While milking the creature, the players are instructed to lock eyes. The move is not necessary to win the game, but it illustrates how much of a novelty eye contact has become in an era that has people glued to smartphone screens, reading tablets, televisions and computers.Another challenge in 1-2-Switch has a player swinging a katana blade and the other slapping the controller to catch the blade. A boxing minigame has players competing to throw straight punches, hooks and uppercuts as quickly as possible.After milking cows, swinging samurai swords and drawing guns on each other, adults who try Switch may remember the joys of the hand-slap game they played in grade school. Children may learn for the first time that face-to-face interaction will always beat a Snapchat video, text message or emoji.Naturally, there are problems that Nintendo needs to fix with the Switch.In one instance, after my Switch was put in sleep mode, it failed to turn back on, even after the device had been charging for hours. This problem persisted for an entire day, and only after the device was left unplugged overnight did it wake back up with a low-battery icon. I suspect the software froze while the gadget was asleep, making it impossible to reboot until after the battery ran down.Nintendo said that it was looking into the issue and that a software update on Friday would improve overall system stability.The Switch is also not a great portable. Measuring about 9.5 inches wide, it is cumbersome to hold for long durations. The picture quality on the built-in screen is unremarkable: When being used as a portable, the system displays a lower pixel resolution than when it is docked for use on a TV.

Though it may be an average portable gaming device, the Switch excels as a powerful and compelling home console. With 1-2-Switch, Nintendo also already has a killer app that is a must-play for gamers of all skill levels.In fact, a friend who helped me test 1-2-Switch professed that she had never won at any video games.

{"Headline": "Howard Schmidt, Cybersecurity Adviser to Two Presidents, Dies at 67", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byHoward A. Schmidt, a computer crime expert who advised two presidents and drafted cybersecurity safeguards that were approved by Congress in 2015, died on Thursday at his home in Muskego, Wis. He was 67.The cause was brain cancer, his wife, Raemarie, said.The legislation, which evolved from precautions Mr. Schmidt proposed several years earlier, enabled government and industry to share information about potential risks from attackers\u2019 codes and techniques, shielded companies from liability lawsuits for trading data and provided privacy protections for consumers.By the time the legislation was finally approved, though, critics complained that it had been diluted in response to corporate concerns and was already technologically anachronistic.Recruited by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Mr. Schmidt returned to the White House under President Barack Obama.He also oversaw the creation of the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, an online authentication program less vulnerable than ordinary passwords to hackers engaged in identity theft or in stealing secrets from private industry or government.Mr. Schmidt won the trust of much of the business community, which was fending off a barrage of cyberattacks but which also feared government intrusion and a damper on innovation. At the same time, he suggested that the threat of full-scale cyberwarfare between governments was exaggerated and that any such conflict would be unwinnable.With the United States portraying itself as a victim of cyberwarfare and much of the world viewing Washington as a perpetrator \u2014 citing attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program as examples \u2014 the White House proclaimed its first formal international cyberspace strategy during Mr. Schmidt\u2019s tenure.That strategy mirrored the planned response to other security threats, in which the United States reserved the right to use all necessary diplomatic and military means to defend itself in the event of a hostile cyberincident. Meanwhile, Mr. Schmidt said, nations were already acting defensively.He said hackers exploited the fear that if one buyer failed to pay for secret information about a computer coding flaw, another would.\u201cIf someone comes to you with a bug that could affect millions of devices and says, \u2018You would be the only one to have this if you pay my fee,\u2019 there will always be someone inclined to pay it,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, dancing with the devil in cyberspace has been pretty common.\u201dFor much of his 40-year career, Mr. Schmidt was in the forefront of information technology and computer security for the military, government agencies and private industry. Most recently he was a partner with Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security secretary, in Ridge Schmidt Cyber, a security consultancy.In the mid-1990s, while working for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Mr. Schmidt was credited with helping to establish the federal government\u2019s first full-time computer forensic laboratory. He also served as chief security officer at Microsoft and chief information security officer at eBay.Mr. Schmidt was the president\u2019s special adviser for cyberspace security in the Bush administration from late 2001 to 2003. He was also chairman of the president\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.The Obama administration recruited him in late 2009 to be its computer security adviser. He reported to the National Security Council.Howard Anthony Schmidt was born on Oct. 5, 1949, in Philadelphia to Anthony and Edith Schmidt. He served three tours in the Air Force in Vietnam from 1968 to 1974; was a police officer in Chandler, Ariz.; and worked for the F.B.I. at the National Drug Intelligence Center.He graduated from the University of Phoenix in 1994 with a bachelor of science degree in business administration and earned a master\u2019s degree from that university.In addition to his wife, the former Raemarie Lange, a forensic scientist, Mr. Schmidt is survived by his mother, Edith Curtis; his stepmother, Gloria Schmidt; his sons, Kyle, David, Andrew and Anthony; and eight grandchildren.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Immigration System, Lauded by Trump, Is More Complex Than Advertised", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 Canada\u2019s merit-based immigration system received a loving mention by President Trump this week in his speech to Congress. Mr. Trump, who has railed against illegal immigration and talked tough about tightening borders, said adopting that kind of system would cost American taxpayers less and help increase wages for poor workers.But in Canada, immigration is not just about selecting newcomers based on their skills. It is part of a system that promotes both the economy and the country\u2019s multicultural society, which has arguably become as much a part of Canadian identity as hockey. And it is largely seen as a way to increase immigration, not reduce it.\u201cCanadians are more likely than citizens of any other industrial country to think immigration is essential to the economy and the future of the country,\u201d said Jeffrey Reitz, a professor of ethnic and immigration studies at the University of Toronto.Part of that enthusiasm is the country\u2019s recognition that, with an aging population, immigration is essential to economic growth. Add to that Canada\u2019s geography \u2014 a long border with the prosperous United States to the south and the Arctic to the north \u2014 and illegal immigration is less of an issue.And finally, Canadians have a wholehearted belief in the merit-based immigration system, which creates a positive feedback loop.\u201cThe advantage of our system is the people who come in \u2014 everyone agrees they\u2019ve passed some sort of merit system,\u201d said Ravi Pendakur, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa. \u201cThe Canadian population in particular is more willing to buy into immigration. They can see it\u2019s managed, and that\u2019s an advantage.\u201dThe program does have its drawbacks. It has become enormously complex, ever-morphing and a source of huge backlogs.Created in 1967, the merit-based system was seen as a way to select immigrants based on their \u201chuman capital\u201d and not simply their country of origin, as had been the tradition. The idea was to bring in immigrants, regardless of where they were born, with vetted qualities that would make them the most successful at integrating into the Canadian economy.Candidates received points for their level of education, ability to speak one or both of the country\u2019s official languages, work experience, age, a job offer and what immigration officials called adaptability, which meant they came with family or had family here.Two years ago, the country revamped the entire system, increasing the possible points to 1,200 and valuing a job offer at 600.Other applications were put in a job bank for employers to select. Successful applicants were promised a six-month approval, but unsuccessful ones had to reapply.Add separate point systems drafted by the country\u2019s provinces and territories based on their job markets, and the system grows even more head-scratching. Saskatchewan, for instance, is recruiting long-haul truck drivers and hospitality workers, while Alberta wants food and beverage processors.\u201cI teach this stuff and I find it confusing,\u201d said Prof. Audrey Macklin, director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Center for Criminology and Sociolegal Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently confusing, plus it keeps changing.\u201dStill, the principle remains: The immigrants coming in under this system are well educated, literate in the local language and have great credentials.\u201cIf America changes toward our system, the Apples and Microsofts and Googles will be very happy,\u201d said Robert Vineberg, a retired regional director general of immigration. \u201cBut the vegetable growers in California will not be so happy.\u201dMr. Vineberg offered government immigration statistics from 2015 as an example. That year, Canada identified 66,360 newcomers as economic immigrants for their occupational skills.Around 36,300 were categorized in the top two classes, meaning they were fluent in one national language and had a college degree. Most would have been recruited for a specific job, Mr. Vineberg said: for instance, vice president of a company or administrator of a hospital. Another 22,700 were picked for a job in skilled trades, like an industrial electrician. They needed the language skills to read a blueprint and follow complicated directions, and at least some postsecondary training and certification in their trade.Only 2,177 were brought in as laborers, and even they would have been chosen for specific positions, most likely in a hard-to-fill job or a remote location \u2014 for instance, a Japanese-speaking hotel receptionist in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Mr. Vineberg said.His example, however, illuminates the contradiction at the center of the immigration system.In 2015, almost 272,000 people were granted entry, and only a quarter were picked for their merit. Most of those counted in the economic class were family members, chosen not for their human capital \u2014 although many might also be educated and intend to work \u2014 but their blood ties.\u201cThe statistics convey the impression that Canada chooses most people based on economic criteria, and perhaps policy makers think this reassures Canadians that immigration serves Canada\u2019s economic interests,\u201d Professor Macklin said. \u201cIn reality, most people still enter on the basis of kinship. The idea that this can be easily or significantly altered is a bit of a fantasy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to be relaxed about immigration when your only land border is a huge wall with the United States,\u201d Professor Reitz said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going From Marginalized to Welcomed in the Workplace", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byPrototypeWhen Michaela Mendelsohn, the owner and chief executive of the Pollo West Corporation, arrived at her restaurant company\u2019s holiday party in 2006, it had been a year since she had seen most of her 500 employees. In that time, she had worked from her home in the Conejo Valley of Southern California and was in contact with only a handful of staff members.A rumor had circulated that she was dying of cancer. But in fact, she was transitioning from male to female, including undergoing facial and body surgeries and changing her style of dress to one she describes as very feminine.Feeling both nervous and excited, she stood up and introduced herself to her staff. \u201cThey had no idea who I was,\u201d Ms. Mendelsohn said, adding that their reaction was largely supportive.But Ms. Mendelsohn\u2019s experience was atypical. Most transgender people cannot take a hiatus from their workplace while they transition, nor do they have the options of someone who owns the company.Ms. Mendelsohn, now 64, saw a potential fix for these problems. She knew that she and others in the restaurant industry were struggling to find reliable workers and that they were overlooking the transgender demographic.In recent years, similar efforts have cropped up in Chicago, Washington, Seattle and Denver, and fledgling programs exist in New York, Las Vegas, San Diego and Atlanta.Ms. Mendelsohn said many transgender people are reluctant to even go on job interviews for fear they will be mistreated. Certification through TransCanWork is meant to help prospective employees feel comfortable in interviews and also to show employers how easy it can be to hire transgender employees, Ms. Mendelsohn said.The training includes a short video covering subjects like bathroom use, proper use of transgender pronouns and which questions are appropriate to ask. Surgery queries are off limits, for instance.In the last five years, the Pollo West Corporation has hired 40 transgender workers. Ms. Mendelsohn said that the response from customers has been overwhelmingly positive and that her transgender employees are thriving; about 25 percent have been promoted to management positions.She plans to extend TransCanWork to the retail, nonprofit, tech and hotel industries. She\u2019s also discussing with the California State Bar and other state agencies the possibility of training major industries on new regulations related to transgender hiring.Ms. Mendelsohn said she believed that the restaurant industry was also well situated to help introduce the general population to the transgender community, pointing out that California has 70,000 restaurants that employ 1.3 million people.\u201cFor the first time in their lives, customers may be forming some form of a relationship with a transgender person in a restaurant,\u201d she said. \u201cThe potential to open hearts and minds is tremendous.\u201dMarie Angel Hoole and Walker Miner, transgender employees at one of Ms. Mendelsohn\u2019s El Pollo Loco restaurants in Los Angeles who were hired through TransCanWork, said that working for a welcoming business has made a huge difference for them.Ms. Miner, originally from Palau in the Pacific Ocean, said she had trouble finding work when she first moved to the United States. \u201cAs far as employers, it\u2019s hard,\u201d she said. \u201cA boy walks in wearing makeup and they\u2019re like, \u2018Thanks, but no thanks.\u2019\u201dBy contrast, her El Pollo Loco bosses are supportive. \u201cIt\u2019s just better to work for someone where you don\u2019t have to constantly explain what you are, or say, \u2018Please acknowledge my gender identity,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Hoole, who has worked in restaurants for the past 10 years, spent a year applying for restaurant jobs in Los Angeles but was never hired despite her extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Finally last summer, she interviewed at one of Ms. Mendelsohn\u2019s restaurants; a month later, she was hired as a cashier and a drive-through attendant.The process was not daunting, and she considers her new work environment \u201cmore inclusive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a sisterhood.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Critics on Climate Policy Hope Executives Can Sway Him", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byJeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric\u2019s chief executive, says climate change is real, a position at odds with the Trump administration.As a member of a White House manufacturing advisory council, he also has President Trump\u2019s ear. And environmentalists are counting on Mr. Immelt, and other executives close to the president, to use that access to argue for policies to combat global warming when the White House is rolling them back.\u201cMr. Trump says the business perspective is especially important, so hearing the business voice is critical,\u201d said Kevin Moss, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington.\u201cThe companies are demonstrating that it\u2019s in their business interest to take action on climate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more they\u2019re willing to say that and take action, the stronger the message comes across.\u201dThose hopes have become increasingly urgent as Mr. Trump \u2014 against the warnings of scientists, environmentalists and even the government\u2019s own research \u2014 has moved to nullify the Obama administration\u2019s efforts on climate change.In a joint statement after the order, a group of technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, urged Mr. Trump to stay the course.\u201cStrong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change,\u201d they said.That action also spurred Mr. Immelt to write a blog post to G.E.\u2019s 300,000 employees in which he criticized the rollback.Jennifer Friedman, a General Electric spokeswoman, declined to say whether Mr. Immelt intended to relay his thoughts to Mr. Trump personally. Many other companies also declined to commit their executives to intervening with the president on climate-related policies.But Ms. Friedman emphasized that Mr. Immelt was outspoken, and she cited G.E.\u2019s focus on clean energy, including Current, a subsidiary that focuses on products and services in energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage to large customers.\u201cHe\u2019s pretty out there and clear,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s his position in every conversation he has.\u201dA PepsiCo spokesman, Jay Cooney, said the company believes that \u201ccombating climate change is critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers and our world.\u201d Kevin Gardner of Walmart, said its environmental commitments were \u201cembedded in our business.\u201dThomas Hushen, spokesman for Campbell Soup, said the company supported \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in the Paris agreement and the continuation of low-carbon policies and investment in a low-carbon economy.\u201d Campbell\u2019s chief executive, Denise Morrison, participates in Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory council because \u201cwe believe it is important to have a voice on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees.\u201d Mr. Hushen said.Corporations, especially those with strong consumer brands, have been increasingly responsive to customer and shareholder concerns about climate change. And the global nature of their businesses means many of their customers are in countries where there is a greater acceptance of the science behind climate change, and the need to tackle it.Walmart, Intel, General Motors and Lockheed Martin \u2014 all of which have senior executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business councils \u2014 have signed on to the principles of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofit groups working to make corporate purchases of renewable energy easier. Last year, General Motors said it would generate or procure 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050.Dell, another company with the president\u2019s ear, says it expects to reduce the energy intensity of its products by 80 percent by 2020.\u201cIn many cases, I think businesses disagree with the administration,\u201d said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder resolutions to advocate for greater corporate environmental and social responsibility.\u201cPeople still care about climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cThe administration may not, but they do have consumers and employees and reputations to uphold.\u201dAn Intel spokeswoman, Katie Lewallen, said, \u201cRegardless of regulatory changes, we intend to continue our commitment to environmental stewardship, including working to fulfill the climate change pledge we made in 2015.\u201dEnvironmentalists also worry about the influence of companies that have opposed climate regulations. General Motors and Ford, for example, successfully advocated a review of stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution.Businesses are pushing for policies to fight climate change \u201cbecause of a well-balanced economic judgment of whether or not they should,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group.He added that sentiment among corporate executives had, after the 2009 global climate conference in Copenhagen, shifted away from the belief that fighting climate change would be too expensive.\u201cIn Paris, there was a very significant number of business leaders that had changed their minds and considered that it was going to hurt the economy if we don\u2019t do something,\u201d he said.Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "WikiLeaks Reignites Tensions Between Silicon Valley and Spy Agencies", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Four years ago, Edward J. Snowden\u2019s disclosures that the federal government was hacking America\u2019s leading technology companies threw the industry into turmoil.Major technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, were trying to assess how badly their core products had been compromised. But one thing clearly had been ruptured yet again: trust between intelligence agencies and Silicon Valley.\u201cAfter the Snowden disclosures, the Obama administration worked hard to re-establish relationships and government-industry partnerships,\u201d said David Gutelius, chief executive of the marketing technology company Motiva, who has worked with the federal government on national security projects. \u201cThis leak will challenge those ties to some extent. But I don\u2019t see companies simply walking away from the table as a result of this. Government and industry still need one another.\u201dThe tense relationship between the technology industry and government agencies has been well documented. After the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the government appeared to give some ground to the industry, which was angered by previously unknown snooping on their products and embarrassed by disclosures of their cooperation with intelligence agencies.The government allowed companies to describe in broad terms the number of secret court orders for access to customer information that they receive. President Barack Obama also promised that the government would share knowledge of security flaws so that they could be fixed.In that case, the government eventually found a way into the phone without Apple\u2019s assistance.Apple said Tuesday night that many of those security issues had already been patched in the latest version of its software and it was working to address remaining vulnerabilities.The leaked documents also identified at least two dozen flaws in Android, the most popular operating system for smartphones, which was developed by Alphabet\u2019s Google division.Google said it was studying the flaws identified by WikiLeaks. Android is more difficult to secure than Apple\u2019s software because many phone makers and carriers use older or customized versions of the software.The documents released by WikiLeaks reveal numerous efforts by the C.I.A. to take control of Microsoft Windows, the dominant operating system for personal computers, using malware. They include techniques for infecting DVDs and USB storage devices with malware that can be spread to computers when they are plugged in.\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the report and are looking into it,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement.Security experts said it was not surprising that the government had stockpiled flaws in major technology products to use for spying. \u201cThe real scandal and damaging thing is not knowing these things exist, but that the C.I.A. could be so careless with them that they leaked out,\u201d said Matthew D. Green, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University.Inside technology companies, the revelations set off a scramble to assess the potential damage to the security of their products.The vulnerabilities, some of which were already known in the security community, could leave individual users of computers, mobile phones and other devices open to being snooped on. Technology companies are likely to plug the holes, however, even as new ones are discovered by spy agencies and others.The more serious near-term effect could be on the reputation of the C.I.A. and the relationship between the technology industry and the intelligence community.Denelle Dixon, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox web browser and was mentioned in the WikiLeaks trove, said that if the reports were accurate, the C.I.A. and WikiLeaks were undermining the security of the internet.\u201cThe C.I.A. seems to be stockpiling vulnerabilities, and WikiLeaks seems to be using that trove for shock value rather than coordinating disclosure to the affected companies to give them a chance to fix it and protect users,\u201d Ms. Dixon said in a statement. \u201cAlthough today\u2019s disclosures are jarring, we hope this raises awareness of the severity of these issues and the urgency of collaborating on reforms.\u201dOren Falkowitz, a former N.S.A. official and the chief executive of the cyberdefense firm Area 1 Security, said that WikiLeaks, run by Julian Assange, had again succeeded in disrupting the status quo, as it did during last year\u2019s presidential election with the release of emails from the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIf you understand the Assange playbook,\u201d Mr. Falkowitz said, \u201ca lot of it is just to create chaos.\u201dBut Mr. Falkowitz added that perhaps the most important message behind Tuesday\u2019s leaks was that neither government agencies nor companies can trust their employees to keep their most precious information secret.\u201cWe expect governments to be involved in espionage,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t expect is that the people within these organizations would create vulnerabilities by disclosing them.\u201dIn a statement accompanying the documents, WikiLeaks said that the security flaws could easily fall into the wrong hands.\u201cOnce a single cyber \u2018weapon\u2019 is \u2018loose\u2019 it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike,\u201d the organization said. It said it was still reviewing whether to release any of the underlying software code.The security flaws described by WikiLeaks are intended to target individual phones. They do not appear to give the intelligence agencies the ability to intercept electronic communications en masse.\u201cWhat can you do as a user to defend?\u201d he asked. \u201cBoring stuff. Keep your software up to date. Don\u2019t run unneeded apps. Don\u2019t become a C.I.A. target.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nintendo Switch: Unconventional Hype for an Unusual Game Console", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byEvery few years, one of the big video game companies comes out with a new box that it wants consumers to make space for in their living rooms.These systems, known as game consoles, invariably promise wondrous new twists that enhance the experience of playing games \u2014 better graphics, online matches, innovative methods of interacting with games. Thunderous hype machines accompany these new devices. The boxes that hit all the right notes become spectacular hits that often are nearly impossible to find in stores, creating lines whenever new shipments turn up.Here\u2019s the anatomy of a typical game console launch and how Switch compares.This is the big moment when a new console is first shown, usually at a special event put on by the console maker during the giant E3 games convention in Los Angeles or a couple of months before it, like the event below by Microsoft in 2013.Technical details of the hardware are shared with an audience of industry insiders and gamer press who build buzz for new products among fans. Retailers fiddle with their marketing and merchandising plans.At this stage, game publishers have already privately gained access to crucial details that allow them to begin developing games for the new consoles. A handful of them usually show short demonstrations of those games, as do in-house studios that the console makers control. This kind of eye candy, not the hardware on its own, is what gets gamers excited about buying a new system.The trailer raised almost as many questions as it answered. What were the technical specs for the system? How much would it cost? What games would be available for it and when? Nintendo stayed mum, though it said Switch would be released in March \u2014 missing the holiday season last year.Instead, the video showed the basics of how Switch can alternate between being played at home, where it can be plugged into a television through a dock, and on the go, where it functions more like a tablet with dedicated controls.Console makers will also do grass-roots marketing to get their new systems into the hands of consumers. Nintendo is a big believer in this approach, in part because the twists it introduces with its new consoles often involve how games are played rather than improvements in graphics, the forte of Microsoft and Sony.All of the hype is designed to make a big splash on the day a new console finally goes on sale. This is also when one of the most persistent conspiracy theories about game console launches gathers steam.If the teams at console makers have done their job by designing a compelling product and marketing it effectively, Day 1 demand for the systems is very high. Millions of die-hard gamers who are willing to take risks when buying new technology are begging console makers to take their money.As companies start to make new boxes, manufacturing is at its most inefficient, said Robbie Bach, a former senior Microsoft executive who oversaw the introduction of the first two Xbox consoles. There may be new chips and other parts that are in short supply because they\u2019ve never been made before.Testing of new consoles can turn up manufacturing defects that require tens of thousands of units to be reworked. Finished units usually have to be sent from Asia on ships across the ocean because faster air shipments are too costly, Mr. Bach said.According to a former Nintendo executive, who asked for anonymity to avoid conflict with the company, Nintendo was cautious about making new systems because its prior console, the GameCube, had not sold well.With the March launch of Switch, Nintendo has missed peak shopping season. And while a new game in the popular Zelda series is being released for Switch at launch, a new Mario game \u2014 always a big draw for Nintendo fans \u2014 will not be available until the holidays.\u201cSupply and demand should be closer to being balanced,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.On the other hand, the company has less competition from other game companies at the moment. Nintendo has promised to make two million Switches available for sale this month, a big number but still possibly not enough.While it may seem like a coda to the spectacle of a console\u2019s initial launch, a new system\u2019s second year on the market is the one that really matters. By the second holiday season, companies have hopefully ironed out most of their manufacturing issues and supplies of new consoles are better in stores.More important, the games are better and more plentiful. It\u2019s a truism in games that the first wave of titles is not of equal measure to those that come later, after game makers have learned how to harness the technology.This is also the moment when game consoles move from early adopters to a bigger audience. There tends to be greater variety \u2014 more genres catering to different tastes \u2014 in Year 2. The unusual timing of Nintendo\u2019s release of Switch may change this pacing slightly, making its first holiday season more important.\u201cThey certainly have an independent streak,\u201d Mr. Bach said.Advertisement"}

Expert at Baidu, Andrew Ng, Resigns From Chinese Search Giant", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In 2014, Baidu announced a hiring coup in the world of artificial intelligence: It had brought in the Stanford and Google alumnus Andrew Ng to lead a new research lab in Silicon Valley.His departure is a blow to Baidu, which has been betting big on artificial intelligence, a technology that is expected to undergird a range of others, like voice recognition and driverless cars.In a post on Facebook and Twitter, Baidu said: \u201cAndrew Ng joined Baidu with a shared goal, to improve life through artificial intelligence. Today, that goal remains strong. Thank you, and all the best on your new chapter!\u201dThe company now has more than 1,300 employees dedicated to A.I. In a signal of just how critical the efforts are to the company, it said in January that it had hired Qi Lu, a former executive at Microsoft and an A.I. specialist, to become the chief operating officer.The resignations underline how that trend never materialized. Few American tech executives followed them, and China\u2019s internet behemoths remain mostly focused on their home markets.In his post on Tuesday, Mr. Ng struck a positive note: \u201cBaidu\u2019s A.I. is incredibly strong, and the team is stacked up and down with talent; I am confident A.I. at Baidu will continue to flourish.\u201dMr. Ng wrote that he would continue working to ensure A.I. made \u201clife better for everyone.\u201d He wrote that he saw the technology\u2019s impact going far beyond large tech companies like Google and Baidu.\u201cIn addition to transforming large companies to use A.I., there are also rich opportunities for entrepreneurship as well as further A.I. research.\u201dMr. Ng is part of a still-small coterie of researchers who are experts in deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that seeks to use computers to emulate the functions of the human brain. During his time at Baidu, Mr. Ng said the lab at Silicon Valley had helped create two different business units, one that works on speech recognition and another focused on driverless cars.As China\u2019s most dominant search engine, Baidu has long had a lock on a profitable section of online advertising. Yet as more Chinese consumers picked up smartphones, the company has struggled to keep its hold on ad spending. In a bid to surpass its rivals, the company has poured money into A.I. technology that executives say will support next-generation products.Mr. Ng wrote that the lab he helped start and is now leaving is working on many of those technologies, \u201csuch as face-recognition (used in turnstiles that open automatically when an authorized person approaches), Melody (an A.I.-powered conversational bot for health care) and several more.\u201d\u201cAs the principal architect of Baidu\u2019s A.I. strategy, I am proud to have led the incredible rise of A.I. within the company,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner Still Benefiting From Business Empire, Filings Show", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, will remain the beneficiaries of a sprawling real estate and investment business still worth as much as $740 million, despite their new government responsibilities, according to ethics filings released by the White House Friday night.Ms. Trump will also maintain a stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The hotel, just down the street from the White House, has drawn protests from ethics experts who worry that foreign governments or special interests could stay there in order to curry favor with the administration.It is unclear how Ms. Trump would earn income from that stake. Mr. Kushner\u2019s financial disclosures said that Ms. Trump earned between $1 million and $5 million from the hotel between January 2016 and March 2017, and put the value of her stake at between $5 million and $25 million.The disclosures were part of a broad, Friday-night document release by the White House that exposed the assets of as many as 180 senior officials to public scrutiny. The reports showed the assets and wealth of senior staff members at the time they entered government service.Those disclosures included the assets of Gary D. Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs who now leads the National Economic Council, Kellyanne Conway, the pollster and counsel to Mr. Trump and Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist to the president.Mr. Bannon\u2019s most valuable asset was Bannon Strategic Advisors Inc., a privately held consulting firm into which income from his other investments appeared to flow. It was valued at between $5 million and $25 million. He also held bank accounts valued at up to $2.25 million, and rental real estate worth as much as $10.5 million.Ms. Conway earned at least $842,614 last year, and perhaps slightly more, the filings show. Her assets are valued at between $11 million and at least $44.2 million.Mr. Cohn is far wealthier, with assets valued between $253 million and $611 million, and income last year as high as $77 million. Another White House official, Reed Cordish, who heads up technology initiatives, accumulated assets as a Maryland developer valued as high as $424 million.\u201cI think one of the really interesting things that people are going to see today \u2014 and I think it\u2019s something that should be celebrated \u2014 is that the president has brought a lot of people into this administration, and this White House in particular, who have been very blessed and very successful,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. The officials \u201chave given up a lot to come into government by setting aside a lot of assets,\u201d he said.Until January, Mr. Kushner was the chief executive of Kushner Companies, a family-run real estate investment firm with holdings across the country. It is a growing business that has taken part in at least $7 billion of acquisitions over the past decade.Late Friday, the White House released details of the plan devised by his advisers to avoid conflicts of interest between Mr. Kushner\u2019s government role and the wide-ranging business empire he ran with his father. That business depends on foreign investment from undisclosed sources, as well as billions of dollars in loans from the world\u2019s biggest financial services firms.Although Mr. Kushner has stepped down from his management positions at the more than 200 entities that operated aspects of the family real estate business, he will remain a beneficiary of a vast majority of the business he ran for the past decade, through a series of trusts that already owned the various real estate companies.The plan laid out on Friday \u201cis not sufficient,\u201d said Larry Noble, a former general counsel and chief ethics officer for the Federal Election Commission. \u201cWhile removing himself from the management of the businesses is an important step, he is still financially benefiting from how the businesses do. This presents potential for a conflict of interest. Given his level in the White House and broad portfolio, it\u2019s hard to see how he will recuse himself from everything that may impact his financial interest.\u201dWhile the filing discloses Mr. Kushner\u2019s personal lenders, it does not provide information on his business partners or lenders to his projects.His real estate firm has borrowed money from the likes of Goldman Sachs, the Blackstone Group, Deutsche Bank and the French bank Natixis. It also received loans from Israel\u2019s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim, which is the subject of a United States Justice Department investigation into allegations that it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes using undeclared accounts.Mr. Kushner\u2019s company and the firm, Anbang Insurance Group, agreed to end the talks on Wednesday after weeks of negative publicity about the deal, criticized as a bailout of the Kushners. The building had already been rescued by a number of prominent firms, including the private equity giant Carlyle Group, and Zara, the Spanish fashion retailer founded and owned by Amancio Ortega, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men.Mr. Kushner has divested his stakes in any businesses connected to that property.The disclosures do not reveal the names of investors and lenders to ventures that Mr. Kushner is retaining a stake in. For example, the form shows Mr. Kushner is retaining a stake in a limited liability corporation that owns a Trump-branded luxury rental high-rise building in Jersey City worth as much as $5 million. That project was financed with tens of millions of dollars from wealthy Chinese investors through a controversial visa-for-sale program called EB-5.However, the filing does not disclose the names of any of those investors \u2014 or partners in any of his other projects.\u201cWe don\u2019t know who the business partners are in many of these investments,\u201d Mr. Noble said, \u201cand those business partners may also have interests that will be affected by how he advises the government. And that\u2019s a concern.\u201d\u201cHe could have foreign business partners who have a real interest in policy, and he may be advising the president on those policies,\u201d Mr. Noble added. \u201cThis is a dark area where we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201dIn all, the Kushner company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.Previous disclosures by the United States Office of Government Ethics showed that Mr. Kushner had divested his interests in several entities, mostly partnerships connected to a venture capital firm run by his brother, Joshua, called Thrive Capital, that invests in technology firms like Instagram.He also shed his interests in funds run by the private equity giant Blackstone Group \u2014 whose chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, is an economic adviser to Mr. Trump \u2014 as well as BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager.Over all, he has shed his stakes in 58 businesses.He is still the sole primary beneficiary of a majority of the trusts that will retain assets, with his children as the secondary beneficiaries.Mr. Kushner was required to submit some limited financial information for his wife, Ms. Trump, who will continue to receive payments from the Trump Organization as well as her fashion brand.Ms. Trump, who now serves as an assistant to the president, resigned from her leadership roles at both companies. Instead of performance-based payments, Ms. Trump will receive fixed payments from T International Realty, the family\u2019s luxury brokerage agency, as well as fixed fees from two entities related to real estate projects, the documents show.The disclosure forms released Friday for less senior White House staff members were not reviewed by the federal Office of Government Ethics. Only the White House Counsel\u2019s Office examines their assets to determine if there are potential conflicts, and to decide what steps employees must take to sell assets, resign positions or recuse themselves from decisions.Already, a complaint has been filed against at least one White House staff member for taking actions that might benefit his own financial interests. Christopher P. Liddell, an assistant to the president and the director of strategic initiatives, had been the chief financial officer of companies including Microsoft, International Paper and General Motors before taking his White House job. Until recently, he also owned stock in General Motors, according to disclosure forms, among more than 750 other companies.\u201cIt is Ethics 101 \u2014 the most basic thing you are not supposed to do: using your official capacity to benefit your financial interest,\u201d said Norman Eisen, who served as a White House ethics lawyer during the Obama administration and now is a co-chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.The White House did not respond Friday when asked about the complaint.Rachel Abrams, Sarah Cohen, Jeremy Bowers, Andrew Lehren, Steve Eder and Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Opposing Views on What to Do About the Data We Create", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Data is the new oil, and we humans are the wells. Our digital crude is a rich brew of mundane, everyday activities \u2014 our searches, texts and tweets \u2014 along with the GPS coordinates from our phones, the biometric information we share with fitness devices, even the IP addresses of our connected refrigerators. To the average person, this raw material is undetectable noise. But for organizations that know how to identify signals, there\u2019s immense value in refining what has become an unlimited supply.Understanding what data we create, and how others exploit it, is vitally important. Soon, powerful machine-learning algorithms and artificially intelligent systems will analyze our data to reach decisions about and for us: whether we qualify for a bank loan, whether we\u2019re likely to commit a crime, whether we deserve an organ transplant. And unlike us, machines aren\u2019t burdened with an emotional attachment to privacy.The popular old data-as-oil idea opens Andreas Weigend\u2019s new book, \u201cData for the People,\u201d an exhaustive and insightful look at how data is collected and used, often without our knowledge and almost always without our input. Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon, details the \u201csocial data\u201d that emanates from billions of cameras, sensors and other devices, as well as social networks, online retailers and dating apps. Data refineries \u2014 those companies and people who turn our digital crude into profitable information \u2014 hunt for patterns, then sort us into buckets based on our behavior: what we might buy, what we\u2019ll watch, whom we might fall in love with. As Weigend points out, this exchange benefits everyone: If we let ourselves be mined, we receive personalized recommendations, connections and deals. Yet there\u2019s an imbalance of power. Companies make a lot of money from our data, and we have very little say in how it\u2019s used.Weigend argues persuasively that in this \u201cpost-privacy\u201d world, we should give our data freely, but that we should expect certain protections in return. He advocates a set of rights to increase data refineries\u2019 transparency and to increase our own agency in how information is used. Companies like OkCupid, WeChat and Spotify should perform data safety audits, submit to privacy ratings and calculate a score based on the benefits they provide \u2014 a sort of credit score for the companies that mine our data. Meanwhile, we should have the right to amend, blur and import or export our own data into any system we please.Not everyone believes that our information should be freely available as long as we agree to the terms of use. In \u201cThe Art of Invisibility,\u201d the internet security expert Kevin Mitnick advocates the opposite. Mitnick notes various reasons we may want to hide our data: We\u2019re wary of the government; we don\u2019t want businesses intruding into our lives; we have a mistress; we are the mistress; we\u2019re a criminal. Mitnick, who served five years in prison for hacking into corporate networks and stealing software, offers a sobering reminder of how our raw data \u2014 from email, cars, home Wi-Fi networks and so on \u2014 makes us vulnerable. He describes basic privacy protections (using a strong password, avoiding public computers) along with more advanced techniques (encrypting files on a hard drive, using a VPN and Bitcoin for online purchases). Most will seem familiar and perhaps rudimentary to those with any technical savvy. For everyone else, he offers an uncomfortable view of how data can be exploited.Both books are meant to scare us, and the central theme is privacy: Without intervention, they suggest, we\u2019ll come to regret today\u2019s inaction. I agree, but the authors miss the real horror show on the horizon. The future\u2019s fundamental infrastructure is being built by computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and security experts just like Weigend and Mitnick, who do not recognize their own biases. This encodes an urgent flaw in the foundation itself. The next layer will be just a little off, along with the next one and the one after that, as the problems compound.Right now, humans and machines engage in \u201csupervised learning.\u201d Experts \u201cteach\u201d the system by labeling an initial data set; once the computer reaches basic proficiency, they let it try sorting data on its own. If the system makes an error, the experts correct it. Eventually, this process yields highly sophisticated algorithms capable of refining and using our personal data for a variety of purposes: automatically sorting spam out of your inbox, say, or recommending a show you\u2019ll like on Netflix. Then, building on this foundation of data and algorithms, more teaching and learning takes place.But human bias creeps into computerized algorithms in disconcerting ways. In 2015, Google\u2019s photo app mistook a black software developer for a gorilla in photos he uploaded. In 2016, the Microsoft chatbot Tay went on a homophobic, anti-Semitic rampage after just one day of interactions on Twitter. Months later, reporters at ProPublica uncovered how algorithms in police software discriminate against black people while mislabeling white criminals as \u201clow risk.\u201d Recently when I searched \u201cC.E.O.\u201d on Google Images, the first woman listed was C.E.O. Barbie.Data scientists aren\u2019t inherently racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. But they are human, and they harbor unconscious biases just as we all do. This comes through in both books. In Mitnick\u2019s, women appear primarily in anecdotes and always as unwitting, jealous or angry. Near the end, Mitnick describes trying to enter Canada from Michigan, and wonders if he\u2019s stopped \u201cbecause a Middle Eastern guy with only a green card was driving.\u201d (He might be right, but he doesn\u2019t allow for the possibility that his own criminal record could also be responsible.)Weigend\u2019s book is meticulously researched, yet nearly all the experts he quotes are men. Early on he tells the story of Latanya Sweeney, who in the 1990s produced a now famous study of anonymized public health data in Massachusetts. She proved that the data could be traced back to individuals, including the governor himself. But Sweeney is far better known for something Weigend never mentions: She\u2019s the Harvard professor who discovered that \u2014 because of her black-sounding name \u2014 she was appearing in Google ads for criminal records and background checks. Weigend could have cited her to address bias in the second of his six rights, involving the integrity of a refinery\u2019s social data ecosystem. But he neglects to discuss the well-documented sexism, racism, xenophobia and homophobia in the machine-learning infrastructure.The omission of women and people of color from something as benign as book research illustrates the real challenge of unconscious bias in data and algorithms. Weigend and Mitnick rely only on what\u2019s immediate and familiar \u2014 an unfortunately common practice in the data community. University computer science, math and physics departments lack diversity in staff and coursework. Corporate data science is homogeneous. So are professional and academic conferences, where the future of data is discussed. If the people mining and processing our data are nothing like us, and if the machines learn only from them, our data can yield only warped caricatures, like the zombies you see on TV.As a futurist, I try to figure out how your data will someday power things like artificially intelligent cars, computer-assisted doctors and robot security agents. That\u2019s why I found both books concerning. Think of all the characteristics that make up who you are: how much coffee you drink, how fast you drive, how often you open your refrigerator, your respiratory rate, what slang you use, the random strangers you\u2019ve friended on Facebook. You may look like Weigend and Mitnick and therefore may not have experienced algorithmic discrimination yet. You, too, should be afraid. We\u2019ve only recently struck oil.Amy Webb, chief executive of the Future Today Institute, is the author of \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream.\u201d Advertisement"}

School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said.\u201cApple is struggling,\u201d said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource.Apple said education was a longstanding value for the company.\u201cMac and iPad are the best tools in education to help teachers teach and students learn,\u201d Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of product marketing, wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly passionate about education and new programs like Apple Teacher,\u201d a site for teachers who want to learn how to more creatively use Apple tools with their students, she said.The rise of Google\u2019s Chromebooks has disrupted the momentum of Apple, which has been marketing its computers to schools for some 40 years.The shift toward Google-powered devices is hurting Apple\u2019s revenue. Of the $7.35 billion that schools, colleges and universities spent on mobile and desktop computers in 2016, sales of Apple devices fell to $2.8 billion in 2016, from about $3.2 billion in 2015, according to IDC, a market research firm. Windows devices generated $2.5 billion in 2016, up from $2.1 billion in 2015, while Chrome devices reached $1.9 billion, up from $1.4 billion.The Chromebook has beaten out classroom competitors on pricing, usability and other factors. Chromebooks run apps through Google\u2019s cloud-based Chrome operating system, making them cheaper \u2014 and often faster to boot up \u2014 than traditional laptops that rely on hard drives.Because Chromebooks store documents in the cloud, they can be shared among students, who can grab any school device to access their class work. Google also provides school administrators with an online dashboard to remotely manage thousands of the laptops at once.Then there is the keyboard issue. While school administrators generally like the iPad\u2019s touch screens for younger elementary school students, some said older students often needed laptops with built-in physical keyboards for writing and taking state assessment tests.The public school system in Eudora, Kan., for instance, used to have rolling carts of iPads for elementary school classrooms and MacBook carts for older students to share. But last year, when administrators wanted to provide a laptop for each high school student, the district bought 500 Chromebooks at about $230 each.\u201cAt the end of the day, I can get three Chromebooks for each of the Mac devices I would have purchased,\u201d said Steve Splichal, the superintendent of Eudora Public Schools. He added that Eudora students continued to use MacBooks for certain creative courses and that first graders and younger students still used iPads.A picture caption on Friday with an article about Apple devices that are losing ground in American classrooms to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on the Chrome operating system from Google, misspelled part of the name of a place in Maryland where children were shown using Chromebooks. It is Glen Burnie, not Glenn Burnie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook and Twitter Could Face Fines in Germany Over Hate Speech Posts", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Social media giants including Facebook and Twitter are not doing enough to curb hate speech on their platforms and could face fines of up to $53 million if they do not strengthen their efforts to delete illegal posts, a German government minister said on Tuesday.For tech companies and free speech campaigners, this global regulatory push could limit how individuals communicate online by restricting people\u2019s digital activities and allowing governments to expand their control over vast parts of the internet.Yet for a growing number of policy makers in Europe, the United States and elsewhere, social media companies have a responsibility to block harmful content from their digital platforms, and they must respect national rules that often run counter to Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to operate across borders.On Tuesday, Heiko Maas, Germany\u2019s minister of justice and consumer protection, said he would propose a law that would impose stiff fines on companies whose social media platforms did not respond swiftly enough to complaints about illegal content. Mr. Maas has been a vocal critic of how companies treat online content that violates the country\u2019s strict rules on hate speech.\u201cThis will set binding standards for how companies running social networks must handle complaints and require them to delete criminal content,\u201d Mr. Maas said of the proposal.If the law is approved, tech companies may face fines of up to 50 million euros, or $53 million, for not combating hate speech, potentially the highest such penalty in the Western world.It would require social media platforms to make it easy for users to report contentious material, and to respond to those requests promptly. It calls for \u201cobviously criminal content\u201d to be deleted or blocked within 24 hours, while companies would have seven days to remove posts that are less clear-cut.Communications experts in Germany welcomed the move.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the internet will no longer be a free space,\u201d said Birgit Stark, head of the institute for communications at the University of Mainz. \u201cYou can\u2019t just defame people, just because it is the internet.\u201dThe development followed the publication on Tuesday of the results of a study that showed that Facebook and Twitter failed to meet the German target of removing 70 percent of hate speech within 24 hours of being alerted to its presence.The yearlong study noted that while the two companies eventually erased nearly all illegal hate speech, in January and February, Facebook managed to delete 39 percent in the time frame sought by the German authorities and Twitter 1 percent. Google\u2019s YouTube video service fared the best, taking down within 24 hours 90 percent of all content flagged.Since September, the figure for Facebook has fallen by seven percentage points, while Twitter\u2019s takedown rate has not changed. The issue has taken on new urgency as Germany gears up for parliamentary elections in September.Tech companies deny playing fast and loose with national hate speech laws, saying they have taken down illegal material when it has been flagged by users. They also argue, however, that there is a fine line between complying with a country\u2019s rules and outright censorship.\u201cWe are doing far more than any other company to try and get on top of hate speech on our platform,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe, said in an interview late last year. \u201cWe recognize that this is a work in progress.\u201dGermany, where it is illegal to promote Nazi ideology or to deny the Holocaust, has been at the center of the debate about what can be published on social media platforms and who is responsible for such content.Many Germans \u2014 among the most engaged users of these services \u2014 also remain overtly wary of how much information American tech companies routinely collect about their online activities. Facebook and Google have run into problems with local lawmakers over what can be disseminated on their social networks and on video sites like YouTube.\u201cWe are disappointed by the results,\u201d Klaus Gorny, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday referring to the German government study. \u201cWe have clear rules against hate speech and work hard to keep it off our platform.\u201dAl Verney, a YouTube spokesman, said that the company was analyzing the proposed legislation and that the video service\u2019s procedures for taking things down were robust. Twitter declined to comment on Mr. Maas\u2019s proposal.The German criticism over how social media companies handle hate speech and other illicit content online is part of a wider global pushback.\u201cTrust is one of the main assets that social media has,\u201d Andrus Ansip, a European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital agenda, said in an interview last month. \u201cIf people can\u2019t trust these channels, then they will stop using these platforms.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Richard Allen. This correction was delayed because the error was pointed out to editors only recently.Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin, and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With WikiLeaks Claims of C.I.A. Hacking, How Vulnerable Is Your Smartphone?", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byWhat is the C.I.A. program?By the end of 2016, the C.I.A. program had 5,000 registered users, including government employees and contractors. And they had produced more than a thousand hacking systems. The agency\u2019s arsenal, the documents indicate, included an array of malware ranging from viruses to clandestine \u201czero day\u201d vulnerabilities in the software of major companies.The files have circulated among former United States government hackers and contractors in \u201can unauthorized manner, one of whom provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive,\u201d WikiLeaks said.WikiLeaks said it was publishing the documents while redacting and anonymizing some passages, including the names of \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of C.I.A. targets. WikiLeaks said it was not distributing \u201carmed cyberweapons.\u201dHow vulnerable is my smartphone?The software targeted by the hacking program included the most popular smartphone operating systems: Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android.The C.I.A. hacking initiative had a \u201cmobile devices branch,\u201d which developed an array of attacks on popular smartphones to infect and extract data, including a user\u2019s location, audio and text messages, and to covertly activate a phone\u2019s camera and microphone.Apple\u2019s iPhone software, according to the documents, was a particular target, including the development of several \u201czero day\u201d exploits \u2014 a term for attacking coding flaws the company would not have known about.Though Apple has only 15 percent of the global smartphone market, the intensive C.I.A. effort was probably explained by the \u201cpopularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.\u201dGoogle\u2019s Android, the most widely used smartphone operating system, seemed to have received even more attention. By 2016, the C.I.A. had 24 weaponized Android \u201czero day\u201d software programs.Did the C.I.A. directly target encryption software?They did not appear to find a way into the apps themselves.Were other kinds of devices targeted?The C.I.A. also targeted Microsoft\u2019s Windows personal computer software, other internet-connected computers, and home and industrial devices running the Linux operating system, according to the documents.There was a specific program to penetrate and take control of Samsung smart TVs. The program, code-named Weeping Angel, was intended to convert new digital televisions into \u201ccovert microphones.\u201d The malware was developed in cooperation with the British spy agency MI5, according to the documents.The Weeping Angel program puts the target TV in a \u201cfake off\u201d mode, according to the WikiLeaks documents. Then, with the owner believing the TV is turned off, the set works as a clandestine recording device, picking up conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a C.I.A. server computer.And in October 2014, according to the documents, the C.I.A. was exploring technology to penetrate the vehicle control systems of cars. The documents do not detail the goal of the vehicle hacking program, but WikiLeaks speculated that it would \u201cpermit the C.I.A. to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.\u201dHas encryption software changed how the C.I.A. behaves?The leaked documents indicate that the broad use of encryption has pushed the C.I.A. to become one of the world\u2019s foremost creators \u2014 and buyers \u2014 of malware. Much of the cache released by WikiLeaks appears to show how the agency has created or acquired a variety of tools to thwart tough encryption or intercept messages before encryption tools make them useless to the intelligence agency.What is new about the C.I.A. program?Using malware to hack into devices ranging from smartphones to webcams has been going on for years. Sometimes the intent is to steal information \u2014 like names, addresses and credit-card numbers for identity theft and fraud. Sometimes the goal seems to be to create havoc.But the C.I.A. program seems to have been particularly sophisticated, far-reaching and focused on surveillance. Just how innovative the individual software techniques were will not be known until independent computer security experts and scientists at the companies whose software was probed can examine the malware and tactics involved.What time period is covered by the documents?WikiLeaks says the document dump will cover 2013 to 2016. The organization says this is the largest publication of intelligence documents in history.If the documents are accurate, did the C.I.A. violate commitments made by President Barack Obama?In 2010, the Obama administration promised to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft. But the WikiLeaks documents indicate that the agency found security flaws, kept them secret and then used them for surveillance and intelligence gathering.Why is it so hard to keep these cyberweapons under wraps?Unlike nuclear weapons, which can be guarded and protected, cyberweapons are \u201cjust computer programs which can be pirated like any other,\u201d WikiLeaks notes. \u201cSince they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "WikiLeaks Will Help Tech Companies Fix Security Flaws, Assange Says", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been derided as an anti-American anarchist, indiscriminate in publishing leaks and far too cozy with Russia. For more than four years, he has been hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid sexual assault investigators in Sweden.The 8,000 C.I.A. documents that WikiLeaks made public this week \u2014 the first installment in a far larger collection, Mr. Assange said \u2014 showed that the agency had found flaws in the most popular products of the internet age: iPhones, Android phones, software used in every office and even internet-connected televisions. But instead of alerting the companies so they could plug the security holes, the agency exploited the weaknesses to carry out cyberspying around the world.\u201cWe have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured,\u201d Mr. Assange said.The companies reacted cautiously to the WikiLeaks offer, saying there could be legal complications in accepting classified information stolen from the government. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, advised the companies to seek legal advice before accepting the leaked code.\u201cI do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about if a program or a piece of information is classified,\u201d he said at a press briefing. \u201cIt remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not.\u201dWikiLeaks\u2019 reputation was marred in some circles by its previous splash in the news, the release last year of emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign that were believed to have come from Russian government hackers. Now Mr. Assange, who once worked as a computer security specialist, insists that his goal was to safeguard the privacy of everyone\u2019s communications from the intrusive gaze of the C.I.A.\u201cWhy has the Central Intelligence Agency not acted with speed to come together with Apple, Microsoft and other manufacturers to defend us all from its own weapons systems?\u201d he asked.The C.I.A. issued an unusually lengthy response, emphasizing that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, with Americans off limits.\u201cAs we\u2019ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,\u201d the C.I.A. statement said. \u201cDespite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, C.I.A. continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.\u201dBy his offer, Assange was inserting WikiLeaks into a strained relationship between the government and Silicon Valley, where some executives believe their products\u2019 reputations are endangered by aggressive American espionage efforts.The Obama administration addressed this conflict by setting up a formal review process for technical vulnerabilities that the government discovered \u2014 or purchased from hackers.When an intelligence agency or the F.B.I. wanted to make use of a major chink in a company\u2019s technological armor, it first had to get approval through a committee organized by the White House. At a sort of court of vulnerabilities, intelligence agencies argued for using the flaw for surveillance, while other officials made the case for revealing it to Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other firm.\u201cThe default position was to disclose the vulnerability,\u201d said Michael Daniel, the cybersecurity coordinator at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, who ran the process. Last year, the administration said in congressional testimony that over 80 percent of vulnerabilities discovered by the government had been revealed to the industry.But there were moments, Mr. Daniel said on Thursday, when the committee he assembled judged that it was in the national interest to keep secret a \u201czero day\u201d flaw \u2014 so named because the target would have zero days of notice that there was a vulnerability. That would give the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. time to exploit it.Not all of the flaws revealed in the new WikiLeaks trove of C.I.A. documents would necessarily have gone through this process, and the committee would not have reviewed the \u201ctools,\u201d or software techniques, used to exploit a vulnerability. But Mr. Daniel said that \u201call the appropriate agencies, including the C.I.A., participated in this process.\u201d That suggests that using at least some of the vulnerabilities exposed by WikiLeaks would have required White House approval.Brian White, the chief operating officer of RedOwl Analytics, a cybersecurity firm, said the companies were caught between conflicting pressures, especially if some of their employees have security clearances to work on government contracts.\u201cIf you are holding a security clearance and you engage in the movement or sharing of this data, you could have your clearance revoked,\u201d he said.But he said that companies like Apple and Google also had a responsibility to their shareholders and customers to make their products as safe as possible. \u201cThe likelihood of prosecution is much less important than understanding any vulnerability in their products,\u201d he said.In addition to the legal quandary, dealing with Mr. Assange, a mercurial personality who is considered a criminal by some people and a hero by others, is fraught with political complications.While WikiLeaks has often been criticized for releasing sensitive data without regard for the consequences, Mr. Assange is acting responsibly this time, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. WikiLeaks redacted the actual computer code for C.I.A. exploits from its initial release to avoid spreading such cyberweapons.\u201cHe is trying to do the right thing,\u201d Ms. Granick said.She said that the legal risk to companies using the leaked information to fix their products is minimal, but that the government could make it easy by sharing more information about the vulnerabilities directly with the companies.Paul Kocher, a cryptographer who was previously an executive at the chip company Rambus, said that helping companies patch security holes was accepted practice in the industry.\u201cThere are lots of things at WikiLeaks that are ethically questionable,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cBut the normal thing to do if you come across vulnerabilities, regardless of who\u2019s using them, is to help them get fixed.\u201dScott Shane and David E.
