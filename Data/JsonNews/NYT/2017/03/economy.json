{"Headline": "Trump Keeps Low Profile After Praising Health Care Overhaul", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump praised House Republican leaders on Friday for their plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, but otherwise kept a conspicuously low profile, with a newfound silent treatment of the news media.After he was done, a member of his personal security detail began yelling for the small pool of print and broadcast reporters to clear out of the room quickly, according to a pool report, echoing the sometimes heavy-handed approach of Mr. Trump\u2019s team during his campaign rallies.Mr. Trump thanked the gathering of committee chairmen for their \u201cdiligent work to advance the Obamacare repeal and replacement.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what people want: They want repeal and replace,\u201d he said.The president, according to the pool report, \u201cdid not seem certain that the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday had approved the House health overhaul plan\u201d but \u201cverified it with Rep. Greg Walden,\u201d an Oregon Republican and chairman of the committee.\u201cWe all remember, \u2018You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.\u2019 I know, Greg, you\u2019ve never heard that, right?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt was said many, many times, and it turned out to be not true. This is the time we\u2019re going to get it done.\u201dWhite House officials have described the Republican bill as a work in progress that is likely to undergo significant change. Earlier this week, it cleared the Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce committees after marathon sessions to review it. While it still faces potential opposition from the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, Republican leaders plan for the bill to reach the House floor later this month..On Thursday, Anthem chief executive Joseph R. Swedish praised the bill as addressing \u201cthe challenges immediately facing the individual market.\u201d He said the proposed legislation \u201cwill ensure more affordable health plan choices for consumers in the short term.\u201dMr. Swedish, who has previously warned lawmakers that Anthem will exit some or all of the markets where it offers coverage under the law if significant changes are not made, also said \u201cthe time to act is now,\u201d because insurers need to set rates beginning next month and decide which, if any, markets they will continue to offer coverage in.But he was less clear about Anthem\u2019s support for all of the provisions in the plan. \u201cWe are thoroughly reviewing and evaluating the legislation further to better understand the changes to both the individual market and the Medicaid program,\u201d he said.A major sticking point among members of Congress is when to phase out the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The bill calls for the expansion to be rolled back in 2020, but some conservatives are demanding it be rolled back in 2018. The House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, said on Friday that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to speed up the process.During Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure, his aides were chastened by the volatility of the jobs reports during the 2009 recession and the grinding recovery. They were reluctant to celebrate improved reports for fear of alienating the public, which was still dealing with stagnant wages and an uncertain future.Mr. Trump and his team have been less circumspect. Mr. Trump often questioned the veracity of the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports during the 2016 campaign, when job growth often exceeded 200,000 a month, arguing that the statistics were rigged to make Democrats look better.Reed Abelson reported from New York.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Premier, Li Keqiang, Strikes Upbeat Tone Amid U.S. Tensions", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, defended his government on Wednesday as a bulwark of economic and regional stability, arguing that smoldering tensions with the Trump administration over trade imbalances, North Korea and other disputes in Asia could be solved through dialogue.The comments appeared intended to set an upbeat tone for a first meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that is provisionally scheduled for next month at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. In an annual news conference that lasted more than two hours, Mr. Li stressed his optimism about relations with the United States.\u201cThis relationship is crucial for not just China and the United States, but also for regional and global peace, security and stability, and we have to protect its progress,\u201d Mr. Li told hundreds of reporters at the end of the annual meeting of China\u2019s legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress.Mr. Trump threatened to punish China over its yawning trade surplus with the United States. Last year, the United States\u2019 deficit in trade in goods with China reached $347 billion, and Mr. Trump has promised to close that gap, which he has also attributed to what he calls China\u2019s rigged currency exchange policies. Many economists say that claim is an oversimplification.Those sources of tension could still flare, especially over trade and the South China Sea, where the Trump administration has promised to establish a more robust naval presence. The Trump administration is also likely to sell Taiwan a large order of weapons, which could renew tensions over that issue.But like other Chinese leaders recently, Mr. Li put a bright veneer over those concerns. He said a trade war of tit-for-tat protectionist measures would ultimately damage the American economy.Mr. Li said that if a trade war broke out between China and the United States, foreign companies operating in China, \u201cin particular American companies, would bear the brunt.\u201d He said he was citing findings published by a foreign think tank, apparently referring to the extra costs that American companies would face buying goods in China for the American market.He also stressed that China would pay close attention to whether Mr. Trump\u2019s administration stuck to the One China policy, which in effect denies Taiwan the possibility of recognition as a separate country, something to which pro-independence groups in Taiwan aspire.\u201cThis policy constitutes the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and cannot and must not be shaken by vicissitudes,\u201d Mr. Li said of the One China policy.On North Korea, another issue over which the two powers have been at odds, Mr. Li repeated Beijing\u2019s position that only renewed negotiations with Pyongyang stood a chance of curtailing its nuclear program. China, the North\u2019s neighbor and sole major ally, hosted long-running multinational talks on the issue that fell apart after 2009.\u201cWe hope that through the efforts of all parties the tense atmosphere can be eased and the parties can return to the track of dialogue,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cNobody wants to have a constant ruckus all day at his doorstep.\u201dThe secretary of state, Mr. Tillerson, is scheduled to visit Beijing over the weekend for talks about the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi and also to discuss regional trouble spots, especially North Korea.For Mr. Li, his annual news conference at the end of the legislative session was a rare chance to dominate the political stage, which is usually filled by the near-omnipresent president, Mr. Xi. Unlike his recent predecessors, Mr. Li has not taken a lead in setting economic policy, and some observers have wondered whether he might be replaced as premier after his first term ends next year.But on Wednesday, Mr. Li held center stage, while crediting Mr. Xi with keeping the economy in good health since they were elected premier and president in 2013.At his news conference, Mr. Li said that the 6.5 percent target differed little from last year\u2019s target. \u201cWe believe that China will continue to be a strong driving force in the face of a sluggish global economy,\u201d he said.China has limited its budget deficit to about 3 percent of economic output, a modest fiscal stimulus. But it has been rapidly increasing total debt in the economy, with overall credit expanding last year by an amount equal to almost one-sixth of the country\u2019s economic output.Mr. Li, however, sought to allay worries about rising Chinese debt. He said that there was no risk to the overall financial system and that the Chinese government\u2019s relatively low budget deficit and large capital bases in banks would protect the country.But he acknowledged that financial challenges remained, saying, \u201cWe are fully aware of potential risks and will take prompt and targeted action.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an inaccurate figure for the United States\u2019 deficit in trade in goods with China last year. It was $347 billion, not $347 million.Adam Wu in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}

We voted Leave because we believe it is essential to preserve the two things we value most: a democratic political system and a social-democratic society. We fear that the European Union\u2019s authoritarian project of neoliberal integration is a breeding ground for the far right. By sealing off so much policy, including the imposition of long-term austerity measures and mass immigration, from the democratic process, the union has broken the contract between mainstream national politicians and their voters. This has opened the door to right-wing populists who claim to represent \u201cthe people,\u201d already angry at austerity, against the immigrant.The European Council, an intergovernmental body where decisive legislative power actually lies, especially for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, comprises member countries\u2019 heads of state, who generally meet just four times a year. They are not directly elected by the inhabitants of the nations whose fate they decide. As for the union principle of \u201csubsidiarity,\u201d a supposed preference for decentralized governance, it is ignored in all practical matters.The wishes of electorates are regularly brushed aside. When, in 2005, a proposed European Constitution was rejected by voters in France and the Netherlands (most governments did not even allow a vote), this meant nothing to the proponents of the European Project. A few cosmetic tweaks, and the constitution was imposed anyway; only then, it was called the Lisbon Treaty. (Ireland, the only state to allow a referendum on the treaty, voted against it. So Ireland was told to vote again until it got it right. That\u2019s democracy, European Union-style.)It has been a colossal error by Davos Man left-wingers to think of nation-states as embarrassing anachronisms hostile to democracy. Far from being a threat to democracy, the nation-state is the only stable underpinning we have yet devised to sustain the commitments, sacrifices and levels of social trust that a democracy and a welfare state require.Rather than leave the field to the nativist right, some of us on the democratic left are going with them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Protests, Kremlin Fears a Young Generation Stirring", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisA previously apathetic generation of people in their teens and 20s, most of them knowing nothing but 17 years of rule by Vladimir V. Putin, was the most striking face of the demonstrations, the biggest in years.It is far from clear whether their enthusiasm for challenging the authorities, which has suddenly provided adrenaline to Russia\u2019s beaten-down opposition, will be short-lived or points to a new era. Nor is it clear whether the object of the anger \u2014 blatant and unabashed corruption \u2014 will infect the popularity of Mr. Putin.But the harshness of the response to the protests on Sunday \u2014 hundreds of people were arrested, in many cases simply for showing up \u2014 suggested that Mr. Putin\u2019s hierarchy was taking no chances.Artyom Troitsky, a Russian journalist and concert promoter who for years has tracked Russian youth culture, said the fact that so many young people took part in the protests in Moscow and elsewhere \u201cis exceptionally important.\u201dThe reason, he said, is that \u201cyoung people have always been a catalyst for change,\u201d and their presence suggests a break from the lack of political interest they had exhibited in recent years.This \u201cdoes not necessarily mean that the tide has turned,\u201d but \u201csomething is definitely changing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut is it changing on a substantial scale, or is this again just a tiny minority, which will mean this all ends up in another flop, another failure like before?\u201d\u201cI think yesterday\u2019s events have shown that there are quite a large number of voters in Russia who support the program of a candidate who speaks for the fight against corruption,\u201d he said.Samuel A. Greene, an expert on Russian protest movements at King\u2019s College London, said Mr. Navalny had a chance to thaw Russia\u2019s frozen political horizons and show that a post-Putin era would, at least some day, be possible.\u201cPeople \u2014 both in the Kremlin and the 80 percent or so who tell pollsters they support Putin \u2014 have all been acting for years on the assumption that the ice is very thick and will never break. What Navalny is trying to do is show that it is not, and will one day crack,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cOnce people begin to believe the ice is in fact thin, it doesn\u2019t matter how thick it really is, and everything can change very suddenly.\u201dThat the Kremlin has been vexed by Mr. Navalny is clear from the authorities\u2019 response to what, in most countries, would be inconsequential protests that merely disrupted traffic. The police arrested protesters in some cases for nothing more than carrying a rubber duck, a symbol of extravagant money reportedly spent on a duck pond at a government residence.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, accused protest organizers on Monday of leading young Russians \u2014 \u201cvirtually children,\u201d he said \u2014 astray with lies and provocations.Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin political strategist, called the protesters \u201cPutin\u2019s children,\u201d the beneficiaries of and now a significant threat to the years of stability and relative prosperity of Mr. Putin\u2019s rule.Many youthful Russians get their information not from state news media, which has ignored Mr. Navalny and his corruption expos\u00e9s, but from the internet.\u201cRussia is really stuck in the past,\u201d said Ilya Amutov, a 25-year-old technology worker who marched in Moscow on Sunday. Young people, he said, \u201cjust want to live like normal, modern people in the rest of Europe.\u201dIn the past, the Kremlin has been highly skillful at channeling the energy of young Russians away from opposition political activism into a pro-Putin youth movement called Nashi and other patriotic ventures.But Aleksei A. Chesnakov, the director of the Center for Current Policy and a former Kremlin official who advised the president on domestic politics, said that in recent years the government had largely withdrawn support for pro-Putin youth movements, leaving the authorities without the ability to stage counterprotests and keep young people occupied.\u201cNow, the government requires police and administrative methods to ensure the opposition doesn\u2019t cross the line,\u201d he said.The limits of this approach were on stark display Sunday when the protesters were not retirees or gritty industrial workers of Russian protests past, but iPhone-wielding, takeaway-coffee-carrying urban youths, representing Mr. Putin\u2019s long-term challenge.Using sophisticated survey techniques to cut through respondents\u2019 fears of political repression, Mr. Dmitriev also predicted after Russia\u2019s 2014 military intervention in Ukraine that the resulting patriotic surge would one day calm, allowing latent discontent to revive, particularly in Moscow, where the middle class is concentrated.As war fervor faded, he wrote in a study of the public mood, \u201caggression will transfer from foreign enemies to bureaucrats and immigrants.\u201d Demand would rise for what he termed \u201chuman development,\u201d or better education, medicine and other services from the government.The election of President Trump has also played into this dynamic by depriving Mr. Putin, who scorned President Barack Obama and accused Hillary Clinton of sending \u201ca signal\u201d that set off Russian protesters in 2011-12, of any easy foreign scapegoat for Russia\u2019s troubles.Even pro-government analysts conceded that focusing on urban quality-of-life issues in Moscow \u2014 which became the Kremlin\u2019s main response, along with police crackdowns, to the previous protests in Moscow \u2014 might not keep a lid on the discontent.\u201cThe middle class and the youth are not happy,\u201d Mr. Chesnakov, the policy institute director, said in a phone interview. \u201cThey are not concerned about sidewalks and parks. Sidewalks and parks are good, but the people want the government to listen.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe middle class is not discontented because it gets nothing, but because it wants something else. The government says, \u2018Do you want a wider sidewalk?\u2019 They say, \u2018We want a more transparent government.\u2019\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, French Presidential Candidate, Vows to Run Despite Inquiry", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byMr. Fillon\u2019s announcement, made at a news conference, added another element of uncertainty to an already unsettled campaign and increased the likelihood that France\u2019s presidential race would be fought by two candidates from neither of the traditional mainstream parties.That would leave the field open to the far-right candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, whose rise in polls has sent jitters through financial markets and immigrant suburbs. Her likely contender is Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister, who is running as the candidate of his own political movement.Mr. Macron, 39, is currently the favorite to defeat Ms. Le Pen, 48, in the second round on May 7. But Mr. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, is untested and inexperienced politically. His centrist program, some of it in line with the Socialist government he served, is viewed as unappealing to parts of the right-leaning electorate. The momentum, in most of the polls, is with her.A top National Front official, Florian Philippot, used a television interview after Mr. Fillon\u2019s appearance largely to attack Mr. Macron \u2014 a clear indication that Ms. Le Pen already considers him her principal opponent.Even as Mr. Fillon, 62, is increasingly being written off, he has doubled down on his defense, yielding no ground to his critics.In another country, the shadow hanging over Mr. Fillon would most likely end a campaign for the highest office. But in France, legal problems, even serious ones, rarely end political careers, even though the electorate appears to be showing \u2014 in polls, at least \u2014 less tolerance than previously for accommodating financial misdeeds in high places.Even if he were to step aside, his center-right Republican Party has few good options. Mr. Fillon\u2019s two main challengers in the party primary both campaigned under the shadow of past and current investigations.The runner-up in the primary, Alain Jupp\u00e9, was convicted in a phony jobs scheme undertaken while he worked at City Hall several decades ago. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president, who finished third, is the subject of multiple investigations, and in February, he was ordered to stand trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012 presidential campaign.But Mr. Fillon\u2019s problems, immediate and future, are different. He campaigned as the candidate of probity. That image has been shattered. And the sums reported to have been pocketed by his wife have shocked the French.Ms. Le Pen is not untainted by corruption accusations. But her legal difficulties, for now, have hardly dented her standing in the polls \u2014 partly because she has never cultivated an image of virtue, and partly because her principal adversary is the European Parliament in Strasbourg, in which she sits and which is widely unpopular, especially among her supporters.Her legal troubles are also more complex than Mr. Fillon\u2019s, and she is not suspected of having personally benefited from any of the alleged financial wrongdoing.Last week, a top Le Pen aide was charged in an alleged phony jobs scheme. The aide was paid out of Parliament money but was thought to have spent her time working for the National Front.Another close associate of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon, has been charged with violating campaign finance laws. Mr. Chatillon\u2019s ties to extremist groups on the far right have been closely documented in the French news media as well.Ms. Le Pen, invoking her parliamentary immunity, has refused a summons from the police who want to question her in the alleged phony jobs scheme, eliciting harsh criticism from government officials who accuse her of holding herself above the law. Like Mr. Fillon, she could still be formally charged.She and Mr. Fillon have struck remarkably similar defenses as the accusations have piled up around them. Both blamed the news media as well as the judicial system and civil servants for their problems.Ms. Le Pen said all of them were working in concert to undermine her. \u201cThe rule of law is the opposite of government by judges,\u201d Ms. Le Pen told her cheering supporters.\u201cJudges exist to apply the law,\u201d she said, \u201cnot to subvert the will of the people.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t embezzle any money,\u201d Mr. Fillon told reporters. \u201cI employed \u2014 like almost a third of the members of Parliament \u2014 family members because I knew I could count on their loyalty and competence. They helped me, and I will prove it.\u201d\u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d he continued, \u201cI haven\u2019t been treated as an ordinary suspect.\u201dAnd he insisted: \u201cThe rule of law has been systematically violated. The press has been an echo chamber for the prejudices of the prosecutors.\u201dMr. Fillon said angrily that the presidential election was being \u201cassassinated,\u201d and he announced his determination to stay in it, because \u201conly the voters can decide who will be president.\u201dThe judicial screws have been steadily tightening on Mr. Fillon since newspaper reports in January \u2014 especially those in the satirical weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 \u2014 said that for years he and his deputy had paid his wife hundreds of thousands of euros in state funds for a possible do-nothing job, and that his children had also benefited from the largess of Mr. Fillon, a former prime minister.In addition, Mr. Fillon is being scrutinized on suspicion of trafficking a high civilian honor, while prime minister, in exchange for money to his wife from a wealthy publisher friend.On Wednesday, in front of dozens of aides and members of his center-right party, Mr. Fillon told reporters he would answer a March 15 summons by the magistrates in the case, after which he is expected to be charged formally. The investigation will continue and Mr. Fillon could then stand trial, or the magistrates could drop the charges.Circumstances look increasingly unfavorable for him. In an article published on Wednesday before Mr. Fillon\u2019s news conference, the French newspaper Le Monde described him as a \u201ccandidate in a bunker\u201d who was hunched up and in his shell. It noted that he no longer took the train for campaign trips out of fear of being called out by protesters.He is often met by protesters banging pots, or \u201ccasseroles\u201d in French \u2014 a slang term for corruption affairs. Sometimes the placards read, \u201cFake jobs for everybody.\u201dAurelien Breeden and Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the President Could Learn From Professional Economists", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewMichael T. Flynn, who briefly served as national security adviser, gave President Trump at least one piece of excellent advice.Mr. Flynn, whose background is in the military rather than in macroeconomics, said he didn\u2019t know. He suggested that the president ask an economist.Just so.But that is not at all true today. The unemployment rate is about 5 percent, close to what many economists consider sustainable in the long run. And inflation is close to the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2 percent. Those are real facts, not alternative ones.Mr. Trump could try to push unemployment even lower through large tax cuts and vast infrastructure spending. But a large expansion in the aggregate demand for goods and services is not what the economy needs right now. It would either lead to higher inflation or, more likely, cause Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates faster and further than she now intends.One cause is demographic. In earlier decades, the percentage of adults in the labor force was increasing, a result in part of the rapidly changing role of women in society and in part of the passage of the baby-boom generation into its working years. Now, the role of women has stabilized, and the baby boomers are retiring. Moreover, in light of the president\u2019s \u201ceconomic nationalism,\u201d immigration is unlikely to be adding as many workers in the future as it has in the past. With lower growth in the labor force, we should expect slower growth in gross domestic product as well.A second cause of slower economic growth is the decline in productivity growth, which has occurred not just in the United States but in most advanced economies. The reason for this slowdown is not fully understood, but I recently heard one explanation at a seminar given by the Stanford University economist Charles I. Jones.To be sure, Mr. Trump can do some things to promote growth. His plans for regulatory and tax reform, if well executed, could be a step in the right direction. But in light of the underlying demographic and technological trends, he should be cautious in raising expectations about how much policy can accomplish.The question is whether Mr. Trump can alter these disturbing trends. Few economists point to flawed trade agreements as the main source of the problem, as the president often does. More important is what economists call skill-biased technological change.When entrepreneurs introduce new technologies \u2014 think robots, for instance \u2014 those advances are likely to replace unskilled workers. At the same time, skilled workers are needed to implement and maintain the new technologies. As the demand for unskilled workers falls and the demand for skilled workers rises, the wage gap grows larger.The solution is to increase the skills of the labor force through better education and training. Yet this is easier said than done.So those are a few of the things that Mr. Trump could learn from a team of economists. Let\u2019s hope he chooses to appoint some soon.N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard, was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Happened to Traditional Floral Bouquets?", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported bySign of the TimesThis country is in the midst of a floral revolution. Perhaps you haven\u2019t noticed, given other events, but over the past several years, flower arrangements have become wilder and stranger, incorporating all manner of seasonal flora plucked from the woods, the garden, the roadside and the vegetable patch. You are now more likely to see a bouquet laden with sheathes of grass, arching vines of clematis, Fritillaria bulbs and flowering purple basil than just a polite cluster of roses or calla lilies. Big deal, you think. Well, it is. Allow me to explain why.On just the level of style, these arrangements \u2014 loose and fluid and highlighting the beauty of their individual elements \u2014 are a vast improvement over the less fortunate floral trends we\u2019ve suffered through: Recall those fads such as stems held in bondage by swathes of foliage, or tight mounds in which the blossoms just barely scaled the edge of the vase, or Pop Art installations in which bright blooms were used for nothing more than Crayola-like graphic patterns. If you consider the materials those florists were working with, it\u2019s analogous to chefs cooking only with canned fruit and out of season tomatoes. In the current floral industrial complex, everything we admire about a fresh flower \u2014 the fragrance, the delicate structure, the fleeting beauty and connection to season and place \u2014 is bred out so that the flower can be inexpensive, long lasting and easily shippable. Most of our cut flowers are imported from Latin America, where labor is cheap, working conditions harsh, regulations lax and chemicals prevalent \u2014 and that\u2019s just the growing part. Then, after being jacked up on fungicide, dunked in vats of preservatives and jostled and manhandled for about a week, these odorless, uniform, sturdy flowers with their enormous carbon footprint come to rest in our florist\u2019s hands or in our homes. Nice.Not so for the ground soldiers of today\u2019s movement, who have quietly just said no to such bland offerings. These revolutionaries are florists and flower farmers, mostly women, mostly in their 30s, at the vanguard of a sensibility that has developed into a cultish lifestyle movement with the power to affect this system. In simply being drawn to working with the rich diversity found in nature \u2014 ferns still unfurling, wildflowers, old roses (all hard to find, especially from the wholesale market) \u2014 they began talking to each other, finding sources, farmers, foragers, pressuring the wholesalers to supply better things, who in turn pressure their growers to grow better things. Nearly all of them teach workshops, often with each other. Despite being competitors, they have developed networks to support each other, a floral sisterhood or hive mind.A preference for wilder arrangements and fresh-from-the-garden or woodland-floor flowers is not new, of course. The 20th-century British designer Constance Spry incorporated weeds, seed pods and kale into arrangements for clients like the Queen of England and the Duke of Windsor. And the small but influential \u201980s and early \u201990s Manhattan flower shop Madderlake was known for casual bouquets mixed with things like roadside-harvested chicory and dandelion accented with squash blossoms. But until now, great style did not a movement make.The crucial difference? Instagram, the Gutenberg of visual imagery \u2014 especially FOMO-inducing lifestyle pictures. One photo of buckets of sweet peas or fields of bearded irises at a time, these florists and farmers are spreading a sophisticated aesthetic and an ecological consciousness like so much kudzu in the hearts and minds of a devoted and ever-exploding audience. There seems to have been a perfect storm brewing, particularly among meaning-searching millennials dissatisfied with their cubicle jobs, ready to either overthrow their nascent careers for farm work or floristry or to simply fantasize about doing so. The irony, of course, is that digital media turns out to be the ultimate propaganda machine for a way of living that harks back to simpler times.With social media, women like Ryhanen and Benzakein can speak to each other and directly to their customers, bypassing the middlemen and traditional media, quickly changing not just ideas and styles but the market itself in ways that would have taken months or years in the past \u2014 if it happened at all. A farmer can now ask a florist friend to try to popularize what is a good crop for her \u2014 the zinnia, say \u2014 because an influential florist can create a frenzy for a flower just by posting an arrangement that includes it. Likewise, a florist can speak directly to a farmer friend asking her to grow more of what she wants, like the newly desirable rusty-hued ranunculus.

{"Headline": "The Blind Spots in Trump\u2019s Foreign Policy", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAMHERST, Mass. \u2014 President Trump\u2019s \u201cskinny budget\u201d might be a misnomer, because in foreign policy, at least, it is actually giving us fat nationalism. The biggest winners are the military, the Homeland Security Department and, of course, the wall. The biggest loser is the State Department and thus diplomacy. Mr. Trump is all about intimidating more and negotiating less. This is the hallmark of xenophobic nationalism.Mr. Trump is also blending xenophobic nationalism with protectionism. The jury is still out on how protectionist the Trump administration wants to be. But in relation to Latin America, even before revealing his budget, Mr. Trump already showed a clear preference for protectionism.He walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was as much about United States trade with Latin America\u2019s rising Pacific economies as it was about trade with Asia. He has trashed Nafta, a trade agreement that is more important as a symbol of the reconciliation between the United States and Mexico than it is as a change in the economic fortune of the United States. His administration has expressed reservations about trade normalization with Cuba and the peace accord in Colombia, a nation with which the United States has a major trade agreement and a history of close cooperation.One problem with nationalist protectionism is that as an ideology, it is prone to double blindness: It is blind both to its exaggerations and to its consequences.Xenophobic nationalists exaggerate the extent to which the outside world takes advantage of the nation. The Chinese are manipulating their currency, Mexicans are taking jobs away, military allies are free-riding, and the rest of the world is misbehaving because it doesn\u2019t fear you enough. And all of this happens \u201cwhile we sit here like a bunch of dummies,\u201d as Mr. Trump has tweeted.Nationalists thus exaggerate both the relative gains that others make at their expense, and the relative costs their own nations incur. They are blind to the concept of mutual gain; they see only abuse.Nationalists do not antagonize every nation. They all have favorite nations that receive uncommon favors, sometimes secretly. In the Trump administration, Russia apparently wins that title.But for the rest of the world, the response of the xenophobic nationalists is to question everything and turn punitive. They expand their military. They import less. They demand more from partners. They underinvest in diplomacy and, of course, foreign aid.And this is where the second blind spot comes in. Xenophobic nationalists fail to see that their response, paradoxically, leads to the very same outcome they wish to avoid. Nationalist bravado produces nationalist backlashes. Your counterpart turns more distrustful. Xenophobic nationalists have a hard time seeing that others will respond in kind.What is particularly disappointing is that this rise in nationalist protectionism has come at a time when Latin America was getting closer to the United States. Not since the 1994 Summit of the Americas has the region been as interested in deepening rather than in drawing back from relations with the United States.This is a contrast to a decade ago. Back then, anti-imperialist governments were in ascendance. Today, except in Nicaragua, they are shrinking electorally. Once invincible, anti-imperialist governments are having trouble winning elections or have been defeated. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, arguably the most anti-imperialist leader in the Americas after Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba, is facing the biggest erosion in his soft power ever.Anti-imperialist political forces on the left and economic nationalists on the right will become electorally stronger. Pro-trade governments will probably feel abandoned, and, over time, might lose interest in promoting trade. As Mexico\u2019s economy minister said in response to United States challenges to Nafta, Mexico has a \u201cPlan B\u201d that involves \u201clevying a tax on U.S. imports.\u201dContrary to intuition, a nationalist backlash in Latin America will also disunite nations. We tend to think that nationalism, especially in post-colonial societies, acts as a unifying force, bringing the nation together through a rally-around-the-flag effect. But we now know that in modern, diversified, globalized societies, rising nationalism draws a huge wedge domestically, with some groups feeling proud of chauvinism and the rest embarrassed by it. This polarization spells trouble and instability. President Trump\u2019s nationalist protectionism could very well bring declining governance not just in the United States but also across Latin America.The relationship between the United States and Latin America is always complicated. After first admiring the country\u2019s political institutions, and copying many of them in their constitutions, Latin Americans by the 1840s became afraid of propensity of the United States to take more than it gives in return.To this day, a minority of Latin Americans remain staunchly anti-American. Their attitude toward the United States is ideological; there is nothing the country could do to change their dislike of it. But the rest of Latin America is not ideological but transactional. In dealing with the United States, these majorities respond to reciprocity. When they perceive the United States as treating them fairly and equally \u2014 as an interested partner more than as a detached or distrustful boss \u2014 they respond in kind.The new United States foreign policy, with its xenophobic protectionism aptly symbolized by Mr. Trump\u2019s promised wall on the Mexican border, will turn these supporters into antagonists. Where applied, this policy will provoke a nationalist backlash and polarization. That much is clear. Mr. Trump may not see it, but the writing is on the wall \u2014 his wall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Republicans Are Battling Republicans on Obamacare Repeal", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are rarely as exercised as when they are fighting with themselves.And as the House debates how to best dismantle the Affordable Care Act, a familiar array of interest groups with deep pockets, incensed talk radio hosts and online agitators is again assuming its posture of aggression toward the House Republican leadership.Political groups backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and other powerful players on the right, such as Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, have come out quickly and strongly against the bill. Some have threatened to punish lawmakers by docking their conservative ratings on the influential \u201cscorecards\u201d they distribute to voters. Activists are already swarming Capitol Hill and demanding that Congress take a harder line and pass a repeal measure that would leave no trace of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI feel lied to,\u201d said Anna Beavon Gravely, the deputy state director of the North Carolina chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed group that is funding a grass-roots push against Republicans in Congress who want to stop short of an outright repeal.\u201cWe trusted you because you said you were going to do something about this. And this is not it. Not even close,\u201d she added as she prepared to set out for the offices of North Carolina lawmakers with other activists from her state.The displeasure is forcing an uncomfortable reckoning in the Republican Party much earlier and in a much more disruptive way than many think is constructive. And it has many conservatives asking why \u2014 now that they control both houses of Congress and the White House and have remained largely united so far \u2014 they are picking a fight with each other.The criticism from the right has grown so harsh that President Trump asked leaders of several conservative groups in an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday to tone it down. He was especially troubled, one participant said, by the comparisons of the plan to \u201cObamacare lite,\u201d which he said was inaccurate and harmful to their shared cause of gutting the current law.One senior White House official described the meeting as \u201ctough.\u201d Referring to the president, the official said: \u201cHe listened. They vented.\u201dAfter the meeting, the White House appeared more confident about the prospects in the House for the health care overhaul. In a meeting with conservative leaders in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he anticipated the most trouble in the Senate, where Republican moderates and conservatives are opposing the plan for different reasons. He said he was prepared to pressure holdout senators by having the kind of stadium-style rallies he had during his presidential campaign.Unified government was supposed to eliminate some of the infighting that plagued the Republicans during the Obama years, when the party\u2019s right flank brought down a House speaker, defeated a House majority leader and blocked another majority leader\u2019s ascent. Instead, it is underlining the difficulties of running Washington now that their party bears full responsibility.\u201cFor a while, it did seem like Trump\u2019s victory had transcended the old political battles,\u201d said Matt Lewis, a conservative author, who added that the fighting was doubly odd because the repeal was not an issue central to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration- and jobs-themed campaign. \u201cThis is not why people elected Donald Trump. And yet here we are.\u201dMaps comparing tax credits under the Affordable Care act and those in the plan House Republicans recently released across groups of incomes and ages.As they find themselves sudden targets of a well-organized and well-financed opposition from within, some Republicans are beginning to question whether the squabbling is ultimately self-defeating. And their doubts raise a new question for this Republican faction that has been mocked as the \u201cParty of No\u201d: Can they ever get to yes?\u201cI fully respect people on the outside \u2014 who don\u2019t have to take a vote or produce an outcome \u2014 who strive for perfect,\u201d said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, one of the Republicans who found activists in their offices this week. Perfect, he said, is never as attainable as people think. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to get good here.\u201dStopping government-mandated health care has been a cause unifying conservatives since Mr. Obama began talking about it as a presidential candidate nine years ago. Perhaps no other issue created as much energy among conservative voters, helping Republicans make historic gains in Congress as they railed against the law as an egregious government overreaching into a vast part of the economy.But differences over how exactly to unravel the Affordable Care Act have long divided Republicans, even when the stakes were low and they knew that whatever they passed in Congress would be vetoed by Mr. Obama. In 2013, differences within the Republican Party over defunding it led to a 16-day government shutdown.Back then, the fault lines in the debate were largely the same: hard-line conservatives butting up against the party leadership, which they accused of not acting aggressively enough.But as much as the squabbling seems the same, there is one crucial difference: They are firing with real bullets now.A comparison of the House Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare and the current law.\u201cWe\u2019re on the hook this time,\u201d said Representative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, who is part of the group of conservatives pushing for an outright repeal. \u201cThis one counts.\u201dThat they are firing some of those bullets at one another seems to be less of a concern the more conservative you are.Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, an opponent of the House bill who along with Mr. Brat is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, the driving force on Capitol Hill behind the resistance, said that any Republicans who will not vote to fully repeal the law will not be keeping a promise they made to voters. \u201cAnd they can go back to their districts and explain to the American people why they lied,\u201d he said.Conservatives see many of the same problems in the Republican leadership plan today that bothered them about the Democrats\u2019 2010 health care bill: It extends a taxpayer-funded subsidy to help individuals buy insurance; though it revokes the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that nearly all Americans have insurance, it replaces the mandate with a new penalty if a consumer buys insurance after letting coverage lapse; it was negotiated largely without consulting the rank and file; and, they insist, its benefits could go toward people who should not receive them, like undocumented immigrants.Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, echoed a concern that many conservative activists have voiced about not being briefed or consulted on the plan. \u201cIt goes a long way when you hear people out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are a lot of natural allies that this caught by surprise as much as it did Democrats.\u201dThe unhappiness on the right could be especially worrisome for Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose status as a favorite target of the conservative base seemed to fade in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election.Now, many conservatives appear willing to reopen the wounds of old leadership fights. Some of them have already taken to mocking the repeal plan with what they consider to be the most damning of pejoratives \u2014 not \u201cTrumpcare,\u201d as Democrats call it, but \u201cRyancare.\u201dEmmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s Rising Ambition Seen in Bid to Breach Global Banks", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byWhen hackers associated with North Korea tried to break into Polish banks late last year they left a trail of information about their apparent intentions to steal money from more than 100 organizations around the world, according to security researchers.A list of internet protocol addresses, which was supplied by the security researchers and analyzed by The New York Times, showed that the hacking targets included institutions like the World Bank, the European Central Bank and big American companies including Bank of America.While some of the Polish banks took the hackers\u2019 bait, the scheme was detected fairly quickly, and there is no evidence that any money was stolen from the intended targets. Yet security researchers said the hit list, found embedded in the code of the attack on more than 20 Polish banks, underlines how sophisticated the capabilities of North Korean hackers have become. Their goals have now turned financial, along with efforts to spread propaganda and heist data and to disrupt government and news websites in countries considered enemies.The list of targets, which has not been previously reported, is part of a growing body of evidence showing how North Korea, a country that is cut off from much of the global economy, is increasingly trying to use its cyberattack abilities to bring in cash \u2014 and making progressively bolder attempts to do so.North Korea\u2019s hacking network is immense, encompassing a group of 1,700 hackers aided by more than 5,000 trainers, supervisors and others in supporting roles, South Korean officials estimate. Because of the country\u2019s poor infrastructure, the hackers typically work abroad, in places like China, Southeast Asia and Europe. Like other North Koreans allowed to work abroad, the hackers are constantly monitored by minders for possible breaches in allegiance to the government.\u201cWe found multiple links, which gave us reasonable confidence that it\u2019s the same group behind Bangladesh as the Polish attacks,\u201d said Eric Chien, a researcher at Symantec, which studied both attacks.The list of targets uncovered in the Polish attack \u2014 including big American financial institutions like State Street Bank and Trust and the Bank of New York Mellon \u2014 is illuminating for its ambition, Mr. Chien added. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to go after Bangladesh,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a whole other thing to take on the U.S.\u201dNorth Korea has denied involvement in the attacks on Sony and others, instead accusing South Korea of disrupting its websites. North Korea\u2019s population is cut off from the internet except for a handful of state-run sites filled with propaganda.The Polish episode provides a case study of how North Korean cyberattack goals have escalated.The attack began around October when the hackers planted a virus on the website of the Polish financial regulator \u2014 then waited for banks to inadvertently download it when they visited the site.The perpetrators used what is called a watering-hole attack \u2014 named after the way predators ambush prey by lazing around a high-traffic spot \u2014 to go after the banks; in this case, the \u201cwatering hole\u201d was the financial regulator\u2019s website. When the visitors on the list landed on the page, they would be redirected to software that would attempt to download malware. The list of targets extended beyond Poland, investigators said, because the group intended to carry out similar attacks elsewhere.\u201cThis was a global list, but they hadn\u2019t gotten around to making a watering hole for all these country banks,\u201d Mr. Chien said, adding that the hackers appeared to have created watering-hole sites in Mexico and Uruguay, too. Symantec said it had blocked 14 attacks against computers in Mexico and 11 in Uruguay.The fact that the hackers were able to attack a specific site showed that their capabilities had improved, Mr. Chien said. The group also used its own modifications of code and exploits more broadly shared by cybercriminals, whereas before it had mostly built its own tools \u2014 another indication of evolution.While Polish banks were the most numerous targets, the second-largest number was in the United States, including the American arm of Deutsche Bank. CoBank, which lends to agriculture and rural projects, was targeted, too. The central banks of Russia, Venezuela, Mexico, Chile and the Czech Republic were on the list. The only target associated with China: branches of the Bank of China in Hong Kong and America.North Korea has been carefully cultivating its cyberattack capabilities since the early 1990s, according to South Korean officials. Generally, the country selects young computer prodigies and trains them as hackers, according to people who have attended the South Korean government\u2019s discussions of the North\u2019s hacking operations. South Korean cybersecurity officials began detecting attacks attributed to North Korean hackers around 2009.Working overseas is a huge incentive for young hackers, since many North Koreans have little chance to leave their impoverished, isolated country. As long as the hackers meet their government-set targets, they are allowed to live abroad and often get the added perk of running illegal gambling sites online, generating profits they can share with supervisors.While North Korea lags developed countries in hacking capabilities, it has occasionally startled observers in South Korea. In 2011, investigators found that a South Korean bank had been hit by malware when an infected computer used by a maintenance-company employee was briefly hooked into the bank\u2019s server network.South Korean hackers who forensically analyzed the attack were impressed not so much by the malware, but by the fact that North Korean hackers had been so constantly on alert, apparently for hours or days on end, waiting for the short window during which the infected computer was connected to the bank\u2019s servers so that they could activate the virus.While the Pentagon has recently warned that North Korea\u2019s hacking abilities could be a cost-effective way of conducting military operations, the attacks on banks shows the country\u2019s more prosaic goal of getting money.\u201cIn the past, North Korean hackers usually attacked government websites with the goal of destroying systems and triggering social confusion,\u201d said Kim Seung-joo, a professor at the Graduate School of Information Security at Korea University in Seoul, who is an adviser for the South Korean government\u2019s cybersecurity division.\u201cNow they have shifted to making money, attacking banks and private companies, apparently because the North\u2019s other means of raising foreign currency are increasingly blocked under United Nations sanctions,\u201d Mr. Kim said.North Korean hackers have also begun using ransomware \u2014 viruses that encrypt all data in an infected computer or smartphone \u2014 to make money. The hackers demand a ransom, usually in Bitcoin, in return for providing victims with a decryption code.In July, the South Korean police said North Korea\u2019s main intelligence agency had stolen the personal data of more than 10 million customers of Interpark, an online shopping mall in South Korea. Interpark did not learn about the breach until it received an anonymous message threatening to publicize the leak of personal data unless it paid the equivalent of $2.7 million in Bitcoin.South Korea attributed the attack to hackers belonging to North Korea\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, its main spy agency.In the end, no Bitcoin changed hands. Instead of paying the ransom, Interpark reported the attack to the police.Alan Wong contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aleksei Navalny, Russian Opposition Leader, Receives 15-Day Sentence", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 A day after the largest antigovernment protests in more than five years, a Moscow court on Monday slapped the opposition leader behind the outburst, Aleksei A. Navalny, with a 15-day prison sentence for resisting arrest.The police responded by beating protesters and arresting more than 1,000 in Moscow alone, though by Monday many had been released.As Mr. Navalny was led into the courtroom for a hearing that lasted much of the day, he told reporters that he was \u201camazed by the number of cities that took part in this and by how many people came out.\u201d After the judge ordered him jailed, Mr. Navalny was whisked away without being allowed a chance to comment further.Mr. Navalny, 40, a charismatic opposition figure, has long been caught up in multiple court cases that he calls politically motivated. He has vowed to run against President Vladimir V. Putin for the presidency in 2018, even though a previous conviction, widely viewed as trumped up, makes that technically illegal.The government has usually avoided jailing him, however, apparently fearful of turning him into an even bigger political martyr. The court on Monday also fined him about $350 for organizing an illegal demonstration.The protests provoked surprise and wonder among analysts and activists, many of whom had written off the public as politically apathetic. The high number of young people in the crowds struck many as particularly impressive.\u201cRight now it looks like a major new phenomenon in Russia that there are young people who are active and have agendas,\u201d Maxim Trudolyubov, a columnist, said. \u201cOne important factor is that these people all grew up under Putin. They don\u2019t remember any other leader.\u201dMr. Putin, as the \u201cgood czar,\u201d enjoys a status that the rest of the government falls short of. Mr. Navalny, however, in calling for people to come out to protest high-level corruption, rather than the president, appears to have tapped into a popular sentiment.The aftermath of the rallies will show whether there is a political thaw or not, wrote Oleg Kashin, another columnist. If there is a new Bolotnaya case, he said, then it is not a thaw; otherwise, it is, even if no substantial policy changes follow.There were no independent numbers available for the turnout for the rallies. The liberal radio station Echo of Moscow estimated that more than 60,000 people had participated.Analysts cited a number of factors for the surprising strength of the protest: pent-up anger over government suppression of peaceful demonstrations; some rankling over the dreary economy; and the weather, because Sunday was sunny and relatively warm for March.But overwhelmingly, they cited the youthfulness of the crowds, with many presumably participating in their first political protests.\u201cA milestone event occurred in Irkutsk today \u2014 a new politically active class was born,\u201d Aleksei Petrov, a longtime election monitor in the Siberian city, wrote on Facebook. \u201cAlmost a thousand young people of student age have taken to the streets.\u201dThe young are less likely to watch state television, which endlessly exalts Mr. Putin and government policy. Indeed, all of the state-run channels ignored the rallies. Instead, young Russians tend to turn to independent voices who broadcast their own shows on YouTube.\u201cI am glad and happy that a new generation grew up in the country that will not accept such attitudes from the government and wants to feel that they are citizens,\u201d Mr. Navalny told reporters in court. \u201cThis was news to many yesterday, including me.\u201dVictor Zadorozhnyi, 26, a real estate broker who was attending his first political rally in Moscow, said: \u201cHave you noticed that only young people are around? Why so?\u201dHe predicted, accurately, that none of the events would appear on Channel One, a main government mouthpiece.\u201cYounger people have smarter eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cElder people, they have rigid brains; watching Channel One is a routine for them \u2014 they switch it on to see what is Channel One telling us. Everything\u2019s good, Mashka the cat had kittens yesterday.\u201dFor its part, the Kremlin denounced what it called illegal rallies, though the organizers maintained they had permits for 21 of the protests.\u201cThe Kremlin respects the civic stance of the people and their right to voice their position,\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Mr. Putin, told reporters. \u201cWe can\u2019t express the same respect for those who consciously misinformed people.\u201dMr. Peskov accused the opposition of jeopardizing and exploiting \u201cchildren\u201d by promising them some manner of reward for attending. It was not clear what he was referring to, though Mr. Navalny had offered to help anyone arrested to seek redress and compensation through the European Court of Human Rights.Mr. Peskov defended the actions of the security forces, who often grappled with demonstrators and seemed to cart off some who had not been participating in the protests. \u201cLaw enforcement was acting in a totally correct, highly professional and lawful way,\u201d he said.He denied that the Kremlin had ordered a news blackout on state-run channels, even though none of them reported on the rallies. \u201cWe don\u2019t shape the editorial policies of TV channels,\u201d Mr. Peskov said.The spokesman said the Kremlin was aware that the protests had not been concentrated in the main cities alone, another phenomenon not seen for years. \u201cThe Kremlin is quite sober when analyzing the scale of yesterday\u2019s protests,\u201d he said, adding that it would neither \u201cdiminish, nor exaggerate the numbers.\u201dThe fate of all the arrested protesters in Moscow and other cities was not clear. The police put the figure at 500 arrests in Moscow alone, but an independent organization that tracks such detentions put the number at closer to 1,000. Most were released overnight.Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What You Can Do About Climate Change", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byOpinionANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 What can you \u2014 just one concerned person \u2014 do about global warming?It may feel like a more urgent problem these days, with proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and each year warmer than the previous one.You could drive a few miles fewer a year. Reduce your speed. Turn down your thermostat in winter. Replace your incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. Reduce your meat consumption. Any one of those actions would help.This would be a big mistake as we try to slow down the warming of our planet and meet our international commitments on climate change. The simple fact is that American drivers are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas pollution, so having a vehicle fleet that burns less fuel can have an outsize impact on total emissions.Though the United States has just 4 percent of the world\u2019s population, it is responsible for 14 percent of man-made greenhouse gases that end up in the atmosphere. Transportation accounts for 27 percent of those emissions. And 60 percent result from driving personal vehicles.Over two years, the average American driver travels a distance equal to the circumference of the earth. The average new vehicle gets only about 25 miles per gallon, which corresponds to about three-quarters of a pound of greenhouse gas emissions for each mile driven. Each year in the United States, 214 million drivers (with 240 million registered vehicles) drive 2.7 trillion miles, emitting about 2.4 trillion pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, based on the current fleet average of 21.4 m.p.g.Changing how much we drive is not easy; it often requires a major change in lifestyle, like moving closer to work or making more frequent use of public transportation, which often takes longer and is less convenient than driving. It is much easier to buy a more fuel-efficient vehicle; cars with fuel economy much better than the new-vehicle average of 25 m.p.g. are widely available.The main reason was the drop in the price of gasoline to $2.14 in 2016 from $3.36 a gallon in 2014. Now, fueling a less fuel-efficient but more spacious vehicle like an S.U.V. or pickup truck costs no more than fueling a small sedan did a few years ago. And buyers have responded by buying more of those bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.This is where the role of government and its fuel-economy standards for new vehicles becomes important.These standards have obvious direct effects on the industry in terms of what vehicles are made and sold, and their actual on-road fuel-economy performance.Significant increases in fuel-economy standards for all vehicles, but especially for pickups and S.U.V.s, are even more important when relatively low gas prices motivate buyers to choose larger vehicles over smaller ones.One of the last important acts of the Obama administration was to reaffirm the more stringent fuel-economy standards for model year 2022-25 vehicles, benchmarks that were originally proposed in 2012. Those standards would have ensured that the improvements in fuel economy that have stalled in recent years would resume.But the recently announced review of those standards by the Trump administration is bad news for the prospects of reducing both transportation emissions and the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. And that will make it that much harder to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet to dangerous levels.Advertisement"}

XP Investimentos hired JPMorgan Chase in the past few weeks and is looking to go public by the end of July. In addition, the dental and health care insurer Grupo NotreDame Interm\u00e9dica, owned by Bain Capital, recently picked Morgan Stanley to work on a possible I.P.O. this year.Companies that had to cancel or postpone past attempts are giving it another go as well.On Thursday the Brazilian e-commerce company Netshoes, which is 37.8 percent owned by Tiger Global Management and first considered an I.P.O. over four years ago, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bradesco BBI, Allen & Company and Jefferies are the underwriters.Azul, a Brazilian airline started by JetBlue\u2019s founder, once again filed for an I.P.O. in February after abandoning two previous attempts.Two other companies have already debuted: the car rental company Movida and the health care company Instituto Hermes Pardini, raising a combined $425 million for the year through Tuesday. Though Movida had to slightly lower its price, and another company, Unidas, which is in the same industry, had to scrap its I.P.O. plans last month, that is the most money raised over the same period since 2011, according to the data firm Dealogic.Renato Ejnisman, the managing director of Banco Bradesco BBI, the investment bank arm of Banco Bradesco, said more than 10 companies were considering stock offerings this year. Moreover, they come from diverse sectors including consumer goods, infrastructure and utilities.\u201cWe have not had such a level of activity in the last four years,\u201d Mr. Ejnisman said.Others share that sentiment. Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Ita\u00fa BBA, estimated that 10 to 15 I.P.O.s could be held in Brazil this year.If that prediction were to come true, the number of offerings this year would dwarf that of the previous three years, when there was only one I.P.O. a year. It would be on par with 2010 and 2011, which each had 11 I.P.O.s. Since 2010, the best year was 2013, which had 13. The deal activity is not off the charts, however. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a selective market,\u201d Mr. Ejnisman said.The thaw is partly because of investors\u2019 pent-up demand after a period of economic downturn. \u201cThe market has been starving for equity for so long,\u201d said Patricia Moraes, the head of banking in Brazil for JPMorgan, who, like the other bankers quoted in this article, would speak only about the state of the market and not about any specific I.P.O.Brazil\u2019s economy contracted by 3.6 percent last year, and shrank by 3.8 percent in 2015.The impeachment remains controversial, the motives dubious, and President Michel Temer, who took over for Ms. Rousseff after helping engineer her fall, is highly unpopular. Yet the finance sector credits his government with some changes.Inflation has fallen, and Brazil\u2019s currency has gained value relative to others. The Central Bank lowered its benchmark interest rate multiple times over the past several months.\u201cOn the macro front, the country is on the right path with the right team handling the economy,\u201d said Fabio Nazari, a partner and head of equity capital markets at BTG Pactual.The activity means more business for investment banks in the region. In January and February, JPMorgan was involved in four equity offerings in Latin America, two of them in Brazil. In those, it raised $2.7 billion with over $12 billion in demand, Ms. Moraes said.That amount alone is already 26 percent of the $10.4 billion raised in all equity offerings in Latin America in 2016, according to Dealogic.The next several months will determine how much optimism is warranted.JPMorgan is leading a group of banks, including BTG Pactual, Ita\u00fa BBA and Morgan Stanley, on the anticipated 4 billion reais ($1.3 billion) stock debut for XP Investimentos. It is expected to start its presentations for potential investors in May.Edemir Pinto, president of BM&FBovespa, said in February that by the end of the year, he expected about 17 companies to raise approximately 25 billion reais (about $8.1 billion) in equity offerings on the S\u00e3o Paulo exchange.Uncertainty still looms, however, accounting for the cautious optimism.While the S\u00e3o Paulo market surged last year, the real economy has still lagged far behind. Most growth estimates for this year are under 1 percent. Banco Safra\u2019s head economist, Carlos Kawall, forecasts 0 percent.Brazil\u2019s most recent unemployment rate, measured over a three-month period ending in January, rose to 12.6 percent, up from 9.5 percent one year ago. Real wages continue to fall.Some believe this may worsen. \u201cThe labor market is likely to deteriorate further as the economy is yet to show signs of minimal positive growth,\u201d Alberto Ramos of Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note last month.Moreover, any enduring progress in Brazil\u2019s fiscal health depends on major reform of its pension or social security system. Until some of these uncertainties are resolved, investors might be wary of overexposing themselves to the Brazilian market.\u201cI don\u2019t think that most foreign investors will start diverting a large chunk of their resources into Brazil until we have the social security reform approved and especially until we start showing some growth in G.D.P.,\u201d said Mr. Ejnisman of Banco Bradesco BBI.The corruption investigation, now starting its fourth year, has Brazil\u2019s political class on edge, in particular Mr. Temer and his allies in Congress.\u201cThe biggest domestic risk is the political scenario,\u201d said Mr. Greenlees of Ita\u00fa BBA.Ms. Moraes of JPMorgan said one of her biggest concerns was \u201cthe political volatility in Brazil, which could delay investment decisions by companies and investors.\u201dStill, she and others said recent developments offered reasons to be hopeful, in particular the return of foreign investors to recent stock offerings.\u201cNow it\u2019s a more balanced demand,\u201d said Mr. Greenlees of Ita\u00fa BBA. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some respectable foreign investors that were not in the market last year come back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An English Sheep Farmer\u2019s View of Rural America", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMATTERDALE, England \u2014 I am a traditional small farmer in the North of England. I farm sheep in a mountainous landscape, the Lake District fells. It is a farming system that dates back as many as 4,500 years. A remarkable survival. My flock grazes a mountain alongside 10 other flocks, through an ancient communal grazing system that has somehow survived the last two centuries of change. Wordsworth called it a \u201cperfect republic of shepherds.\u201dIt\u2019s not your efficient modern agribusiness. My farm struggles to make enough money for my family to live on, even with 900 sheep. The price of my lambs is governed by the supply of imported lamb from the other side of the world. So I have one foot in something ancient and the other foot in the 21st-century global economy.Less than 3 percent of people in modern industrial economies are farmers. But around the world, I am not alone: The United Nations estimates that more than two billion people are farmers, most of them small farmers; that\u2019s about one in three people on the planet.My farm\u2019s lack of profitability perhaps shouldn\u2019t be of any great concern to anyone else. I\u2019m a grown-up, and I chose to live this way. I chose it because my ancestors all did this, and because I love it, however doomed it might seem to others.My farm is where I live, and there is actually no other way to farm my land, which is why it hasn\u2019t changed much for a millennium or more. In truth, I could accept the changes around me philosophically, including the disappearance of farms like mine, if the results made for a better world and society. But the world I am seeing evolve in front of my eyes isn\u2019t better, it is worse. Much worse.In the week before the United States elected Donald J. Trump to the presidency, I traveled through Kentucky, through endless miles of farmland and small towns. It was my first visit to the United States, for a book tour. I was shocked by the signs of decline I saw in rural America.I saw shabby wood-frame houses rotting by the roadside, and picket fences blown over by the wind. I passed boarded-up shops in the hearts of small towns, and tumbledown barns and abandoned farmland. The church notice boards were full of offers of help to people with drug or alcohol addictions. And yes, suddenly I was passing cars with Trump stickers on their bumpers, and passing houses with Trump flags on their lawns.The economic distress and the Trump support are not unconnected, of course. Significant areas of rural America are broken, in terminal economic decline, as food production heads off to someplace else where it can be done supposedly more efficiently. In many areas, nothing has replaced the old industries. This is a cycle of degeneration that puts millions of people on the wrong side of economic history.Economists say that when the world changes people will adapt, move and change to fit the new world. But of course, real human beings often don\u2019t do that. They cling to the places they love, and their identity remains tied to the outdated or inefficient things they used to do, like being steel workers or farmers. Often, their skills are not transferable anyway, and they have no interest in the new opportunities. So, these people get left behind.I ask myself what I would do if I didn\u2019t farm sheep, or if I couldn\u2019t any longer farm sheep. I have no idea.Perhaps it is none of my business how Americans conduct their affairs and how they think about economics. I should doubtless go back to the mountains of my home here in Cumbria, and hold my tongue. But for my entire life, my own country has apathetically accepted an American model of farming and food retailing, mostly through a belief that it was the way of progress and the natural course of economic development. As a result, America\u2019s future is the default for us all.It is a future in which farming and food have changed and are changing radically \u2014 in my view, for the worse. Thus I look at the future with a skeptical eye. We have all become such suckers for a bargain that we take the low prices of our foodstuffs for granted and are somehow unable to connect these bargain-basement prices to our children\u2019s inability to find meaningful work at a decently paid job.Our demand for cheap food is killing the American dream for millions of people. Among its side effects, it is creating terrible health problems like obesity and antibiotic-resistant infections, and it is destroying the habitats upon which wildlife depends. It also concentrates vast wealth and power in fewer and fewer hands.After my trip to rural America, I returned to my sheep and my strangely old-fashioned life. I am surrounded by beauty, and a community, and an old way of doing things that has worked for a long time rather well. I have come home convinced that it is time to think carefully, both within America and without, about food and farming and what kind of systems we want.The future we have been sold doesn\u2019t work. Applying the principles of the factory floor to the natural world just doesn\u2019t work. Farming is more than a business. Food is more than a commodity. Land is more than a mineral resource.Despite the growing scale of the problem, no major mainstream politician has taken farming or food seriously for decades. With the presidential campaign over and a president in the White House whom rural Kentuckians helped elect, the new political establishment might want to think about this carefully.Suddenly, rural America matters. It matters for the whole world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Egypt\u2019s Activists Became \u2018Generation Jail\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "FeatureSix years after the Arab Spring, the country\u2019s democracy activists live under constant threat of prison \u2014 or worse.Supported byMaher and I were sitting in his small, dark apartment at 3 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon in February, waiting for his children to return from their first day back at school after a two-week vacation. A television played a soccer match in a corner, and a coffee table was strewn with textbooks from Maher\u2019s studies at Cairo University, where he is pursuing a second degree, in political science, this one begun behind bars.It was just six years ago that Maher was celebrated around the world as a symbol of freedom and democracy. In January 2011, as the leader of a social-media-savvy network of young activists called the April 6 Youth Movement, Maher mobilized hundreds of thousands of Egyptians in demonstrations in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square and across the country that took down President Hosni Mubarak. The movement was considered for a Nobel Peace Prize, and Maher traveled across Europe and the United States talking about the Arab Spring and Egypt\u2019s future with the likes of Ban Ki-moon and Lech Walesa. But the hopes that were raised by the revolution dissolved into sectarianism and chaos, and Maher\u2019s aspirations were extinguished within two years. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the defense minister and commander in chief of the armed forces, seized power in July 2013 and outlawed protests. Five months later, a judge found Maher guilty of illegal demonstration, rioting and \u201cthuggery\u201d and sentenced him to three years in jail. Another judge added six months to Maher\u2019s sentence for \u201cverbally assaulting a public officer while on duty\u201d after he demanded that the police remove his handcuffs while in court for a 2014 appeal. Maher spent almost all of that period sealed in a small cell in a solitary-confinement wing at Tora Prison, a notorious complex on the outskirts of Cairo, built during British rule, that houses about 2,500 political prisoners and common criminals. Hidden behind 25-foot-high walls, the vast compound encompasses seven prison blocks, ranging from a minimum-security facility for policemen and judges convicted of taking bribes to the supermax \u201cScorpion Prison,\u201d a labyrinth of cells largely reserved for Islamists and April 6 leaders.Today Maher is nominally a free man, but the restrictions on his movements are stifling. The regime is deeply concerned that he could revive the social-media network that brought his followers to the streets six years ago. As it was explained to Maher, \u201ctweets can lead to demonstrations, and demonstrations can lead to revolution, and that will bring down the regime and create martyrs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you are tweeting, you are like a terrorist.\u201dThe front door opened, and Maher\u2019s wife, Reham, their daughter, Meral, 9, and their son, Nidal, 5, spilled into the room. Nidal raced to the television, switched it from the soccer match to a cartoon and then snuggled up to his father. \u201cI missed these moments,\u201d Maher said. During his incarceration, his contact with the children was limited to short visits twice a month. The encounters left his kids perplexed and disturbed. \u201cAt first I lied when they would visit me,\u201d Maher recalled. \u201cMy daughter asked, \u2018Why you are not in our home?\u2019 and I said, \u2018This is my job.\u2019 She said, \u2018So why are you wearing blue?\u2019\u2009\u201d Reham, who met Maher at Cairo University 16 years ago and married him in 2007, told me that after a year they decided to explain the situation to their daughter. \u201cI tried to make her grasp the difference between being detained for political reasons and being a common criminal,\u201d Reham said. \u201cI explained what the revolution was and how people protested. And I told her that when the current regime took over, it didn\u2019t allow people to express their opinions. Sisi knew what happened to Mubarak, so he didn\u2019t want them to speak out again.\u201dIn prison, Maher earned a reputation as a defiant figure, repeatedly sending antigovernment criticism and vivid descriptions of his ordeal to the Western and Egyptian news media. \u201cWhen I heard the president talk about the rule of law and human rights in Egypt, I said, \u2018What is this bullshit?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cThat made me want to write about the reality.\u201d Denied pens and paper, he scribbled messages on tissues, using pens smuggled into his cell, and managed to smuggle the notes out. After they were published, guards would tear apart his cell, removing bricks from walls to search for hiding places. They confiscated his books, radio and clothes, leaving him with only his thin prison uniform. At one point, they covered the open exercise yard with a tarpaulin, blotting out the sunlight, suspecting that Maher might somehow be smuggling messages through the air. Still he continued devising acts of rebellion. A year into his confinement, Maher grew an extravagant handlebar mustache and a long beard and then braided it. \u201cIt bothered them \u2014 it seemed like I was making fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prison officials complained to my father. They said, \u2018Please tell him to shave.\u2019\u2009\u201dAfter getting out of jail, Maher decided to keep wearing facial hair; it helped disguise his identity. Maher\u2019s face is widely recognized in Egypt, and other April 6 Youth Movement leaders have been physically attacked by regime loyalists who blame them for plunging the country into instability and violence. When his wife enrolled their children in private school after Maher was sentenced to prison, she told the administrators that their father was \u201cout of the country on business.\u201d The school never connected their father\u2019s name to the famous activist, and even now, Maher said, when he picks his children up from their school, the staff has no idea who he is.Maher had to be careful with what he told me; the regime might send him back to prison if he criticized Sisi too harshly. \u201cEven if it was something minor, they would jail him,\u201d Reham said. \u201cIt would be a catastrophe for us.\u201d Yet Maher\u2019s reluctance runs against all his instincts. Since his release, he has sensed a deepening anger toward the regime, and he believes that the political climate may be changing. \u201cPeople tell me that they can see through the lies,\u201d he said, \u201cand that they are supporting us.\u201dMany Egyptians have accepted Sisi\u2019s argument that another prolonged round of protests could invite radical Islamists to capitalize on the chaos. \u201cHe\u2019s positioned himself as the sole leader who makes decisions because he knows what\u2019s best for the nation, and he\u2019s saving us from the fate of Syria and Libya,\u201d Khaled Dawoud, a prominent Egyptian journalist and the leader of a small opposition party, told me. Egyptians are proud that the first Arab leader to whom President Trump spoke after his electoral victory was Sisi, a sharp contrast to Barack Obama, who had suspended military aid to Egypt for two years after the police massacre of 1,000 Muslim Brotherhood supporters in August 2013 at Rabaa, a Cairo encampment. Obama never invited the Egyptian president to the White House. \u201cThe thinking is, Egypt is returning to its rightful place as a player,\u201d said a veteran political observer in Cairo, who like many officials I spoke to feared retribution for discussing even innocuous-seeming elements of Sisi\u2019s policies.Sisi\u2019s crackdown has unfolded amid one of the most expansive overhauls of the legal system in Egyptian history. After declaring a state of emergency and disbanding Parliament in 2013, he issued a series of presidential decrees that granted him unprecedented power to silence his critics. A protest law enacted in November 2013 requires three days\u2019 notification before a demonstration can take place and gives the Interior Ministry the right to \u201ccancel, postpone or move\u201d the protest if it determines protesters will \u201cbreach ... the law.\u201d Broad new counterterrorism laws have expanded the definition of terrorism to include civil disobedience; this gives prosecutors latitude to roll over 15-day pretrial detention periods, in many cases without limit. And once a case gets to court, a compliant judiciary, long regarded as hostile to the opposition, has been unforgiving in its sentencing. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily conservative institution,\u201d one official told me, explaining that judges tend to favor a \u201cmaximalist approach\u201d to eliminate threats to the public order and safeguard their own interests. \u201cThey are overwhelmingly the children of judges, like gondoliers in Venice. It is a family business.\u201d According to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, a watchdog group in Cairo, the minister of justice has fired almost half of the 75 judges who called for more democracy in an open letter to Sisi and replaced them with hard-liners. Two hundred others have been sidelined with administrative chores or have left the country.One of the most notorious magistrates, Mohammed Nagy Shehata, known as the \u201cexecutioner judge,\u201d a holdover from the Mubarak era, has handed out hundreds of lengthy prison terms and death sentences to pro-democracy activists. In early 2016, Shehata sentenced three young members of April 6, who were attending a memorial service for a murdered comrade when they were arrested, to life terms for protesting without a license, possessing fireworks and spreading false information. (The sentences were later reduced to 10 years.) In June 2014, another Cairo judge sentenced 25 peaceful demonstrators, some of them teenagers, to 15 years for violating the protest law, blocking roads and attacking public institutions. \u201cKids are going to jail for four or five years,\u201d Dawoud said, \u201cbeing portrayed as anarchists and terrorists. No country in the world jails its young people for that long for demonstrating peacefully.\u201d During the Mubarak era, he said, \u201cI would take part in demonstrations and spend three days in a police station. We got released because we were students, and they were not going to destroy our future. There is no more of that kind of thinking.\u201dSameh Samir, a lawyer with the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a nongovernmental organization that defends many protesters, told me that his office has been overwhelmed by the caseload. \u201cThey are making random arrests, just sweeping people off the streets,\u201d he said. The regime has hampered the ability of human rights groups like Samir\u2019s to defend protesters, freezing their bank accounts and making it increasingly difficult to accept foreign funds, often a lifeline for such organizations.Ten and a Half Kilometers Camp, a collection of concrete bungalows surrounded by a fence just off the Cairo-to-Alexandria highway, typifies the prisons of the Sisi era. Built under Mubarak to house violent Islamists, the camp today serves as a pretrial detention facility for Islamists and a handful of secular political prisoners. A founding member of April 6 named Ayman, who did not want his last name mentioned, landed there in December 2015 after participating in an illegal protest. Thrown into a 26-foot-by-13-foot cell with 35 Islamists, he slept amid a crush of other prisoners on a blanket on the concrete floor. They defecated in a hole surrounded by curtains and were never permitted to leave the cell. \u201cYou need to take the word \u2018privacy\u2019 out of your dictionary if you are going to survive,\u201d he told me.After two weeks, Ayman was moved into a tiny disciplinary cell with 11 other prisoners to await interrogation. They shared a few thin blankets, drank unpurified water from a rusty pipe and survived on one piece of stale bread and cheese each day. A fluorescent light in the 10-foot ceiling shone day and night. \u201cWe learned how to get it unscrewed by standing on each other\u2019s shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to use a little acrobatics.\u201d Twice during his 26 days in the unit, he was shaken awake in the night, blindfolded, taken to an interrogation room and questioned for hours. \u201cThey asked me how the hierarchy of April 6 worked, how do we communicate,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t give them any names.\u201d The authorities finally moved him to Al Kanatar Prison, 15 miles from Cairo, where, after 20 days, a judge ordered his release.Ayman said that many of the prisoners he met were from the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political organization that briefly held power after Mubarak. The group formally renounced violence in the early 1970s, but Ayman watched his cellmates grow hardened in prison. \u201cThe torture and unjust imprisonment for long periods without clear charges or trial dates created human bombs,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one of them was just waiting to get out. They are so thirsty for revenge.\u201d Last April, when he heard that the authorities were again looking for him, Ayman sought refuge in South Africa, where his wife and two young daughters eventually joined him.Days after the Feb. 11 resignation of Mubarak, one of the world\u2019s longest-serving tyrants, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, a transitional military body, sent a bus to pick up Maher and three other protest leaders and took them to a villa owned by military-intelligence officials. Sisi, then the intelligence chief, and two other generals greeted them respectfully, Maher recalled. \u201cSisi said: \u2018You are heroes. You did miracles. You brought down Mubarak. You did something we failed to do for years. But now we need you to stop demonstrating.\u2019\u2009\u201dMaher and the others rejected Sisi\u2019s request. \u201cWe said: \u2018The revolution is not complete. We need to change the cabinet, change the structure of the government.\u2019 We kept sending them demands.\u201d Over the next six months, Maher met with Sisi three times. \u201cWe said the same, and he said the same. \u2018We need to stop demonstrating; stand together against the enemies.\u2019 Sisi always hated the protests.\u201dAfter Mubarak\u2019s downfall, Maher traveled to the United States and captivated students in gatherings at New York University, Harvard, M.I.T. and American University, and met with leaders of the Arab-American community. In Europe, he talked politics and revolution with the first vice president of the European Commission, Catherine Ashton; officials from the United Nations Human Rights Council; and Green Party and Social Democratic representatives to the European Parliament in Brussels. Western diplomats and politicians underestimated the structural weakness of the secular democrats, the grass-roots appeal of the Islamists and the entrenched power of the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 military intelligence and the state security apparatus.Back in Egypt, the April 6 leaders searched for a strategy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a vision,\u201d admitted Walid Shawky, a dentist and a member of the April 6 Political Committee. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an answer for what comes next.\u201d Maher struggled to articulate an ideology, vaguely describing the group\u2019s leanings as \u201csocial democratic, social liberal\u201d \u2014 somewhere between unfettered capitalism and Soviet-style communism. There were debates between those who wanted to transform April 6 into a secular political party that would challenge the Muslim Brotherhood and those, like Maher, who believed that such a transformation was too ambitious. The Brotherhood \u201coutnumbered us 10 to one,\u201d he told me. \u201cI thought that being a pressure group to write a new Constitution would be a better role for us.\u201d April 6 began an awareness campaign throughout the country. \u201cWe used to go out with slide projectors in rural areas, teaching people of all the [human rights] violations made by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces,\u201d recalls Mamdouh Gamal, one of tens of thousands of youths who joined the movement in the immediate aftermath of the revolution. He has since left it.While April 6 members continued their activism, the Islamists cemented their political advantage. The Muslim Brotherhood won parliamentary and presidential elections but enraged much of the population when it tried to draft a Constitution based largely on fundamentalist Islamic principles. By the end of 2012, Egypt was in chaos. \u201cThere were street fights, people at one another\u2019s throats, a real possibility of civil war,\u201d remembered Dawoud, the journalist. April 6 gave its support to Tamarod, a grass-roots movement that gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures favoring early elections that, they believed, would remove the Muslim Brotherhood from power. Maher believed that they had the military\u2019s support. Instead, on July 3, 2013, Sisi went on television and announced that he was deposing President Mohammed Morsi and seizing power. He suspended the Constitution, disbanded Parliament, declared a state of emergency, ordered the arrests of Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and then in August began the deadly attack on the Brotherhood protest camp at Rabaa. After nearly two years of turmoil, many Egyptians were desperate for stability, and April 6 suddenly found itself lacking any popular support. \u201cAt that time, there was not one person in the street who was against Sisi,\u201d recalled Amal Sharaf, the April 6 spokeswoman for the foreign media. After the killings, Sharaf said, \u201cwe tried to make protests, and we got beaten. People with hammers and knives were chasing us. There was a lot of ugliness.\u201dDays after the coup, the interim president, Adly Mansour, a former Constitutional Court chief justice who was appointed by Sisi as a figurehead civilian leader, summoned Maher to the presidential palace. \u201cHe was asked to go on trips to Western countries and say, \u2018This was not a coup, but something the people had asked for,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Ayman, the April 6 founding member. \u201cMaher and the whole leadership of the movement refused to do it. We said, \u2018This is a military coup \u2014 people asked for an early election.\u2019\u2009\u201d (Maher won\u2019t comment on the incident.) The movement\u2019s leaders publicly denounced the Rabaa killings as a \u201cmassacre,\u201d further antagonizing Sisi and sealing the group\u2019s fate. Maher was arrested on Nov. 30 and sent to Tora Prison.In 2014, as Maher and other April 6 leaders languished in jail, Egypt\u2019s Court for Urgent Matters, one of Sisi\u2019s favored tools for stifling dissent, banned the group\u2019s activities, accusing it of espionage and defaming the state. Last winter, Amr Ali, who succeeded Maher as the April 6 general coordinator, received a three-year sentence for conspiring to overthrow the government and joining an illegal organization, another crippling blow to the movement. \u201cThe case against us is not finished,\u201d said Mohammed Samy, the acting coordinator of the outlawed movement. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to capture that many people now, so they put this case in the drawer, and when they want to recapture us, they will open it again.\u201dThe government remains resolute. \u201cApril 6 was not at all a peaceful organization,\u201d said a top Egyptian official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cIt was an anarchist movement that used violence against the security forces and incited violence. They said, \u2018We have to topple the government.\u2019\u2009\u201d When I pressed him for an example of such violence, he cited, without offering proof, an April 6 member who, during the revolution, \u201cseized a gun from a police officer and threw it in the Nile.\u201dI met the school administrator at an evening soiree, attended mostly by gay Egyptians, including my translator, and hosted by a European diplomat at his elegant apartment in a building a few blocks from the Nile. The atmosphere was festive but rife with anxiety: In a sweeping crackdown, the police have been shutting gay bars and nightclubs, entrapping gay people using online dating sites, even raiding private homes in the name of debauchery and prostitution laws.The persecution has gone far beyond the Mubarak regime\u2019s sporadic attacks on the gay community. Over cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Egyptian red wine, I chatted with a towering bearded man who had spent four years as a closeted member of a Salafist sect in Alexandria. \u201cI hated myself, and I thought being a Salafist would cure me of being gay,\u201d he told me. He had fallen in love with another fundamentalist, a Syrian who jilted him and joined the refugee flood to Europe. The man had returned to the gay scene in Alexandria and Cairo \u2014 but the oppressive atmosphere has made it nearly impossible for him to mix socially with other gay men. \u201cWe have never seen anything like this in Egypt,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople are terrified.\u201d (A few days after I left Egypt, my translator would seek, and eventually gain, humanitarian asylum in Germany, claiming that the crackdown on gay Egyptians had endangered him.)Around midnight, the host cleared furniture from the salon, and the crowd gathered around the perimeter of the room to watch the evening\u2019s entertainment. A lithe, bare-chested man danced erotically around another man swathed in a black burqa, prying apart the second man\u2019s legs and removing a beach ball, a teddy bear and other objects and tossing them around the salon. The lewdly choreographed show, taking place out of sight of Sisi\u2019s ubiquitous security forces, seemed an act of defiance. Yet I was asked repeatedly not to identify the location of the party or anything else that might compromise those in attendance.The country\u2019s security forces have displayed their unbridled power in other startling ways. Last year, Ziad Hassan Qenawy, a 3-year-old from the Cairo exurb of Al Shorouk, was detained at Cairo Airport with his father and hauled into court to face sentencing for six guilty verdicts handed down in absentia, ranging from theft to \u201cresisting the authorities.\u201d Each was punishable by a year in prison. The boy\u2019s lawyer, Mahmoud Al Shinawy, calls the case a revenge plot against the father, an affluent businessman who had refused to submit to a police shakedown. In the courtroom, Shinawy told me: \u201cI had to lift Ziad up so the judge could see him. When the judge saw me carrying the boy, he asked me, \u2018Why are you bringing your son to the court?\u2019 I said: \u2018This is not my son. This is the defendant.\u2019\u2009\u201d Ziad was given suspended sentences, \u201cbut he now has a criminal record,\u201d Shinawy said. \u201cIt will last for his entire life, and he will lose many rights.\u201dEgypt\u2019s byzantine justice system seemed to be assiduous in sweeping up toddlers. Last February, a military court found 3-year-old Ahmed Mansour Qorani Sharara and 115 others guilty of killing three people and damaging private and public property during a pro-Muslim Brotherhood demonstration. Ahmed was sentenced to life in prison, but the verdict was later thrown out of court. The police insist that it was a case of mistaken identity and that the real culprit, a teenager, is still being sought.My translator and I walked through the downtown streets, past stray dogs and cats feasting on piles of garbage in alleys, past derelict century-old buildings that looked dangerously close to collapse. After 15 minutes, we arrived at the Eish and Malh bistro, a high-ceilinged pizza-and-salad joint. The April 6 organizer, a skinny 33-year-old with square wire-rim glasses, a white Tour de France shirt, a thin beard and a mop of curly black hair, was smoking furiously at a round table in the center of the large room. He insisted on being quoted anonymously, only to change his mind, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone who reads this to feel it\u2019s a fabrication,\u201d before anxiously changing his mind again.He recounted how plainclothes security men had jumped out of five cars at the April demonstration, punched and pistol-whipped him, then pushed him inside one of the vehicles and blindfolded him on the way to the security headquarters. He spent the next five months in pretrial detention, before a judge ordered his strictly supervised release.\u201cI know that I am always being observed, and it drives you to an obsession,\u201d he said. \u201cI have thought about going abroad, but I need to be more psychologically stable first. I need to have the safe feeling, so that I can organize my life again.\u201d (His anxieties about being rearrested proved well founded. In February, the police detained him without explanation for six hours; when he arrived late for that day\u2019s scheduled detention, he was sent back to prison for 18 days.) As he stood up to leave the pizza parlor, I asked him if the campaign for democracy had accomplished anything. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it was a waste,\u201d he told me after a pause. \u201cIt created a feeling, a space, even if we don\u2019t have that now. Even if the people are afraid again, that experience was so important. In spite of everything, I believe it was worth it.\u201dIn February, I returned to Cairo to meet Maher, who was released from prison on Jan. 5. As the April 6 leader prepared to report for his own far stricter surveillance, I asked him whether this routine, a constant reminder of the unyielding power of the state, demoralized him. Maher shrugged. He had recently finished reading Samuel Huntington\u2019s 1991 book, \u201cThe Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th Century,\u201d and he believed that history would prove his efforts worthwhile. \u201cHuntington wrote that waves of revolution are greater than waves of counterrevolution,\u201d Maher said. \u201cSo it\u2019s three steps forward, two steps back.\u201dA friend picked up Maher at his home, and I followed them in my car to the station. The sun was sinking low over the desert as I drove down the wide street leading from Maher\u2019s home, past shabby apartment blocks with laundry drying on every balcony and stunted palm trees lining the meridian. I parked at the bottom of a hill, across the street from the gated police compound, an Egyptian flag fluttering over the entrance. The wail of a muezzin wafted across the neighborhood; four officers stood inside a corrugated-roof guard post just before the gate. The driver embraced Maher and then motored away. Maher wore his woolen ski cap and carried a black satchel containing a novel and a dinner that Reham had prepared for him. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he told me, hoisting the bag over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll find out what it is when I get inside.\u201d Then he crossed the road, walked past the four unsmiling policemen and disappeared into the shadows.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Currency Champ Lives South of the Border", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byStrategiesCan you guess which world currency has gained the most since Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration as president?Here\u2019s a clue.Of all major currencies, the one that has strengthened the most since Jan. 20, the day Mr. Trump became president, is the Mexican peso. In his inauguration speech, Mr. Trump pledged to \u201cbring back our jobs\u201d and \u201cbring back our borders,\u201d in veiled references to Mexico. Since that day, the Mexican peso has gained more than 15 percent.What\u2019s startling is that the peso served throughout the presidential campaign as a proxy for Mr. Trump\u2019s political fortunes. The connection isn\u2019t perfect, but the two have had a very close and extremely uncomfortable relationship. And at the moment, it has taken an unexpected turn.Recall that on the night of Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning election victory, the peso immediately took a brutal beating, plunging 12 percent against the dollar. That move was consistent with patterns throughout the presidential campaign. Whenever Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects rose, the peso\u2019s dived. Whenever he raised the volume on promises to build a towering wall on the Mexican border or to stamp out \u201cbad hombres\u201d or to crack down on immigration, the peso lost some of its value.That\u2019s why the data from the foreign exchange markets is so interesting. The peso isn\u2019t being battered these days. It has been getting much stronger.The peso may still be a proxy for the Trump presidency. If so, the foreign exchange rates may be telling us that the Trump administration\u2019s policies are no longer being viewed as quite so harmful to Mexico \u2014 and to other emerging markets.There are several possible explanations for this.For a start, now that some important members of the Trump administration are in place and beginning to get down to work, the statements of policy makers other than the president are turning out to be far less troubling than those of the president himself.He added, however, \u201cEven taking that into account, and given the other fundamentals of the Mexican economy, I think the peso is still undervalued.\u201d He also said that both the bank and the finance ministry are intent on stabilizing the peso. The central bank has raised interest rates in the last four meetings to 6.25 percent.Since Inauguration Day, against a basket of world currencies, the peso was the top performer, with a gain of 15.2 percent, according to Bloomberg. Since the beginning of the year, it was second, with a gain of about 7.3 percent compared to 7.5 percent for the South African rand.Other emerging-market currencies have fared well since the beginning of the year, too, and while the Mexican peso\u2019s rise may be the most striking, it didn\u2019t occur in isolation. The South Korean won, Taiwanese dollar and Brazilian real have had sizable gains, even though the United States Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates, a move that might have unnerved the currency markets.Of course, there is an intriguing possibility. The strong peso may reflect an apparent disarray in the Trump administration, a situation that could easily be reversed.During the campaign season, for example, the peso also surged. That happened in moments when Mr. Trump appeared to be weakest. On the evening of Sept. 26, for example, when Hillary Clinton performed particularly well in a debate and Mr. Trump performed poorly, the peso soared, along with Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index futures. Those moves were widely interpreted as an assessment of Mr. Trump\u2019s chances in the presidential election.The financial markets may well be voting now. But in at least one respect, finance is not like politics. The markets will vote again and again, thousands of times a day. The peso\u2019s ascendancy won\u2019t last forever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anatoly S. Chernyaev, Key Aide and Gorbachev\u2019s \u2018Alter Ego,\u2019 Dies at 95", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byAnatoly S. Chernyaev, a crucial adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev as he tried to refashion the Soviet Union\u2019s relations with the West, died on March 12 in Moscow. He was 95.The Gorbachev Foundation announced his death. He had been treated for a respiratory ailment for several weeks, a friend said.As a close aide to Mr. Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, on both foreign and domestic affairs, Mr. Chernyaev (pronounced churn-YAI-yev) played a central role in his bold attempt to modernize and liberalize the Soviet Union and was with him at a vacation house during the short-lived coup against him in 1991 and when he stepped down at the end of that year.Mr. Chernyaev went on to become deeply disillusioned by the revanchist rule in Russia of President Vladimir V. Putin, acquaintances said.\u201cHe was one of the key actors in ending the Cold War,\u201d said Svetlana Savranskaya, who is director of Russian programs at the archive, a research center at George Washington University, and who is editing the diaries. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overestimate his role in pushing Gorbachev toward arms control, mutual security and the integration of Russia into Europe.\u201dWilliam Taubman, a professor at Amherst College and author of a forthcoming Gorbachev biography, said that while Mr. Chernyaev was Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s main foreign policy adviser, Mr. Gorbachev \u201cconsulted him endlessly on domestic matters as well\u201d and once described him as his \u201calter ego.\u201dAnatoly Sergeyevich Chernyaev was born into an aristocratic Russian family on May 26, 1921, during the civil war that followed the Bolshevik seizure of power. His father, Sergey, was an engineer, and a grandfather had been a general in the czarist army. Anatoly was privately tutored in French and German as a child.He and his family viewed Stalin, who ruled until his death in 1953, as a \u201ccrude, ignorant, completely alien force,\u201d Professor Taubman said. But Mr. Chernyaev\u2019s path nonetheless took him directly into the Soviet political mainstream.He served in the Soviet Army in World War II before graduating from the history faculty of Moscow State University and teaching there for a time. He then took a job at the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the epicenter of Soviet power and ideology.In a pivotal assignment from 1958 to 1961, Mr. Chernyaev worked in Prague on the staff of a journal, Problems of Peace and Socialism, where he was deeply affected by his contacts with reform-minded Soviet intellectuals as well as visiting Communists from Western Europe.After returning to the Central Committee, he thrived, becoming deputy director of the international department in the early 1970s. While he never became anything like a dissident, Mr. Chernyaev privately formed a deeply critical perspective on the Soviet system.\u201cHe was trying to do what good he could from within the system,\u201d said Professor Taubman, who spent a decade talking regularly with Mr. Chernyaev for his Gorbachev biography.Mr. Chernyaev was 65 and ready to retire when Mr. Gorbachev asked him to join his effort to remake foreign policy by bringing the Soviet Union closer to the West and scaling down the nuclear standoff that had lasted for decades. He agreed.Mr. Gorbachev saw this campaign for \u201cnew thinking\u201d in foreign affairs to run parallel with glasnost, his new policy of openness in the press, and perestroika, a reconstruction of the lumbering Soviet economy.In his diary in 1986, Mr. Chernyaev expressed joy at the ascent of a Communist Party general secretary with new ideas.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a rare leader: a very smart man, educated, \u2018alive,\u2019 honest, with ideas and imagination,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd he is brave. Myths and taboos (including ideological prejudices) are nothing to him.\u201dHe was at Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s side at summit meetings with President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain; advised the Soviet leader on fending off Kremlin conservatives; and chided him in private (and in his diary) when he felt it was necessary.When hard-liners seized power in Moscow in August 1991 and imprisoned Mr. Gorbachev in his vacation house on the Black Sea, Mr. Chernyaev, a guest there and a powerful swimmer, offered to smuggle out a note by swimming to a beach more than three miles away. Uncertain where he could take the note, they dropped the plan. The coup quickly failed in any case.Mr. Chernyaev was married for 47 years to the former Genya Vaynberg, who died in 2005. He is survived by their daughter, Anna Chernyaeva, and his partner, Lyudmila Rudakova.He wrote six books and many articles, and in his later work he lamented the authoritarian and nationalist turn of the country under Mr. Putin and his aides.\u201cHe felt they\u2019d squandered everything he and Gorbachev had done,\u201d Ms. Savranskaya said. \u201cHe was grieving.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the year of Stalin\u2019s death. It was 1953, not 1956.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Superstar Firms\u2019 May Have Shrunk Workers\u2019 Share of Income", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byBut in recent decades, that steady share \u2014 which includes everything from the chief executive\u2019s bonuses and stock options to the parking-lot attendant\u2019s minimum wage and tips \u2014 started to flutter. In the 2000s, it slipped significantly. Although the numbers have inched up in the last couple of years, labor\u2019s portion has not risen above 59 percent since before the recession.Some economists argue that technological advancements are to blame as employers have replaced workers with machines. Others point to trade powered by cheap foreign labor, a view championed by President Trump that particularly resonated among voters.Over the last 15 years, for example, labor productivity has grown faster than wages, a sign that workers are not being adequately compensated for their contributions. And some industries have fared worse than others. Slices of the pie going to mining and manufacturing narrowed the most, while service workers (including professional and business services) had the biggest gains.From manufacturing to retailing, giant companies have managed to gobble up a larger and larger share of the market.Think about the retail sector, where mom-and-pop stores once crowded the landscape. Now it is dominated by a handful of giants like Walmart, Target and Costco.\u201cThey\u2019re very sophisticated and efficient and they don\u2019t use as much labor,\u201d said Mr. Autor, who worked on the research with a team of economists that included David Dorn, Lawrence F. Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen.With efficiencies come advantages.Software platforms and online services, for example, may be expensive to install, but not so costly to expand. Technology can make it easier to exploit smaller competitive advantages. And there is no need for duplicate payroll, shipping or human resources departments.The idea of superstars vacuuming up a majority of goodies is perhaps more obvious on the individual level. Because of technology like cable and satellite television and the internet, music luminaries like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift or sports phenoms like LeBron James or Cristiano Ronaldo can reach a much larger audience and gain a greater proportion of the revenue generated.What was once true of pop stars can now be seen in more mundane industries. \u201cOver the past several decades, only the highest earners have seen steady wage gains,\u201d a report from the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers concluded late last year. \u201cFor most workers, wage growth has been sluggish and has failed to keep pace with gains in productivity.\u201dLarger companies tend to pay better than smaller ones, Mr. Autor and the other researchers say, and in the technology sector especially, salaries can be impressive. Workers there are sharing in the larger pie \u2014 there are just fewer of them to do so.The researchers examined six industries that account for 80 percent of private employment in the United States. In each one, they discovered \u201ca remarkably consistent upward trend in concentration.\u201d In manufacturing, for instance, the top four companies controlled 43 percent of sales in 2012, up from 38 percent in 1982. In finance, the figure grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, and in retail trade it went to 30 percent, from 15 percent.The faster concentration grew, the bigger the drop in labor\u2019s share.\u201cWhat\u2019s different about new superstar firms is they don\u2019t have the cadre of middle-class jobs for nonelite workers,\u201d said Mr. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard.\u201cThat\u2019s very worrisome,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe trend is going on in country after country.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the effect large companies may have had on a decline in workers\u2019 share of income misspelled the surname of an author of the study on such \u201csuperfirms.\u201d He is John Van Reenen, not Van Reenan.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After $225 Billion in Deals Last Year, China Reins In Overseas Investment", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China struck $225 billion in deals to acquire companies abroad last year, a record-breaking number that signaled to the world that Chinese business leaders were hot to haggle.Now, China \u2014 with a worried eye on the money leaving its borders \u2014 is telling some of its companies to cool it down.On Saturday, in the strongest public signal yet that Beijing is changing course, China\u2019s commerce minister castigated what he called \u201cblind and irrational investment.\u201d At a news briefing during the annual meeting of China\u2019s congress, the minister, Zhong Shan, said officials planned to intensify supervision of what he called a small number of companies.\u201cSome enterprises have already paid the price,\u201d said Mr. Zhong, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of President Xi Jinping. \u201cSome even have had a negative impact on our national image.\u201dJust a day earlier, Zhou Xiaochuan, the country\u2019s top central banker, had also questioned the wisdom of some recent Chinese overseas deals. \u201cSome are not in line with our requirements and policies for overseas investment, such as in sports, entertainment and clubs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis didn\u2019t bring much benefit to China and caused some complaints overseas.\u201dThe comments are the clearest confirmation that the government is hitting the brakes on the sometimes chaotic rush overseas by deep-pocketed Chinese companies with a reputation for having more money than deal-making aptitude.\u201cAre these guys in over their heads?\u201d said Brock Silvers, a longtime investment banker in Shanghai. \u201cThe answer to me is, in some cases, they seem to be.\u201dA series of Chinese deals have come apart this winter \u2014 although it is not always clear whether Beijing stepped in or whether buyers themselves suddenly decided they were making a big mistake.Chinese families and companies have been rushing to move money out of the country for more than a year amid worries over a slowing national economy, a weakening currency and numerous other problems. The outflow has been expensive \u2014 China has spent $1 trillion over the past two and a half years to shore up the value of its currency \u2014 and threatens to damage the country\u2019s efforts to help its rising middle class.Among its moves, Beijing secretly told banks in late November that any movement of $5 million or more out of the country required special approval. Since then, regulators have also told each bank not to move more money out of the country for clients than they take in. Some banks had been moving up to six times as much money out of the country.That rule has complicated not only mergers and acquisitions but also the way many global companies move their China-made profits overseas, in the form of dividends. That could put into question whether China is complying with its commitments to the International Monetary Fund, which are part of a broader Chinese effort to increase the profile of the country\u2019s currency.Foreign executives describe broad difficulties moving money out of China. \u201cOn dividend payments, European Union companies experience more tedious paperwork, extended times of processing and the issue of breaking up the dividends over several months if it is a sizable amount,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.Mr. Zhou, China\u2019s central banker, said on Friday that dividends should not be subject to restrictions, but he did not go into details.China\u2019s $225.4 billion in announced deals for overseas properties last year amounted to more than double 2015\u2019s total, according to Dealogic, a data firm that tracks deals.Chinese officials appear eager to portray China\u2019s tougher stance on deals abroad as an effort to prompt more responsible investing rather than an effort to shore up the country\u2019s financial system. Mr. Zhong, the commerce minister, said the country had not changed its long-term policy of encouraging Chinese companies to become more global.But Chinese officials have a strong incentive not to acknowledge the administrative limits they have put on large movements of money out of the country. Such limits may make foreign investors more wary of putting money into China, at a time when Chinese leadership is trying to encourage more bond purchases by foreigners and other investments into the country to offset the money moving out.Anhui Xinke New Materials, a copper processing company in central China, made a deal in November to buy Voltage Pictures, an American film financing and production company, for $350 million. A month later, Anhui Xinke pulled out of the transaction before its completion.Many Chinese companies already have a lot of money overseas. More than $500 billion sluiced out of the country in the few months after the stock market plummeted in summer 2015 and before China began gradually enforcing previously dormant rules on money transfers in February 2016. Much of that money is still being allocated to longer-term investments, along with another $50 billion or more that is leaving the country each month and the accumulated earnings on previous investments made overseas.Qiang Li, a managing partner for China at the law firm DLA Piper, said that only a quarter of the many deals in which he was involved relied on transferring money out of China and might face obstacles. The rest are proceeding without difficulty because they use Chinese-owned dollars that are already overseas, he said.\u201cThere is no question,\u201d he said, \u201cthat investors will continue to invest overseas, by getting the proper approvals.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Dutch Stopped Being Decent and Dull", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn sum, Dutch politics were decent and dull.But these are not normal times. Populism is sweeping across the Western world. Populists of the right like Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands are different in some ways, but they have a few important things in common: They despise the European Union and see Muslim immigrants and refugees as an existential threat to national identities \u2014 or what some now grandly choose to call \u201cJudeo-Christian civilization.\u201dWhat happens in the Netherlands could be a harbinger for other elections in Europe, and this also means that the future of the European Union is at stake. Mr. Wilders, like Ms. Le Pen, has promised to hold a national referendum on membership in the union, and he favors a Dutch version of Brexit. He also wants to close the nation\u2019s borders to Muslims, shut down mosques, deport Muslim citizens who commit a crime and ban the Quran, which he has compared to \u201cMein Kampf.\u201dAccording to recent polls, Mr. Wilders\u2019s Party For Freedom should emerge as the biggest group in Parliament, followed by the conservative People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy, known as the V.V.D. For that reason, his views need to be taken seriously. The only reason he may not become the next prime minister, even with a resounding win, is the nature of the Dutch electoral system, which is proportional. As many as 28 parties will compete, from such zany outfits as the Jesus Lives Party and the Party of Non-Voters to the mainstream Christian Democrats and the V.V.D. No party is likely to be large enough to form a government on its own, so the elections will be followed by a period of horse-trading among party leaders. The most viable coalition will win.Since even the increasingly right-wing V.V.D., headed by the current prime minister, Mark Rutte, has ruled out forming a government with Mr. Wilders, the Party For Freedom\u2019s chances of leading the country are slim. But it is not unthinkable; after all, Mr. Rutte, like most politicians, is quite capable of changing his mind.Not so long ago, Mr. Wilders would have been regarded as pretty zany himself. He is the only official member of his party, an expedient to ensure control over it. His agitated opinions on immigrants, Islam and the European Union, not to mention his bizarre dyed hair and crass speeches and tweets, would have placed him far outside the mainstream of Dutch society.The Dutch have long prided themselves on being the most tolerant, most progressive, most enlightened country in the world, a beacon of multiculturalism, a haven for pot smokers, a place where gay equality and the right to euthanasia were championed, and immigrants and refugees from all parts of the world were welcomed. Liberalism became almost a badge of national identity, so much so that Mr. Wilders uses gay rights and gender equality as sticks to beat Muslims by characterizing them as less tolerant.He is not the first anti-Muslim agitator to do this. At the turn of this century, a dandy named Pim Fortuyn, a politician who had once been a man of the left and was openly gay, emerged with the message that Muslims were a threat to liberal Western values. Outrageously amusing, he said things out loud that many people thought but were afraid to utter. Still, his stated wish to halt Muslim immigration was regarded as so inflammatory in 2002 that his own party, called the Livable Netherlands, rejected him. That same year, Mr. Fortuyn was shot dead by an animal-rights activist who hated his attitudes toward minorities.The progressive nature of modern Dutch society is one of the reasons first Pim Fortuyn and now Geert Wilders became so popular, among not just conservatives but some former leftists, too. The Netherlands used to be a very religious country; Mr. Fortuyn, like Mr. Wilders, grew up as a Roman Catholic. It took a great deal of rebellious effort from the 1960s onward to enhance the rights of women and gays and diminish the influence of organized religion, Protestant and Catholic. Certain feminists and some progressives now blame immigrants from Muslim countries for challenging these social changes by bringing in a new faith-based orthodoxy.But Dutch-style populism is based on a paradox. While some people hate conservative Muslims for their views on women and gays, others, who feel adrift in this more secular age, look to a leader like Mr. Wilders to bring back the old certainties of a more traditional and ethnically homogeneous society.The kind of free-spirited liberalism that made Amsterdam a magnet for the backpackers of the Western world was always concentrated in the cities along the North Sea coast. It\u2019s telling that Mr. Wilders hails from Limburg, a largely Catholic province in the southern hinterlands, bordering Belgium and Germany.The Catholic Church and once-thriving coal mines had given Limburgers a sense of place, pride and identity. But even as the mines were closing in the \u201960s and \u201970s, the Church and the Catholic Party lost influence. At the same time, resentment of the metropolitan elites grew, and not just in Limburg.Like populists everywhere, Mr. Wilders promises to \u201ctake our country back\u201d and defend Dutch identity \u2014 from Islam, of course, but also from Brussels, the administrative capital of the European Union. People who feel abandoned and bewildered by globalization, new technology, secularism, immigration, refugee crises, economic stagnation and Islamist violence are susceptible to dreams of going back to some never-never land in the past when harmony reigned and all felt at home with their own kind.What that country would look like in the Dutch case is unclear, for Dutch society was always a patchwork of different identities, mostly connected to religious affiliations. Protestants married Protestants, shopped at Protestant stores, played for Protestant soccer clubs, voted for Protestant parties, and were buried in Protestant cemeteries. The same was true for Catholics, or indeed socialists. Each community was tied to its own sociopolitical-cultural network, called \u201cpillars,\u201d or zuilen in Dutch. Politics rested on compromises made by the leaders of these pillars, who managed society together in carefully constructed coalition governments.These pillars have now largely collapsed. Apart from the monarchy (descended from William, Prince of Orange, who rebelled against Catholic Spain in the 16th century) and the orange-shirted national soccer team, there is not much that defines Dutch national identity today.Mr. Wilders, as well as more mainstream politicians who are afraid of losing votes to the far right, like to talk about \u201cDutch values,\u201d but it is hard to know what they are. Gay rights and gender equality are hardly traditional national values. And so, stirred up by figures like Mr. Wilders, people get bogged down in absurd debates about Black Peter, the frolicking servant in blackface who accompanies St. Nicholas at his annual feast on Dec. 5. Not only black Dutch citizens now find this type of minstrelsy, invented in the 19th century, offensive.But right-wing politicians and their supporters see any attempt to abolish blackface as a vicious attack on Dutch identity. There have been parliamentary debates on this burning issue. There have been violent demonstrations.These disputes over Black Peter, the European Union and Islam are, in fact, a mere symbol of a deeper resentment, against the cosmopolitan elites, who live in cities, form paternalistic, technocratic, compromising governments, and feel comfortable with international institutions and a globalized economy.Mr. Wilders, a former punk rocker whose maternal family is partly Indonesian, might seem an odd figure to purify the identity of a largely Protestant trading nation with a long tradition of allowing people of different faiths and persuasions to live in relative peace. But what he has in common with his followers is a seething rage against people he suspects of thinking they\u2019re better than him.This may not be sufficient to make him prime minister, but the politics of fury have done plenty of damage already.A professor at Bard College and the author of \u201cMurder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo Van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Campus, Embracing Feminism and Facing the Future", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byWomen Today\u201cThese students want the freedom to express who they are without the constraints of choices such as either a woman or man, heterosexual or homosexual,\u201d Dr. Campt said. \u201cThose categories no longer carry a definitional value.\u201dBoth Dr. Campt and Dr. Crossley, who is also author of the book \u201cFinding Feminism: Millennial Activists and the Unfinished Gender Revolution,\u201d say women today are in a world that is profoundly different from what it was a generation ago, so they are having to create ways of coping with new challenges, the same as previous generations did.\u201cThe structure of the economy, of family and of work is very, very different,\u201d Dr. Campt said.She said young women today were entering an economy with fewer work opportunities and much more debt. It is also an era in which feminist activism and education happen in both the physical world and the virtual one, often through blogs and social media.One thing that surprised Dr. Crossley about the college women she studied was their wholehearted embrace of feminism. \u201cThey spoke about how feminism permeated their worldview and their interactions and the relationships they had in their everyday lives,\u201d she said.We spoke to female undergraduates at colleges around the country to find out what issues they were most concerned about and what feminism meant to them. Their comments have been edited and condensed.Sociology major and French minorThe biggest issue for me as a woman on campus is safety and acceptance. When I walk in a room, I do a quick scan to see if there are any other women there. And if there are men, I look at how many are white, and their ages. It gives me a sense of the openness of the room.I worry about equality of pay, and it\u2019s something that when I hear my dad talk about, as a black man, I think, \u201cHe\u2019ll still probably make more than I ever will,\u201d because not only am I a woman, but I\u2019m black.I feel like the women\u2019s movement doesn\u2019t represent women of color as well as it could. I\u2019m not expecting the movement to be perfect, but if you\u2019re talking about women earning 80 cents for every dollar a man makes, you\u2019re not really talking about Latina women, black women, Native American women, who make even less than that.Neuroscience majorIf you had asked me my concerns about being a woman six months ago, I don\u2019t know if they would have been the same. The election and college have changed that. I\u2019m a Cuban immigrant \u2014 I came to the U.S. in 2009, when I was 11 years old \u2014 and what concerns me most now is the idea of safety, both on the college campus and in the world.I\u2019m very involved with the fight against rape culture, and I\u2019m out as an L.G.B.T. student and activist. But the climate in North Carolina now, that\u2019s something to be concerned about.I worry a lot about immigration status. I\u2019m technically safe, but who knows what will happen now. The whole idea of safety as something that is given to us by society concerns me. The idea that we are to blame for what happens to us \u2014 women, minorities, immigrants \u2014 because of how we dress or express ourselves or our immigration status. There\u2019s so much victim-blaming.I consider myself a feminist, and that means attaining equality in all the senses that entails. As an out woman of color, it\u2019s the idea that I will be able to be myself and fight for the things I care about.Biology and African studies majorFor me as a woman, what I see on campus and in the bigger world is that we\u2019re always fighting for equal opportunity and access. I am on the pre-med track, and I\u2019m also African-American, Korean and Slovak. I see such a lack of minority women in STEM.I haven\u2019t had a physician mentor who is a minority woman, and I think it\u2019s harder to relate to role models in your future career field when they haven\u2019t had the same racial experiences. I don\u2019t have someone I can ask: \u201cWhat was it like being a black woman in your medical school classes? What were the challenges you faced?\u201d That\u2019s a real concern of mine.On campus, I\u2019m concerned about the language and rhetoric used to describe minority groups, and that includes women. I think our voices may be heard less as a result of the current rhetoric and the direct implications of it.Public relations and marketing majorI\u2019m concerned that some women don\u2019t feel capable of succeeding or comfortable in our own skin. I am a conservative Christian and my morals and beliefs line up with that, but I would also say I\u2019m a conservative Christian feminist. I believe in God and I am definitely pro-woman, but I\u2019m also pro-man.I believe God created men and created women with different skills and talents to serve for different reasons. Feminism to me is believing in myself, following my dreams and empowering other people \u2014 both men and women.Political science and geography majorThe biggest issue on campus for women here is sexual assault, being afraid of the young men we know here, who are in our lives.One of my best friends was sexually assaulted a year ago but didn\u2019t report it, and we were out at a bar and he was there. She was very uncomfortable with him being there, and I went up to him and said, \u201cLook, she feels really uncomfortable, could you leave?\u201d He said no. It\u2019s concerning, the rape culture and lack of respect for women.Another big concern for me as a woman is being able to graduate and find a job. I think as a woman it\u2019s a lot more difficult. Guys are given priority \u2014 you\u2019ve seen the studies where if it says you\u2019re a man on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 you are more likely to get hired. I\u2019m also bothered that if you\u2019re an assertive woman \u2014 and I\u2019m called aggressive all the time simply because I\u2019m assertive \u2014 it\u2019s misconstrued as bossiness. That really undermines us. It says to women it\u2019s not O.K. for us to be driven, ambitious and have strong opinions.I am concerned about unequal pay between men and women in the workplace. I\u2019m going to grad school after college to study public policy and if I have debt after that, will I be able to pay it off as well as my male peers? Because men earn more. When I look at jobs, I know it will take me X amount of years longer to pay off my school debt than it would if I were a man. That could affect my ability to pursue a career I\u2019m passionate about.I consider myself a feminist and also a pretty religious Christian. I went to the march in Washington this past January, but I also went to the inauguration. I look at feminism as feeling empowered enough to behave in a way that demands respect, rather than acting in a way that demands attention. I am a student body vice president at T.C.U. and very career-focused. I\u2019ve thought a lot about balancing what the world defines as a strong woman with biblical truths, such as this phrase in Scripture: \u201cSubmit to your husband.\u201dThe Bible is very clear about men being the ones to lead relationships. And for a long time it was difficult for me to accept this, but I\u2019ve realized it doesn\u2019t have to demean a woman\u2019s role in a relationship. Submission doesn\u2019t have to come from weakness. We are all called to serve each other by utilizing our strengths. My biblical foundation empowers me to advocate for women\u2019s rights.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Increasing Significance of the Decline of Men", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byAt one end of the scale, men continue to dominate.While women were hit much harder than men by the disappearance of middle-skill jobs, the majority of women managed to upgrade their skills and find better-paying jobs. By comparison, more than half of men who lost middle-skill jobs had to settle for lower-paying occupations.From 1979 to 2007, seven percent of men and 16 percent of women with middle-skill jobs lost their positions, according to the Dallas Fed study. Four percent of these men moved to low-skill work, and 3 percent moved to high-skill jobs. Almost all the women, 15 percent, moved into high-skill jobs, with only 1 percent moving to low-skill work.Men whose childhood years were marked by family disruption seem to fare the worst.For boys and girls raised in two-parent households, there were only modest differences between the sexes in terms of success at school, and boys tended to earn more than their sisters in early adulthood.Among children raised in single-parent households, however, boys performed significantly less well than their sisters in school, and their employment rate as young adults was lower. \u201cRelative to their sisters,\u201d Autor and his collaborators wrote, \u201cboys born to disadvantaged families\u201d \u2014 with disadvantage measured here by mother\u2019s marital status and education \u2014 \u201chave higher rates of disciplinary problems, lower achievement scores, and fewer high-school completions.\u201dWhen the children in the study reached early adulthood, the same pattern emerged in employment:Employment rates of young women are nearly invariant to family marital status, while the employment rates of young adult men from non-married families are eight to ten percentage points below those from married families at all income levels.Autor and his co-authors conclude that family structure \u201cis more consequential for the skills development and labor market outcomes of boys than girls.\u201dFor many men without college degrees, the scaffolding that underpinned their fathers\u2019 lives has been torn down. David Leege, an emeritus professor of political science at Notre Dame, wrote me by email:The institutions they knew to process authoritatively the economic and social changes they faced in earlier times are gone or undermined \u2014 the union, the Catholic Church, the industrial bar with co-workers, the compliant wife \u2014 and what has replaced it, if anything, is an unvetted information technology that yields little truth or comfort, and nurtures anomie and anger.David Geary, a professor of psychology at the University of Missouri, describes a vicious cycle that entraps men who either drop out of the work force or take low-skill jobs with few prospects of improvement:The long-term political implications of large numbers of unengaged and underemployed men are potentially very serious. Marriage typically reduces men\u2019s aggressiveness and rule breaking and focuses them on family and engagement with the community. However, if large numbers of them are not attractive as potential husbands, due to poor long-term economic prospects, then this \u201ccivilizing\u201d influence is lost to them. I don\u2019t know what the tipping point would be, but the potential for large-scale discontentment and destabilization increases as the proportion of these men increases.David Buss, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas-Austin, elaborated on Geary\u2019s point in an email, stressing the lower proportion of men than women getting college degrees:Women have strong mate preferences such that they do not want to mate or marry men who are less educated, less intelligent, and less successful than they are.And this, Buss said, \u201ccreates a surplus of men\u201d at the low end who are not going to get married.Millions of these less well educated men are not going to get the benefits of marriage:Married men live longer, are less likely to become alcoholic, take drugs, commit suicide, etc.In a phone interview a number of years ago, Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, was prescient:Men are really going to have to change their act or have big problems. I think of big guys from the cave days, guys who were good at lifting stuff and hunting and the things we got genetically selected out for. During the industrial revolution that wasn\u2019t so bad, but it\u2019s not going to be there anymore.Asked to confirm his earlier views, Freeman wrote me that what he predictedhas occurred and continues, and perhaps is linked to the penchant for some male workers to be more favorable to right-wing populism than might have been the case.David Deming, a professor of public policy at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, suggests that things are not as simple for men as \u201cchanging their act.\u201dHigh-paying, difficult-to-automate jobs increasingly require social skills. Nearly all job growth since 1980 has been in occupations that are relatively social skill-intensive. Jobs that require high levels of analytical and mathematical reasoning but low levels of social interaction have fared especially poorly.What this means, according to Deming, is thatthe economy-wide shift toward social skill-intensive occupations has occurred disproportionately among women rather than men. This is consistent with a large literature showing sex differences in social perceptiveness and the ability to work with others.Females consistently score higher on tests of emotional and social intelligence. Sex differences in sociability and social perceptiveness have been shown to have biological origins, with differences appearing in infancy and higher levels of fetal testosterone associated with lower scores on tests of social intelligence.In an email, Deming suggested two reasons that men may be reluctant to take jobs in the growing service sector. The first, he said, is thatif service sector and other \u201cpink collar\u201d jobs were higher-paying and more secure (perhaps unionized), they would attract more men.The second reason, in Deming\u2019s view, is thatmany service sector jobs involve \u201cserving\u201d people of higher social status. I think women are more willing to do this \u2014 for cultural or genetic reasons, who knows.more vulnerable over a longer period of time to stressors in the social environment and toxins in the physical environment that negatively impact right-brain development.This vulnerability, in turn, makes boys more susceptible toattention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorders as well as the epigenetic mechanisms that can account for the recent widespread increase of these disorders in U.S. culture.Schore argues that a major factor in rising dysfunction among boys and men in this country is the failure of the United States to provide longer periods of paid parental leave, with the result that many infants are placed in day care when they are six weeks old.Starting day care at six weeks, Schore writes, is \u201cthe exact time of the initiation of the postnatal testosterone surge found only in males.\u201d Schore notes that \u201cresearch has documented that boys more so than girls raised in single-mother families show twice the rate of behavioral problems than do boys in two-parent families\u201d and argues that a \u201cmis-attuned insecure mother\u201d can be \u201ca source of considerable relational stress, especially when the immature male toddler is expressing high levels of dysregulated aggression or fear.\u201dWhen a child is 18 to 24 months old, fathers play a crucial role, Schore writes, pointing tothe male infant\u2019s attachment transactions with the father in the second year, when he is critically involved in not only androgen-controlled rough-and-tumble play but in facilitating the male (and female) toddler\u2019s aggression regulation. This same period (18\u201324 months) involves the initiation of a critical period of growth in the left hemisphere, and so the \u201cpaternal attachment system\u201d of father-son interactions would presumably forge an androgenic imprint in the toddler\u2019s evolving left-brain circuits, including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, allowing for his regulation of the male toddler\u2019s testosterone-induced aggression (\u201cterrible twos\u201d).What does all this suggest?Second, male children suffer more from restricted or nonexistent parental leave policies and contemporary child care arrangements, as well as from growing up in single-parent households.He also called for guaranteeing six weeks\u2019 maternity leave by extending unemployment insurance benefits to working mothers whose employers do not offer paid maternity leave.\u201cFor many families in our country, child care is now the single largest expense \u2014 even more than housing,\u201d Trump said, speaking from prepared remarks. \u201cOur plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated both the date on which Donald Trump announced his child-care plans during the presidential campaign and the name of the place where he did so; it was on Sept. 13, not 14, and it was in Aston, Pa., not Ashton. The earlier version also misspelled the surname of a Notre Dame professor. He is David Leege, not David Leegee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, Facing Calls to Quit French Race, Enjoys a Day of Gains", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byA second threat, that the Republicans party would publicly disavow Mr. Fillon, was averted later in the day. Top party officials emerged from a meeting in Paris to say that they had agreed unanimously to keep on supporting him.French news outlets reported that Mr. Fillon, who took part in the meeting, put his foot down, emphasizing that divisions within the party could not spread further.Even so, Mr. Fillon\u2019s troubles are not over. With less than 50 days to go before the first round of voting on April 23, the rifts on the French right that have been exposed by the scandal surrounding Mr. Fillon are unlikely to heal before the presidential and legislative elections.Hundreds of Mr. Fillon\u2019s former backers have distanced themselves from him, and some in his party continue to doubt that he can win now. But the developments on Monday seemed to bolster Mr. Fillon\u2019s claims that there is no one suitable to replace him.\u201cNo one can stop me from being a candidate,\u201d Mr. Fillon said on Sunday in an interview on the television channel France 2.Mr. Jupp\u00e9, who is mayor of the southwestern city of Bordeaux, told reporters there on Monday that the presidential campaign had been dominated by \u201cunprecedented\u201d confusion.\u201cWhat a waste,\u201d he said, accusing Mr. Fillon of squandering the center-right party\u2019s chances of winning.He criticized Mr. Fillon on Monday for his \u201cobstinacy,\u201d and he called Mr. Fillon\u2019s dismissive response to the corruption allegations against him \u201ca dead end.\u201dMr. Fillon, who like Mr. Jupp\u00e9 is a former prime minister, won primaries on the right and center-right in November, led in the polls and appeared to be on track to reach the second round of voting, where he would have a good chance to defeat his likely opponent, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front.But Mr. Fillon\u2019s campaign was upended by reports in the satirical and investigative newspaper Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 that his wife and two of his children were paid with taxpayer money to be parliamentary aides, posts that might not have involved much genuine work.The reports prompted an investigation by financial prosecutors, and they deeply dented Mr. Fillon\u2019s standing in the polls, dropping him to third place behind Ms. Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, an independent candidate and a former economy minister.That defiance turned what, until then, had been mostly uneasy grumbling into a cascade of defections, with more than 300 backers dropping their support for Mr. Fillon and calling for the Republicans to find a new candidate. An allied party, the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents, also dropped its support for Mr. Fillon.Nicolas Sarkozy, a former president who also lost to Mr. Fillon in the primaries, said in a statement Monday morning that he wanted to organize a meeting with Mr. Fillon and Mr. Jupp\u00e9 to find a \u201cdignified and credible way out of a situation that can no longer last.\u201dSo far, Mr. Fillon has dug in his heels. At a rally organized on Sunday in Paris, he lashed out at those calling for him to drop out.\u201cThey think I\u2019m alone; they want me to be alone,\u201d a combative Mr. Fillon told the crowd as he stepped on stage at the Trocad\u00e9ro, across from the Eiffel Tower. \u201cAm I alone?\u201d he asked, and the crowd roared.\u201cIf, by magic, the French had been able to witness what I\u2019ve seen these last weeks, a wave of disgust would submerge them,\u201d Mr. Fillon said, denouncing \u201cthose who desert the sinking ship.\u201dMs. Fillon also said she had urged her husband to continue his campaign, as did the thousands of supporters who stood under pouring rain Sunday afternoon in Paris, waving French flags and chanting for Mr. Fillon to \u201chold fast\u201d because \u201cFrance needs you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the union between the people and the future president,\u201d Franck Patti, 53, a project manager for the city of Paris, said about the rally.A core faction of Republican rank-and-file voters have stood by Mr. Fillon, dismissing the allegations against him and warning that they could stay home on Election Day if he were to drop out.\u201cThe Republicans must see that Fillon is their natural candidate,\u201d Mr. Patti said.An article last Tuesday about two positive campaign developments for Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a center-right candidate for president of France who is battling allegations of corruption, misstated the location of Bordeaux, whose mayor, Alain Jupp\u00e9, decided not to challenge Mr. Fillon. Bordeaux is in southwestern France, not southeastern.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Agree on Paid Leave, but Not on Who Should Pay", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported bySurvey SaysMost people say workers should get paid leave to take care of a baby, a sick family member or themselves, according to two new surveys. But they disagree on the details: who should pay, and whether it should be mandatory or optional.In a first, presidential candidates from both parties talked supportively about paid leave, but the Trump administration\u2019s proposal, led by Ivanka Trump, faces hurdles because of deep divisions about what the policy should look like.Yet the surveys make clear that the need crosses income, gender and political lines, and affects people\u2019s career decisions and wages.Ninety-four percent of respondents said paid leave would help families, and 65 percent said it would help the economy. When asked which work arrangements would be most helpful to them, they ranked paid leave the highest, alongside flexibility of hours. Sixty-two percent told Pew they\u2019d taken paid leave or are very likely to.Large majorities support paid leave \u2014 between 67 percent and 85 percent, depending on the type of leave \u2014 according to the Pew report, which included two nationally representative online surveys of 8,000 Americans total. One survey was about people\u2019s general opinions about family leave, and the other about their personal experiences with it.A woman who works for the Ohio state government in Columbus said during a Pew focus group: \u201cPeople are making too difficult of a choice every day: Do I go to work? Or do I take care of this person who I love dearly?\u201dBut Americans are torn about the government\u2019s role. Only half of people over all and one-third of Republicans think it should mandate leave, versus continuing to let employers decide. Sixty-nine percent of Democrats supported a government mandate.Most people say employers should pay for leave instead. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government should pay for it because, I mean, we\u2019d all be paying for it anyway because it would be in our taxes,\u201d a Denver father and sales manager said in the focus group.Respondents said offering paid leave would help employers recruit and keep good workers. Still, nearly half of respondents said offering paid leave would harm businesses.\u201cYou are going to have a much more productive employee, and you\u2019ve also got an employee who has better health, their children have better health,\u201d said a mother in Denver who runs a small business. \u201cBut it is hard in the front. It\u2019s a huge expense.\u201d\u201cThe feeling that policies that encourage women to be in the work force are not in the best interest of the family is pervasive among Republicans,\u201d Ms. Mathur said. \u201cBut having access to these policies is really critical for these working families who are not in a position to even choose do I go back to work or not.\u201dDespite the fact that both parents work outside the home in most two-parent families, 44 percent of respondents said it was best if one stayed home. Thirty-nine percent said it should be the mother, and 56 percent said it didn\u2019t matter.Despite the enthusiasm for paid leave, there is disagreement about how to pay for it. The most popular idea was a tax credit to employers who offered leave; it was strongly or somewhat supported by 87 percent of respondents. Next was pretax savings accounts for employees to save for leave, supported by 84 percent.Sixty-two percent of people at least somewhat supported a government fund that employers and employees pay into \u2014 a policy used in three states. Least popular, with 60 percent support, was a government paid leave program financed through higher taxes on wealthy people or corporations.The need is most acute for low-income workers.

Today the capital of Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan\u2019s main islands, is proving itself to be fertile ground for homegrown creativity, with basements and passageways and crumbling old houses being transformed into galleries and shops and exciting new restaurants. Green urban parks, laid-back residents and an outdoorsy spirit have many comparing the city to Portland, Ore., Sapporo\u2019s sister city on the opposite side of the Pacific. To judge for yourself, speed north on the new Hokkaido Shinkansen; the bullet train began service last year, making this newly dynamic city easier to reach in every season.\nExplore street view and find things to do in Sapporo.\nA single letter in elegant script marks the entrance to Q, a stylish subterranean restaurant that opened in 2014 and that serves ramen by day and upscale yakitori at night.

{"Headline": "Trump Signs Executive Order Unwinding Obama Climate Policies", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, flanked by company executives and miners, signed a long-promised executive order on Tuesday to nullify President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change efforts and revive the coal industry, effectively ceding American leadership in the international campaign to curb the dangerous heating of the planet.Mr. Trump made clear that the United States had no intention of meeting the commitments that his predecessor had made to curb planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution, turning denials of climate change into national policy.\u201cC\u2019mon, fellas. You know what this is? You know what this says?\u201d Mr. Trump said to the miners. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to work.\u201dPresident Trump has rolled back key Obama-era greenhouse gas regulations. Without these rules in place, the United States is set to fall far short of its 2015 Paris Agreement pledge.Throughout the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s major climate change policies, a set of ambitious E.P.A. regulations to curb greenhouse pollution from coal-fired power plants. He made clear that American leadership in the global campaign against climate change would take a back seat to his commitment to energy industry jobs.With his order to move forward with the rollback, climate diplomats around the world maneuvered to fill the vacuum left by the exit of the globe\u2019s second-biggest climate polluter.Over all, the goal of the Paris deal is to keep the planet from warming more than 3.6 degrees, the point at which scientists say the earth will be irrevocably locked into a future of severe droughts, floods, rising sea levels and food shortages.Mr. Obama pledged that the United States would cut its emissions about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Carrying out the Clean Power Plan was essential to meeting that target.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Mr. Trump has not yet decided whether to formally withdraw from the Paris agreement. But by rolling back the policies needed to meet American commitments, the United States essentially announced that it would not comply, whether the nation remains a signatory or not, experts said.\u201cOne of the greatest concerns is what other key countries, including China, India and Brazil, will do when the U.S. reneges on the Paris agreement,\u201d said Robert Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard, mentioning some of the world\u2019s other largest carbon dioxide polluters.\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that the Paris agreement will unravel,\u201d Mr. Stavins said. \u201cThat would be a great tragedy.\u201dDiplomats from some of the world\u2019s other major economies say they intend to continue carrying out their climate change agreements, with or without the United States. But the Trump administration\u2019s moves are likely to embolden opponents of climate action around the world.At the heart of the Paris accord was a breakthrough 2014 agreement between Mr. Obama and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in which the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest polluting countries agreed to enact policies to cut their emissions. At the time, Mr. Obama offered the Clean Power Plan as evidence that the United States would meet its target.Their hard-won deal was seen as the catalyst to bring other countries to the table to forge the Paris pact. If Mr. Trump reneges on his predecessor\u2019s commitment, it could further fray a relationship that has become more tenuous since his election.\u201cGetting to that point was not easy,\u201d said Kelly Sims Gallagher, an expert on Chinese environmental policy at Tufts University who helped broker the Obama-Xi climate talks. \u201cThis undoes many years of work building up trust that the U.S. will honor the commitments it makes at the presidential level.\u201dMr. Trump is tentatively scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi next week at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate.Mr. Xi has signaled that he is prepared to move forward with his Paris pledge that China\u2019s emissions will drop by or before 2030. Speaking at the Davos economic summit meeting in January, Mr. Xi said, \u201cAll signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations.\u201dBut experts say that without action from the United States, China\u2019s efforts to curb emissions may slow. \u201cIt may empower business and political interests within China that still opposed climate action,\u201d said Alex L. Wang, a legal scholar of Chinese environmental policies at the University of California, Los Angeles.2016 is the hottest year on the historical record and the third consecutive record-breaking year, scientists say.The same dynamic could play out in India, the world\u2019s third-largest carbon dioxide polluter. Prime Minister Narendra Modi worked closely with Mr. Obama on climate change policies, but he did so against internal domestic pressures to prioritize economic development \u2014 including the provision of cheap coal-fired electricity to India\u2019s rural poor.Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. Modi by telephone on Tuesday, but aides declined to say if they discussed climate change.Harsh V. Pant, a research fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi, said Mr. Trump\u2019s order would give the Indian government political space to delay some of its climate commitments.\u201cIt will slow down a little bit,\u201d he said.Still, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump\u2019s orders will fully vanquish Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change legacy. Legal experts say it could take years for the E.P.A. administrator to carry out the process of withdrawing and revising the climate change regulations, and the process will be hit by legal challenges at every turn. A coalition of states, including New York and California, has already vowed to fight Mr. Trump.Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York said he was preparing to challenge any effort to do away with regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. Such a move, he argued, violated the Clean Air Act, as well as established case law.\u201cIf they want to go back into the rule-making process, we believe they are compelled under law to come up with something close to the Clean Power Plan,\u201d he said.\u201cThey probably don\u2019t want to hear this again,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if they want to repeal, they have to replace.\u201dCoral Davenport reported from Washington, and Alissa J.

{"Headline": "The Trump-SoftBank-Saudi Connection", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byDealBookAs camera lights flashed, President-elect Donald J. Trump strode across the lobby of Trump Tower with Masayoshi Son, the colorful Japanese entrepreneur, in December.The photo op was intended to be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign.This is not a secret to anyone who has been paying even a modicum of attention to the news that has dribbled out about the fund.While Mr. Son has pledged to provide a quarter of the fund himself, hardly any of the money comes from investors in the United States \u2014 with the exception of several nominal $1 billion investments, including from Apple, Qualcomm and Larry Ellison of Oracle.Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Mr. Son, and therefore Saudi Arabia, to take over some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most promising companies and intellectual property could be seen as being at odds with his nationalistic talk.\u201cWould you take money from the Saudis?\u201d Sean Hannity of Fox News asked him last year.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, without missing a beat.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Riyadh. \u201cCrooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Facebook. \u201cI am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!\u201dThose references were made in the context of politics, but should they also extend to business?This column isn\u2019t taking a position on the politics or the morality of taking money from Saudi Arabia. But it is a conversation that is worth having.Just as the United States has tried to become energy independent from the Middle East for economic and political reasons, we may be on the verge of taking the opposite tack when it comes to our innovative start-ups.While Mr. Trump wants to stimulate foreign investment in the United States, he has also talked tough about the Middle East and terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were citizens of Saudi Arabia.In true Trumpian style, he has made somewhat contradictory statements about Saudi Arabia: \u201cSaudi Arabia \u2014 and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a campaign stop. \u201cThey spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\u201dSaudi Arabia\u2019s laws are antithetical to many Americans and even to Mr. Trump\u2019s most conservative views: Women are not allowed to drive, homosexuality is punishable by stoning to death, and freedom of religion is not permitted.Which makes it all the more surprising that when Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince, came to California last year, a who\u2019s who of technology and venture capital chief executives lined up to meet with him. The tour included meetings with Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and venture capital investors like Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel.Or maybe it is not surprising if you take the view that an influx of cash from Saudi Arabia will most likely lift the valuations of all Silicon Valley companies. Cash is cash.In fairness to Mr. Trump, if he does want to bring huge investment sums to the United States, it is hard do that without involving some countries with which we have had complicated relationships. Some of the largest money is tied up in vast sovereign wealth funds.Not all of the $50 billion investment that Mr. Son pledged to make here is likely to come from SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, the one backed by Saudi Arabia. Some of it may come directly from SoftBank, which owns Sprint and is hoping to merge it with T-Mobile.All that said, can you imagine if Mr. Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower with Prince Mohammed talking about a $50 billion investment in the United States from Saudi Arabia?It\u2019s hard to see \u2014 but then again, we live in strange times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Tensions Pose Early, and Perilous, Test for Trump", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byChina condemned the new antimissile system as a dangerous opening move in what it called America\u2019s grand strategy to set up similar defenses across Asia, threatening to tilt the balance of power there against Beijing.The tensions are testing the new Trump administration and its uneasy allies South Korea and Japan, which have complained for years that China has simultaneously chastised and coddled the North, refusing to enact stiff enough measures to force it to abandon its nuclear and missile programs.But with the beginning of work to install the antimissile system, the delicate international cooperation against North Korea is splintering: Beijing is expressing more concern about American intentions in the region than about the dangers of the North\u2019s latest surge in nuclear and missile testing.The dual approach seemed evident on Wednesday when China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said, \u201cThe two sides are like two accelerating trains coming toward each other, and neither side is willing to give way.\u201d\u201cOur priority now is to flash the red light and apply brakes,\u201d Mr. Wang said at a news conference in Beijing. He said that North Korea should suspend its nuclear and missile activities and that in exchange, South Korea and the United States should suspend large-scale joint military exercises, laying the way to new negotiations with North Korea.Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he spoke with Mr. Trump for 25 minutes, adding, \u201cI appreciate that the United States is showing that all the options are on the table,\u201d usually code words for raising the possibility of a military response.To conservatives in South Korea\u2019s crisis-racked government, the antimissile system is exactly the kind of strong action needed to counter the North\u2019s belligerence and demonstrate unity with Mr. Trump, who had suggested during the campaign that Asian nations needed to do far more to defend themselves.But South Korea remains deeply divided about the one response already underway: the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, or Thaad. It is designed to intercept short- and medium-range missiles, but not the kind of intercontinental missiles that the North says it is developing to reach the United States.Many South Koreans oppose it and worry about China\u2019s moves to block South Korean imports because of Beijing\u2019s continued insistence that Thaad is aimed at containing Chinese power, not the missile capabilities of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.Japan is urging stronger American action, but remains uncertain about how much it wants to commit when a conflict with the North \u2014 deliberate or accidental \u2014 once again looks like a real possibility.The combination of military and diplomatic tensions suddenly unleashed in Asia comes before Mr. Trump\u2019s full national security team is in place, and before it has a well-thought-out strategy.The new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, has focused more on counterinsurgency than dealing with the peculiar problem of a nuclear-armed failing state.In three meetings at the White House \u2014 more than on any other foreign policy problem \u2014 the National Security Council deputies have considered a range of options, and have already come to the predictable conclusion that a dramatic show of force, like attacks on the North\u2019s missile and nuclear sites, would probably start a war.The North Koreans have made the most of this period of uncertainty and transition. Their sped-up testing seems intended to send a message that they can overwhelm antimissile defenses, deploying missiles faster than the United States and its allies can put countermeasures in place.And they hold an ace card: an ability to destroy Seoul with artillery buried in the mountains just north of the Demilitarized Zone, a remnant of the Korean War.In the North\u2019s view, the American rush to put missile defenses around it only splits the global community, pushing China and Russia closer to Pyongyang, as American officials acknowledge when speaking on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Tillerson is focused on ways to pressure China, while trying to set up a first meeting between President Xi Jinping and Mr. Trump. But the two nations\u2019 leaders are conducting a balancing act. Mr. Xi\u2019s is the hardest, trying to weigh his opposition to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program against his conviction that a North Korean collapse would be far worse.The Trump administration is measuring how hard it can press Beijing. It is mulling negotiations to \u201cfreeze\u201d the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal, but that would also acknowledge it as a fact.That is exactly the debate taking place in the White House, as Mr. Trump\u2019s aides try to figure out their alternatives, including changing the security landscape with a major military buildup or, if needed, an open conflict with North Korea.The current, slow-burning crisis arose not from one episode, but from Mr. Kim\u2019s broader strategy over the past year: to accelerate the pace of nuclear and missile tests so his arsenal becomes a fait accompli, something the United States cannot hope to reverse.When North Korea launched four Scud-ER ballistic missiles on Monday, it tried to demonstrate an ability to simultaneously launch multiple missiles at American bases in Japan and at American aircraft carriers around the Korean Peninsula, South Korean military officials said Tuesday.The ability to launch a barrage of missiles increases the chances of breaching an antimissile shield. But the types of midrange missiles North Korea has launched in recent months \u2014 including the Scud-ERs, with a 620-mile range \u2014 pose another problem for South Korea. Some of the missiles have been launched at a steep angle to achieve a higher altitude and return to earth at high speed, techniques that appear intended to complicate intercepting them.American military officials said the recent tests were a particular concern because they illustrated Pyongyang\u2019s ability to carry out a salvo of launches and on very short notice.\u201cWhat we saw this weekend was demonstration of a near-term simultaneous launch,\u201d said Vice Adm. James D. Syring, the director of the Pentagon\u2019s Missile Defense Agency. \u201cThat is something beyond what we have seen in the past.\u201dFor Washington and Seoul, the rush to field Thaad is as much about politics as missile interception. American officials have repeatedly warned China that its failure to rein in North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs would force the United States to deploy missile defenses in the region.Seoul\u2019s interim government wants to deploy the antimissile system before a progressive leader, skeptical of the deployment, can take power in a coming presidential election.But progressives have held deep reservations about the Thaad deployment, seeing it as part of the United States\u2019 effort to wrap the South into an anti-China coalition and arms race. They have already mounted a case against it.On Tuesday, Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, warned, \u201cOur business are dying; our people residing in China are being threatened.\u201dHong Ik-pyo, a senior policy maker in the opposition, said the Thaad deployment would do more harm than good for South Korea, whose economy depends on exports for growth and reaps a huge annual trade surplus with China.\u201cThey say this is only to defend us from North Korea, but everyone knows this is part of the American missile defense plan,\u201d Mr. Hong said. \u201cChina sees the Thaad deployment in South Korea the way the Americans saw the Cuban missile crisis in the 1960s.\u201dThe Chinese government said Tuesday that it continued to oppose the deployment of Thaad.Chinese leaders have struggled to grapple with the unpredictable styles of Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. Now there are fears that the North might take advantage of the political discord to move ahead with its nuclear weapons program.\u201cThey have seized this opportunity, knowing that U.S. and China are clashing,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing.Yet policy makers in Beijing failed to grasp how Washington and its allies regarded North Korea\u2019s nuclear program as getting closer to a dangerous threshold of being able to place a warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile, said Paul Haenle, the director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\u201cThat\u2019s a game-changer,\u201d he added.Javier C.

{"Headline": "Even Bold Foreign Investors Tiptoe in Iran", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 In recent weeks, Total, the French energy giant, has been sending small amounts of euros from banks in Europe to Tehran.It was the corporate equivalent of setting up a direct deposit. Total wanted to test the banking system and learn how difficult it was to make day-to-day transactions in Iran.As it considers investing in Iran, the company is moving cautiously. It has assigned a full-time compliance officer to the country to ensure it doesn\u2019t run afoul of any rules: It can\u2019t allow any Americans to work on its projects there, and has to be careful to avoid sanctioned Iranians.Like many international oil players, Total has been lured by the promise of a large and lucrative market with vast energy reserves. But the changing geopolitical landscape has made companies wary of the sanctions and restrictions tied to working there.Energy companies, in particular, have been eyeing Iran.But along with being at odds with the United States, Iran has a reputation as a difficult and opaque place to do business. Banking restrictions are still in place. Corruption is widespread. And political opposition to letting foreigners invest in Iran\u2019s natural resources is strong.American companies are still effectively barred by Washington from making investments in Iran\u2019s energy sector. And with oil prices still less than half their level in 2014, European companies like BP, which traces its origins to the discovery of oil in Iran, have also hung back.That has presented an opportunity for Total.\u201cWe are a little bolder than others,\u201d Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent interview. \u201cIt is part of our strength.\u201dAfter nuclear sanctions were lifted last year, Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 seized on the opportunity, meeting with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. By November 2016, Total reached the outlines of what \u2014 if consummated \u2014 will represent the first deal by a major Western energy company since the lifting of those sanctions, one with a $2 billion initial investment.Whether Total manages to complete the deal is important not just to the company and others interested in investing, but also to Tehran. Iran is holding an election in May, and Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government wants financial and technical help to keep ramping up oil production, a key export earner and source of influence in the OPEC oil producers\u2019 group, as well as in the Middle East generally.\u201cPart and parcel of the nuclear deal was that Iran could be rehabilitated economically,\u201d said Sanam Vakil, an Iran analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. Failing to wrap up such deals \u201cwould be bad news for Rouhani.\u201dTotal\u2019s investment would be for a slice of the world\u2019s largest natural gas field, shared between Iran and Qatar in the Persian Gulf. The company already knows the field, which Tehran calls South Pars, from its work in the country before sanctions were imposed. And Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 reckons that drilling the wells and building the production platforms necessary will not be difficult \u2014 having worked with both Iran and Qatar, he does not see anything coming up that Total is not prepared for.Still, Mr. Pouyann\u00e9, a burly former rugby player, is tiptoeing into Iran, highlighting the risks the country presents.Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 has assigned a full-time compliance officer to Iranian matters, a highly unusual step in an industry where such staff members typically cover multiple countries or issues, and one that indicates how complex and risky, but also how important, working with Iran is.Companies like Total must be careful they are not doing business with Iranian companies related to sanctioned organizations like the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the powerful Iranian military unit responsible for protecting the government at home and furthering its interests abroad. That, however, is easier said than done: The Revolutionary Guards have a range of front companies, and retains investments in Iran\u2019s ports and in other key sectors of the economy.There are even risks related to who you hire. \u201cNot a single U.S. person has the right to work on Iran, so you have to be careful of that,\u201d Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 said.The banking system is also tough to maneuver. The United States prohibits the use of the dollar banking system for transactions with Iran. While a company the size of Total can cope more easily by tapping other sources, it makes business more complex.Total is partnering with China\u2019s state-owned energy giant C.N.P.C., which may give it access to funding from Chinese banks. It is also trying to find European lenders willing to be a day-to-day banker in Iran. Wary of running into trouble with the American authorities, larger banks are for now staying away.\u201cWe have identified some, I would say, medium-sized banks who are ready to work with Iran,\u201d Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 said. To test the system, Total has put several token transactions through the banking system, hoping to identify difficulties in getting money into and out of Iran.\u201cThere are some constraints, but we can do it,\u201d he said.The risks and challenges are even more pronounced for smaller companies.Banking restrictions mean they lack access to loans and credit, and cannot use international credit and debit cards either. Staff members are instead asked to carry large amounts of cash, a risky proposition.Large discrepancies between official and unofficial exchange rates are also an issue. Converting money at an official exchange office can mean accepting a rate that is 20 percent worse than that available on the black market.Further risks lurk beneath the surface. Accountants in Iran, for example, can be co-opted or intimidated into not doing proper due diligence, fearing retribution from powerful state-backed companies.Beyond even those domestic obstacles are the looming threat of what Mr. Trump\u2019s administration means for the nuclear deal, and ties with Iran generally.In particular, Total is watching whether Mr. Trump will renew a waiver allowing international companies to work in Iran. And when it comes to the nuclear deal, companies are wary of a return to tighter sanctions in the event that Iran is deemed to not be complying.Analysts say the numerous obstacles may mean that investment in Iran will proceed more slowly than some expect, even when it involves large European companies, which are legally free to do business there and able to overcome many of the challenges.For now, those hurdles can \u201ccertainly deter key European corporates from going back in,\u201d said Helima Croft, an energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Washington.Effectively, faced with either investing in Iran or having access to American capital markets, companies \u201chave to choose.\u201dThomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.Advertisement"}

Opinion polls show that Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen are the most likely to make it to that runoff \u2014 a result that would be a stunning rebuke for France\u2019s two main political parties, the Socialists and the Republicans.Ms. Le Pen, inheritor of the anti-immigrant, populist National Front party from her father, concentrated her fire Monday night on her younger opponent.Mr. Macron, 39, has advanced more by offering a fresh face than by political savvy, and Ms. Le Pen, 48, sought to exploit his vulnerability, forcing him to define himself in opposition to her strident positions.\u201cWe\u2019ve got Islamists in our country,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cThe demands are incessant,\u201d she said, citing food and clothing.\u201cThe trap you are falling into, Madame Le Pen, with your provocations, is to divide society,\u201d he said, adding that she was making \u201cenemies out of more than four million French men and women whose religion happens to be Islam.\u201dThe other three candidates present Monday night tried to get shots in at the two front-runners.He sought during the debate to project a reassuring image of gravity, but he was forced to acknowledge that he \u201cmight have made some mistakes.\u201d Most recently, he was accused of accepting two suits worth 13,000 euros, or about $14,000, from a political fixer.That has left Mr. Fillon vulnerable to sly insinuations about his ethics. Mr. Hamon, for instance, pointedly described himself as someone who would be \u201can honest and fair president,\u201d free from the influence of \u201cmoney and lobbies.\u201dMr. Hamon, the Socialist candidate, has promised a guaranteed \u201cuniversal income\u201d and has spoken of cutting the already reduced French workweek, but his chances are thought to be lowered by the presence of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, whose positions are largely similar.Ms. Le Pen, who also faces accusations related to fictional jobs, accused Mr. M\u00e9lenchon of being a \u201cRobespierre\u201d when he called on voters to \u201creward the virtuous and punish those who don\u2019t seem so.\u201dMr. Macron, for his part, projected an image of innocence and virtue, and Ms. Le Pen aimed directly for it, with the most savage blast of the evening aimed at his reputation for speaking at length but saying little.After a windy declaration by Mr. Macron on protecting France\u2019s \u201cindependence,\u201d Ms. Le Pen, whose campaign is centered on a withdrawal from the European Union, mockingly repeated the word before firing back.\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken for seven minutes, and I have no idea what you said,\u201d she said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything. Every time you talk, you take a little of this, and a little of that, and you never settle on anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And there are economists sprinkled throughout the government \u2014 there is an entire council of them advising the president in most administrations, if not yet in this one.But as much as we love economics here \u2014 this column is named Economic View, after all \u2014 there just may be a downside to this one academic discipline having such primacy in shaping public policy.They say when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. And the risk is that when every policy adviser is an economist, every problem looks like inadequate per-capita gross domestic product.Another academic discipline may not have the ear of presidents but may actually do a better job of explaining what has gone wrong in large swaths of the United States and other advanced nations in recent years.\u201cOnce economists have the ears of people in Washington, they convince them that the only questions worth asking are the questions that economists are equipped to answer,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Lamont, a Harvard sociologist and president of the American Sociological Association. \u201cThat\u2019s not to take anything away from what they do. It\u2019s just that many of the answers they give are very partial.\u201dFor starters, while economists tend to view a job as a straightforward exchange of labor for money, a wide body of sociological research shows how tied up work is with a sense of purpose and identity.\u201cWages are very important because of course they help people live and provide for their families,\u201d said Herbert Gans, an emeritus professor of sociology at Columbia. \u201cBut what social values can do is say that unemployment isn\u2019t just losing wages, it\u2019s losing dignity and self-respect and a feeling of usefulness and all the things that make human beings happy and able to function.\u201dIt seems plausible that this helps explain why so many Americans who lost jobs in the 2008 recession have never returned to the labor force despite an improved job market. Mr. Sharone is working with career counselors to explore how to put this finding to work to help the long-term unemployed.It works against the tendency to think about housing policy as solely a matter of which subsidy goes to whom and what incentives ought to be in place to encourage banks to lend in poor neighborhoods. All that stuff is important, of course, but doesn\u2019t really address the overwhelming challenge of insecurity that affects millions of people.If the White House Council of Social Advisers did exist, one of its great challenges would be to convert some of these findings into actual policy proposals that might help. Part of the ascendance of economics in the policy-making sphere comes from the fact that economists tend to spend more time looking at specific legislative or regulatory steps that could try to improve conditions.And trying to solve social problems is a more complex undertaking than working to improve economic outcomes. It\u2019s relatively clear how a change in tax policy or an adjustment to interest rates can make the economy grow faster or slower. It\u2019s less obvious what, if anything, government can do to change forces that are driven by the human psyche.But there is a risk that there is something of a vicious cycle at work. \u201cWhen no one asks us for advice, there\u2019s no incentive to become a policy field,\u201d Professor Gans said.It may be true that these lessons on identity and community don\u2019t lend themselves immediately to policy white papers and five-point plans. But a deeper understanding of them sure could help policy makers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Odd Man in: The Sculptor Robert Morris, at 86, Is Still Blazing Trails", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byThe time was ripe for change, and Mr. Morris and his colleagues Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd and Sol LeWitt obliged. Intriguingly, none of these Minimalists studied sculpture in art school. They never learned how to model in clay, carve marble or weld metal.Mr. Morris set out to be a painter. While building props for his wife\u2019s performances, he created a solo for himself with the Living Theater, featuring \u201cColumn,\u201d his first important object. It was a tall rectangular box with a hollow core; and he stood inside of it for several minutes before toppling over. He almost got a concussion. But he had found his m\u00e9tier. He became a sculptor. Though he has been a trailblazer, he has always been the odd man out. Minimalism was just one of many stops on his six-decade journey through the art world.He also published polemical essays about the nature of sculpture in Artforum. To earn a master\u2019s degree in art history, he wrote a thesis on the work of Constantin Brancusi, the modern Romanian virtuoso. And, for many years, he was a popular art professor at Hunter College.More than anything else, however, Robert Morris liked to make things. He has worked with lead, aluminum mesh, mirrors, dirt, felt, steam and steel. In November, Mr. Morris recalled that when Donald Judd wrote in a review, \u201c\u2018The trouble with Morris\u2019s work is that there is not enough to see,\u2019 I knew I was on the right track.\u201dNow, decades later, Mr. Morris has been revisiting earlier work. His latest felt pieces, on view at the Castelli Gallery\u2019s uptown space, 18 East 77th Street, include provocative words like \u201cparanoid,\u201d \u201cblackops\u201d and \u201cassassin\u201d cut into the thick, heavy material. And an installation providing seating has old-fashioned radios broadcasting a dialogue he wrote that echoes \u201cHearing\u201d (1972), his scathing philosophical inquiry related to the Vietnam War.With the multifigure groups on view at Castelli\u2019s new quarters at 24 West 40th Street, Mr. Morris\u2019s status as a renegade is more pronounced. Though most lack bodies and heads, much less faces, the meticulous way he modeled and cast cloaks, robes and mortuary shrouds while leaving many hollow cores visible suggests they\u2019re more like statues than present-day structures. And Mr. Morris has conveyed emotional states in a way that emulates what he admires in the art of Francisco Goya: \u201cDeft economy in depicting gesture and expression.\u201dHis days as a Minimalist, however, are not quite in the distant past. Like the works at Dia:Beacon, these sculptures stand directly on the floor, rest against the wall, lie on the ground, hang from the ceiling.But emotion, not formal language, sets the latest work apart from what Mr. Morris executed earlier in his career. In November, in remarks he delivered at a Dia benefit dinner, Mr. Morris suggested why. \u201cWe have only to experience late Donatello or C\u00e9zanne or Titian or Goya to see that it is in old age that the most extraordinary art is made by those few survivors who realize how terrifying existence is,\u201d he said, \u201cand at the end of life live totally in their art to escape this crushing world.\u201dThese are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Morris, conducted in person and by email.Why plywood sculptures?In November 1964, Richard Bellamy offered me the Green space for December. I said yes, not knowing what I would do. But of course I had been thinking about and making a few large plywood works since \u201cColumn\u201d of 1962. They were simple to construct. Deciding which works would go in the space was more critical, and I probably stewed over that awhile. I made all the objects in a month, dismantled them, trucked them to 57th Street, and nailed them back together.Plywood was cheap, plentiful, standard and ubiquitous. It was unstressed as an art material, an \u201cordinary\u201d material in the industrial world. The tools required to work plywood were common and readily at hand; the skill required to manipulate them was relatively undemanding; carpentry was another \u201cordinary\u201d everyday skill in the urban late industrial milieu.Acknowledging the wall made the works more a part of the room, anchoring them to the walls as much as the floor.I doubt whether most of the plywood works of the early \u201960s were abstract. \u201cColumns,\u201d \u201cSlabs,\u201d \u201cPortals\u201d \u2014 these \u201cgeometric\u201d objects referenced parts of buildings.Wasn\u2019t it daring to place a sculpture in the corner of a room back then?I assumed viewers, anyway some, might walk up to \u201cUntitled (Corner Piece)\u201d and see it had sides. The object sat away from the two walls as well as floated above the floor a few inches.I suppose the question \u201cWhy?\u201d might be asked. But I would rather short-circuit the question and hide behind Chekhov\u2019s remark that art should ask questions rather than give answers.The plywood works got nicknames like \u201cCloud,\u201d etc., and were officially \u201cUntitled.\u201d Nevertheless, I always knew they were tainted with the \u201crepresentational.\u201d And not just tainted, but intended to be impure. I was an abstract artist as a painter in the \u201950s. I\u2019ve never been an abstract sculptor.Wasn\u2019t it a stretch to execute a sculpture from dirt?I have always worked in more than one direction at a time. As the scorpion said after stinging the frog ferrying it across the river, \u201cIt is my nature, what can I do?\u201dDirt is dirt, grease is grease, and bits of wire and metal are just that. I don\u2019t see the work as \u201cabstract,\u201d but concrete. I don\u2019t know if you are asking, \u201cWhat does it represent?\u201dOf course \u201cDirt\u201d is more than dirt. It speaks to the ongoing dialogue that we call sculpture, what we take sculpture to be, what we think it can be. Duchamp established the nominalism of art and changed the question from \u201cwhat is art?\u201d to \u201cis it interesting?\u201dAre your latest \u201cFelt Works\u201d related to earlier pieces? I can imagine you saying, \u201cIf anything is abstract, those \u2018Felt Works\u2019 are.\u201d And all I can reply is: \u201cI think of the \u2018Felt Works\u2019 as the Mother. Soft, large, enfolding, and yes, unpredictable, too.\u201d Well, that is a lame answer, but it is the best I can do.She didn\u2019t like me swearing or throwing rocks, but mothers have to make some exceptions for unruly children.In recent years, have you been more inspired by old masters rather than contemporaries?Now that you\u2019re in what\u2019s considered the late-style phase of your career, do you truly see art and, even more, the human condition differently?What constitutes a late style? Is it more than what an artist does in old age? Edward Said thought he saw some old artists letting go and daring to do what they would not have when younger. Who can say? But I don\u2019t think I see art differently now than I did years ago. As for insights into the human condition, I think I am the same pessimist I always was.Are there things that can be expressed only with figurative sculpture?Have my \u201cColumns\u201d evolved into figures? When I fell over in the first \u201cColumn\u201d in 1962, was I desperate to get out? Or is it only now in old age when the creaking of the body can\u2019t be ignored that it insists on full recognition? Now that I can\u2019t do a back flip, do I need to make a figure leaping to remember? Are all these dark figures out of the past? Or are they coming to remind me of what is on the way?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Talks Tough on U.S.-China Trade but Delays Real Action", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisSHANGHAI \u2014 President Trump appeared to follow through on Friday on his promises to get tough on trade with China, less than a week before he is to meet with President Xi Jinping of China.In two executive orders, Mr. Trump called for tighter enforcement of tariffs imposed in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy trade cases, as well as a comprehensive review of the United States trade deficits \u2014 measures that reflect America\u2019s economic tensions with China. A pair of earlier presidential Twitter posts played to the tough talk: Mr. Trump said next week\u2019s meeting with China \u201cwill be a very difficult one,\u201d given the \u201cmassive trade deficits\u201d and \u201cjob losses.\u201dBut beneath the surface, the moves betrayed a trade policy in disarray, with the administration troubled by staffing deficiencies and a lack of consensus over strategic direction. With more talk than action, the orders so far seem more like a delaying tactic that gives administration officials the time to come up with a unified trade policy, which has eluded them so far.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump criticized China for unfair trade practices, accusing it of draining millions of jobs from the United States through a huge imbalance. In Mr. Trump\u2019s view, that deficit was fed by Chinese currency manipulation, government subsidies to exporters and other directives aimed at giving China\u2019s homegrown players an edge.The executive orders, though, do not really address those problems.The 90-day review of the trade deficit, described as a comprehensive examination of the products and countries responsible for the gap, looks more like an economics classroom exercise than a foundation for policy. While portrayed as a new approach, it is the latest in a very long lineup of federal reports on trade.Every year, the Office of the United States Trade Representative produces a voluminous report on foreign failures to protect intellectual property and another massive report on foreign trade barriers. The United States International Trade Commission, a separate federal agency, is constantly being asked by administrations and by Congress to produce lengthy reports on specific issues. And the Commerce Department produces a very detailed monthly report on trade statistics that includes data by country and by industry.As for improving enforcement, that is a somewhat technical issue. In the order, Mr. Trump wants to ensure that the steep tariffs imposed in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases are collected.Over the years entrepreneurs have been suspected of setting up new companies in the United States to import goods, often from China, in the monthslong period after the government imposes such tariffs but before their exact amount is calculated. The companies bring the goods into the United States and sell them, and then the companies disappear or file for bankruptcy before the final duties can be collected.\u201cThere are many unscrupulous tricks of the trade being used \u2014 especially by China \u2014 to evade hard-won duties and thus continue cheating through the use of dumping and subsidies,\u201d said Thomas M. Sneeringer, a former steel industry lawyer who is now the president of the Committee to Support U.S. Trade Laws, a manufacturing trade group. \u201cThese include falsifying the country of origin, transshipping, misclassifying products and outright criminal fraud.\u201dThe Trump administration faces the problem that China\u2019s high trade barriers are allowed by the World Trade Organization, because China entered the group as a developing country and insists it still is one.But these cases aren\u2019t an economic game changer. As little as 1 percent of American imports are covered by steep tariffs, and the actual effect of illegal violations of these tariffs is far narrower still.\u201cThey\u2019re politically sensitive, but in terms of the overall trade balance, they\u2019re going to have a limited effect,\u201d said Alan Wolff, a former American trade official who is now a senior counsel at the law firm Dentons.What really could make a difference for the trade deficit would be if the United States imposed a so-called border-adjusted tax. Such a move would essentially impose a tax on goods from other countries.It would strike at the heart of the trade deficit. Each year, the United States buys $4 worth of Chinese goods for each $1 worth of American goods that China buys.The border-adjusted tax has strong similarities to the way China and the European Union assess taxes.The combined value of import tariffs and average state sales taxes in the United States is just 9 percent. Import taxes plus value added taxes \u2014 a kind of sales tax \u2014 total 27 percent in China and roughly 25 percent in Western Europe.Above all, the Trump administration still has not made the most fundamental strategic decision. Will the main priority on trade be a border-adjusted tax as part of tax reform in Congress? Or will the main priority be a long series of narrow, industry-specific trade disputes?Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Trade Council, and Wilbur Ross, the choice for commerce secretary, appear to favor a more aggressive approach like the border tax. Others, like Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, could have a moderating influence.Chinese officials have been watching the issue with rapt attention.Zhong Shan, China\u2019s new minister of commerce, was asked at a news conference during the National People\u2019s Congress annual session in early March which of two difficult outcomes he might prefer. A border-adjusted tax would impose a heavy financial burden on Chinese exports and the Chinese economy, but it might result in limited diplomatic friction. The tax would amount to a single action by the United States and would apply equally to trade with all foreign countries \u2014 not just China.A flurry of sector-specific trade restrictions by the United States might not add up to a lot of money, because bilateral trade is divided into thousands of categories. But it could produce a long series of diplomatic confrontations.Mr. Zhong, in the usual fashion of trade ministers, did not address the question directly, endorsing a continuation of existing trade relationships. \u201cNo protectionism,\u201d he said, \u201cserves the interests of the two countries.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Not-So-Standard Equipment on the Otherwise Standard Corolla", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byDrivenI first experienced radar-assisted cruise control in a $70,000 Mercedes in 2001. Slowing automatically to keep from hitting the car ahead felt like a magic trick. In 2009, I was told to drive a new $50,000 Volvo into the back of a \u201cparked car\u201d (really, an inflatable mock-up). Every fiber of my body wanted to stomp on the brake pedal. Instead, the car did it for me. Automatic braking is mind-bending the first time.Both of these technologies are standard equipment on 2017 Toyota Corollas, which start at $19,385. So is lane-keeping assist, which nudges the car back between the road stripes if you wander. Automatic high-beam headlamps, too.Huzzah for technology trickle down!A number of mainstream automotive brands now offer valuable safety technology once exclusive to premium makes. Often, they are option packages or part of higher trim levels. Toyota is putting Toyota Safety Sense, or T.S.S., on many of its passenger cars as standard equipment.This, as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing. Just make sure you understand which T.S.S. you are getting.The tested Corolla sedan gets T.S.S.-P., which provides automatic braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and automatic high beams. Buyers wanting the more practical Corolla iM hatchback get T.S.S.-C., which lacks radar cruise control and the pedestrian detection part of the auto-braking system.There is more legalese in Toyota\u2019s T.S.S. literature than \u201cO\u201ds in a box of Froot Loops, but here is what to expect: Auto braking (called a precollision system by Toyota) operates at 7 to 110 miles per hour. When detecting cars, it can reduce the speed by up to 25 m.p.h. Pedestrian detection works from 7 to 50 m.p.h. reducing speed by up to 19 m.p.h.In general, the adaptive cruise control works from 25 to 110 m.p.h. The biggest surprise in these numbers is that a Corolla can actually go that fast.This technology is not the grade found in premium brands. For now, Corolla\u2019s adaptive cruise control doesn\u2019t keep pace in stop-and-go traffic, but it should reduce dented fenders, bumpers and skulls.That is a good start and will probably help to sell this car, which rides on an architecture that is about 10 years old.But other than the high tech, the Corolla as an automobile is basic transportation. It runs with a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that delivers 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. The Eco model has 8 additional horsepower.The transmission is continuously variable with steering wheel paddle shifters that provide surprisingly crisp simulated gearshifts. There is also a sport mode, but don\u2019t fall for that promise.The safety technology may calm the spirit, but Corolla\u2019s driving dynamics will not stir the soul. It accelerates and stops just fine for a budget car. Drivers may often be making small course corrections when cruising. There is little road feel and the tires and suspension don\u2019t handle bumps in a calming way. The continuously variable transmission has the elastic feeling common to continuously variable transmissions. For engaging handling or refinement in this size, go with the Honda Civic, Chevy Cruze, Hyundai Elantra or Mazda 3.On average, the Environmental Protection Agency rates Corolla\u2019s fuel economy average at 32 miles per gallon. That is about what I saw.The cabin looks fine for a modestly priced car. There is a lot of hard plastic to rub elbows with and the hide on the seats is clearly synthetic but it\u2019s probably durable for the long haul. That is the point of a Corolla. At $23,545 as tested, the XSE model has automatic climate control and heated seats. A backup camera is standard equipment (that is something the luxury brands could learn from), and the controls are straightforward down to the basic touch-screen interface. No Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, if that is a deal breaker.There is room for two full-size adults in back, three if they are skinny. The trunk has the space of some midsize sedans. A folding split back seat lets long boxes of Ikea furniture ride along.In the looks department, Corolla has a pleasant enough profile, with a crisp shoulder line near the rear pillar. The scowl of the redesigned front end resembles Darth Vader\u2019s mask. You half expect to hear the sound of a respirator.Automobile enthusiasts often sneer at the appliance that is Corolla. But some people simply need the luxury of a car, not a prestige automobile. There are many single parents who require affordable wheels with a three-year warranty. That is the kind of security used cars don\u2019t offer. Plus, there is peace of mind in the electronic nannies.The auto braking and lane keeping features aren\u2019t a license to text and drive. It is important for drivers to remain engaged since it takes only a few seconds of distraction for things to go seriously wrong. It would be helpful to outfit all vehicles with safety tech like T.S.S.-P. for unexpected moments. Toyota has made lifesaving features affordable. Now, how about adding some life to Corolla\u2019s personality?Advertisement"}

The Fed Isn\u2019t So Sure.", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byFor the Federal Reserve, it was the final confirmation that the time had come to raise interest rates to prevent the United States economy from overheating.Mr. Trump and Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, appear to be headed toward a collision, albeit in slow motion. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that he is determined to stimulate faster growth while the central bank, for its part, is indicating that it will seek to restrain any acceleration in economic activity.The move itself is minor. The rate is expected to remain below 1 percent, and interest rates on consumer and business loans will still be remarkably low by historical standards. But the Fed is moving months earlier than markets had expected at the beginning of the year, precisely because the economy appears to be gaining steam.Both Fed officials and independent economists are quick to emphasize that the central bank is not trying to pre-empt the new administration\u2019s policies. The Fed is raising rates because economic conditions are improving. Winter did not chill the United States economy this year. The stock market keeps fizzing upward; employment and wages are growing; companies and consumers are optimistic.\u201cThe thought that by tweaking the funds rate you could send some kind of political message is crazy, and they know that, and they\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen. \u201cOn the other hand, this is the first first quarter in about six years that isn\u2019t looking scary, so it\u2019s not surprising they would be considering a rate increase.\u201dGrowth above the sustainable pace can lead to higher inflation. That, in turn, can force the Fed to raise rates more quickly, a course that often ends in a recession.She said the Fed was fine with faster growth so long as it reflected an improvement in economic fundamentals. On the other hand, she said, the Fed would try to offset faster growth \u201cif we think that it is demand-based and threatens our inflation objective\u201d \u2014 a technical description of what would happen if Congress cut taxes or increased spending.The White House and the Fed have very different economic outlooks.\u201cWe\u2019re very excited about what\u2019s ahead of us,\u201d he said.Fed officials, by contrast, see the pace of job growth as unsustainable. The unemployment rate fell below 5 percent last May. Since then, employment has continued to expand at an average of 215,000 jobs a month \u2014 more than twice the job growth necessary to keep pace with population growth. The faster growth is good news for the economy, indicating that adults who gave up on finding jobs are returning to work. The question is how long that can continue.The Fed\u2019s slow march toward higher interest rates is gradually raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage loan was 4.21 percent last week, up about half a percentage point from the same time last year, according to Freddie Mac. Rates on credit cards and car loans have also ticked higher, although borrowing costs remain well below historical norms.As for interest on saving accounts, banks tend to raise those rates more slowly than they raise rates on loans. But as the Fed pushes up rates, savings rates will eventually increase, too.Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have been careful to acknowledge the persistence of a range of economic problems. Labor force participation is low. Productivity growth remains weak. Middle-income families have seen little income growth.She noted that the White House and Congress could adopt fiscal policies that would improve those fundamental factors, although doing so would take time.But in this case there is no reason for the Fed to rush. The Fed has indicated what it will do. Now, it can afford to wait and see what fiscal policy makers do.President Trump has promised \u201cmassive tax relief for the middle class,\u201d and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said last month that he wanted to see a bill passed before Congress goes on summer vacation in August. That is an ambitious timetable, not least because health care legislation is first in line. But even if the deadline is met, more months will pass before the money accumulates in the pockets of businesses and consumers, and before the money is spent.\u201cThe thing that makes it relatively easy for the Fed is that fiscal policy usually takes a long time,\u201d said James A. Wilcox, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cFinancial markets don\u2019t wait for all of that to happen, of course, but the actual spending and employment effects \u2014 they usually take a while to show up.\u201dMr. Trump has also not seized quickly on the opportunity to appoint his own people to the central bank. Two seats on the Fed\u2019s seven-person board have been vacant for almost three years because Senate Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees. But Mr. Trump has not put forward his own.Mark Calabria, the chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, said last week that the White House planned to fill vacancies at the Fed and other regulatory agencies \u201cin short order.\u201d But he added that the administration was still considering its options.Mr. Trump also has the opportunity to replace Ms. Yellen as chairwoman when her four-year term ends in February, although she could remain on the board.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Political Stew", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byReader, guess when this paragraph was written:Liberalism has turned away from the common people and become institutionalized into an establishment. Its spokesmen are driven around in limousines and supported by rich foundations, the television networks and publishing houses, the knowledge industry, the billion\u2010dollar universities and the urban consulting firms which profiteer from poverty. Liberalism is dominant only in the Northeast, which is always the last bastion of a dying order of privilege. The Northeast resists the populist surge of our day just as it fought the revolution of Jefferson, Jackson, Bryan and Roosevelt.In fact, the problems that plagued the Democratic Party 50 years ago continue to do so.The 2016 election and its aftermath have produced turmoil on the right while once again forcing into public view worrisome long-term trends in the Democratic electorate.Based on his examination of exit poll data, al-Gharbi points out thatContrary to the emerging Democratic majority thesis, there does not seem to be any demographic category with which Democrats are progressively improving.His conclusion:Progressives don\u2019t have any kind of \u201clock\u201d on the future. In the near term, absent radical change, the situation may even grow worse for them.One of the mainstays of Democratic optimism is the conviction that a growing body of young voters \u2014 more liberal than their elders \u2014 will soon dominate elections, just as the baby boomers did before them. In point of fact, however, millennials are slowly, incrementally becoming a less reliable Democratic constituency.While Trump faces grim numbers among Millennials overall, he has displayed strength among them with the same groups that responded to him most in older generations: evangelical, non-urban, and blue-collar whites.Clinton did less well than Obama in 2012 among millennial voters, winning them by 19 points compared to Obama\u2019s 23-point margin.But just as importantly, Brownstein shows that Clinton\u2019s best margins among millennials were concentrated in reliably blue states like California, New York and New Jersey, where victory was assured. Her weakness was most evident in key battleground states where she was critically injured by defections among these same young voters.In the Rust belt, Clinton\u2019s margin among 18- to 29-year-old voters fell far behind Obama\u2019s, as the accompanying chart shows, with devastating effect.In the Rust belt, millennials are disproportionately white non-college voters and their defections from the Democratic Party parallel those of their elders. In political terms, class, education and culture outweigh every other determinant, including age.Developments on the Republican side of the aisle are more straightforward.Pat Buchanan, a two-time candidate for the presidency (in 1992 and 1996), has been an outspoken critic of the Republican elite for a long time. He voices unadulterated pleasure over the recent ideological upheaval within the Republican Party.In leading Republicans away from globalism to economic nationalism, Trump is not writing a new gospel. He is leading a lost party away from a modernist heresy \u2014 back to the Old-Time Religion.Asked if they agreed with the statement \u201cThe free market has been sorting the economy out and America is losing,\u201d Republicans agreed by better than two to one, 57-23, while Democrats were split, 33-33.The abrupt and often radical changes within the two parties are not just a problem for Democrats and Republicans. They are also a problem for social scientists who are struggling to make sense of the changed electorate.David Brady, a political scientist at Stanford, put the dilemma in blunt terms. In an email he wrote:Why did Kankakee, Illinois and Green Bay vote Obama and then Trump? They didn\u2019t become racist and misogynistic over the last 8 years. It has to do with the effects of slow growth economies over time on people\u2019s psyches. They begin to give up hope and are tired of Republicans and Democrats promising all things \u2014 Reagan \u201clower taxes more money\u2019 to Obama\u2019s \u2018change, change\u201d \u2014 and their lives don\u2019t get better and their kids\u2019 lives get worse. We as a profession had better start thinking more creatively about how to get at these issues instead of the old \u201cleft is good, right is bad. \u201dI asked Brady to elaborate on his thinking:Political science sees things as Democrats good, Republicans bad. The folks who went from Obama to Trump over 2008-2016 aren\u2019t authoritarians, racists and evil. They have some legitimate complaints that haven\u2019t been addressed by the Democratic Party as it stands today. As long as political science thinks of this election as all about race and misogyny and nothing else, we will miss the boat.Three of Brady\u2019s fellow political analysts \u2014 Edward G. Carmines and Michael J. Ensley, political scientists at Indiana and Kent State universities, along with Michael W. Wagner, a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison \u2014 are taking up this challenge.Trump\u2019s support among Republican primary voters, and probably in the broader electorate, only makes sense once we recognize that the political choices offered by a conservative Republican Party and a liberal Democratic Party do not reflect the full extent of the ideological heterogeneity found in the American public.The three argue that bystrategic design or dumb luck, the Trump candidacy was able to activate a segment of the electorate that has historically not been part of the GOP electoral coalition.These voters, white populists, are citizens with \u201cheterodox policy preferences,\u201d those \u201cwho have liberal positions on economic issues and conservative preferences on social issues.\u201d They cut across the traditional left-right divide.These voters stand out in two important ways. First, they hold what the authors call stronger \u201cnationalist\u201d views, which helps explain their attraction to Trump. These views include the belief that immigration takes jobs, opposition to outsourcing, support for torture and the belief that \u201cblacks have too much influence.\u201dThe three conclude that the ability of the Republicans to mobilize and keep a grip on these voters is a crucial question looking toward future elections:Trump\u2019s message may have appealed to populists in a way that could have fundamentally altered the electorate in states where white populists reside \u2013 states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. We look forward to finding out.There are those who see the developments in the American electorate in more evolutionary, less abrupt, terms.Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California-San Diego, for example, wrote in an email:As for Trump reshaping the Republican electorate, it\u2019s more a matter of continuing trends that go back to the 1960s (remember Nixon\u2019s \u201chard hats,\u201d the white working class \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d?). As Democrats have become the party of younger, secular, urban, minority, highly educated voters, Republicans have become the party of lower educated whites, religious, conservatives, xenophobes, etc.Trump reshaped the Republican electorate in 2016, but his performance will determine whether this was a one-shot reshuffling or something more lasting.\u201cThose ex-Obama supporters?\u201d Sabato asked:If Trump produces, they\u2019ll reward him with a second term. If he doesn\u2019t \u2014 and he needs to create lots of high-paying jobs in the face of automation and a global economy moving in other directions \u2014 then they\u2019ll be ripe for a return to their former home, the Democratic Party \u2014 if Democrats give them an appealing nominee.Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory, emphasized to me thatwhite working-class voters have been trending Republican for a long time and white voters with college degrees or post-college education have been trending Democratic as well.These developments, according to Abramowitz, reflectan ideological divide over cultural issues and racial issues that has been there for many years. What Trump has done, I think, is put more weight on the racial issues than we have seen before.Abramowitz emphasizes a key point:Republican voters are much more conservative on racial issues than in the past while Democratic voters are more liberal on those issues than in the past.The big shift Trump wrought was to change the type of whites who voted Republican.Beginning in 1968, when Southern whites and some working class whites in the North began to abandon the Democratic Party, Republican candidates made major inroads among non-college voters. Nixon won voters with high school degrees with 52 and 67 percent in 1968 and 1972; Ronald Reagan won them with 55 and 58 percent in 1980 and 1984.Starting in the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, non-college whites became substantially more Republican in their presidential voting than whites with degrees. By 2012, Mitt Romney won whites with degrees by 14 points and those without degrees by 25 points.In 2016, however, Trump won college-educated whites by four points and non-college whites by a record-setting 39 points, a larger margin than Ronald Reagan, the previous record-holder at 29 points.Put another way, insofar as Trump voters define the contemporary Republican electorate, non-college whites are the majority, 55.1 percent, with college -educated whites becoming the minority at 44.9 percent.The Republican Party, then, has moved closer toward the goal Kevin Phillips outlined 47 years ago:I wish we could drop into the Potomac all those obsolescent conservatives who are still preoccupied with Alger Hiss and General MacArthur, and who keep trotting out laissez faire economics and other dead horses. They make the Republican party look musty to millions of ignored working\u2010class people who are looking for a party that relates to their needs.This is an exceptionally volatile mix. Trump is fanning rather than quelling the flames \u2014 everything he has done so far has been to raise, not lower, the heat. The next question is whether the Republican Party will be able to continue to exploit this mix or whether it will boil over in ways that cannot be predicted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Wild Nights\u2019 Offers a History of Sleep (and Sleeplessness)", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesThe night before I stopped sleeping, I slept. This is something I try to explain to any well-meaning person who asks about my mysterious, pigheaded, yearslong case of insomnia. It came on abruptly. It was precipitated by no crisis I could discern. It was not the culmination of many years of poor or varied sleep. One day, I simply closed my eyes and nothing happened. It was as if I\u2019d been poisoned.Whenever a self-help book about sleep crosses my desk, I toss it. I already know what it says. Not getting enough: Bad. Pills: Avoid. Sunlight: Essential. But when I saw Benjamin Reiss\u2019s \u201cWild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World,\u201d I lunged for it, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if my fellow travelers in exhaustion had the same response. Certainly, strangers reacted favorably to Reiss while the book was still in progress. As he writes in his epilogue: \u201cSomething about becoming the Sleep Guy seems to have made me a magnet for interesting divulgences and unusual conversations.\u201dMost people, even those who sleep well, have at least one story about a brutal cage match with Morpheus.What makes \u201cWild Nights\u201d so liberating is that it is descriptive, not prescriptive. It does not hector. It barely engages with the science of slumber at all. It aims, rather, to describe the social history and evolving culture of sleep \u2014 through literature (Reiss is an English professor at Emory University), through ethnographies, through old diaries and memoirs and medical texts.I wish the quality of this book didn\u2019t jiggle like a sine curve. Only every other chapter, or thereabouts, pops with insight. The others stray too far from the subject or hew too closely to the familiar. I already know that the 24/7 demands of the information economy conspire against sleep. I certainly do not need Reiss\u2019s analysis of Kanye West\u2019s video \u201cFamous,\u201d which includes this spoonful of jargon-flavored goo: \u201cThis particular bit of public, collective sleeping practically sacralizes fame.\u201dYet solitary sleeping generated problems of its own. Moralists panicked over masturbation. (During the 19th century, a small market of appliances discouraging it, like erection alarms and penis cases, bloomed.) Neurotic worries over children\u2019s sleep grew. Dr. Benjamin Spock, the cuddly child-rearing eminence of the mid-20th century, recommended securing kids in bed with a loop of badminton net.Industrialization did not just privatize sleep. It also consolidated it and then shoehorned it into rhythms better suited to commerce and railway travel than the rhythms of the seasons \u2014 or our bodies\u2019 own needs. We know that before the machine age, people slept in a variety of ways, including (famously) \u201csegmented sleep,\u201d or sleep in two shifts. But with industrialization, we became servants of clock time, \u201ca time newly homogeneous across season, region or profession.\u201dThe most harrowing parts of \u201cWild Nights,\u201d however, are not about the great loss of sleep diversity. They\u2019re about sleep inequality, for want of a better term. Sleep is supposedly a great equalizer \u2014 \u201cth\u2019indifferent judge between the high and low,\u201d as the Elizabethan poet Philip Sidney once wrote \u2014 but Reiss makes it achingly clear that sleep is anything but democratically distributed. Or interpreted.Nowhere was this more evident than in the institution of slavery. Frederick Douglass wrote that \u201cmore slaves are whipped for oversleeping than any other fault.\u201d Slaves slept in squalor and were never permitted sufficient rest; yet somehow, Thomas Jefferson took a slave\u2019s tendency to fall instantly asleep as evidence not of bone-weariness, but intellectual inferiority \u2014 the slave lacked introspection.This, more than 150 years before Twitter.Yet sometimes Reiss overindulges his penchant for literary analysis, simply using sleep as an excuse to riff on authors he loves. Embedded throughout \u201cWild Nights\u201d is also a nostalgia, no doubt influenced by Thoreau (whom he calls the book\u2019s \u201cguiding spirit\u201d), for a time when our bodies were synchronized with the seasons, unchained from the adamantine demands of the clock.But the days of candles and oil lamps didn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a good night\u2019s rest. As the author acknowledges, insomnia is an ancient problem, for which there have been a staggering variety of proposed cures over the centuries \u2014 including the strategic application of one sheep lung to each side of the head.And on occasion, Reiss\u2019s perspective becomes so narrow it brings to mind that old aphorism \u201cTo a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d To a writer about sleep, everything looks like an uncomfortable bed. At one point Reiss declares that \u201cit\u2019s not too much to speculate\u201d whether the solitary confinement of children to their own rooms was \u201cone of the hidden sources of the rebellious youth movements that marked the late 20th century.\u201dActually, it is too much to speculate.What does remain certain is that humans will continue to try to subdue sleep. If putting children to bed by themselves was once unfathomable to us, what might the next unthinkable development be? Reiss writes about a NASA-financed project that explored inducing astronauts into a \u201cprolonged torpor\u201d for a mission to Mars. It didn\u2019t make much headway. But researchers are still working on the possibilities of human hibernation, and maybe even losing sleep over it.Advertisement"}

The company held court over the realm of the desktop personal computer. Intel made powerful chips that were the workhorses of PCs for decades, and for decades the trend was that people wanted bigger, better and faster desktops to power more and more programs that were growing more sophisticated. That includes stunning games with complicated graphics, the rise of Photoshop, and video editing software.The problem came in the shift to mobile devices. BlackBerry, Palm and, of course, the rise of the iPhone, decimated Intel\u2019s gargantuan lead in desktop computing as people found that they could do so much of what they did at home, sitting in front of a screen, from their phones. Now the smartphone is a global phenomenon, forever changing modern computing, and Intel\u2019s power-hungry processors tailor-made for desktops don\u2019t fit in with that new version of the world.So now, apparently, the bet for Intel is self-driving cars \u2014 or rather, providing the components for them \u2014 an industry currently receiving untold billions of dollars of investment from automakers to technology giants, all betting on an autonomous future.Do you think this is a smart move for Intel? I found it a bit schizophrenic, but also not necessarily ill advised.Otherwise, though, this does seem like a better bet than a lot of other stuff the company has been into lately. The auto market is huge, and every car is going to get more and more intelligence. Intel can combine its own manufacturing expertise with Mobileeye\u2019s insights to become the main shop for carmakers looking to add smarts to their vehicles.To me, the real question in this deal is what happens to the automakers. This deal is yet another sign that the future of the auto business will be determined as much by what happens in Silicon Valley as what happens in Detroit. Not only are tech companies creating more of the tech in cars, they\u2019re also changing the business model of the industry (through things like sharing) and the infrastructure around it (by pushing for electrification of cars). None if this bodes well for traditional carmakers.Anyway, nice to have you back, Mike.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Reasons Trump\u2019s Promised Tax Overhaul Won\u2019t Be So Easy", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s failure to push through the broad health care overhaul he promised has raised questions about the prospects of a sweeping rewrite of the tax code. It is a politically fraught and dizzyingly complex endeavor that pits powerful interests against one another and threatens to increase the federal deficit.\u201cTrump has to win on this,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation who advised Mr. Trump on tax policy during his campaign and transition. \u201cThere\u2019s no margin for error here, and failure is just not an option.\u201dJust how difficult will it be? Here are five obstacles to getting a new tax law:The greatest hurdle to a tax overhaul may be the White House itself. Mr. Trump has yet to make basic decisions about the structure and scope of his plan, the strategy for pushing it through Congress or even who in his administration will be in charge of crafting and selling it. While White House officials said they would unveil a plan weeks ago, one has not materialized.\u201cObviously, we\u2019re driving the train on this,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday as he deflected basic questions about what the president\u2019s proposal would look like. That is hardly obvious to many members of Congress, administration insiders and outside observers who now question whether Mr. Trump and his close advisers are capable of executing on such an ambitious and high-stakes negotiation.Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will most likely play a major role in devising a tax package. He said last week that the administration would soon release a plan. He also predicted that the tax effort would be easier than health care, a notion that many longtime congressional aides consider laughable. With many central jobs still unfilled at the Treasury Department, Mr. Mnuchin does not yet have the number-crunching and policy-analyzing firepower he needs to lead a major tax overhaul effort.Then there is Gary Cohn, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, who has told people that he is leading the president\u2019s tax overhaul effort. Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has expressed interest in using revenue raised by a special tax on American companies\u2019 offshore earnings to finance a major infrastructure rebuilding effort, an approach that could have some appeal among Democrats eager to see new spending on roads and bridges.Yet House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, are among those who have held firm to the idea of a tax overhaul that does not increase the debt.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that Republicans still very much care about balancing the federal budget,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cAnd in truth, this doesn\u2019t have to be a choice.\u201dBut choices will have to be made.One choice dividing Republicans is whether to include a large import tax, also known as a \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d in the package. Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady have been aggressively pushing the inclusion of a 20 percent tax on imports that they think would raise as much as $1 trillion to offset cuts in individual and business tax rates.Such a proposal appeals to Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct for toughness at the border, promoting American-made products and igniting the creation of new manufacturing jobs. While he has sent mixed signals about whether he supports including it in a tax overhaul, the president told The New York Times this month that he did. \u201cI\u2019m the king of that,\u201d he said.It is a clich\u00e9 in Washington to say that tax reform creates winners and losers. But it is true, and that is one of the most formidable obstacles that has frustrated previous efforts at enacting broad changes to the tax code.The tax code is riddled with special-interest provisions and deductions enacted over many decades. Reorienting is bound to give advantages to certain groups and impose disadvantages on others.Popular tax breaks for individuals such as deductions for mortgage interest, charitable giving, and state and local taxes account for huge amounts of revenue. They would probably have to be curbed or eliminated in order to compensate for bringing down tax rates. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Brady have proposed doing so.The real estate industry, charitable groups, municipal bond traders, and state and local governments are just a few of the constituencies that are likely to revolt at the first hint of such changes. And they could be expected to spend freely to defeat them.The arcane procedural rules of Congress \u2014 the same ones that contributed to the demise of the health care repeal bill \u2014 will complicate the process of pushing through a tax overhaul. The White House and congressional Republicans would need to decide whether to use a process known as budget reconciliation to speed changes through Congress on a simple majority vote or allow the legislation to proceed under normal rules. Go with the normal rules and they would need 60 votes in the Senate \u2014 including some Democratic support \u2014 to pass it.Because of the strictures of the reconciliation process, the plan would not be allowed to add to deficits outside of a 10-year budget window. That is why President George W. Bush had to include a sunset provision in his tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.But businesses that crave long-term certainty are not likely to favor such an impermanent approach. And on Monday, Mr. Brady said he had no intention of producing such a plan.\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about leapfrogging America back to the lead of the pack, if we\u2019re serious about creating jobs and jump-starting this economy, a 10-year bill will not accomplish either of those,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cThe most pro-growth tax reform is a permanent tax reform.\u201dThat is a lot that could go wrong. Notice we have not even mentioned Democratic opposition.An earlier version of this article imprecisely described strictures of the reconciliation process. The tax plan would not be allowed to add to deficits outside of a 10-year budget window, not for the next 10 years.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Visions of Trumptopia", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "Supported byEditorialIf there was a unifying theme to President Trump\u2019s campaign, it was his pledge to serve America\u2019s \u201cforgotten men and women,\u201d working people forsaken by the economy and Washington.In his speech Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump presented himself as having made an aggressive start at championing the cause of working people, and promised a new era of rising wages, bustling factories and coal mines, sparkling air and water, and cheaper and better health care, all behind a \u201cgreat great wall.\u201d He told a few whoppers, but largely kept his eyes riveted to his teleprompter and his delivery subdued. He even opened his speech with a long-overdue condemnation of hate \u201cin all of its very ugly forms.\u201dWe heard again the same sorts of gauzy promises and assertions of a future Edenic America, a sort of Trumptopia, that characterized his campaign. He didn\u2019t explain how he would get it all done, much less pay for any of it; indeed, it sounded at times as though he were still running for the job, rather than confronted with actually doing it. Across his first few weeks in office, Mr. Trump has shown little sign of delivering anything for working Americans beyond whatever satisfaction they may derive from watching him bait the Washington establishment and attack the reality-based media.As in the campaign, Mr. Trump also promised Tuesday night to accelerate economic growth with a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. \u201cCrumbling infrastructure,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.\u201d Sounds great. What\u2019s the plan? How will we pay for it? He wasn\u2019t saying. He also renewed his promise of \u201cmassive tax relief\u201d for the middle class \u2014 but once again there are no details in sight.It is very early yet in this presidency \u2014 though it sure doesn\u2019t feel that way \u2014 and Mr. Trump may yet keep some of his proliferating commitments to Americans.But the plans he has put forward so far, and the few actions he has taken, do not bode well. He proposes to cut the health, disability and job-training programs that working people, as well as the poor, rely upon. Mr. Trump\u2019s first big initiative was a draconian immigration ban, now mired in court challenges, that\u2019s caused problems for businesses from Silicon Valley to Wisconsin. Mr. Trump proudly noted Tuesday that one of the administration\u2019s first orders froze federal hiring, but he seems unaware that those jobs aren\u2019t only in Washington, they\u2019re in communities across the nation.Mr. Trump has successfully started a national assault on unauthorized immigrants \u2014 and it is already tearing families apart and disrupting businesses, and is likely to cost billions without improving the fortunes of the working poor. On Tuesday he dangled the possibility of supporting some form of \u201cmerit based\u201d immigration reform that would make struggling families \u201cvery very happy indeed.\u201dAgain, that last bit sounds really nice. But it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that, so far, the only working people the president has really delivered for are members of his own family, who are using his presidency as a brand-building opportunity, and former campaign officials, who are cashing in as lobbyists in Washington.Yet Mr. Trump has certainly not forgotten America\u2019s \u201cforgotten men and women.\u201d The White House is assiduously stoking their fears, grievances and prejudices, and selling photo-ops as accomplishments in order to portray an undisciplined, unfocused president as \u201cPresident Action, President Impact.\u201dMeanwhile, he and his aides have counted on the protests of Americans outraged by his antics to create the appearance of an activist presidency. The cable shows are always on in the West Wing, where Stephen Bannon loves seeing split-screen television images with Mr. Trump meeting business executives on one side and opposition protest rallies on the other.Mr. Trump closed his address to Congress by recalling the historic accomplishments of \u201cthe country\u2019s builders and artists and inventors\u201d and imagining what Americans can accomplish today. It\u2019s time for the American president to do his job as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: In Washington, Jerry Brown Talks Nuclear Terror", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byCalifornia Today Good morning.WASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown arrived in Washington for his first trip to the capital during the Trump administration with an agenda full to the point of groaning. But in addition to infrastructure, immigration, health care and myriad other issues important to the nation\u2019s largest state, he had another topic on his mind.\u201cThe end of the world,\u201d said Mr. Brown.In a visit to The New York Times Washington bureau Tuesday, the always-spirited governor was at his most animated when discussing his work on the board of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and a threat he said should be taken more seriously.\u201cOne bomb of 15 kilotons dropped in Washington from a terrorist from some material they put together \u2014 unlikely but highly possible \u2014 could kill 80,000 people instantly, 100,000 serious casualties, wipe out the president, most of the Congress, whoever is at the meeting and change America forever,\u201d said Mr. Brown, tapping a conference table for emphasis. \u201cEnd America as we know it. That is not inconceivable.\u201dThe governor put in a plug for legislation sponsored by Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts that would require the president to receive congressional approval to use nuclear weapons.Mr. Brown, though, did not only speak with wonder about the prospect of cataclysmic terror. There was also the time he stepped onto Donald J. Trump\u2019s plane and laid eyes on a Renoir.\u201cI was very impressed,\u201d he said.It was in the 1990s and Mr. Brown had revived his career by becoming mayor of Oakland. He caught a ride on Mr. Trump\u2019s jet as part of an effort to convince the future leader of the free world to open a casino in Oakland (which never happened).But, Mr. Brown admitted, he could not be sure the artwork was an original.\u201cI didn\u2019t look that close,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)To travel between the lowest and highest points in the Lower 48, you need not go far.Both in California, Death Valley\u2019s Badwater (282 feet below sea level) is less than 100 miles as the crow flies east of Mount Whitney (14,505 feet).As one might expect, the proximity of the extremes has drawn people looking to test their mettle.To ratchet up the torture, it is held in mid-July, when 120-degree temperatures are common.Many runners drop out.

{"Headline": "What Booming Markets Are Telling Us About the Global Economy", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe stock market reached yet another new high on Wednesday, the latest development to make a mockery of what savvy economic commentators thought they knew about the world.Consider how things looked one year ago. The world economy seemed hopelessly trapped in a cycle of low growth and inflation. Markets recoiled at the mere possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. Populist political insurgencies seemed to threaten yet more financial market chaos.Now, interest rates and inflation forecasts have risen substantially from last winter\u2019s lows; financial markets are shrugging off \u2014 or even rallying at the possibility of \u2014 imminent Fed rate increases; and it is all taking place during Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency.An economy that seemed locked in some form of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d or \u201cnew normal\u201d is at long last showing some signs of being in something closer to an \u201cold normal.\u201d The United States manufacturing sector is showing strength, and the broader mix of market and economic data from around the world in the last few months also points to a world where a vicious economic cycle isn\u2019t looking quite as scary and may even be ending.There can be no assurance that this pattern will continue, and there are some things to worry about on the horizon, not least that the Trump administration could follow through on some of its threats to disrupt global trade and diplomatic relations. Long-term interest rates remain low by historical standards across most of the world, suggesting that global bond investors aren\u2019t fully buying into a return to stronger, more consistent growth.But the pivot since Election Day is huge. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is up 12 percent since Nov. 8, the London FTSE 100 index reached a new high Wednesday, and other global markets have grown nicely in that span. Ten-year Treasury bonds now yield 2.45 percent, up from 1.85 percent on Election Day, suggesting investors believe higher growth and inflation are more probable than had seemed likely just four months ago.Much of the buoyant optimism on Wall Street is driven by investors\u2019 expectations of corporate tax cuts and deregulation under the Trump administration. But there is also some real improvement in the economic data underneath the shifts, reflecting economic forces that have been underway for years. And this resetting of expectations is evident in market data beyond the always erratic stock market.For years, a theory that the major world economies were stuck in a pit of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d had gained hold \u2014 the idea that low economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and weak productivity growth were all reinforcing one another in a vicious cycle.There\u2019s hardly enough evidence to toss that theory aside, but there are many reasons to think things are now looking up.For example, bond market prices now suggest that investors foresee consumer price inflation in the United States at 2.03 percent a year over the coming decade \u2014 consistent with the 2 percent inflation the Fed aims for. It only recently reached that level, however, after being as low as 1.2 percent in February 2016. And it\u2019s not just the United States. Similar measures of inflation expectations have risen in Germany, Britain and other advanced economies.Fed watchers interpreted that to mean that an interest-rate increase could be on the way in mid-March, just three months after the last increase in December. Yet that did nothing to slow the 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 on Wednesday, and may even have contributed to it, as a sign of the Fed\u2019s confidence in the economy.A year ago, hints that the Fed would move quickly with rates would have sent markets into a tailspin. As 2016 began, Fed leaders were expecting to raise rates four times in that year, plans that helped send the stock market plummeting and measures of economic pessimism soaring. Then they backed off and only raised rates once.Conventional economic theory predicts that if a government tries to increase deficits at a time of full employment, the results will be some mix of higher inflation and higher interest rates, crowding out investment.So if tax cuts, more military spending and other Trumpian policies add to deficits at a time the economy is already running at full blast, rising prices and rising rates are exactly what we would expect to see.Advertisement"}

After lying and obfuscating about their \u201cclean diesel\u201d cars, VW finally pleaded guilty in January to criminal charges in the United States and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines. The cost to VW for its fraud in the United States so far is some $25 billion, including fines, customer claims and buybacks. In addition, six VW executives face criminal charges. One, Oliver Schmidt, was arrested in Florida in January and will be tried in April.The others are believed to be in Germany, which does not normally extradite citizens. But Germany is conducting its own investigation. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel testified before a parliamentary committee on when, and how much, she knew about VW\u2019s fraud. She said she \u201clearned of the allegations against VW from the media\u201d only after the E.P.A. went public.

{"Headline": "Strikes Shut Down French Guiana, With Effects Resonating in Paris", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 A general strike and widespread protests over high crime and economic hardship paralyzed French Guiana on Monday, as the government struggled to quell growing unrest that has disrupted travel, closed schools and thrust one of France\u2019s often-overlooked overseas territories into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.The French prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, announced on Monday that a delegation of ministers would travel to the South American territory by the end of the week to try to address demands by protesters, who have refused to negotiate with lower-level officials.\u201cFrench Guiana has always had a rather unfortunate reputation as an economic backwater whose general neglect by French officials is only periodically interrupted by outbreaks of political protest and acts of violence by various local groups demanding greater economic investment in the region,\u201d Mr. Toth wrote in an email.One of France\u2019s five overseas departments, the territory uses the euro, but the economy is heavily dependent on imports and on subsidies. In 2009, the overseas departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique, both islands in the Caribbean, were paralyzed for over a month by similar strikes, which sometimes turned violent.\u201cWe are not treated the same way as the French in the Hexagon,\u201d Mr. Karam said, referring to mainland France. He also noted that the proportion of inhabitants without access to drinking water or electricity was much higher in French Guiana than it was on the mainland.Gross domestic product per capita in the territory is less than half what it is on the mainland, and unemployment, more than 20 percent, is about double.Crime is also a major concern. One group of protesters, who wear balaclavas and call themselves the Collective of 500 Brothers, has been behind many of the demonstrations calling for greater security.Mr. Cazeneuve, the prime minister, said that solutions would not be found \u201camid disorder,\u201d but he acknowledged the widespread sentiment that the territory had been neglected.\u201cThere is still much to do to develop French Guiana,\u201d Mr. Cazeneuve said from Paris. \u201cIn the French Republic, each citizen must be able to benefit from the support and solidarity of the state.\u201dMr. Cazeneuve announced several measures, including the construction of a new penitentiary to relieve prison crowding. Over the weekend, the French authorities had already announced police reinforcements and increased funds for the hospital in Cayenne, the territory\u2019s capital.The protests have illuminated the deep economic, social and sometimes racial divide between mainland France and its overseas territories, which are the remnants of the French colonial empire.Lines formed at stores and gas stations over the weekend as people rushed to stock up on goods before the strike, which a group of 37 unions voted on Saturday to carry out for an unlimited period of time.With four weeks to go before the first round of the French presidential elections, the unrest has become a focal point of the campaign, and candidates across the spectrum spoke profusely about a region of France that usually gets little attention from politicians and the news media outside of electoral seasons.At a rally in Rennes on Sunday, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the leftist candidate in the presidential election, called for better access to health and education services.Other candidates have been tripped up by past or new statements illustrating how France\u2019s overseas territories are only marginally discussed in regular political debate.The independent candidate Emmanuel Macron, who is predicted by polls to beat Ms. Le Pen in the second round of voting in May, was widely mocked on social media for referring to French Guiana as an \u201cisland\u201d \u2014 which, unlike many other French overseas territories, it is not.His campaign later attempted to justify his use of the word by saying that he was referring to the \u201c\u00cele de Cayenne,\u201d or \u201cIsle of Cayenne,\u201d a term used to designate the area surrounding the capital.Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a right-wing presidential candidate, was also in the news for statements he made in 2014 suggesting that the authorities create a detention center in Cayenne for jihadists, to \u201cisolate these raving lunatics.\u201d (On Monday, he apologized for the comments.)\u201cThe people of French Guiana are trapped in an administrative and legal structure that on the one hand guarantees them French-style institutions and benefits and on the other assures that local people will never be able to prosper there,\u201d Ms. Spieler said in an email.\u201cThe economic problems that now confront France have led to a decline in the quality of local public services in French Guiana and local people cannot make up the difference because they are poor,\u201d she said. \u201cFor structural reasons, the postcolonial economy of French Guiana can never prosper on its own.\u201dBeno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting from Paris, and Sewell Chan from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fake Freedom of American Health Care", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byOpinionRepublican leaders seem unfazed by this, perhaps because, in their minds, deciding not to have health care because it\u2019s too expensive is an exercise of individual free will. As Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, put it: \u201cAmericans have choices. And they\u2019ve got to make a choice. And so maybe, rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love, and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.\u201dIn practice, though, this Republican notion is an awfully peculiar kind of freedom. It requires most Americans to spend not just money, but also time and energy agonizing over the bewildering logistics of coverage and treatment \u2014 confusing plans, exorbitant premiums and deductibles, exclusive networks, mysterious tests, outrageous drug prices. And more often than not, individual choices are severely restricted by decisions made by employers, insurers, doctors, pharmaceutical companies and other private players. Those interest groups, not the consumer, decide which plans are available, what those plans cover, which doctors patients can see and how much it will cost.And I haven\u2019t even mentioned the millions of Americans who don\u2019t earn enough to pay for insurance or a lifesaving treatment. If you can\u2019t afford it, not buying it is hardly a choice.Eight years ago I moved to the United States from Finland, which like all the Nordic nations is a wealthy capitalist economy, despite the stereotypes you may have heard. And like all those countries, Finland has invested in a universal, taxpayer-funded and publicly managed health care system. Finns constantly debate the shortcomings of their system and are working to improve it, but in Finland I never worried about where my medical care came from or whether I could afford it. I paid my income taxes \u2014 which, again despite the stereotypes, were about the same as what I pay in federal, state and local income taxes in New York City \u2014 and if I needed to see a doctor, I had several options.For minor medical matters, I could visit a private physician who was provided as a perk by my employer. Or I could call the public clinic closest to my home. If I saw the private doctor, my employer picked up the tab, with the help of public subsidies. If I went to the public clinic, it might cost me a small co-payment, usually around $20. Had I been pregnant, most care would have been free.If I had wanted to, I also could have easily paid to see a private doctor on my own, again with the help of public subsidies. All of this works without anyone ever having to sign up for or buy health insurance unless he wants additional coverage. I never had to worry whether I was covered. All Finns are covered for all essential medical care automatically, regardless of employment or income.In Europe, he said, elderly people facing life-threatening diseases are often placed in palliative care and essentially told it\u2019s their time to go. According to the Republican orthodoxy, government always takes away not only people\u2019s freedom to choose their doctor, but also their doctor\u2019s ability to choose the correct care for patients. People are at the mercy of bureaucrats. Waiting times are long. Quality of care is dismal.But are Republicans right about this? Practically every wealthy capitalist democracy in the world has decided that some form of government-managed universal health care is the most sensible and effective option. According to the latest report of the O.E.C.D. \u2014 an organization of mostly wealthy nations \u2014 the United States as a whole does not actually outshine other countries in the quality of care.It\u2019s not just American patients who endure endless bureaucratic hassles. American doctors were also significantly more likely to report as major problems the amount of time they spent on dealing with administrative burdens related to insurance and claims, as well as on getting patients medications or treatment because of restrictions imposed by insurance companies, compared with doctors in most of the other 10 countries studied \u2014 including Sweden and Britain.Overall, Americans spend far more of their hard-earned money on health care than citizens of any other country, by a very wide margin. This means that it is in fact Americans who are getting a raw deal. Americans pay much more than people in other countries but do not get significantly better results.The trouble with a free-market approach is that health care is an immensely complicated and expensive industry, in which the individual rarely has much actual market power. It is not like buying a consumer product, where choosing not to buy will not endanger one\u2019s life. It\u2019s also not like buying some other service tailored to individual demands, because for the most part we can\u2019t predict our future health care needs.The point of universal coverage is to pool risk, for the maximum benefit of the individual when he or she needs care. And the point of having the government manage this complicated service is not to take freedom away from the individual. The point is the opposite: to give people more freedom. Arranging health care is an overwhelming task, and having a specialized entity do the negotiating, regulating and perhaps even much of the providing is just vastly more efficient than forcing everyone to go it alone.What passes for an American health care system today certainly has not made me feel freer. Having to arrange so many aspects of care myself, while also having to navigate the ever-changing maze of plans, prices and the scarcity of appointments available with good doctors in my network, has thrown me, along with huge numbers of Americans, into a state of constant stress. And I haven\u2019t even been seriously sick or injured yet.As a United States citizen now, I wish Americans could experience the freedom of knowing that the health care system will always be there for us regardless of our employment status. I wish we were free to assume that our doctors get paid a salary to look after our best interests, not to profit by generating billable tests and procedures. I want the freedom to know that the system will automatically take me and my family in, without my having to battle for care in my moment of weakness and need. That is real freedom.So is the freedom of knowing that none of it will bankrupt us. That is the freedom I had back in Finland.Here is my appeal to Republicans: If you really want to free Americans and unburden American employers, why not try, or at least seriously consider, some form of government-managed health care, like almost every other capitalist democracy? There are many ways of giving people choice and excellent care under government management. Universal publicly managed health coverage would even free America\u2019s corporations and businesses to streamline their operations, releasing them from bureaucratic obligations that to me, coming from Finland, I have to say look weirdly socialist. Would this mean they would have to pay more in taxes? Possibly.Many countries require employers and employees to contribute to the health care system through payroll taxes, more than the United States does. But again, Americans are paying far more for health care than anyone else, and America\u2019s businesses are stuck managing this mess. It\u2019s true that in countries with universal health care the cost of hiring a new employee can be significant, especially for a small employer. Yet these countries still have plenty of thriving businesses, with lower administrative burdens. It can be done.In wealthy capitalist democracies all around the world the government itself also has an essential kind of freedom. It\u2019s a freedom that enables the government to do work on behalf of the citizens who elect it, including negotiating the prices of health care with providers and pharmaceutical companies \u2014 a policy that has led to lower drug prices in those countries.Americans today are paying vastly more in money, worry and hassle for the same, and sometimes worse, care than people in other wealthy capitalist democracies. Some Americans have coverage that serves them well, but judging by the current mood, the number of Americans who think the system needs to change is growing. No health care system is perfect. But in a nation that purports to champion freedom, the outdated disaster that is the United States health care system is taking that freedom away.Anu Partanen is the author of \u201cThe Nordic Theory of Everything: In Search of a Better Life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Raises Interest Rates for Third Time Since Financial Crisis", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byThe Federal Reserve, which raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the second time in three months, this time to a range between 0.75 percent and 1 percent, is finally moving toward the end of its nine-year-old economic stimulus campaign, which began in the depths of the financial crisis.But Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said at a news conference after the decision was announced that the Fed did not share the optimism of stock market investors and some business executives that economic growth is gaining speed. It still plans to move slowly because the economy continues to grow slowly. She suggested that the Fed would have plenty of time to adjust its plans should President Trump and Congress cut taxes or spend massively on infrastructure.Her announcement was full of confidence. But it certainly was not ebullient. \u201cThe data have not notably strengthened,\u201d Ms. Yellen told reporters. \u201cWe haven\u2019t changed the outlook. We think we\u2019re moving on the same course we\u2019ve been on.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s sobriety did not appear to make much of an impression on investors. The stock market\u2019s heady march that began after Mr. Trump\u2019s election continued apace. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 0.84 percent to close at 2,385.26 Wednesday, moving up sharply after the announcement. Some said the Fed was still a long way from doing anything that might hurt.\u201cThe first four to eight rate hikes are the low-hanging fruit,\u201d said Deron McCoy, the chief investment officer at SEIA, a Los Angeles firm. \u201cThe real test will be whether the economy can withstand positive real rates. And that still seems to be a 2019 topic.\u201dSome analysts said the Fed will want to see an impact from its actions. \u201cPolicy makers hike rates to tighten financial conditions,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cIf this easing of financial conditions on the back of today\u2019s hike are sustained, that would tell policy makers they need to do more.\u201dThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third consecutive quarter.Ms. Zentner said she expected the Fed to raise rates again at its June meeting. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee next meets on May 2 and 3.She noted that the Fed\u2019s longer-term outlook is less clear. Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as Fed chairwoman ends in February, and Mr. Trump could then replace her.\u201cThe basis for today\u2019s decision is simply our assessment of the progress of the economy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at the postmeeting news conference. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been doing nicely.\u201dThe Fed, which had made more inflation a central objective, said on Wednesday that it was now focused on stabilizing inflation. Ms. Yellen took the opportunity to note that inflation may now rise a bit above 2 percent, just as it has been below 2 percent the last few years. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a target.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s increased confidence was reflected in a new round of policy forecasts it also published Wednesday. An increased number of Fed officials are expecting to raise rates at least twice more this year. Only three of the 17 officials who submitted forecasts expect the central bank to move more slowly. There was a similar coalescing around tighter policy for the following two years, marking the first time in recent years that the Fed\u2019s quarterly economic forecasts have shifted toward a prediction of tighter monetary policy.This is the third time the Fed has raised rates since the financial crisis. The first hike came at the end of 2015 and the second almost exactly one year later. This time the Fed waited just three months. The benchmark rate remains below 1 percent, a very low level.People with credit card debt are likely to see an immediate increase of about a quarter percentage point in their interest rates. The effect on longer-term loans is less direct, but the average rate on a 30-year mortgage rose by half a percentage point over the last year.The Fed\u2019s move to raise rates puts it on course for a slow-motion collision with President Trump, who has repeatedly promised to increase economic growth through policies including cuts in taxation and regulation and more spending on infrastructure and defense.Fed officials have emphasized that the economy is already growing at roughly its maximum sustainable pace; faster growth would therefore lead to faster increases in interest rates.Some economists and liberal activists argue that the Fed is raising rates too quickly. Narayana Kocherlakota, an economist at the University of Rochester and a former member of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, noted that strong economic growth continued to pull people into the job market while wage growth remained relatively weak. That suggests, he said, that the economy has not yet returned to full employment.\u201cWe should be seeing faster wage growth with this level of employment growth if we were close to full employment,\u201d Mr. Kocherlakota said on Twitter before the Fed\u2019s decision.Mr. Kocherlakota\u2019s successor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, cast the sole vote against raising rates on Wednesday.The Fed\u2019s assessment of economic conditions remained quite measured. The economy expanded by just 1.6 percent in 2016, and there is little sign of an acceleration during the first quarter. Fed officials continue to forecast a Goldilocks economy, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.5 percent and inflation around 2 percent for the next three years.Ms. Yellen played down surveys showing a sharp rise in the optimism of consumers and business executives since the presidential election, noting there is little evidence that such surveys predict spending decisions.She said that Fed officials spoke regularly to business leaders, and that many were undoubtedly in \u201ca much more optimistic frame of mind.\u201d But she added that many of those executives have adopted a wait-and-see attitude \u2014 just like the Fed itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Upholds Auto Emissions Standards, Setting Up Face-Off With Trump", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byCalifornia\u2019s clean-air agency voted on Friday to push ahead with stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks, setting up a potential legal battle with the Trump administration over the state\u2019s plan to reduce planet-warming gases.The vote, by the California Air Resources Board, is the boldest indication yet of California\u2019s plan to stand up to President Trump\u2019s agenda. Leading politicians in the state, from the governor down to many mayors, have promised to lead the resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.\u201cAll of the evidence \u2014 call it science, call it economics \u2014 shows that if anything, these standards should be even more aggressive,\u201d said the board member Daniel Sperling, a transportation expert at the University of California, Davis.The board\u2019s chairwoman, Mary D. Nichols, an assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, was even more pointed, admonishing automakers for milking Mr. Trump for favors.\u201cWhat were you thinking when you threw yourselves upon the mercy of the Trump administration to try to solve your problems?\u201d she asked. \u201cLet\u2019s take action today, and let\u2019s move on.\u201dLong a forerunner in environmental regulation, California worked with the Obama administration on joint standards that became a crucial part of the country\u2019s effort to combat climate change. Officials said the regulations would reduce the country\u2019s oil consumption by 12 billion barrels and eliminate six billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution over the lifetime of the cars affected. That amounts to more than a year\u2019s worth of America\u2019s carbon emissions.Friday\u2019s unanimous vote by the 14-member board, which affirmed the higher standards through 2025, amounted to a public rejection of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans.Now, the question is how \u2014 or whether \u2014 the Trump administration will handle California\u2019s dissent. The administration could choose to revoke California\u2019s waiver, at which point experts expect the state would sue.California sued the George W. Bush administration after it challenged California\u2019s waiver in 2007. Mr. Obama reversed the federal challenge.The White House and the E.P.A., which have not yet determined their plans for the California waiver, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Several states that follow California\u2019s rules raced to its defense. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way together,\u201d said Steven Flint, director of the air resources division of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. \u201cWe\u2019re with you, and we believe in what you\u2019re doing.\u201dAfter the election of Mr. Trump, a group representing the nation\u2019s biggest makers of cars and light trucks urged a reassessment of the emissions rules, which the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d for the auto industry.Automakers now complain about the steep technical challenge that the stringent standards pose. They have estimated that only about 3.5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it, and that their industry would have to spend a \u201cstaggering\u201d $200 billion by 2025 to comply.John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, an industry trade group, said before the California vote that companies agreed on the need to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. But he urged California to fall into line with federal rules.\u201cThere is a more effective way forward than regulatory systems that are different,\u201d Mr. Bozzella said. He also suggested that demand for clean cars remained relatively tiny.What was required, he said, were standards that \u201cbalance innovation, compliance and consumer needs and wants.\u201dAutomakers have also been critical of a California\u2019s zero-emission vehicle program, which requires automakers to sell a certain percentage of electric cars and trucks in California and nine other states. The board voted on Friday to continue that program.Politicians in California, one of the country\u2019s most Democratic states, have embraced acting as a bulwark against Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, promising to defend the state\u2019s laws on immigration, health care and the environment. Many cities in California have broad \u201csanctuary\u201d policies aimed at protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants. State law also provides some protections for immigrants from being turned over to federal authorities for deportation.In addition, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, declared that California would continue to work toward its legally required target of reducing carbon emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And the state has retained Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, to advise on potential legal fights with the White House.Even at the federal level, the president\u2019s announcement alone will not be enough to immediately roll back emissions standards, a process expected to take more than a year of legal and regulatory reviews by the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department. The Trump administration would then need to propose its own replacement fuel-economy standards.Bonnie Holmes-Gen of the American Lung Association of California, one of many health and environmental groups that spoke at the board meeting, said moving away from strict emissions standards would hurt public health and the health of the planet. She urged the state to stay its course.\u201cThe public is bearing a huge cost \u2014 billions of dollars in health expenses and damage from climate,\u201d Ms. Holmes-Gen said. \u201cI urge California to keep us on track.\u201dAn article on Saturday about California\u2019s upholding its auto emissions standards misstated the position that Steven Flint holds at the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. He is director of the air resources division, not the director of the department.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Leaders Argue, South Korea Finds China Is No Longer an Easy Sell", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byINCHEON, South Korea \u2014 Until recently, Beyond Cosmetics could not fill Chinese orders fast enough for its Green Piggy Collagen Jella Pack, a creamy beige substance containing pig collagen, or its Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask, which leaves the user\u2019s face covered with foam.Even before the current crisis, Beyond Cosmetics had started to look beyond China, where it was increasingly running into problems like tougher government rules and rising homegrown competition.\u201cWe thought we could do something better with our time than attempt to go further into the Chinese market,\u201d said Kim Byung-sun, the company\u2019s vice president, adding that he traveled regularly to promote halal-certified products in Malaysia, a predominantly Muslim country, and long-lasting matte lipsticks that can withstand the humidity in Thailand.An export powerhouse that began its upward trajectory decades before Beijing embraced capitalist economics, South Korea has long benefited from China\u2019s rise. Chinese factories are major buyers of Korean-made components. A growing Chinese middle class embraced Korean devices, cosmetics, television shows and music, often in shopping trips across the Yellow Sea.All of that may be in jeopardy now. Consumer boycotts have hit Korean chain stores in China. K-pop shows there have been canceled. Just last week, the Chinese National Tourism Administration ordered regional travel agencies to halt sales of package tours to South Korea.But even before China began lashing out at South Korea, the economic relationship between the industrial giants had started to shift. China is increasingly a competitor as much as a customer for South Korea. Chinese companies have improved product quality and can compete on price, both at home and abroad, in everything from complex components to cosmetics to smartphones.\u201cA key question is whether Korea is going to be able to make a shift away from a trade- and export-led growth model that brought them dramatic economic success,\u201d said Mark W. Lippert, who recently left Seoul as the American ambassador to South Korea.Chinese manufacturers have started to make the parts and components that South Korean companies have been selling into China, where factory workers assemble them into products destined for European or American consumers. This so-called intermediary trade currently accounts for about three-quarters of all of South Korea\u2019s exports to China.Mr. Kim, of Beyond Cosmetics, says Chinese cosmetics manufacturers have wooed South Korean research employees with salaries that are three times higher than what his company can offer, in addition to benefits like housing and cars.In 2015 and 2016, South Korea\u2019s exports fell for the first time in close to 60 years, the Korea International Trade Association said. Last year, exports to China slid 9.3 percent compared with a year earlier as the Chinese economy slowed down, though those figures were up in the first two months of this year.\u201cRegardless of the industry, Korea has depended on China too much,\u201d said Kang Seon-jou, professor of trade and economic studies at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy.Lotte, a South Korean conglomerate that is providing land for the Thaad deployment, has reported that its online stores in China have been hacked and that half its China-based shops have been shut down for reported fire code violations.Although Lotte is reluctant to blame the Thaad backlash, Chinese consumers seem ready to do so. Over the weekend, hundreds of angry protesters, waving Chinese flags and singing, assembled outside Lotte shops and demanded that the public boycott South Korean products.In Incheon, a port city less than 250 miles from the nearest port in China, visiting Chinese consumers arrive by ferry to snap up items like rice cookers, toilet seats, food and makeup.Still, local merchants are experiencing what they say is a slowdown in tourist activity from China. Incheon officials said that this month, several large Chinese businesses that were planning to send thousands of employees to company workshops in the city canceled the visits.Although the number of Chinese visitors to Incheon rose in 2016 over a year earlier, when an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome caused tourism to plunge, the numbers have not returned to 2014 levels. Yoo Jeong-bok, Incheon\u2019s mayor, said in an interview at city hall, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have these geopolitical security issues, I think these 2016 figures would have been much higher.\u201dLee Chung-ha, 65, owner of a small dealer of Korean-made rice cookers, said he used to sell about 30 cookers a day to Chinese visitors. On a recent Wednesday, he was unable to sell even one and cited the Thaad deployment as the biggest factor.In the underground Sinpo International Market, a warren of small retail stalls selling clothing, handbags and used cellphones, business was sluggish on a recent visit.\u201cThings are really bad right now,\u201d said Kim Min-seop, 52, owner of Mirae Mobile, where he sells recycled cellphones and iPads. \u201cBut to be honest, what can the government do? This is such a sensitive political issue.\u201dDown the hall, at a tiny skin care salon, Kim Chun-yeo, 57, the owner, sat alone on a small stool waiting for a customer to stop by. An ethnic Korean who was born in China, Ms. Kim opened her stall two years ago. About half of her business came from Chinese visitors, including a steady stream of cruise ship and ferry workers who wanted facials. Now, she\u2019s lucky to get one or two customers a day.Ms. Kim never thought she would need to pay so much attention to politics. \u201cI think the politicians have not done well,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause for the economy to be good, we have to have a relationship with China. I think Korea should be smarter by trying to cooperate with China.\u201dSu-hyun Lee contributed reporting from Incheon, South Korea.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Hard Truth About Refugees", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt is too early to know whether the net effect of the 2015 wave of largely Middle Eastern refugees on Sweden, Germany and other European countries will be positive or negative. Certainly Mr. Trump\u2019s habit of blaming refugees for terrorism, used to justify his signing a revised executive order banning travel from six predominantly Muslim countries on Monday, flies in the face of the evidence. But so does the reflexive claim that the refugees will fit easily into European society or expand the labor force. Our liberal opinion corridor thus offers the perfect pretext for cynics and xenophobes to parade their prejudice as truth-telling courage.The truth about refugees is complicated. Sweden offers a kind of laboratory in that regard: Almost all the non-Europeans in the country arrived as refugees. The Chileans, Iranians, Kurds and Bosnians have done very well; Eritreans and Somalis, less so. Labor-force participation and educational attainment among non-European immigrants are far lower than among native Swedes. Yet Sweden has one of Europe\u2019s strongest economies.The question that cannot yet be answered is how well the 100,000 or so Syrian, Iraqi, Afghan and other refugees who will be granted permanent residence in the country will integrate. Will they embrace Sweden\u2019s extremely secular, extremely progressive culture? Probably not. Polls find that Muslim immigrants are vastly more conservative than native Europeans on matters of sex, family and the role of religion in public life.We already know what the political effect has been: The right-wing politics that has convulsed virtually every northern European country, including Sweden, feeds upon public fear of refugees and immigrants. In the Netherlands, which will hold elections this month, mainstream parties have adopted a sharply anti-immigrant line to blunt the appeal of the nativist Geert Wilders; in France, Marine Le Pen, head of the anti-immigrant National Front, is expected to win the most votes in the first round of voting, in late April.The answer to xenophobia cannot be xenophilia. For mobile, prosperous, worldly people, the cherishing of diversity is a cardinal virtue; we dote on difference. That\u2019s simply not true for many people who can\u2019t choose where to live, or who prefer the familiar coordinates of their life. That was the bitter lesson that British cosmopolites learned from Brexit. If the answer is to insist that the arrival of vast numbers of new people on our doorstep is an unmixed blessing, and that those who believe otherwise are Neanderthals, then we leave the field wide open to Donald J. Trump and Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen.A year ago, when European leaders struck a deal with Turkey to stop refugees at the border in exchange for funding to help Turkey treat refugees decently, they were widely denounced for violating humanitarian obligations. But if they had honored those obligations they would have lost their publics. Now they need to devise the coordinated, long-term answers to both refugees and immigrants that they have been putting off for years.The situation is different here. Since the United States has no real refugee problem, save one fabricated by Mr. Trump and conservative activists, and no immigrant crime wave, the chief answer has to be on the level of the opinion corridor: Liberal urbanites have to accept that many Americans react to multicultural pieties by finding something else \u2014 sometimes their own white identity \u2014 to embrace. If there\u2019s a culture war, everyone loses; but history tells us that liberals lose worse.I believe that liberalism can be preserved only if liberals learn to distinguish between what must be protected at all cost and what must be, not discarded, but reconsidered \u2014 the unquestioned virtue of cosmopolitanism, for example, or of free trade. If we are to honor the human rights of refugees, we must find a way to do so that commands political majorities. Otherwise we\u2019ll keep electing leaders who couldn\u2019t care less about those rights.James Traub, a columnist and contributor for Foreign Policy, is writing a book about the rise and fall of liberalism.Advertisement"}

Down a narrow, dark hallway, strains of Spanish music came from an apartment. Daniela Alulema opened the door to where her mother and brother live. The shiny birthday balloons bobbing over a spotless dining table were there to commemorate her brother\u2019s birthday.\u201cHe reached a quarter-century,\u201d said the mother with a proud smile. She walked over to the oven and pulled out a roast rabbit for the modest celebration. On the radio, guitar trios played boleros, melancholy songs of romance and regret.And Ms. Alulema? In recent years she finished college and went on to get a master\u2019s degree in public policy. Thanks to an Obama-era decision known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, she obtained permission to work and remain, and she now works for a migration policy group. For the first time, she felt as if she could breathe easy. But that was short-lived once Donald J. Trump was elected president after a campaign in which undocumented immigrants were used as rhetorical punching bags. The subsequent reports \u2014 and rumors \u2014 of arrests in immigrant communities have rattled her.\u201cThe morning after the election I was getting ready to go to work,\u201d said Ms. Alulema, 29. \u201cI just broke down in the bathroom.

Do we stay, or do we pack our bags and go back? There is an air of instability. Everybody is nervous about what can we do.\u201dThat includes Ms. Alulema, whose future has been thrown in limbo since the election. Her employer got her legal help to see if he could sponsor her. Her mother suggested she marry an American citizen, a prospect she rejects: In these times, she is not about to make any long-term plans, much less marry.\u201cEverybody turned to look at me when I walked in,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the first time, I felt unwelcome. I felt I had to watch my words and be on guard. I was even watching the way I pronounced my words.\u201dMs. Alulema possesses a quiet confidence. She is precise in her language and not easily rattled. Trained as an accountant, she also looks beyond the numbers to the human lives that undergird the city economy, where people like her mother allow middle-class residents to balance career and family.\u201cMy mother is raising American kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Americans know that immigrants pick crops, cook food, raise children and take care of the elderly. Immigrants make this city run. It\u2019s hypocritical what this country is doing. They want this cheap labor, but they want to keep us in fear.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think anything coming from the White House can be trusted,\u201d Ms. Alulema said. \u201cWashington is playing with the dreams and lives of so many people. I\u2019ve become cynical and won\u2019t believe anything until I see signed papers. I do not feel safer.\u201dShe goes about her day knowing she has to be ready. The lawyers she has consulted are not optimistic. A trip she had planned to visit her father in Ecuador has been delayed, like many other things in her life. She wonders if it\u2019s time to go back to Ecuador.\u201cOne day, I stopped and thought how my parents were even younger than me when they came here,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother came here not knowing the language or anyone else. She took that risk, so why can\u2019t I take that risk and leave everything? I have these amazing tools my parents gave me, an education. You get tired of living in fear and being limited.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s at Stake in a Health Bill That Slashes the Safety Net", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhat do we lose when social insurance unravels?It is startling to realize just how much the social safety net expanded during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. In 2016, means-tested entitlements like Medicaid and food stamps absorbed 3.8 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, almost a full percentage point more than in 2008.Public social spending writ large \u2014 including health care, pensions, unemployment insurance, poverty alleviation and the like \u2014 reached 19.3 percent of G.D.P., the most in decades and almost three percentage points more than in the year before Mr. Obama took office.It didn\u2019t stick, though.And in the biggest step to shrink the social safety net since President Franklin D. Roosevelt started building it in the rubble of the Great Depression, Republicans in the House plan to vote this week to undo the Affordable Care Act. That law was Mr. Obama\u2019s singular contribution toward an American welfare state, the biggest expansion of the nation\u2019s safety net in half a century.Voters, pay attention. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, will try to sell his plan by leveraging Americans\u2019 atavistic fear of Big Government, offering people the freedom to choose whether to have health insurance. You may want to focus instead on what the United States stands to lose.Mr. Ryan\u2019s proposal, the American Health Care Act, doesn\u2019t merely undo the expansion of Medicaid to the near poor. It converts the entire program into a block grant to the states and gradually strangles it by increasing federal funding more slowly than projected spending growth. Not even the Clinton administration\u2019s welfare reform of 1996, the other notable revision of the American safety net, proposed such a redistribution.The American Health Care Act, by contrast, is decidedly about cutting people off. David M. Cutler, an expert on the economics of health care at Harvard University, put it like this: \u201cNo other Congress or administration has ever put forward a plan with the intention of having fewer people covered.\u201dAnd that is just the first pass.What will happen? Millions of Americans \u2014 poor ones, mainly \u2014 will use much less health care. They will make fewer outpatient visits, have fewer mammograms and cholesterol checks. Access to Medicaid in Oregon increased use of health care services by some 25 percent. Losing Medicaid is likely to reduce use by a similar amount.Among those who survive, more are likely to report themselves in poorer health. Their rates of depression are likely to rise. Critically, their finances will certainly suffer. This provides a direct glimpse into how cutting off health insurance won\u2019t just reduce access to health care among the poor. It will ricochet across society.The Ryan plan \u2014 caught between right-wing Republicans in the House who would like to cut health care subsidies further and centrists in the Senate who are loath to leave so many Americans uninsured \u2014 may not pass in its present form. The administration could short-circuit the Affordable Care Act by dragging its feet on enforcing the insurance mandate or simply not advertising plans on the exchanges. In any event, public health insurance will take a big hit.Might an uninsured mother become more reluctant to let her child play outdoors and risk an expensive broken arm? Might depression and mental health problems destabilize families, feeding down into the health, education and well-being of the next generation?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edward E. David Jr., Who Elevated Science Under Nixon, Dies at 92", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "Supported byEdward E. David Jr., a researcher who sought to make science more relevant and accessible to presidents and to the public, died on Feb. 13 at his home in Bedminster, N.J. He was 92.His death was confirmed by his wife, Ann.He also helped draft the administration\u2019s proposals for pollution control and alternative energy that followed passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. He struck partnership agreements with foreign governments and private industry, reorganized the federal scientific bureaucracy, and encouraged Nixon to deliver the first presidential message on science and technology.But elevating research to a higher government priority was problematic, as was getting the president to listen. An article in The Saturday Review of Science concluded in 1972 that \u201cMr. David is politically chaste and Mr. Nixon is scientifically illiterate.\u201dAfter Nixon diluted Dr. David\u2019s authority by appointing a separate technology adviser, and just three weeks before the president abolished the science and technology office altogether, Dr. David quit in frustration early in 1973. The president said the office\u2019s advisory and other functions could largely be assumed by the National Science Foundation, a congressionally chartered agency.During his tenure and afterward, when he served on professional and official panels (including some appointed by other presidents), Dr. David warned of the challenges that computers posed to personal privacy, advocated a federal communications network linking local emergency services to provide disaster warnings, expressed alarm at a national learning gap in mathematics, and supported ethical standards for research.While he pressed utility companies to impose pollution controls and explore alternative fuels, in 1972 he questioned the cost-benefit value of stringent auto emission rules and airbags.He favored development of a supersonic transport plane and criticized NASA for relying too heavily on space shuttles as launching vehicles instead of expendable rockets.By the new century, with nongovernment sources spending more on research, he suggested that the president\u2019s science office, which was revived in 1976, become a \u201cwindow on the private sector\u201d rather than a more aggressive guiding force.Unlike the presidential science advisers who preceded him, Dr. David was an industrial scientist. Before serving in government, he was executive director of the communications systems division of Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he worked from 1950 until his presidential appointment in 1970.He left government for Gould Inc., a technology company, and was president of the Exxon Research and Engineering Company from 1977 to 1986.He was also the United States representative to the NATO Science Committee, a president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the founder of a consulting company.Edward Emil David Jr. was born on Jan. 25, 1925, in Wilmington, N.C., to Edward Emil David and the former Beatrice Liebman.In addition to his wife, the former Ann Hirshberg, he is survived by their daughter, Nancy David Dillon.Mr. David served in the Navy at the end of World War II and earned a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1945. He received a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he specialized in microwaves and noise theory.At Bell Labs, he worked on fabricating an inexpensive artificial larynx to help restore speech after surgery and on technology to prevent airplane hijackings.\u201cWe can\u2019t leave science and technology to the experts,\u201d Dr. David said in 1970.\u201cI look on science and scientists as the antidote to politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all these arguments about pollution, energy, drugs, product safety, some group has to stand up for reality. That\u2019s what science is all about.\u201dBut, he cautioned, even after the great scientific strides of the 1960s \u2014 among them landing a man on the moon \u2014 science has its limits.\u201cI believe that by the end of the 1970s we will have solved most of the problems we perceive now: transportation, energy, pollution,\u201d Dr. David predicted as the decade began. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we can\u2019t do everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Those Pesky Airline Fees and How to Avoid Them", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayWhat\u2019s a blanket on a cold airplane worth?\u201cDiverting a fight is clearly not our first choice, but our crew felt it was necessary to divert to Los Angeles and deplane the passenger before beginning to fly over the Pacific Ocean,\u201d the airline said in a statement.As most passengers can\u2019t help but notice, add-on fees are becoming more and more prevalent. Mr. Hobica said the fee that makes most passengers angry is the one for changing flights, which costs an average of $200 on domestic flights. But that does not mean the smaller fees aren\u2019t aggravating.The problem is that the fees vary greatly from airline to airline and class to class, which means comparing base ticket prices has become almost meaningless.\u201cFrom the consumer\u2019s perspective, this results in increased confusion, and makes it frustratingly difficult to comparison shop or to understand the full cost of travel,\u201d said Patrick Surry, Hopper\u2019s chief data scientist.For example, Spirit offers the lowest base ticket prices of the eight airlines studied by Hopper, with a median fare of $356, but charges the most for baggage ($50 for the first bag, $111 for the second) and for changing flights ($250). Throw in a $35 carry-on fee and, if you\u2019re a traveler with two checked bags who has changed your flight, you could be paying more than twice the cost of your base fare.But there\u2019s more you can do to keep your flight costs closer to what you thought you were paying in the first place. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the most common and costly fees.The change fee is not only the most costly but also the most difficult to avoid. And don\u2019t even think about canceling.The Hopper study (which excludes data from Southwest and Delta) found that a nonrefundable, domestic reservation in the main cabin is usually changeable, for a price. For example, United charges an average of $200 to change a domestic flight, while Virgin America\u2019s fee is $125, which is the lowest of the airlines studied. The fee varies among the budget airlines as well, with Frontier charging $198 and Spirit $250.\u201cThe higher the change fee on a nonrefundable airfare, the greater the incentive for some travelers to simply buy a more expensive refundable airfare,\u201d Mr. Hobica said.If you\u2019re prone to changing plans, try to book with Southwest, which is the only major domestic airline that does not charge for canceling or changing your flight. Alaska Airlines will also let it slide if you do so within 60 days (otherwise it\u2019s $125).Do not expect to see these fees get cheaper or go away anytime soon, unless airlines take away the option of changing a flight altogether.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see change fees go to $250, or for changes and cancellations to be eliminated entirely, as the airlines have done with their \u2018basic economy\u2019 airfares,\u201d Mr. Hobica said.It\u2019s hard for me to remember a time when I did not expect to pay extra for baggage. But if you go back about 10 years, there were none.Standard baggage fees for domestic flights have remained steady for several years now at $25 (Spirit and Frontier charge more), but airlines pick up the slack with their charges for overweight bags, which have crept up over the years, Mr. Hobica said.Once again, Southwest is the no-fee winner, not charging for checked bags (with some size and weight restrictions). You won\u2019t see much budging on this from other airlines (except on international flights).\u201cAnother recent trend is more carriers are starting to charge for carry-on luggage,\u201d Mr. Surry said. Spirit and Frontier already charge for a carry-on.\u201cThe Big Three domestic airlines are following a similar model with their basic fares, where carry-on luggage may not be permitted unless you\u2019re willing to pay extra,\u201d Mr. Hobica said, referring to United, Delta and American.In general, learning to pack well is your best chance to reduce baggage fees; weighing your luggage before leaving home will help make sure there are not any surprises at check-in.And now we come full circle to the $12 blanket.\u201cThe most important step in reducing your total cost is to plan carefully for what additional services you\u2019ll use when you travel, and pay attention to what those add-ons will cost if they\u2019re not included in the base price,\u201d Mr. Surry said.Most airline websites list these fees, which vary by airline, fare and flight, so do your homework.Bringing your own tablet with pre-downloaded content (don\u2019t forget the earbuds, for which many airlines also charge) is now a no-brainer; you\u2019ll avoid charges for what you watch. Many airlines allow access to free entertainment options via apps that you download in advance. You will also avoid any potential rental charges for tablets; domestic airlines charge between $8 and $15 depending on the length of flight.Other common-sense approaches for saving money include eating at the airport or bringing a sandwich onboard. And don\u2019t forget to dress appropriately; nobody wants to pay $12 for a blanket.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Calling Nafta \u2018Worst Trade Deal,\u2019 Trump Appears to Soften Stance", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, who has called the North American Free Trade Agreement \u201cthe worst trade deal\u201d ever signed by the United States, appears to have backed off his threat to abandon the deal and is instead proposing keeping major planks in place when he begins renegotiating it later this year.But Mr. Trump, eager to showcase his tough stance against unfair trade practices, plans to sign two executive orders on Friday that will lay the groundwork for new policies and stricter enforcement of trade laws.The president will order a 90-day study of abusive trade practices that contribute to the United States\u2019 trade deficit. The Commerce Department and the United States trade representative will do a country-by-country, product-by-product accounting of the reasons for the imbalance. A second directive is aimed at increasing the collection of duties from countries whose companies American officials believe are selling products in the United States below their cost of production.Neither measure will have an immediate impact on trade policy or enforcement, but each could eventually lead to aggressive new measures. Both are aimed at showcasing Mr. Trump\u2019s intent to fulfill his promises on trade.\u201cThese actions are designed to let the world know that this is another step in the president fulfilling his campaign promise,\u201d said Wilbur L. Ross, the secretary of commerce. He said the findings would \u201cform the basis for decision-making by the administration\u201d on how to approach trade deficits in the future, including in a renegotiation of Nafta.\u201cFor the first time, we\u2019re looking comprehensively at the source of what has been a large and persistent trade deficit that has contributed to job losses, the loss of our manufacturing base and other things,\u201d said Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Trade Council.The president is poised to give Congress the legally required 90 days\u2019 notice of his intention to renegotiate Nafta, the 1994 pact with Canada and Mexico. In a draft letter circulated among members of Congress this week, the administration proposed adding a provision to allow tariffs to be reinstated if a flood of imports threatens to harm a domestic industry.Mr. Trump also wants to adjust the agreement\u2019s rules of origin, or how much of a product must be made in a Nafta country. And he wants Nafta partners to expand the market for United States-made goods in their government procurement.The Trump administration faces the problem that China\u2019s high trade barriers are allowed by the World Trade Organization, because China entered the group as a developing country and insists it still is one.\u201cThe persistent U.S. deficit in goods trade with Canada and Mexico demands that this administration take swift action to revise the relationship to reflect and respond to 21st-century challenges,\u201d read the letter, signed by Stephen Vaughn, the acting United States trade representative.Mr. Trump has often said that the United States could abandon Nafta altogether if renegotiating it is not possible. But the hawkish rhetoric of the campaign has given way to more measured statements on trade from the administration that track more closely with the stance of many congressional Republicans, who are avid promoters of free trade and deeply skeptical of policies they view as restrictive or protectionist.\u201cIn terms of what we consider to be President Trump\u2019s economic nationalist objectives and what he has said previously about Nafta, the list of negotiating terms was relatively benign,\u201d said Scott S. Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White & Case.American business welcomed the additional specifics on trade policy. \u201cThe details in the letter have whet our appetite for more,\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a former Mexican trade official, said the letter suggested a softening in tone but also contained several proposals that were likely to prompt a strong response from the Mexican government.\u201cThere are some specific problems,\u201d said Mr. Ortiz-Mena, now a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington. \u201cBut in terms of the language used during the campaign and at the beginning of the administration, it\u2019s not as far-reaching as some people could have expected.\u201dThe assessment that the actual policies of the United States might not end up being as harsh as those espoused by Mr. Trump during the campaign is reflected in the confidence in the Mexican peso. Measured against a basket of currencies, it has gained about 17.5 percent in value since the inauguration, more than any other major currency. On Thursday, it traded at 18.72 pesos to the dollar, approaching the levels it held before Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.The Canadian government declined on Thursday to comment directly on the draft letter, because Nafta negotiations have not begun. \u201cShould notice of intent to renegotiate be given, Canada is prepared to discuss improvements at the appropriate time,\u201d said Global Affairs Canada, the country\u2019s foreign ministry.Among Canadian trade experts, the proposals were met with relief, but the suspense has not ended. While the draft letter did not completely dismiss Nafta, it outlined American priorities that could threaten Canadian industries. \u201cIt\u2019s not ripping up Nafta, but there are a bunch of sticks of dynamite contained in those pages,\u201d said Mark Warner, a Canadian-American trade lawyer based in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a messy, hard-slogging negotiation.\u201dThe letter calls for expanding market access among the three countries and eliminating licensing and permit barriers that tend to stall commerce. It also calls for maintaining \u201creciprocal access\u201d for textile and apparel products.It made no mention of currency policy, an issue many trade experts had thought might be on the table.The administration did give itself room to get tougher. The proposal for reinstating tariffs, often referred to as a snapback, was billed as a \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d to protect domestic industries. The draft also suggested efforts to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d on tax treatment. Such measures could bring objections from Canada and Mexico.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers have argued that Mexico uses its value-added tax as a tariff that puts the United States at a disadvantage. The president has called for a tax on companies that move their operations to Mexico and try to sell products in the United States. Republicans in Congress are considering a \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d that would make imports more expensive.Automakers and car dealers have expressed concerns that changes to Nafta could disrupt the strong vehicle market in the United States. General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler operate plants in Mexico that supply models popular with American consumers, such as pickup trucks. Their assembly plants in the United States also rely on a steady flow of parts made by Mexican suppliers.The industry, including dealers, is particularly worried that Mr. Trump will follow through on the border tax on vehicles imported from Mexico.The 90-day window gives members of Congress and industry players time to weigh in before the Trump administration opens the negotiations.\u201cThere is much to like about it,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said of the draft letter. \u201cThere are areas where we are going to make suggestions.\u201dBill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit, Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City, and Jeff Sommer, Nelson D. Schwartz and Dan Levin from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let Bannon Be Bannon!", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byI continue to worry about Steve Bannon. I see him in the White House photos, but he never has that sprightly Prince of Darkness gleam in his eye anymore.His governing philosophy is being completely gutted by the mice around him. He seems to have a big influence on Trump speeches but zero influence on recent Trump policies. I\u2019m beginning to fear that he\u2019s spending his days sitting along the wall in the Roosevelt Room morosely playing one of those Risk-style global empire video games on his smartphone.Back in the good old days \u2014 like two months ago \u2014 it was fun to watch Bannon operate. He was the guy with a coherent governing philosophy. He seemed to have realized that the two major party establishments had abandoned the working class. He also seemed to have realized that the 21st-century political debate is not big versus small government, it\u2019s open versus closed.Bannon had the opportunity to realign American politics around the social, cultural and economic concerns of the working class. Erect barriers to keep out aliens from abroad, and shift money from the rich to the working class to create economic security at home.It was easy to see the Trump agenda that would flow from this philosophy: Close off trade and immigration. Fund a jobs-creating infrastructure program. Reverse the Republican desire to reform and reduce entitlements. Increase funding on all sorts of programs that benefit working-class voters in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Many of us wouldn\u2019t have liked that agenda \u2014 the trade and immigration parts \u2014 but at least it would have helped the people who are being pummeled by this economy.But Bannonesque populism is being abandoned. The infrastructure and jobs plan is being put off until next year (which is to say never). Meanwhile, the Trump administration has agreed with Paul Ryan\u2019s crazy plan to do health care first.Moths show greater resistance to flame than American politicians do to health care reform. And sure enough it\u2019s become a poisonous morass for the entire party, and a complete distraction from the populist project.Worse, the Ryan health care plan punishes the very people Trump and Bannon had vowed to help. It would raise premiums by as much as 25 percent on people between 50 and 64, one core of the Trump voter base. It would completely hammer working-class voters whose incomes put them just above the Medicaid threshold.The Trump budget is an even more devastating assault on Bannon-style populism. It eliminates or cuts organizations like the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative that are important to people from Tennessee and West Virginia up through Ohio and Michigan. It cuts job-training and road-building programs. It does almost nothing to help expand opportunity for the working class and almost everything to serve defense contractors and the national security state.Why is Bannonism being abandoned? One possibility is that there just aren\u2019t enough Trumpians in the world to staff an administration, so Trump and Bannon have filled their apparatus with old guard Republicans who continue to go about their jobs in old guard pseudo-libertarian ways.The third possibility is that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t really care about domestic policy; he mostly cares about testosterone.He wants to cut any part of government that may seem soft and nurturing, like poverty programs. He wants to cut any program that might seem emotional and airy-fairy, like the National Endowment for the Arts. He wants to cut any program that might seem smart and nerdy, like the National Institutes of Health.But he wants to increase funding for every program that seems manly, hard, muscular and ripped, like the military and armed antiterrorism programs.Indeed, the Trump budget looks less like a political philosophy and more like a sexual fantasy. It lavishes attention on every aspect of hard power and slashes away at anything that isn\u2019t.The Trump health care and budget plans will be harsh on the poor, which we expected. But they\u2019ll also be harsh on the working class, which we didn\u2019t.We\u2019re ending up with the worst of the new guard Trumpian populists and the old guard Republican libertarians. We\u2019re building walls to close off the world while also shifting wealth from the poor to the rich.When these two plans fail, which seems very likely, there\u2019s going to be a holy war between the White House and Capitol Hill. I don\u2019t have high hopes for what\u2019s going to emerge from that war, but it would be nice if the people who voted for Trump got economic support, not punishment.For that, there\u2019s one immediate recipe: Unleash Steve Bannon!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coal Country Is a State of Mind", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byBut that simple story breaks down when you look at the realities of the situation \u2014 and not just because environmentalism is a minor factor in coal\u2019s decline. For coal country isn\u2019t really coal country anymore, and hasn\u2019t been for a long time.Why does an industry that is no longer a major employer even in West Virginia retain such a hold on the region\u2019s imagination, and lead its residents to vote overwhelmingly against their own interests?So coal-mining jobs have been disappearing for a long time. Even in West Virginia, the most coal-oriented state, it has been a quarter century since they accounted for as much as 5 percent of total employment.What, then, do West Virginians actually do for a living these days? Well, many of them work in health care: Almost one in six workers is employed in the category \u201chealth care and social assistance.\u201dOh, and where does the money for those health care jobs come from? Actually, a lot of it comes from Washington.It\u2019s true that the nation as a whole pays for these health care programs with taxes. But an older, poorer state like West Virginia receives much more than it pays in \u2014 and it would have received virtually none of the tax cuts Trumpcare would have lavished on the wealthy.Now think about what Trumpism means for a state like this. Killing environmental rules might bring back a few mining jobs, but not many, and mining isn\u2019t really central to the economy in any case. Meanwhile, the Trump administration and its allies just tried to replace the Affordable Care Act. If they had succeeded, the effect would have been catastrophic for West Virginia, slashing Medicaid and sending insurance premiums for lower-income, older residents soaring.Also, don\u2019t forget that Paul Ryan has long pushed for the conversion of Medicare into an underfunded voucher scheme, which would be another body blow to retiree-heavy states.And aside from the devastating effect on coverage, think about how the Republican assault on Obamacare would have affected the health sector that now employs so many West Virginians. It\u2019s almost certain that the job losses from Trumpcare cuts would have greatly exceeded any possible gains in coal.So West Virginia voted overwhelmingly against its own interests. And it wasn\u2019t just because its citizens failed to understand the numbers, the reality of the trade-off between coal and health care jobs.For the striking thing, as I said, is that coal isn\u2019t even the state\u2019s dominant industry these days. \u201cCoal country\u201d residents weren\u2019t voting to preserve what they have, or had until recently; they were voting on behalf of a story their region tells about itself, a story that hasn\u2019t been true for a generation or more.Their Trump votes weren\u2019t even about the region\u2019s interests; they were about cultural symbolism.Now, regional cultures that invoke a long-gone past are hardly unique to Appalachia; think of Texans wearing 10-gallon hats and cowboy boots as they stroll through air-conditioned malls. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that!But when it comes to energy and environmental policy, we\u2019re not talking about mere cultural affectations. Going backward on the environment will sicken and kill thousands in the near future; over the longer term, failing to act on climate change could, all too plausibly, lead to civilizational collapse.So it\u2019s incredible, and terrifying, to think that we may really be about to do all of that because Donald Trump successfully pandered to cultural nostalgia, to a longing for a vanished past when men were men and miners dug deep.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art Basel Hong Kong: Where Commerce and Creativity Meet", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s hard to imagine a place more hard-wired for commerce than Hong Kong. The territory has a history steeped in trade, from its ceding to the British at the end of the First Opium War to its return to Chinese control in 1997 with a special economic and political status engineered to further economic development.Buying and selling made the territory what it is.So as the latest Art Basel Hong Kong opens tomorrow at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, featuring more than 240 galleries that are exhibiting through Saturday, the stage is set for collectors to be efficiently paired with artworks to take home and hang on the wall \u2014 or, given the size of many installations, placed in a garden, a public park or a private museum.\u201cWe\u2019re not invincible,\u201d said Adeline Ooi, the Asia director for Art Basel and its day-to-day chief. \u201cWe\u2019re affected by everything that happens, and we are living in uncertain times.\u201dBut that uncertainty hasn\u2019t affected galleries\u2019 eagerness to come and show their wares.This year there is a new sector called Kabinett, which is a feature of the Miami Beach fair. The 19 participating dealers in this sector essentially put on focused mini-shows within their booths, many with a historical angle.\u201cWe always want to enrich the content, and this allows galleries to switch up their timelines,\u201d Ms. Ooi said. \u201cA lot of the material otherwise is quite contemporary.\u201d\u201cFrom the Asian collector standpoint, these predate his more famous works, and we haven\u2019t had access to this earlier material,\u201d Ms. Ooi said of the sculptures.Pace has branches in Beijing and Hong Kong. \u201cWe came in not as a colonialist gallery but to support the market by showing Asian art, mostly Chinese,\u201d said Arne Glimcher, the gallery\u2019s founder.Ben Brown, who was born in Hong Kong and runs galleries there and in London, will be showing works by Lucio Fontana and Heinz Mack at the fair, as well as eight works by the German photographer Candida H\u00f6fer, as part of Kabinett.Mr. Brown, whose family still lives in Hong Kong, said that while the city had earned its prominence as a business center, it still had a long way to go as a place to see art when the fair wasn\u2019t in town. \u201cIt\u2019s not yet on the scale of London, New York and cities in Germany, and that\u2019s just wrong, given its size, wealth and sophistication,\u201d he said.But there are positive signs for Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as a creative hub. In particular, the fruits of long-planned government funding are coming into view.Even skeptics like Mr. Glimcher, who said he thought Beijing had a stronger local art scene than Hong Kong, are encouraged. \u201cM+ is going to be the major game changer,\u201d he said.Mr. Brown agreed that the opening of the M+ center would be a huge step. (It should be noted that his mother, Rosamond Brown, is a philanthropist who helped organize an acquisition fund for M+.)Even before the Herzog & de Meuron building is completed, M+ is putting on exhibitions in a small temporary space, the M+ Pavilion. \u201cAmbiguously Yours: Gender in Hong Kong Popular Culture,\u201d which focuses on the culturally fertile decades of the 1980s and 1990s, runs through May 21.\u201cWe wanted a topic that was relevant but not too academic,\u201d said Tina Pang, a curator at M+. \u201cGender ambiguity and fluidity is well reflected by many artists at that time.\u201dDoryun Chong, the deputy director and chief curator of M+, said that although the government had put enormous resources behind M+ and the whole district, there was work to be done to get support from private sources.\u201cIt\u2019s a large chunk of money,\u201d Mr. Chong said, adding that M+ is different from some government-run museums in that it has to seek multiple sources of support. \u201cWe will have to fund-raise.\u201dBut even without the presence of his organization, he said, the local art scene is strong. \u201cIt\u2019s a widespread misperception that Hong Kong is a cultural desert,\u201d he said.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have reached the level of clout and sophistication we have if it had only been driven by the market,\u201d said Cosmin Costinas, the executive director of Para Site, which operates kunsthalle style, without a permanent collection.

The piece involves images projected inside two tram cars.It all comes back to commerce, and given the prices of many of the works on view at Art Basel, the true audience for the fair is not the thousands of casual visitors, but a small cadre of collectors who aren\u2019t significantly affected by downward shifts in the economy.\u201cA gallery\u2019s business is often concentrated in just a couple of dozen people,\u201d Mr. Spiegler said.And if all goes well, some of them will be on hand at the convention center this week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Kwong, Authority on Chinese Immigration, Dies at 75", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byPeter Kwong, who came to the United States to be trained as an engineer but became instead an authoritative scholar on America\u2019s Chinatowns and Chinese immigration, died on March 17 in Manhattan. He was 75.The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Dusanka Miscevic, a China scholar and his closest survivor, said.His career spanned the 1965 immigration act, which reversed four decades of virtual exclusion of Asians, and the more recent gentrification of Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown. He charted the spread of ethnic Chinese newcomers to satellite enclaves in other boroughs and the suburbs; the linguistic ascent of Mandarin over Cantonese; and, in New York City, the ultimate validation of an ethnic group\u2019s rise: the designation of Lunar New Year as a holiday, when public schools are closed and alternate-side parking rules are suspended.Along the way, as Joseph P. Viteritti, the chairman of Hunter\u2019s Urban Policy and Planning Department, wrote in an email, Professor Kwong \u201cchallenged the notion that Asians are a model minority, revealing in his research widespread class divisions, poverty, exploitation, drug abuse and organized crime \u2014 all of which were exacerbated by decades of discrimination by a majority white society.\u201dIn that book, Professor Kwong described Chinatown\u2019s economy as being \u201cdivided into a small elite who own large enterprises and a working class who are exploited.\u201d The neighborhood, he wrote, was a place where \u201cthe labor conditions are totally outside of American standards.\u201dHis other books include \u201cChinatown, New York: Labor and Politics, 1930-1950\u201d (1979) and \u201cForbidden Workers: Illegal Chinese Immigrants and American Labor\u201d (1998). With Ms. Miscevic, he wrote \u201cChinese Americans: An Immigrant Experience\u201d (2000) and \u201cChinese America: The Untold Story of America\u2019s Oldest Community\u201d (2005).Professor Kwong was also a producer of the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201cChina\u2019s Unnatural Disaster: The Tears of Sichuan Province,\u201d which depicted the Chinese government\u2019s inept response to a catastrophic earthquake in 2008 that killed tens of thousands of people. The film was broadcast on HBO in 2009.As a journalist, he reported for many newspapers and magazines, including The Village Voice. One article in The Voice, written with his wife in 1990, examined Chinese drug cartels; another was an essay he wrote in 1992 on race riots in Los Angeles.At the time of his death, he and Ms. Miscevic were completing a history of Chinese immigration in the Western United States, and he had begun an autobiography.Peter Chi-Choong Kwong was born on Nov. 13, 1941, in Chungking, China, to Edward Yao-kun Kwong, a university professor and writer, and Susan Su-chuen Ho, who was schooled as a nurse.He earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1965 in math and physics from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from Columbia. Friends said he never practiced as an engineer, having given up the discipline as he became more involved in social issues.At Columbia, he also earned a certificate in Asian studies from the East Asian Institute, a master\u2019s from the School of International Affairs and a doctorate. Over the years, he held a number of visiting professorships. In China, he taught at Fudan University, the People\u2019s University of China and the City University of Hong Kong; in the United States, at the University of California, in both Los Angeles and Berkeley, and at Columbia, Yale, Oberlin College and Princeton.Professor Kwong became an expert on the history of Chinese immigration to the United States since the mid-19th century and its evolution.In the half-century since then, he said, immigrants scattered as jobs became less concentrated. Few enclaves proved as durable as Chinatown in Lower Manhattan.He added, \u201cLike many other old immigrant communities, the space will still be there, but the essence will be gone.\u201dAlthough more Chinese immigrants now live in Brooklyn and Queens, Chinatown in Manhattan has endured longer, in part, he said in the NPR interview, because it joined adjacent neighborhoods to resist gentrification.\u201cWe are basically the very last stand,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Budget Expands the G.O.P.\u2019s War on Math", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSpending cuts alone do not a fiscal conservative make. Remember that as President Trump claims to be one, bigly, based on the deep cuts he\u2019s proposed in just about everything the government does other than defending the nation and distributing Social Security and Medicare checks.Trumpism would just take fiscal irresponsibility to a new level. Like \u201cRyan Republicans\u201d \u2014 defined for nearly a decade by the budget plans of Representative Paul D. Ryan, now House speaker \u2014 Mr. Trump is promising multitrillion-dollar tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent. Unlike Ryan Republicans, Mr. Trump says there will be no compensating reductions in Social Security and Medicare, the entitlement programs that are \u2014 along with insufficient revenues \u2014 driving projections of unsustainable federal debt as the population ages and claims benefits. (The president used to say Medicaid was off-limits, too, until the Republican health care proposal took aim at the program for the poor and disabled.)Mr. Trump is bound to fail to get cuts as deep as he wants. After years of trying to limit deficits by carving up the same slice of the budget pie for spending, such big whacks will be politically unpalatable even for Republicans in Congress. Already that spending portion is the smallest it has been since the government began keeping track 55 years ago, during the Kennedy administration. And as Maya MacGuineas, president of the fiscally conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, noted, the portion \u201cis projected to grow more slowly than inflation\u201d going forward.True fiscal conservatives would know: Not only is this type of spending not the cause of rising federal debt, but also much of it is what long was called the nation\u2019s \u201cseed corn\u201d \u2014 money for investments in public works, science, medical research, a skilled work force and other purposes crucial to future prosperity.Yet Republicans quit being true fiscal conservatives long ago. Thomas E. Mann, a scholar of governance at the Brookings Institution, goes back to the Reagan era, when cutting taxes began to take precedence over cutting deficits. \u201cThe driving objective was to cut taxes, which is easier to accomplish than cutting spending, and after a while Republicans came to believe Dick Cheney\u2019s line that \u2018deficits don\u2019t matter,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cAnd someone who\u2019s fiscally conservative wouldn\u2019t make the indiscriminate slashes in the very small discretionary domestic budget. Conservatives look to conserve, to be prudent and look to the needs of the country.\u201dBut George W. Bush disowned his father\u2019s fiscal legacy: His Republican rival in 2000, Senator John McCain, often said that Mr. Bush could not keep both of his big promises \u2014 tax cuts and a new Medicare prescription drug benefit \u2014 without reopening huge deficits. As president, Mr. Bush did get both from a compliant Congress, and Mr. McCain was right: Republicans did not even try to pay for the Medicare benefit. In contrast, when Democrats recaptured Congress in 2006, they revived pay-go rules, and the next big expansion social program, Obamacare, was fully paid for, by tax increases and spending curbs.Having condemned deficits under President Barack Obama, forcing him to accept spending cuts even as economists urged more stimulus spending to spur the sluggish recovery, Republicans now are open to borrowing for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, border wall and infrastructure plans. Under Mr. Obama, they shut down the government and repeatedly risked the nation\u2019s credit standing by opposing essential increases in the federal debt limit.They were egged on by Citizen Trump. Now he is President Trump. A deadline for another government-funding bill looms in April, and the debt limit must be raised months later. But already he has flunked the tests of fiscal conservatism.Jackie Calmes is a former national correspondent in The New York Times Washington bureau.Advertisement"}

What were your early years like?He\u2019s a surgeon, and when he came to this country, black surgeons were not granted admittance privileges at hospitals. So you needed to find another doctor who had admittance privileges, and ask them to admit your patients for you. And for that privilege, you would pay them.He got to know a doctor of Jewish heritage who said to him: \u201cI understand oppression. I\u2019m going to admit your patients for you, and I\u2019m not going to charge you.\u201d They were in Kansas City at the time, and later the doctor said: \u201cI\u2019m moving to Delaware. If you want to follow me to Delaware, I\u2019ll continue to do this for you.\u201d So that\u2019s how we ended up in Delaware.My mom is from Texas, so we had kind of a blended home. When our extended families would get together, it was about building bridges across language and cultural differences.How did that influence your leadership style?The Haitian side of the family was very vocal, and dinner conversations were important. I remember being a child and looking at my aunts and uncles and asking them why they were always arguing.What I realized was that they were very engaged in discussions about the economy or about what was going on in different countries. I was witnessing the best part of \u201cbenevolent friction\u201d \u2014 to be hard on ideas but soft on people \u2014 because there was a lot of love and hope about the future.When my father came to this country \u2014 remember, this was pre-civil rights \u2014 people would say to him, \u201cWhy did you choose the United States?\u201d And he said, with unwavering confidence: \u201cI read about Bobby Kennedy. I listened to Martin Luther King. I knew that America was on the ascendancy. I knew that with a great education, with the support of my family, I could make a life for myself and my family.\u201dThat really resonated with me because it meant that despite the challenges, there were always ways to win. So if you try a tactic and you\u2019re thwarted by external factors, you can try another pathway.Retreating and trying another pathway doesn\u2019t mean defeat. It just means you\u2019re not going to succeed in that lane right now. So maybe you go back to that lane when you have more education or more experience or more leverage and you try again. Tell me more about \u201cbenevolent friction.\u201dIn a start-up, you don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring, so you have to be constantly learning and be adaptive with your colleagues. You might think you have a role to play, but you have to listen and be responsive to your colleagues in order for the team to really win.In the beginning, some people didn\u2019t like it when I used that phrase because they felt that friction is a negative thing, and they didn\u2019t want to have any friction with their colleagues.I would explain that if you don\u2019t have pressure on the carbon, you never get to the diamond. You can still be very respectful, and assume everybody has a spark, but we have to subject our ideas to the toughest scrutiny because our work is important.Other leadership lessons for you?Early in my career, as a woman of color in financial services, the expectations for excellence were either really high \u2014 so it\u2019s hard to live up to them \u2014 or really low, with people assuming I was here because of affirmative action. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re just you.So you have to work really hard to demonstrate to people that you have intellectual capabilities and that you\u2019re a valued addition to the team. You have a spark. If you\u2019re given the mask of being extraordinary, then you spend a lot of time trying to convince people that even when someone manifests as extraordinary, they have foibles like everybody else. There\u2019s pressure with that.So you try to create your own mask, but it\u2019s still a mask and it\u2019s still limiting. Ultimately, you have to define success for yourself.How do you hire?I look for that spark. I invite them to tell me their story and how our company fits into that story. You learn a lot when people tell you their story: what they care about, their integrity, their passions and the choices and sacrifices that they make. When you overlay the technical capabilities on top of that, you have a pretty good sense of someone.I also look for what I call \u201cnimble intelligence\u201d \u2014 people who can take in information, harness collective wisdom and make good judgments. They can adapt and pivot, and they\u2019re always in motion.And how do you get at that quality?I ask people about situations they\u2019ve faced when they were caught off guard and what they did about it. I ask them about a situation where they felt totally ill equipped to succeed and what they did.I also ask people about job transitions. What was lacking in the job you had that made you start looking? And when you landed in the new role, did you find what you wanted?And if you found it, was it something that was waiting for you on a platter or was it something that you had to manufacture for yourself? What did you learn from that?What career and life advice do you give to new college grads?I made the mistake early in my career of going into a field I didn\u2019t have passion for. It doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t good at it, but it didn\u2019t inflame my passion. The advice I give people is to spend time really understanding what you care about, and what you\u2019re willing to do with joy even when it\u2019s really hard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As E.C.B. Charts Economic Course, Politics Complicate the Picture", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Central bankers like to portray themselves as being aloof from the hurly-burly of politics, coolly assessing the economic data as they ponder whether to add a jolt of stimulus or take some away.But with populism on the rise in Europe and elsewhere, opinion polls have arguably become one of the European Central Bank\u2019s most important sources of data points.Faced with a series of national elections in which anti-euro candidates play prominent roles, Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, mounted a spirited counteroffensive on Thursday. He portrayed the currency as the key to European prosperity and even took an implicit jab at the protectionist rhetoric of President Trump.\u201cOpen trade has been the pillar of world prosperity for many, many years,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Although it made no major changes to monetary policy on Thursday, the bank is under increasing pressure to begin withdrawing the stimulus program that has prevailed for a decade. That task, delicate in the best of times, is even more difficult in the charged political atmosphere that permeates not only Europe but also the United States and the rest of the world.Some political candidates are questioning the whole idea of a united Europe and the European Central Bank\u2019s fundamental reason for being. The situation raises the stakes whenever the bank makes a decision.A wrong move by the European Central Bank could upset a fragile economic recovery and provide fodder for the populists.While insisting that the central bank\u2019s job is to keep inflation under control, Mr. Draghi was unusually direct on Thursday in rebutting opposition to European free trade and political unity.\u201cIf we go back to when the euro was created, there were always people who said it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s a mistake, it can\u2019t be done,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThey are saying the same today.\u201dEurozone members have made \u201cextraordinary shows of solidarity\u201d toward countries in crisis, Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThe euro is here to stay.\u201dNo matter what Mr. Draghi does, he will continue to draw strong reactions. As one of Europe\u2019s most powerful institutions, the central bank serves as an all-purpose pi\u00f1ata for nationalist politicians of all stripes.Frauke Petry, leader of the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, regularly accuses Mr. Draghi of endangering Germans\u2019 savings with ultralow interest rates.In Italy, where low interest rates have helped ease a severe credit crunch, sentiment runs the opposite direction. When the European Central Bank does begin gradually reducing its stimulus efforts, perhaps around the middle of the year, expect leaders of the populist Five Star Movement in Italy to accuse Mr. Draghi of selling out to the Germans.The prospect that Ms. Le Pen could become president of France has pushed up the government\u2019s borrowing costs. The higher rates feed through to the economy and work against central bank measures intended to make sure credit remains cheap.The political landscape in Washington is also a concern for the European Central Bank. The United States is the European Union\u2019s largest trading partner. If Mr. Trump erects trade barriers, as he has threatened to do, European exporters would suffer along with the region\u2019s economy.Mr. Draghi will have his first direct contact with the new American administration next week at a summit meeting in Germany of central bank governors and finance ministers. He declined to say on Thursday what message he planned to deliver.A further complication for the European Central Bank is that its policies are out of sync with those of the Federal Reserve. Fed officials have signaled that an interest-rate increase is likely next week. That could be a problem for the European Central Bank, if higher market interest rates in the United States spill over to the eurozone and undermine efforts to keep borrowing costs low.Analysts say they expect the European Central Bank to give a clearer view of its intentions around June, probably by signaling a reduction in purchases of government and corporate bonds, a way of pumping money into the economy.An increase in official interest rates may be years away. On Thursday, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rates unchanged, and it said it would continue the stimulus measure of buying government and corporate bonds through the end of the year, albeit at a reduced level starting in April.However, in a statement, the central bank was less alarmist about the eurozone outlook than in the past. Mr. Draghi said the bank would not extend an emergency lending program for commercial banks because there was no need. \u201cThere is no longer that urgency in taking further actions,\u201d he added.It will be nearly impossible to time the easing of the stimulus in a way that does not open the European bank to criticism. The economies of the eurozone are also badly out of step with one another. Unemployment in Italy, at 11.9 percent, is three times as high as Germany\u2019s.The European Central Bank has already been drawn into Italian politics. The central bank, which regulates commercial lenders in the eurozone, has endorsed a rescue plan for troubled Italian banks that critics in Germany say violates European rules.In Germany, by contrast, there are complaints that the European Central Bank\u2019s low interest rates penalize middle-class savers, who earn almost no return on their nest eggs. The resentment has grown recently because of an increase in inflation. Consumer prices in Germany rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in January, above the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just under 2 percent.The inflation rate for the eurozone as a whole was 2 percent in February. But the increase was almost entirely because of food and fuel prices, which frequently fluctuate. The European Central Bank will probably not react until there is evidence that prices in other categories, like services, are also rising.That may be too late for some in Germany.\u201cIt is time for the European Central Bank to start phasing out its expansionary monetary policy in Europe,\u201d Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an influential research organization in Munich, said on Thursday in a statement. \u201cIt should now take its foot off the gas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans for Single-Payer Health Care", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byWithout a viable health care agenda of their own, Republicans now face a choice between two options: Obamacare and a gradual shift toward a single-payer system. The early signs suggest they will choose single payer.That would be the height of political irony, of course. Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Tom Price may succeed where left-wing dreamers have long failed and move the country toward socialized medicine. And they would do it unwittingly, by undermining the most conservative health care system that Americans are willing to accept.Let me take a step back to explain how we got here and how the politics of health care will most likely play out after last week\u2019s Republican crackup.Trump seemed to understand this during the campaign and came out in favor of universal coverage. Once elected, though, he reversed himself. He turned over health care to Price, a surgeon and Georgia congressman with an amazing record, and not in a good way.Obamacare increased coverage in two main ways. The more liberal way expanded a government program, Medicaid, to cover the near-poor. The more conservative way created private insurance markets where middle-class and affluent people could buy subsidized coverage.Now, think about the political message this would send to Democrats: It\u2019s not worth expanding health coverage in a conservative-friendly way, because Republican leaders won\u2019t support it anyway.Politics aside, private markets in many areas of the economy have substantive advantages over a government program. They create competition, which leads to innovation and lower prices. But private markets in medical care tend to be more complicated and less successful.So if voters like government-provided health care and Republicans are going to undermine private markets, what should Democrats do? When they are next in charge, they should expand government health care.They should expand Medicaid further into the working class. They should open Medicare to people in their early 60s. They should add a so-called public option to the private markets. They should push the United States closer to single-payer health insurance. It will take time and involve setbacks, but they are likely to succeed in the long run.Until then, the future of socialized medicine is in the hands of Dr. Tom Price.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Trump \u2014 in thrall to those who see all regulations as job-killers \u2014 would ease these rules for an industry that has not only done well under them but that owes the American taxpayer big league for successive bailouts in the Bush and Obama administrations.It\u2019s true that workers in many industries have suffered.

In one episode, his high school disbanded its all-white swimming team rather than let him join it.Those experiences would inform his efforts in three major civil rights cases before the United States Supreme Court.In one, Mr. Coleman, recruited by Thurgood Marshall, was an author of the legal briefs that successfully pressed the court to outlaw segregation in public schools in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.Ten years later, he argued a case that led to a Supreme Court decision establishing the constitutionality of racially mixed sexual relations and cohabitation. And in 1982, he argued that segregated private schools should be barred from receiving federal tax exemptions. The court agreed.Mr. Coleman was appointed transportation secretary by President Gerald R. Ford in March 1975, a little more than six months after Ford, who had been vice president, succeeded President Richard M. Nixon after Nixon\u2019s resignation in the Watergate affair. Mr. Coleman, a corporate lawyer with expertise in transportation issues, was on the Pan Am board of directors at the time.A portly man partial to impeccably tailored suits, he and Ford had become friends in 1964, when Mr. Coleman was an assistant counsel to the Warren Commission during its investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Ford, then a Republican congressman from Michigan, was a commission member.Mr. Coleman oversaw a Transportation Department confronting rapid advances in the aviation industry and increasing demands for public safety on the roads. In May 1976, he authorized a 16-month testing period allowing the Concorde, the needle-nose supersonic British- and French-made commercial jet, to land at Dulles International Airport near Washington and Kennedy International Airport in New York.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had barred Concorde jets from landing at Kennedy, in part because of concerns about sonic booms. But the Supreme Court overturned the ban in October 1977. The jets crisscrossed the Atlantic daily until 2003, when they were taken out of service largely because of a lack of customers willing to pay $12,000 or more for a round-trip ticket.In December 1976, weeks before leaving office, Mr. Coleman announced that the auto industry would conduct a two-year demonstration of the practicality of installing airbags in automobiles. The limited testing was hailed by the industry, but it disappointed consumer groups and the insurance industry, which had urged Mr. Coleman to end seven years of government indecision and order the device on all autos. Airbags became standard equipment only in the early 1990s.His deliberate approach was in part a consequence of the Watergate revelations about White House misdeeds, said Donald T. Bliss, who was acting general counsel to the Transportation Department under Mr. Coleman. His boss, he said in an interview, was concerned about transparency.\u201cIn the post-Watergate time, he wanted to take into account the different interests, whether environmental, technological or economic, and to fully explain a decision to the public,\u201d said Mr. Bliss, who is now president of the United Nations Association for the National Capital Area. \u201cSometimes the way to move forward is to have a demonstration.\u201dIn an economy under stress, Mr. Coleman also had to deal with bankruptcies and consolidations in the railroad industry and with President Ford\u2019s insistence that funds for federal highways be sharply reduced. \u201cHe really did agonize over all these decisions,\u201d Mr. Bliss said.The case, Bob Jones University v. United States, involved tax exemptions that had been granted to Bob Jones, a fundamentalist Protestant institution in Greenville, S.C., and to Goldsboro Christian Schools in Goldsboro, N.C. The plaintiffs argued that their segregation policies were based on biblical injunctions against the mixing of races.Mr. Coleman would have none of it. \u201cTheir argument is that because their racism is religiously based, they have a right to tax benefits denied to all others who cannot defend their policies on religious grounds,\u201d he told the court. \u201cWhen fundamental public policy is violated, a defense of religious belief is not available.\u201dThe court affirmed his position on May 25, 1983, with an 8-1 decision written by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Justice William H. Rehnquist, later the chief justice, was the lone dissenter.Almost 20 years earlier, Mr. Coleman was co-counsel in McLaughlin v. Florida, in which the Supreme Court overturned a Florida law that prohibited an interracial couple from living together under the state\u2019s anti-miscegenation statutes. The couple had been convicted after choosing to live together despite the law.In a unanimous decision on Dec. 7, 1964, Justice Potter Stewart wrote, \u201cIt is simply not possible for a state law to be valid under our Constitution which makes the criminality of an act depend upon the race of the actor.\u201dThree years later, in Loving v. Virginia, the court unanimously declared all race-based legal restrictions on marriage unconstitutional.William Thaddeus Coleman Jr. was born on July 7, 1920, in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, the second of three children of William Sr., the director of a boys club for 40 years, and the former Laura Mason, who had taught German.The family came from six generations of teachers and Episcopal ministers on his mother\u2019s side (one of whom operated the Underground Railroad in St. Louis, helping slaves flee their masters) and many social workers on his father\u2019s side. The civil rights pioneer W.E.B. DuBois and the poet Langston Hughes would go to dinner at the Coleman home.Mr. Coleman attended a segregated elementary school and was one of just seven black students at Germantown High School, one of Philadelphia\u2019s best. In a memoir, \u201cCounsel for the Situation: Shaping the Law to Realize America\u2019s Promise\u201d (2010), Mr. Coleman recalled giving a well-received oral presentation in an English class as a 10th-grade honors student.After Mr. Coleman concluded the presentation, his teacher, who was white, said, \u201cSomeday, William, you will make a wonderful chauffeur.\u201dThe teacher, Mr. Coleman wrote, \u201chad intended to compliment the poised oral presentation\u201d he had made. \u201cYet somehow I didn\u2019t take it that way,\u201d he added. He cursed the teacher and was suspended.He was suspended again when, by his account, he demanded to join the school\u2019s all-white swim team. After the suspension was lifted, he said, the team disbanded rather than admit him. It regrouped after he graduated.Mr. Coleman went on to the University of Pennsylvania (with a strong recommendation from the swim team coach, he said), and graduated summa cum laude with a double major, political science and economics, in 1941.He was accepted into the Harvard School of Law but left in 1943 to enlist in the Army Air Forces, though not before asking himself, as he put it, \u201cwhether it made sense to fight for freedom and liberty in Europe and Asia when racial segregation was still so rampant in the United States.\u201dHe trained in Mississippi with the black aviators who earned fame as the Tuskegee Airmen, though he failed to become a fighter pilot himself. He spent part of his service as a defense team member in court-martial proceedings, and in one case helped defend black airmen who had been arrested for challenging segregation at an officers\u2019 club.Mr. Coleman returned to the law school after military service ended in 1945, was accepted by The Harvard Law Review \u2014 he was one of its first black staff members \u2014 and graduated first in his class in 1946.While on leave from the Army in 1945, he married Lovida Mae Hardin, a New Orleans native he had met when she was studying for a degree in education at Boston University.Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Lovida H. Coleman Jr., a prominent Washington lawyer; two sons, William III, a former general counsel to the Army, and Hardin, a former dean of the School of Education at Boston University; and four grandsons.After the clerkship, Mr. Coleman, seeking to go into private practice, was repeatedly rejected by white-shoe firms in Philadelphia before he was finally accepted by one in New York \u2014 Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. He later returned to Philadelphia to be a partner at Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish & Levy, a major firm there and, at the time, an all-white one. From 1952 to 1963, he also served as Philadelphia\u2019s special counsel on transportation issues.By then he was deeply involved in civil rights issues. In 1951, Thurgood Marshall, who was then chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (he would become the first black justice on the Supreme Court in 1967), asked Mr. Coleman to join the legal team preparing the briefs in Brown v. Board of Education.Those arguments contributed to the court\u2019s unanimous declaration that state laws that established separate schools for black and white students were unconstitutional.Mr. Coleman was named president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in 1971 and was its chairman from 1977 to 1997. He argued 19 cases before the Supreme Court altogether.Mr. Coleman twice turned down offers for federal judgeships, from Presidents Johnson and Nixon. He was co-chairman of the White House Conference on Civil Rights in 1966. In 1995, President Bill Clinton presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.His memoir, \u201cCounsel for the Situation,\u201d was written with Mr. Bliss and had a foreword by Justice Stephen Breyer. In it, Mr. Coleman reflected on his own life and on the American legal system, and paid tribute to the people who had influenced him \u2014 blacks and whites, Republicans and Democrats.\u201cThey shared the strong conviction,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat individual talent, brilliance and effort can and will change the course of history.\u201dAn obituary on April 1 about the lawyer and former transportation secretary William T. Coleman erroneously attributed a distinction to him. He was one of first black members of the Harvard Law Review, not the first. (Charles Hamilton Houston had served on the board in the early 20th century.) The obituary also misstated the year Mr. Coleman graduated from Harvard Law School. It was 1946, not 1947. In addition, the obituary referred imprecisely to Mr. Coleman\u2019s military service in World War II. He joined the Army Air Forces \u2014 not the Army Air Corps, which was a component of the Army Air Forces.William McDonald and Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Leaders See Way Out of Scandal: Amnesty", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The president is accused of running on a ticket that got millions of dollars in illegal donations. One of his closest allies in the Senate is, too. The same goes for some of their bitter enemies in Congress, creating a widening sense of panic across Brazil\u2019s political establishment.Now, with new revelations into illegal campaign donations continuing to drop, lawmakers from across the ideological spectrum in Brazil have come up with a plan.They are scrambling to give themselves amnesty.Politicians who often spend their time jousting with one another are frantically trying to advance legislation this week to shield lawmakers from jail time.\u201cWe have a saying in Brazil: \u2018When the jungle is in flames, the beasts unite,\u2019 \u201d said Gil Castello Branco, the director of Contas Abertas, a watchdog group that tracks political corruption. \u201cWell, the fire has been lit, and all these politicians want to do is save their own skin.\u201dWith dozens of business moguls and politicians already going to jail for corruption, the nation still healing from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment and removal, and the economy trying to make a comeback, the amnesty is needed, they argue, to prevent further upheaval.\u201cNo, we need to salvage politics,\u201d the senator said.The political dread over such testimony is casting attention on a practice known in Brazil as \u201ccaixa dois,\u201d a so-called second cash register of financing that is undeclared to tax authorities. It can be used for political campaigns or receiving bribes, or as a slush fund encompassing a range of illicit activities.Brazilian law allows for fines and jail sentences of up to five years for illegal campaign financing, though in practice few politicians go to prison for such crimes. Even so, with the exception of leaders from relatively small parties, the push for amnesty is uniting influential figures from across the spectrum. (Amnesty is not under discussion for crimes like bribery, embezzlement or money laundering.)Still, others insist that existing campaign laws should remain intact and be fully enforced.\u201cI see what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m not a fool,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Francisco da Silva, 78, a retired painter of automobiles. \u201cOf course they\u2019ll all get amnesty.

{"Headline": "The Case for a Border-Adjusted Tax", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe American corporate tax system is broken. Faced with one of the highest tax rates in the world, many multinational corporations in the United States move their operations and reported profits offshore or undertake \u201cinversions\u201d to relinquish their American tax nationality. Elaborate regulatory and enforcement measures have been unable to stop this. Vilifying companies for their behavior hasn\u2019t worked, either.Fortunately, bipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing in Washington. In place of the old system, Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed adopting a tax \u2014 the destination-based cash-flow tax \u2014 that would be levied on the domestic cash flows of all businesses operating or selling here. (Your domestic cash flow is your revenues in the United States minus the wages, salaries and purchases you pay for in the United States.) This would mean introducing \u201cborder adjustments\u201d to the current system \u2014 exempting exports from tax, but taxing imports.This reform should appeal broadly, to Democrats and Republicans alike. The border adjustments would strongly discourage the shifting of profits and activities offshore and eliminate incentives for corporate inversions. (The proposal would also eliminate incentives for companies to borrow excessively and strengthen the tax benefits for investing in plants and equipment.) But there remains much misplaced criticism of the reform and its potential, and much misunderstanding about who the winners and losers will be if it is adopted.Some critics, including President Trump at one time, have claimed that the new system would be too complicated. On the contrary, the tax would be much simpler than our current arrangement. By basing a company\u2019s tax liability exclusively on its domestic cash flows, the new system would replace the much more complex calculation of a company\u2019s income that takes place now, which must also account for offshore and cross-border transactions. And because the tax would eliminate incentives for companies to shift operations and profits offshore, it could dispose of the raft of complex tax and regulatory measures developed over the years to discourage such tactics.Other critics, particularly those on the political left, have expressed concern that the tax isn\u2019t progressive enough. But it promises to be more progressive than the current United States corporate tax system: Its burdens would fall squarely on the owners of corporate capital rather than \u2014 as happens to some extent now \u2014 on American workers, whose wages suffer from the flight of productive investment capital to lower-tax countries.Importers have also criticized the tax, arguing that the border adjustments would lead to a major redistribution of income away from sectors of the economy based on import shares and toward those based on export shares. This is the biggest misconception about the tax. In truth, importing industries should expect on the whole to experience a shift in the composition of their costs rather than an overall increase in their costs. The reason is that under the new tax system, the dollar should appreciate relative to the currencies of our trading partners (in response to the changing incentives for American firms to export and import). A stronger dollar would make imports cheaper, offsetting the increase in taxes paid.Of course, corporate tax reform would result in winners and losers. But the gains and losses would derive mostly from the increased profitability of American operations and the lost opportunities to avoid paying United States taxes.Free-market critics of the tax have suggested that border adjustments are tariffs and would thus erect trade barriers. This is also untrue. The border adjustments would merely shift taxation from where products are made to where they are sold. This, again, would encourage companies to locate their productive activities and profits in the United States. (Countries around the world use such border adjustments every day as components of value-added taxes that are collected at the location of purchases rather than production.)For the United States corporate tax to be a viable source of revenue, it must be reinvented. Intense tax competition for profits, production and jobs, in the form of other countries\u2019 sharply declining corporate tax rates and a host of favorable tax provisions, has been little hindered by international efforts to slow the process.The United States faces a choice: to mark time as our competitive position worsens, to join this race to the bottom or to take forceful action that replaces our corporate tax system with one that aligns with the national interest. Our decision should be clear. We need to adjust to new ideas like a destination-based cash-flow tax. In the end, the short-run economic adjustments required would be a small price to pay for an enduring, fair and rational tax system.Alan Auerbach is a professor of economics and law at the University of California, Berkeley.

The problem for us is that problem solving or business smartness without ethics, and without respect for human dignity, and without a sensibility toward social justice \u2026 is simply just business.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really hesitant to say the wall has provided an opportunity,\u201d he told me over coffee in Berkeley last week, but he makes the argument that we should view the nearly 700 miles of wall as an opportunity for economic and social development along the border \u2014 while at the same time encouraging its conceptual and physical dismantling.Rael\u2019s proposals play at notions of the wall not just as a purveyor of security, but also as productive infrastructure \u2014 as the very backbone of a borderland economy. In all this work, he says: \u201cWe aren\u2019t proposing walls but urging that something be done alongside them. Something is happening, and we are attempting to intercept it, to smuggle in design so these landscapes won\u2019t be destroyed.\u201dRael writes that one of the most devastating consequences of the wall is \u201cthe division of communities, cities, neighborhoods and families, resulting in the erosion of social infrastructure.\u201d When we talked, he wondered how we might create something positive from something so horrible: \u201cCan reform happen through borderland investment? If you build 150 libraries along the border, you\u2019d get a very different outcome.\u201dJanet Napolitano, the former secretary of Homeland Security and governor of Arizona, once said, \u201cYou show me a 50-foot wall, and I\u2019ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border.\u201d Yet we persist in not only maintaining that wall but expanding it. The border wall is a symbolic and real barrier. It aims to create a neat binary in a complex world. North vs. south. The United States vs. Mexico. Legal vs. illegal. Us vs. them. The polarizing effect is both insidious and intentional. The Trump administration isn\u2019t likely to entertain any proposal that doesn\u2019t reinforce that \u2014 but I\u2019m not entirely convinced that means we shouldn\u2019t try.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trade on the Streets, and Off the Books, Keeps Zimbabwe Afloat", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Dusk falls and thousands of vendors fan out across central Harare. Through the night, they hawk their wares \u2014 vegetables, clothes, kitchen utensils, cellphones \u2014 from carts, wheelbarrows or even the pavement, transforming the city\u2019s staid business district into a giant, freewheeling village market.On Robert Mugabe Road, around the corner from the city\u2019s remaining colonial-era luxury hotel, the Meikles, Victor Chitiyo has sold dress shirts since losing his job as a machine operator at a textile factory several years ago.\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve never been employed,\u201d Mr. Chitiyo, 38, said under the dim light of a street lamp. \u201cIf the economy improves, I\u2019d want to be employed at a company again. But I don\u2019t think that will happen. It\u2019s been a long time since we were optimistic in Zimbabwe.\u201dHarare\u2019s night market is the most visible evidence of Zimbabwe\u2019s swelling informal economy, which the government estimates now employs all but a small share of the country\u2019s work force.Even as Zimbabwe\u2019s government, banks, listed companies and other members of the formal economy lurch from one crisis to another, the thriving informal economy of street vendors, traders and others unrepresented in official statistics helps keep the country afloat. For the government of President Robert Mugabe, that parallel economy is both a source of stability \u2014 and a potential challenge.Once one of Africa\u2019s most advanced economies, Zimbabwe has rapidly deindustrialized and shed formal wage-paying jobs, forcing millions like Mr. Chitiyo to hustle on the streets in cities and towns.Many more people are joining Mr. Chitiyo on Harare\u2019s streets as the formal economy shows few signs of improvement. An acute cash shortage persists despite the introduction of a surrogate currency in November. The government, unable to pay its workers their Christmas bonuses, has offered them land instead. And despite repeated visits to Washington and European capitals, and promises of political and economic reforms, Zimbabwean officials have failed to secure fresh loans from skeptical international lenders.\u201cThe government is moving into an increasingly untenable situation, and they are in desperate need of a bailout in the billions to restore liquidity in the country,\u201d said John Robertson, an independent economist in Harare. \u201cThe formal sector has collapsed. The informal sector is now very much bigger, and it is actually keeping alive a very much higher percentage of the population.\u201dBut the government mostly turns a blind eye, clearly calculating that a permanent crackdown on the livelihoods of an increasing number of its citizens would result in greater political instability. According to an unspoken rule, the street vendors are allowed to operate only after dark on weekdays and starting in late afternoon on weekends.\u201cIf I come too early, the police will take my wares away and I\u2019ll be broke,\u201d said Norest Muza, 28, who sold popcorn and chips while carrying her 2-year-old son on her back. \u201cEvenings, the police don\u2019t come.\u201dMany of the street vendors arrive in Harare\u2019s business district at dusk and spend the night on the streets before going home at dawn with the morning\u2019s first taxis and buses.\u201cHow else can we survive when things are tough for everyone here in Zimbabwe?\u201d asked Tichaona Murwira, 25, who was hawking cellphone chargers, sweets and cigarettes. \u201cI\u2019m a vendor because there is no job for me although I passed my secondary school education.\u201dOn Harare\u2019s outskirts, industrial areas have been gutted. Abandoned factories are now used by the homeless, drug dealers, prostitutes and churches.In Southerton \u2014 the district where Mr. Chitiyo, the street vendor, once worked as a machine operator \u2014 Philda Chinyoka, the pastor at the True Covenant International Ministries, a Pentecostal church, said she had moved her church to the area in 2014.\u201cThe building was just empty,\u201d she said. \u201cI hear it used to be a tissue paper-making company.\u201dInside a nearby abandoned building, with missing doors and broken windows, prostitutes operate day and night.\u201cThe company that used to manufacture net wire here \u2014 I forget its name \u2014 closed shop in 2006,\u201d said Esther Munetsi, 27, who has worked in the building as a prostitute for the last nine years.With manufacturing\u2019s sharp decline, as well as the resulting drop in exports and spike in imports, Zimbabwe suffers from a steep trade imbalance. That imbalance\u2019s effect on the economy is exacerbated by the American dollar, which Zimbabwe adopted in 2009 to combat hyperinflation.With the government now strictly controlling the transfer of dollars outside Zimbabwe, companies dependent on trade are finding it increasingly difficult to import critical goods.At a small auto parts shop in central Harare, called Track Board, Prince Mapira, 23, said American dollars had vanished from the marketplace. Customers now pay only in bond notes, which are recognized only inside Zimbabwe, creating a problem for his business.The auto shop needs American dollars to import parts from South Africa or Japan. So Mr. Mapira takes the bond notes, which are supposed to be the equivalent of the American dollar, to exchange on the black market.\u201cIf you go there with 100 dollars in bond notes, they give you $70 or $80,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not equal on the black market.\u201dAs the formal economy keeps shrinking, more and more people have been crowding the area where Mr. Chitiyo sells shirts on Robert Mugabe Road.Across the street, a girl\u2019s voice was crying, \u201cTwenty-five cents for a cob!\u201d It belonged to Tariro Dongo, 13, on her first evening working as a street vendor. It was past 9 p.m. Tariro said she was good in school and wanted to become a teacher.She had bought 20 corn cobs for $2 near her home in Epworth, a poor township outside Harare. If she sold everything, her profit, after transportation, would amount to a couple of dollars. Sitting on a black bucket and fanning the coals in a small charcoal burner with a piece of cardboard, Tariro roasted the cobs.She was happy with the money she had made on her first day, Tariro said.\u201cTwenty-five cents,\u201d she cried. \u201cOne cob left!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Solar Big Enough to Matter", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe widespread view that solar power is a hopelessly subsidized business is quickly growing outdated. In some particularly sunny spots, such as certain parts of the Middle East, solar power now is beating fossil-fueled electricity on price without subsidies.The market is concluding that solar makes sense. In part that\u2019s because of technological advances that have made solar cells more efficient in converting sunlight into power. In part it\u2019s the result of manufacturing scale, which has slashed the cost of solar-panel production. And, in places that tax greenhouse-gas emissions, it\u2019s in part because solar produces carbon-free power.But much more needs to be done. Ratcheting up solar to produce approximately 1 percent of global electricity has required a lot of technology and investment. Making solar big enough to matter environmentally would be an even more colossal undertaking. It would require plastering the ground and roofs with billions of solar panels. It would require significantly increasing energy storage, because solar panels crank out electricity only when the sun shines, which is why, today, solar often needs to be backed up by fossil fuels. And it would require adding more transmission lines, because often the places where the sun shines best aren\u2019t where most people live.In the mid-2000s, stimulated by hefty solar subsidies in Europe, a handful of entrepreneurs in China started producing inexpensive solar panels, much as had been done in China before with T-shirts and televisions. These entrepreneurs bought equipment from manufacturers in Europe and the United States, built big factories with government subsidies, and got down to business cranking out millions of solar panels for export.Today, China utterly dominates global solar-panel manufacturing. Last year, according to the consulting firm IHS Markit, China accounted for 70 percent of global capacity for manufacturing crystalline-silicon solar panels, the most common type. The United States share was 1 percent.But now, China\u2019s solar industry is changing in little-noticed ways that create both an imperative and an opportunity for the United States to up its game. The Chinese industry is innovating technologically \u2014 indeed, it\u2019s starting to score world-record solar-cell efficiencies \u2014 contrary to a long-held myth that all China can do is manufacture others\u2019 inventions cheaply. It\u2019s expanding its manufacturing footprint across the globe. And it\u2019s scrambling to import more efficient ways of financing solar power that have been pioneered in the West. The United States needs to take these shifts into account in defining an American solar strategy that minimizes the cost of solar power to the world while maximizing the long-term benefit to the American economy.A more-enlightened United States policy approach to solar would seek above all to continue slashing solar power\u2019s costs \u2014 not to prop up types of American solar manufacturing that can\u2019t compete globally. It would leverage, not aim to bury, China\u2019s manufacturing superiority, with closer cooperation on solar research and development. And it would focus American solar subsidies more on research and development and deployment than on manufacturing. As solar manufacturing continues to automate, reducing China\u2019s cheap-labor advantage, it is likely to make more sense in the United States, at least for certain sorts of solar products.The United States needs to play to its comparative advantages in the solar sector. That requires a sober assessment of what China does well. There are real tensions between China and the United States, including the tariff fight, doubts about the protection of intellectual property in China, and national-security concerns. But it\u2019s time to put those concerns into perspective, as investors, corporations and governments try to do every day.These proposed shifts in American solar policy will upset partisans across the political spectrum. They will offend liberals who have promised that solar-manufacturing subsidies would bring the United States huge numbers of green factory jobs. They will rankle conservatives who see China as the enemy. How will the Trump administration view them? That\u2019s unclear.Mr. Trump argued in his 2015 book, \u201cCrippled America\u201d (since retitled \u201cGreat Again\u201d), that solar panels didn\u2019t \u201cmake economic sense.\u201d But he also wrote that, when solar energy \u201cproves to be affordable and reliable in providing a substantial percent of our energy needs, then maybe it\u2019ll be worth discussing.\u201dThat time has arrived. A smarter solar policy \u2014 one with a more-nuanced view of China \u2014 is something the new president ought to like.Solar isn\u2019t just for the granola crowd anymore. It\u2019s a global industry, and it\u2019s poised to make a real environmental difference. Whether it delivers on that promise will depend on policy makers prodding it to become more economically efficient. That will require a shift both from those who have loved solar and from those who have laughed it off.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Golden Age for Museums in the Persian Gulf", "Date": "2017-03-11", "News": "Supported byLouvre Abu Dhabi is sure to attract global attention this year when it becomes the first international outpost of the Louvre to open its doors. But it\u2019s by no means the Persian Gulf\u2019s maiden museum project.Since the turn of the millennium, emirates of the Gulf have been in a museum-building campaign, recruiting Pritzker-winning architects to design elaborate structures, and partnering with major Western cultural institutions. Qatar has opened one big museum and has two others in the works. Abu Dhabi is planning two new museums next to its Louvre offshoot.Why all the museum building?\u201cAny time a country experiences a period of great economic prosperity, it becomes reflected in its culture, in its cities, in its capital, and translates into architecture, big buildings, big museums,\u201d said Jean Nouvel, the architect of Louvre Abu Dhabi and the National Museum of Qatar, which is nearing completion.\u201cAfter the very rich period that the emirates have lived through, both culturally and economically, and the complete mutation of their cities, it\u2019s normal that there should be buildings symbolizing this golden age,\u201d he said.The first major cultural landmark of the new millennium was Qatar\u2019s Museum of Islamic Art. Opened in Doha in 2008, it was designed by I. M. Pei, the architect of the pyramid at the Louvre.Mr. Nouvel\u2019s National Museum of Qatar, a sprawling structure whose contents will celebrate the nation\u2019s culture and heritage, is set to open next year in Doha. Qatar also is about to choose the architectural practice to create a giant contemporary art space out of former flour mills on the Doha waterfront. It will be called the Art Mill.In Abu Dhabi, the other two museum projects \u2014 Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and Zayed National Museum, both announced a decade ago, along with the Louvre \u2014 have been in limbo following the 2008-9 global financial crisis and the more recent decline in oil and natural gas prices.Preliminary piling work was done on the Guggenheim, but no contractor has been appointed or construction carried out since, and it is not known when building will start, said a spokesman for Abu Dhabi\u2019s Tourism Development and Investment Company. No contractors have been named or construction done on the Zayed National Museum, either, the spokesman added.Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, designed by Frank Gehry and an offshoot of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, is expected to showcase the contemporary art and architecture of West Asia, North Africa and South Asia. Zayed National Museum, designed by Norman Foster and his team, will, in tandem with the British Museum, celebrate Abu Dhabi\u2019s culture and heritage.Louvre Abu Dhabi was born of a 2007 agreement by which the government of Abu Dhabi agreed to pay the Louvre and a consortium of 11 partner museums in France around one billion euros ($1.05 billion) for the use of the Louvre name, the lending of artworks and the organization of exhibitions.The museum sits on Saadiyat Island, a commercial, residential and cultural development off the Abu Dhabi coast. Mr. Nouvel\u2019s striking design features a 180-meter-wide (590-foot) latticed dome that casts speckled shadows over the buildings and outdoor plaza beneath.Inside, the museum will show 600 works \u2014 half of them rotating loans from the French consortium that includes the Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and the Pompidou Center \u2014 and will host four exhibitions a year. Louvre Abu Dhabi\u2019s mission is to be a universal museum that tells the story of the world by showing commonalities between artworks and antiquities from around the globe.\u201cAdmittedly, as the name suggests, we have a strong connection to the Louvre, but this museum is absolutely not a satellite,\u201d Manuel Rabat\u00e9, the director of Louvre Abu Dhabi, wrote in an email. \u201cIt is an Emirati museum where we will present works in an original fashion to show the similarities between various civilizations. We\u2019d like every visitor to find their own culture in the works on show, but also to understand the other cultures of the world.\u201dThe museum\u2019s inaugural display will include masterpieces like da Vinci\u2019s \u201cPortrait of a Woman,\u201d also known as \u201cLa Belle Ferronni\u00e8re\u201d (1495-99); an 1887 self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh; and \u201cBlue Lady,\u201d a glazed terra-cotta eighth-century Chinese figurine.The opening exhibition will be a history of the Louvre in Paris, curated by its director, Jean-Luc Martinez. Site-specific commissions by the artists Jenny Holzer and Giuseppe Penone will also be unveiled at the opening.The new Louvre outpost and other museum projects have transformed the image of the Persian Gulf states, said Alexandre Kazerouni, a researcher at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris and the author of a new book on Gulf museums, \u201cLe Miroir des Cheikhs,\u201d or \u201cThe Mirror of the Sheikhs.\u201d\u201cThe world was used to associating the Gulf with war, or with oil,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAssociating the Gulf with culture is something completely new, and it coincides with the announcement of these major museum projects.\u201dThe drive to build Western-style museums and universities started in the 1990s, Mr. Kazerouni said. Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, which was countered by a United States-led military coalition, prompted the Gulf states to feel a heightened sense of vulnerability and seek closer diplomatic and cultural ties with the West.The emirates also set out to diversify their economies to become less reliant on oil and gas.Around that time, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, then the emir of Qatar, began a large-scale campaign of investments in culture and education, Mr. Kazerouni said. He ordered the construction of the Orientalist Museum in Doha, which opened in 1996, and the Museum of Islamic Art.The first major milestone in Qatar\u2019s museum-building program, the Museum of Islamic Art, has first-rate collections and a design inspired by ancient Islamic architecture. The next milestone is the National Museum of Qatar. Mr. Nouvel\u2019s design for the vast complex consists of a cluster of overlapping disks that recalls the desert rose (the rose-shaped mineral formations found in the Qatari desert).Neighboring Dubai and Sharjah also have been staking cultural claims. Dubai is the hub of the region\u2019s commercial art galleries, and its annual Art Dubai fair is an important regional marketplace. Sharjah has become a globally recognized art destination with its Sharjah Biennial, started in 1993.Wouldn\u2019t these countries have been better off working together? Not necessarily, said Mr. Nouvel, pointing to their cultural complementarity.\u201cThere is a logic to all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a healthy competition, I would say a healthy emulation, and a logical synergy.\u201dMr. Rabat\u00e9 of Louvre Abu Dhabi said that looking ahead, he favored collaboration with neighboring countries to secure museum loans and put on exhibitions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meeting in Turkey With Erdogan May Be Tillerson\u2019s Toughest", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byThe referendum has resulted in the worst divide between Europe and Turkey in decades, with Mr. Erdogan accusing European leaders of Nazi-like tendencies after they refused to allow officials of his government to address pro-referendum rallies.Navigating these difficulties would test the most seasoned of diplomats. Mr. Tillerson, though, has had a rocky start. On a recent trip to Asia, he stumbled repeatedly \u2014 disputing a South Korean explanation for his dinner plans and allowing China to crow over his use of language that American diplomats had long eschewed.Mr. Tillerson\u2019s aides insist that he is still finding his footing in a complicated job. But experts in the region say there is no room for mistakes in his discussions Thursday evening with Mr. Erdogan. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a more important or more challenging relationship,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state who visited Turkey three times last year to keep the relationship from foundering.Turkish officials, who have been waging a campaign against Kurdish militants inside Turkey, have repeatedly said they would not accept American plans to use a force that combines both Arab and Kurdish forces to attack Raqqa, since they view the Kurdish units as terrorists. United States officials have repeatedly responded that the combined force is the only viable option.Overcoming this disagreement is essential since Turkey could derail the fight against the Islamic State in profound ways. Much of the air campaign is being conducted out of Turkey\u2019s Incirlik Air Base, and closing the base to coalition bombers, as some Turkish officials have threatened, would be a huge blow. Turkey has also threatened to send its military against Kurdish forces, a move that would lead to a severe breakdown in the coalition and stall the Raqqa campaign.Just as important was a series of disasters visited upon Turkey over the past year. The attempted coup on July 15 killed 290 people and traumatized Turkish politics. Mr. Erdogan responded with mass arrests, purges of civil servants and the referendum, planned for April 16, that, if passed, would give him nearly dictatorial powers. The country also experienced terrorist attacks that cost hundreds of lives and crippled its tourism industry. The economy, after growing smartly for much of the past decade, has been hobbled.Hammering out a workable agreement with the Turks under such difficult conditions would require intense work and close planning across several United States government agencies, said Ryan C. Crocker, a former ambassador to six Muslim-dominated countries. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s happening on our side, I haven\u2019t seen any signs of it,\u201d he said.Nothing is likely to be decided about the Raqqa campaign until after the referendum. By then, Mr. Erdogan may be loath to alienate the Americans \u201cnow that the relationship with Europe is at an all-time low and there are increasing signs that the relationship with Russia is becoming counterproductive,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe.Gardiner Harris reported from Ankara, and Patrick Kingsley from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democratic Response to Trump\u2019s Speech: Video and Transcript", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "Supported byI\u2019m here in Lexington, Ky. \u2014 some 400 miles from Washington \u2014 at a diner with some neighbors \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 where we just watched the president\u2019s address. I\u2019m a proud Democrat, but first and foremost, I\u2019m a proud Republican, and Democrat, and mostly American. And like many of you, I am worried about the future of this nation.Look, I grew up in Kentucky in a small town called Dawson Springs. My dad and granddad were Baptist preachers. My family owned a funeral home. And my wife, Jane, and I have been married for almost 50 years. I became governor at the start of the global recession, and after eight years, we left things a lot better than we found them.By being fiscally responsible \u2014 I even cut my own pay \u2014 we balanced our budget and turned deficits into surpluses without raising taxes. We cut our unemployment rate in half. We made huge gains in high school graduation rates. And we found health coverage for over half a million Kentuckians.We did that through trust and mutual respect. I listened. And I built partnerships with business leaders and with Republicans in our legislature. We put people first and politics second.The America I love allowed a small-town preacher\u2019s kid to be elected governor, and it taught me to embrace people who are different from me, not vilify them. The America I love has always been about looking forward, not backward, about working together to find solutions, regardless of party, instead of allowing our differences to divide us and hold us back.And we Democrats are committed to creating the opportunity for every American to succeed by growing our economy with good-paying jobs, educating and training our people to fill those jobs, giving our businesses the freedom to innovate, keeping our country safe, and providing health care that families can afford and rely on.Mr. President, as a candidate, you promised to be a champion for families struggling to make ends meet, and I hope you live up to that promise. But one of your very first executive orders makes it harder for those families to even afford a mortgage. Then you started rolling back rules that provide oversight of the financial industry and safeguard us against another national economic meltdown. And you picked a cabinet of billionaires and Wall Street insiders who want to eviscerate the protections that most Americans count on and that help level the playing field.That\u2019s not being our champion. That\u2019s being Wall Street\u2019s champion.Mr. President, folks here in Kentucky expect you to keep your word. Because this isn\u2019t a game. It\u2019s life and death for people.These ideas promise \u201caccess\u201d to care but deny the importance of making care affordable and effective. They would charge families more for fewer benefits and put the insurance companies back in control. Behind these ideas is the belief that folks at the lower end of the economic ladder just don\u2019t deserve health care, that it\u2019s somehow their fault that their employer doesn\u2019t offer insurance or that they can\u2019t afford to buy expensive health plans.We sit in the bleachers with them on Friday night. We worship in the pews with them on Sunday morning. They\u2019re farmers, restaurant workers, part-time teachers, nurses\u2019 aides, construction workers and entrepreneurs working at high-tech start-ups. And before the Affordable Care Act, they woke up every morning and went to work, just hoping and praying they wouldn\u2019t get sick, because they knew that they were just one bad diagnosis away from bankruptcy.You know, in 2010, this country made a commitment, that every American deserved health care they could afford and rely on. And we Democrats are going to do everything in our power to keep President Trump and the Republican Congress from reneging on that commitment. But we\u2019re going to need your help by speaking out.Another commitment now being tested is to our national security. Look, make no mistake, I\u2019m a military veteran myself, and I know that protecting America is a president\u2019s highest duty. Yet President Trump is ignoring serious threats to our national security from Russia, who\u2019s not our friend, while alienating our allies, who\u2019ve fought with us side by side and are our friends in a dangerous world. His approach makes us less safe and should worry every freedom-loving American.Real leaders don\u2019t spread derision and division. Real leaders strengthen, they unify, they partner, and they offer real solutions instead of ultimatums and blame.Look, I may be old-fashioned, but I still believe that dignity, compassion, honesty and accountability are basic American values. And as a Democrat, I believe that if you work hard, you deserve the opportunity to realize the American dream, regardless of whether you\u2019re a coal miner in Kentucky, a teacher in Rhode Island, an autoworker in Detroit or a software engineer in San Antonio.Our political system is broken. It\u2019s broken because too many of our leaders think it\u2019s all about them. They need to remember that they work for us and helping us is their work.Kentucky made real progress while I was governor because we were motivated by one thing: helping families. Democrats are trying to bring that same focus back to Washington, D.C. Americans are a diverse people. And we may disagree on a lot of things, but we\u2019ve always come together when we remember that we are one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.Thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Winning a State Election Will Strengthen Modi\u2019s Populism", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byVARANASI, India \u2014 India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, is a mesmerizing orator, in the way of a talk-show host with an acerbic tongue, and this month a campaign crowd of more than 50,000 showed up in Deoria, a hardscrabble town in the state of Uttar Pradesh, to hear his story. They knew and loved the part about how this son of a tea seller rose through the party ranks with no help from family connections. But the rest of his rags-to-power tale is changing fast.Mr. Modi took office in 2014 billing himself as a pragmatic business reformer who could restart economic growth in India. But the promised growth has not followed, and in the last year or so he has begun pitching himself as a champion of the poor. \u201cThey\u201d \u2014 the wealthy elites, the long-ruling Congress Party and its Gandhi family dynasty \u2014 \u201chave been stealing from you for 70 years, and I will give India back to you,\u201d he told the Deoria crowd, which roared its approval.At a time when voters worldwide are rejecting established leaders and turning to populists who promise aggressive solutions for their economic frustrations, Mr. Modi is sensing the mood and increasingly positioning himself as a populist strongman. He is now running the most centralized administration India has seen in decades. And the strategy is working with a lot of voters.On Saturday his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., decisively won the election in Uttar Pradesh. It is India\u2019s most populous state, with more than 200 million people, and one of the poorest, with an annual per capita income less than half the national average of about $2,000. Uttar Pradesh is a powerful base for a born-again champion of the poor, and Mr. Modi\u2019s victory here stands as a popular endorsement of his recent makeover. It may encourage him to centralize power even more as national elections approach in 2019.Mr. Modi\u2019s message has turned 180 degrees. In 2014, he promised \u201cminimum government, maximum governance\u201d \u2014 a streamlined administration that would not interfere in the private sector. He talked about attracting multinationals with tax breaks, about privatizing state companies and business-friendly land reforms. Now he speaks only of helping the poor, providing loan waivers to farmers, giving out free cylinders of gas and cleansing the system of corruption and the streets of filth.Ostensibly, the focus of the Uttar Pradesh vote was to choose a new state chief minister, but it became a referendum on Mr. Modi and his new direction. The other parties named a candidate, but Mr. Modi asked people to vote for the B.J.P., and allow him to choose their chief minister. The subtext of all his speeches was that only he could solve India\u2019s problems.By the final days of the campaign, the Congress Party leader, Rahul Gandhi, was giving listless speeches to bored crowds \u2014 barely 5,000 showed up at one I attended in the town of Pindra \u2014 focused on trying to pop Mr. Modi\u2019s growing personality cult.The prime minister proved surprisingly impervious. Back in 2014 he had promised to revive economic growth, create jobs and decentralize the government by empowering state chief ministers. But today growth remains stuck around 5 percent to 6 percent \u2014 even if a new official accounting methodology puts it above 7 percent. India is not creating the millions of jobs needed to employ its rapidly growing population, and far from empowering new chief ministers, Mr. Modi is expected to install a loyalist in Uttar Pradesh whom he can control.I spent five days following the campaign, and it gradually became clear why Mr. Modi is so resilient, including his can-do reputation and his success in battling the scourges of corruption and inflation. In India, rising food prices have toppled many leaders, including Mr. Modi\u2019s predecessor, Manmohan Singh. But under Mr. Modi inflation has fallen from double digits to 3 percent, causing it to vanish as a political issue. This was partly the lucky result of falling oil prices, and partly a credit to Mr. Modi\u2019s budget restraint.The unattached prime minister is also seen as free of grasping family ties, and thus less corruptible. His three-year-old administration is untouched by scandal, a rare achievement. Many voters thus accept Mr. Modi\u2019s argument that corrupt elites had been failing since independence in 1947, and his clean administration deserves more than three years to deliver on \u201cvikas,\u201d development.My travels took me through Varanasi, a Hindu holy city that is the prime minister\u2019s home constituency in Parliament. Residents blame state authorities for the squalor here, not Mr. Modi. On my way out of the city, a man told me I was about to witness \u201cthe many good things the state government has done for our roads and bridges,\u201d in a tone so deadpan I couldn\u2019t be sure if he was being sarcastic.But the drive eastward quickly led into barren lands that evoke the \u201cMad Max\u201d movies, as if someone had superimposed gas engines and mobile phones onto medieval villages. At the skeletal beginnings of a suspension bridge over the Ganges River, locals told me the bridge was incomplete 13 years after construction because each successive state administration halted work to turn the project over to its favorite contractors. Diverted toward a rickety pontoon bridge, I hit a mile of stopped vehicles, all halted by a car that had slipped off the steel slats. Later, fitness watches in our van started announcing \u201c10,000 steps,\u201d \u201c15,000 steps\u201d \u2014 apparently counting bumps in the road.The development hurdles facing India are this basic, and many locals believe Mr. Modi is the answer. Manmohan Singh was seen as a tool of the Gandhis and was often overshadowed by a cabinet of powerful rivals, but Mr. Modi is the opposite \u2014 increasingly unchallenged and respected for it.The World Values Survey found that between the mid-1990s and the early part of this decade, 25 of 30 countries that responded to the survey in both time periods saw an increase in the number of people who agree that having \u201ca strong leader who does not have to bother with Parliament and elections\u201d would be good for their country. In India, support for this proposition spiked to 70 percent from 44 percent, the highest level after Ukraine. India also ranked near the bottom in popular support for private enterprise, alongside former Communist bloc nations like Russia and Ukraine.Mr. Modi\u2019s makeover as a strong-arm champion of the poor is thus tapping into India\u2019s fundamentally socialist DNA. His most striking use of state authority came on the evening of Nov. 8, when he announced that India would begin withdrawing large currency bills \u2014 86 percent of the currency in circulation \u2014 starting at midnight.Advertised as a way to force wealthy tax dodgers to turn in their \u201cblack money,\u201d and catch them unawares, the scheme also threw the lives of poor savers into chaos. Yet Mr. Modi has managed to portray himself as a can-do leader and critics of the currency cleansing as elitist outsiders. \u201cOn one hand are those who talk of what people at Harvard say, and on the other is a poor man\u2019s son who through his hard work is trying to improve the economy,\u201d he said at the Deoria rally.The early Mr. Modi, with his talk of \u201cminimum government,\u201d was often compared to Ronald Reagan, but now the comparison is more often to President Trump. Not since the late 1970s \u2014 when supporters of Indira Gandhi would say that \u201cIndia is Indira, Indira is India\u201d \u2014 have so many identified the nation with one leader.Mr. Modi makes his grand entrances alone, and dominates the national conversation. In Uttar Pradesh, some voters could not name a leader other than him. For all his oratorical gifts, Mr. Modi rarely meets reporters, and his aides are openly dismissive of the Indian press and its role in a democracy.The prime minister is also turning inward. Early on he worked to raise India\u2019s global profile, traveled often to foreign capitals, and sought peace with archrival Pakistan. Lately he travels mainly to Indian state capitals and has adopted his party\u2019s old view of Pakistan as an incubator of terror. His message to the B.J.P. faithful: Expand our domestic base so that our brand of Hindu nationalism faces no obstacles.As the campaign unfolded, Mr. Modi\u2019s team built on an old B.J.P. theme, about how previous governments had catered to the 20 percent Muslim minority in Uttar Pradesh, reserving for them unfair shares of public jobs, services and welfare assistance.Later a top Modi aide insisted to me that this was a \u201cdevelopment\u201d issue, but the sectarian overtones seem clear; the B.J.P. did not field a single Muslim candidate for any of the 400 legislative positions at stake in Uttar Pradesh. In Delhi, some political analysts argue that Mr. Trump, with his unfiltered attacks on the media and immigrants, has freed Mr. Modi to embrace this more exclusive nationalism.So the rise of Western populists is now emboldening peers in Asia. Mr. Modi is bringing relative political stability to India, by fragmenting the opposition and concentrating power in his hands, thus shifting the driver of economic growth from the private sector to the state, and freeing himself to conduct radical economic experiments like his currency cleansing policy. And now with his election victory in India\u2019s most populous state, his populist convictions are likely only to intensify.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byAutomation NationWho is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans? Last year, two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead. But now they\u2019ve declared a different winner: the robots.But that paper was a conceptual exercise. The new one uses real-world data \u2014 and suggests a more pessimistic future. The researchers said they were surprised to see very little employment increase in other occupations to offset the job losses in manufacturing. That increase could still happen, they said, but for now there are large numbers of people out of work, with no clear path forward \u2014 especially blue-collar men without college degrees.\u201cThe conclusion is that even if overall employment and wages recover, there will be losers in the process, and it\u2019s going to take a very long time for these communities to recover,\u201d Mr. Acemoglu said.\u201cIf you\u2019ve worked in Detroit for 10 years, you don\u2019t have the skills to go into health care,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market economy is not going to create the jobs by itself for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the change.\u201dThe study analyzed the effect of industrial robots in local labor markets in the United States. Robots are to blame for up to 670,000 lost manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007, it concluded, and that number will rise because industrial robots are expected to quadruple.The economists looked at the effect of robots on local economies and also more broadly. In an isolated area, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by 6.2 workers and wages by 0.7 percent. But nationally, the effects were smaller, because jobs were created in other places.Take Detroit, home to automakers, the biggest users of industrial robots. Employment was greatly affected. If automakers can charge less for cars because they employ fewer people, employment might increase elsewhere in the country, like at steel makers or taxi operators. Meanwhile, the people in Detroit will probably spend less at stores. Including these factors, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by three workers and wages by 0.25 percent.The findings fuel the debate about whether technology will help people do their jobs more efficiently and create new ones, as it has in the past, or eventually displace humans.Mr. Restrepo said the problem might be that the new jobs created by technology are not in the places that are losing jobs, like the Rust Belt. \u201cI still believe there will be jobs in the years to come, though probably not as many as we have today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the data have made me worried about the communities directly exposed to robots.\u201dIn addition to cars, industrial robots are used most in the manufacturing of electronics, metal products, plastics and chemicals. They do not require humans to operate, and do various tasks like welding, painting and packaging. From 1993 to 2007, the United States added one new industrial robot for every thousand workers \u2014 mostly in the Midwest, South and East \u2014 and Western Europe added 1.6.The study, a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published Monday, used data on the number of robots from the International Federation of Robotics (there is no consistent data on the monetary value of the robots in use.) It analyzed the effect of robots on employment and wages in commuting zones, a way to measure local economies.The next question is whether the coming wave of technologies \u2014 like machine learning, drones and driverless cars \u2014 will have similar effects, but on many more people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Journey to Colombia\u2019s Coffee Belt", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "In the northern reaches of the Andes \u2014 where the coffee bean is as central to life as corn is to small town Iowa \u2014 a welcoming spirit prevails.Supported byThere are more than 20 restaurants and cafes that sell coffee by the cup in the lively pastel-splashed plaza of Jard\u00edn, a quaint Colombian pueblo, or village, nestled in the northern reaches of the Andes Mountains.I chose one and settled in at a streetside table painted bright blue like an Easter egg, and ordered a caf\u00e9 tinto \u2014 straight black \u2014 for 800 pesos, about 25 cents. It was a Monday morning, and the Paisas, as the folks in this region south of Medell\u00edn are called, were socializing. Some looked to be friends and family chatting and laughing in the shadow of the double-spired basilica. Some, I was told, were shopkeepers who took the day off after a busy weekend catering to tourists. At the table next to me, a campesino relaxed with his cowboy hat pulled over his face and his chair tilted back against the wall.Had I been here on a certain day during the harvest season, I might have seen farm owners standing outside the Bancolombia branch with bags of paper cash, surrounded by police officers for security and workers who came to be paid. On Saturday nights, this plaza is a raucous cacophony of pounding discoteca beats and campesinos parading into town astride show horses, but there are still tintos among the cervezas on the trays waitresses carry between tables.Coffee is at the heart of Jard\u00edn, as corn is to small town Iowa: the local economy that forms a cultural identity. When my tinto arrived, it was easy to see why: The flavor, strong and bold, flowed directly from the beans, not a burned layer from roasting. I took another sip from my teacup-size demitasse and noticed that of all the people drinking coffee around me, a travel mug or paper cup was nowhere to be found. No one was taking their coffee to-go. Everyone was sitting, sipping, enjoying.This was why I had come: to indulge my love of coffee. And Jard\u00edn is a perfect place, in the heart of a coffee belt in southwestern Antioquia, the largest-volume coffee producer of Colombia\u2019s 32 departments.In the 1990s, a collapse in commodity coffee prices hit Colombia hard. Half of its coffee market value vanished, and thousands of families in coffee-growing regions were pushed into poverty. As a strategy for the future, the Colombian government began encouraging and supporting farms to grow higher quality beans that qualify for specialty coffee markets, where prices are higher and more stable.With the help of a hired guide \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1o Hern\u00e1ndez, himself the son of coffee farmers \u2014 I was ready to see where the rich brew in my cup came from, to explore the coffee terroir of the northern Andes.In the plaza, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, 41, picked me up in his car and we drove through a military checkpoint just outside of town. After the soldiers waved us through, he told me we would be taking the scenic route to visit a coffee finca above 6,000 feet in elevation. By scenic, he meant a route for equestrians. At the mountain foothills, he parked at the roadside and we met up with another guide who had horses saddled and ready to go. The ride up a cobble-strewed path was a series of pinch-me moments \u2014 glorious vistas of the northern Andes, rays of morning sun shooting through fluffy clouds, the occasional ridiculous-beaked toucan flying by.After a few hours we stopped and tied up the horses, and Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez unlocked a gate at a barbed-wire fence. This was the backdoor to the Cueva del Esplendor. The public entrance to this tourist attraction is a parking lot on the other side of the ravine, where people leave their cars and walk a path to the cave. From this side, we rappelled down wire cables into jungle. At the bottom we entered a small cave with a sunlit waterfall shooting through the rock ceiling \u2014 another pinch-me moment.After another hour of scenic equine touring, it was time for lunch at the finca, a simple farmhouse near the mountaintop with white stucco walls and dandy blue trim. That same popping blue accented the pedestal for a shrine to the baby Jesus and also a cross erected at the drop-off to a million-dollar view: more than a dozen Andean peaks rolling out as far as could be seen, with bushy coffee plants climbing up every mountainside.Three women hustled out to lay the lunch spread on a table on the covered porch: fried eggs with runny yolks, fried plantains two ways \u2014 one ripe and sweet and the other not-quite ripe and starchy; red beans; and chicharr\u00f3n, strips of fried pork rind crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. I piled the beans into a bowl and topped them with an egg and spoonfuls of homemade chunky picante paste. The whole mix was simple and satisfying. Around the corner, the farmworkers and their families sat at another table, a mix of men, women and children all eating beans and eggs and chicharr\u00f3n. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez had asked for an authentic finca lunch, and so it was.\u201cColombians eat a big lunch; it\u2019s their main meal,\u201d he explained when asking what I thought of the food. \u201cIt takes a lot of food to work this farm.\u201dAfter the empty plates were collected, one woman poured me a cup of the house coffee, served tinto. I smiled and sighed at the pure flavor: so earthy and saturating on my palate, yet exiting cleanly without a trace of aftertaste. Then the farm\u2019s manager, Juan Crisostomo Osorio Mar\u00edn, beckoned me to follow a dirt path up into the coffee bushes. Mr. Mar\u00edn runs the farm\u2019s field operations for his father, who is the owner.We arrived at a spot where bundles of green and bright red coffee berries weighted down seemingly every branch. These are prodigious plants, each one growing the equivalent of a pound of finished, ground coffee. The red coffee berries, resembling cranberries, were ripe and ready to pick. I challenged Mr. Mar\u00edn to a quick coffee-picking contest, and in 30 seconds I had 50 berries in a basket. Mr. Mar\u00edn had more than 200. The trick, he showed me, was to move a hand underneath the branch while flicking berries with the thumb. In one sweeping motion he could dislodge 10 or more berries.During harvest season, Mr. Mar\u00edn, 40, will haul down several baskets of coffee berries that add up to 500 pounds by the end of the day \u2014 this off a ridge so steep I found it somewhat difficult to stand up straight. Other relatives do the same. Last year Mr. Mar\u00edn\u2019s 62-year-old father picked more than 400 pounds in a day, just after recovering from a broken leg suffered while playing soccer.Still, the production here pales to the output on corporate coffee plantations. The Mar\u00edn family emphasizes quality over quantity. Nespresso grades these beans as Triple A, its highest rating for quality and sustainability.Mr. Mar\u00edn said three factors favored his coffee: the elevation, which is high enough to keep pestiferous coffee borer bugs at bay; the humidity, which stems from passing clouds that provide a steady stream of moisture; and the red soil.\u201cPor qu\u00e9?\u201d I asked: Why is the soil so red? Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez told me about Nevado del Ruiz, a volcano in the northern Andes that sprinkled ash across the mountaintops.\u201cA good thing?\u201d I asked Mr. Mar\u00edn through Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez.\u201cS\u00ed, claro, claro,\u201d Mr. Mar\u00edn said, nodding his head. The answer came back through my guide that the ash made these soils rich and fertile: \u201cLike a blessing, the land is better up here.\u201dBack at the farmhouse, I got a tour of the depulping grinder that expunges beans from the fruit (like extracting pits out of cherries), and the drying rack for beans before they go to the co-op. For 15,000 pesos (about $5), I got a bag of his Triple A coffee and thanked Mr. Mar\u00edn for his hospitality.On the ride back to Jard\u00edn, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez told me I was only his second coffee tourist in seven years of guiding. All of his other clients are birders, but he would like to do more trips like this, as his grandfather settled and started the coffee farm nearby where he grew up. When the coffee crisis hit, his parents divorced and he left college in Medell\u00edn to come home and help his mother climb out of debt. It was during this troubled period that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez sought emotional refuge at a Taoist temple and found his calling in a life of guiding, helping others find meaning in this land he loves. His mother is still on the family finca, but coffee, like all farming, is a tough business, and he isn\u2019t sure she can continue. \u201cThe stories in these hills,\u201d he told me while we bumped along a dusty road, \u201cthey give me hope.\u201dMr. Hern\u00e1ndez dropped me off at the inn where I was staying outside of town and told me he would take an afternoon siesta, but he would be back in a few hours. I did likewise and stretched out in the rainbow-colored hammock strung up on the balcony of my second-floor room overlooking Jard\u00edn. At 6 p.m. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez retrieved me for dinner at another finca, also up in the hills but shrouded in a forest canopy.At the farmhouse, a family bustled out of the door \u2014 father and mother, flanked by a little boy and a toddler girl \u2014 to warmly greet me, the first North American to visit their home. (Swiss men from Nespresso had been there before.) The farm owner, Francisco Javier Angel, grinned and waved us to the dining room table on the open-air porch. A single light bulb on the ceiling attracted moths and other insects from the forest, and they occasionally smacked my head in their orbits around the light. But nothing was biting, no mosquitoes, another advantage of the farm\u2019s elevation.Mr. Angel, 37, seemed young to own a farm, but he was enterprising. He had worked this farm when a local priest owned it, and the priest, impressed by his work ethic, sold him the land. His wife, M\u00f3nica, disappeared into the kitchen and came back bearing glasses of fresh-squeezed lemonade sweetened with panela, a form of unrefined sugar. Through Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, Mr. Angel explained that panela can also be used as a sweetener for chaqueta caf\u00e9, \u201cjacket coffee,\u201d served when days turn cold or to give coffee pickers a boost of energy for the fields.Brewing coffee is a rustic and ritualistic process on a Colombian farm. First, she heated a liter of water in a pot on the gas stove to just near boiling, when bubbles first formed on the bottom. Then she stirred five spoonfuls of grounds from the house coffee into the pot, turned off the gas and let it sit for five minutes. \u201cSilencio,\u201d she said. In the meantime, she rinsed four cups in hot water so a sudden change in temperature \u2014 hot coffee hitting a cold cup \u2014 wouldn\u2019t shock the coffee. Finally, she poured coffee through a tiny sieve into each cup. It was a gorgeous midnight-black brew with a light brown foam halo on the edges.Back at the dinner table, I took a sip and was astounded by a simple cup of coffee for the third time today: such force, so rich, yet no hint of bitterness. I asked what made this coffee unique. Mr. Angel and Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez exchanged some Spanish, and the back story was relayed to me.Mr. Angel\u2019s coffee-farming lineage goes back three generations, and he had the idea to grow the same variety of beans his grandfather grew 100 years ago \u2014 a heritage coffee, of sorts. But those seeds were nowhere to be found; the co-op sells only modern coffee varieties. So Mr. Angel went treasure hunting in abandoned farms that had been run out by the commodity-price crash. In one he found the old variety of beans from his grandfather\u2019s generation.Everyone in town thought Mr. Angel was insane for planting beans he scavenged out of fallow fields, but slowly his heritage coffee is winning converts. He sells it under the name Pajarito, or little bird, because he sees lots of birds among the bushes where this coffee grows.\u201cI see opportunity in coffee,\u201d Mr. Angel told me through Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez. That\u2019s a bold statement, given that so many of his fellow coffee farmers throughout Colombia are abandoning farms, jumping off the roller coaster of coffee market prices for jobs in big cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the tradition of this family,\u201d Mr. Angel said. \u201cIt is what we do.\u201dMr. and Mrs. Angel gathered with their children on the porch to wave goodbye as Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez and I walked out into the night. The air buzzed with insects whirring a fervent nocturnal chorus. A sea spray of white lights, like twinkling stars, glittered in the dark forest beyond us.When we had arrived in daylight, the foliage was so thick I couldn\u2019t see beyond the trees. But now I realized those stars were the porch lights of fincas on the next mountain ridge, each light a home like this one.It was a reminder that coffee here is a family affair. And if you slow down, sip, really savor, you can taste earnest endeavors and lifetimes of devotion.Medell\u00edn has the closest international airport to Jard\u00edn (about a four hours\u2019 drive away). Within Jard\u00edn, a motoraton \u2014 literally \u201cmotor mouse,\u201d a motorized rickshaw on three wheels \u2014 zips passengers from hotels to restaurants for about 3,000 Colombia pesos. A taxi to locales within a half-hour of Jard\u00edn costs about 30,000 pesos. A driver with a Jeep is about 300,000 pesos per day.Gustave Axelson is a frequent contributor to the Travel section.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Huge January Trade Deficit Shows Trump\u2019s Hard Job Ahead", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byGlobal BalancePresident Trump says that the United States\u2019 persistent trade deficit is a scourge that must be eliminated. But new data Tuesday shows the complexity of the costs and benefits of trade \u2014 and how reducing the trade deficit, if not done right, could leave Americans worse off.What really matters is not whether the trade deficit is rising or falling. What matters is why.The trade deficit rose 9.6 percent in January, to the highest level since 2012 (though it remains lower as a share of the total economy). It\u2019s in the details of that $48.5 billion gap between what the United States exported and what it imported, though, that you see why the economy is more complex than the \u201ctrade deficits are bad\u201d framing of the Trump administration.Picking apart the January numbers, you see just how that way of looking at trade can be misleading. The challenge for the Trump administration, if it sticks to its guns of reducing the trade deficit as a top economic goal, will be to do so by focusing on what really matters for Americans\u2019 standards of living. The trade deficit fell a great deal during the 2008 recession, for example. No one would argue it made Americans (or pretty much anyone else) better off.The United States actually exported 0.9 percent more goods in January than it did in December (the numbers are adjusted for the usual seasonal variations). If your concern is that other countries haven\u2019t been buying enough goods made in U.S. factories, the January numbers pointed in a positive direction. The United States exported $1.3 billion more in automobiles and $2.1 billion more in industrial supplies in January than it did in December.The details show the economic idea of specialization at work. The $1.3 billion rise in automotive exports was paired with a $900 million rise in automotive imports. The overall balance didn\u2019t shift much, but that suggests that the United States is shipping cars and trucks that it makes more efficiently while importing those that others make more efficiently.The reason the trade deficit rose is that imports rose faster than exports. But even that isn\u2019t entirely a negative.Imports of consumer goods rose by $2.4 billion in January, with a particularly strong rise in imported cellphones. That reflects the relative strength of the U.S. economy. American consumers have rising incomes, and inevitably they spend part of that income on imported goods.In effect, the higher trade deficit in January is in significant part caused by U.S. economic strength. It is the inverse of what happened during the 2008 recession. Buying more imported consumer goods because you are making more money is generally a good thing, not a bad thing.Some exports of products were down in a few sectors where the United States has important competitive advantages.Exports of civilian aircraft \u2014 think Boeing jets sold across the globe \u2014 fell by $611 million, and shipments of other high-tech capital goods like aircraft engines and telecommunications equipment were also down.Such sectors tend to be volatile, so these may turn out to be blips. But if global demand softened for these products made by skilled workers with advanced technology, it would be bad news for Americans.Meanwhile, a persistent strength of the U.S. economy has been in services, but the balance of trade in services worsened by $5.3 billion.This may reflect a rise in the value of the dollar. For example, when travelers from abroad visit the United States and spend money at hotels and restaurants, that counts as a services export. That number fell by $89 million in January. It is worth watching whether that falls further, as it might should the dollar keep rising and should the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel from several countries dissuade would-be travelers.Given the vast numbers of American jobs tied to service industries, it would be bad news if that trend continued.A big piece in the rise in imports was crude oil and other petroleum products. They were up by a combined $2.2 billion. (Exports of those products also rose, by $1.2 billion, but combined that means oil contributed to the widening of the trade deficit.)But that seems less worrisome if you know that the price of crude oil rose 9 percent from the start of December until the start of January.A rise in the price of oil or any other commodity benefits its producers and costs its consumers. It will affect, over time, patterns of imports and exports of that product. But when the trade deficit rises or falls because of those shifts, it\u2019s not really because of trade per se, but because of underlying shifts in supply and demand for the commodity in question.Put it all together, and while the January trade report has some weak spots and areas for concern, it is not nearly the unabashed bad news that a simplistic reading of the trade deficit would suggest.If the trade deficit falls during the Trump administration because sales of American-made automobiles, jet airliners or services overseas boom, that will be great news. If it falls because Americans\u2019 spending collapses, it will be bad news. If it falls because of commodity price swings, it will depend on which commodities exactly, and where they\u2019re made.The trade deficit is important. But using it as a simplistic scorecard doesn\u2019t tell the full story.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rare Move, Chinese Think Tank Criticizes Tepid Pace of Reform", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s ambitious plan to revamp its economy has bogged down. Flabby state conglomerates have thwarted attempts to whip them into commercial shape. Rules that treat millions of city-dwelling rural migrants like second-class citizens have barely budged.Such criticisms are common from skeptical foreign economists who have long argued that President Xi Jinping\u2019s efforts to remake China\u2019s economy and fix pernicious social problems have been too slow and tepid.But these withering findings on China\u2019s reforms come from a startling place: from within the government itself.It concludes: \u201cReform has to some extent fallen into stalemate.\u201dThe report comes ahead of a Communist Party leadership shake-up later this year that is likely to further solidify Mr. Xi\u2019s hold on power. While the report\u2019s few mentions of Mr. Xi are laudatory, it may add to arguments that he needs to move faster to fix economic problems.But critics argue that the policy changes have slowed or foundered. The report, together with recent comments from a couple of senior officials, indicates that some government insiders agree.\u201cThere must be more political courage and wisdom,\u201d the report said. Despite the vision laid out in 2013, it said, \u201cit\u2019s been quite difficult to reach consensus on specific reform measures, and there have even been policies at odds with this general direction.\u201dEfforts to redefine how different levels of government spend and tax have become mired in bureaucratic feuding. Local governments fear losing revenue from selling off land while they must pay for growing demands for services. Personal income and property tax changes have been discussed, \u201cbut ultimately it\u2019s brought loud thunder but little rain.\u201dRepeated attempts to make hospital care less expensive and more accessible have been frustrated by bureaucratic rivalries and a failure to take on monopolistic hospitals and train more doctors, the report said. The result, it said, is that \u201cseeing a doctor has become even more difficult.\u201dChina\u2019s hundreds of millions of migrant workers, who leave their farms and villages for jobs in the cities, usually don\u2019t qualify for urban benefits like health care or education for their children. Experts have called on China to ease up on the limits in order to help turn migrant workers into bigger consumers. But many cities have created point systems that still exclude them, the report said.State companies \u2014 many of which suffer from overcapacity and heavy debt, burdening the broader economy \u2014 have resisted plans to rein them in while rival agencies have bickered over the direction of change.\u201cOver all, progress in every reform of state-owned firms has been quite sluggish,\u201d it said.Above all, the report said, local officials have been besieged by conflicting demands to be both cautious and courageous, and have become allergic to taking risks that could end their careers or even land them in detention on charges of violating party discipline.\u201cIt\u2019s an inescapable objective fact that the enthusiasm of many local governments to get things done has fallen greatly,\u201d said the report. \u201cThe lack of vigor in implementing reform plans has become the most pressing difficulty in our country\u2019s efforts to comprehensively deepen reform across the board.\u201dBut the authors do not blame the sluggishness just on foot-dragging cadres and state executives, an impression sometimes left by state-run news media reports.Instead, they say that the \u201ctop-level design\u201d of promised reforms in state-owned business and other areas has been marred from inception by confusion, vagueness and unrealistic or conflicting demands.\u201cCurrently, a bigger reason why reforms in some of our country\u2019s key sectors have had difficulty moving forward may lie in the thinking behind the top-level design of these reforms,\u201d the report said.It added, \u201cthe source of the obstructions lies in the policy making.\u201dFor example, the report said, a rule that slashed the salaries of managers at state-owned companies backfired. \u201cThis undermined the enthusiasm of central state-owned enterprises, so they had even less vigor and dynamism,\u201d it said.Some senior officials have also been making the case for more urgency in overhauling the economy.\u201cThis has made people unwilling to endure the pain of reform,\u201d said Mr. Lou, who stepped down from the ministry in November and now runs the state agency that manages social security funds.But the researchers also urge the government to become more open and consultative in drawing up policy \u2014 something that may not come easily to Mr. Xi, who has centralized power and warned officials against bending orders.\u201cGive local officials more room to explore and experiment,\u201d the report said. \u201cDon\u2019t settle scores with them even if their efforts fail.\u201dAdam Wu in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Profitable Companies, No Taxes: Here\u2019s How They Did It", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byYet if the level is so high, why have so many companies\u2019 income tax bills added up to zero?Although the top corporate rate is 35 percent, hardly any company actually pays that. The report, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research group in Washington, found that 100 of them \u2014 nearly 40 percent \u2014 paid no taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015. Eighteen, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E, incurred a total federal income tax bill of less than zero over the entire eight-year period \u2014 meaning they received rebates. The institute used the companies\u2019 own regulatory filings to compute their tax rates.Companies take advantage of an array of tax loopholes and aggressive strategies that enable them to legally avoid paying what they owe. The institute\u2019s report cites these examples:Citing evidence in the report, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, introduced a bill on Thursday to eliminate tax loopholes that encourage companies to shift activities offshore. \u201cThe truth is that we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations,\u201d Senator Sanders said. \u201cOffshore tax haven abuse has become so absurd that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is now the \u2018home\u2019 to more than 18,000 corporations.\u201dOthers, like American Electric Power, Con Ed and Comcast, qualified for accelerated depreciation, enabling them to write off most of the cost of equipment and machinery before it wore out.Individual industries have successfully lobbied for specific tax breaks that function as subsidies: for instance, drilling for gas and oil, building Nascar racetracks or railroad tracks, roasting coffee, undertaking certain kinds of research, producing ethanol or making movies (which saved the Walt Disney Company $1.48 billion over eight years, the report says).These industry-specific subsidies mean that the goodies were not evenly distributed. Utilities logged an effective tax rate of just 3.1 percent over the eight-year period. Industrial machinery, telecommunications and oil, gas and pipeline companies paid roughly 11.5 percent. Internet services paid 15.6 percent. In just two sectors \u2014 health care and retail \u2014 companies paid more than 30 percent of their profits in federal income tax.\u201cOne of the things that jumps out pretty starkly is there\u2019s a real gap between the tax rates paid by different industries,\u201d said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the institute and a co-author of the study. \u201cWhen the biggest companies aren\u2019t paying their fair share, that means the rest of us are left to pick up the slack. It means small business and middle-income families are paying more.\u201dBut Tara DiJulio, a spokeswoman for General Electric, called the report \u201cdeeply flawed and misleading.\u201d\u201cG.E. is one of the largest payers of corporate income taxes,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the last decade, G.E. paid $32.9 billion in cash income taxes worldwide, including in the U.S., and pays more than $1 billion annually in other U.S. state, local and federal taxes.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe tax code is complex and outdated, which is exactly why tax reform must happen this year. G.E. has long been advocating to simplify and modernize the tax system \u2014 even if it means we pay more in taxes.\u201dCompanies with the biggest tax subsidies over the eight years, the institute\u2019s report said, included:Some of the tax incentives, including those enacted during the recession, were meant to increase economic growth and hiring, but the institute\u2019s report said they often didn\u2019t work that way.Republicans say their tax overhaul will eliminate some of the biggest loopholes, although critics counter that the substitute will end up further reducing companies\u2019 tax bills.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "War Consumes South Sudan, a Young Nation Cracking Apart", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byYAMBIO, South Sudan \u2014 Simon Burete was weeding his peanut field a few weeks ago when he saw smoke coming from his house. He ran as fast as he could.He and his wife, Angelina, had enjoyed years of peace, he farming the fields, she selling the produce in the market. They were poor but welded to each other. Just that morning, they had talked about walking into town to buy their first mobile phones.But as Mr. Burete made it back to the house, out of breath, red dirt still stuck to his knees, he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. His wife was lying on the floor, burned to death in a rampage by government forces.\u201cI used to call her akara-ngba,\u201d he said, which means in the Zande language \u201cthe last word on beauty.\u201dHe could barely choke out the words.South Sudan\u2019s war and its full ugliness are engulfing new, previously peaceful areas of the nation, spelling horror for the victims and signifying something deeper: This country is cracking apart.Yambio, a midsize town of wide dirt roads and lofty kapok trees that seem to breathe tranquillity, used to be part of what was called a green state. This place was considered safe. It was not a red zone.But now charred buildings and crushed huts line the roads leaving town. Bountiful fields \u2014 here in a part of the country known as South Sudan\u2019s breadbasket \u2014 lie untended during a desperate national food crisis. The names of dead loved ones circulate through hastily built displaced-persons camps all around Yambio, just as they do in cities and towns hundreds of miles away.But as it enters its fourth year, this war, Africa\u2019s worst, is rapidly sucking in many of the nation\u2019s other ethnic groups, including the Azande, the Shilluk, the Moru, the Kakwa and the Kuku. The widening conflict is imperiling nearly every pillar that this young country\u2019s future rested on: oil production, agriculture, education, transport and most especially unity, which seemed so proudly on display six years ago when South Sudan was born in a halo of jubilation that now seems Pollyannish.Dangerous fissures are opening up within the South Sudanese military, and the burst of bloodshed here in the Equatoria region is both cause and effect. An Equatorian general and a colonel recently quit, criticizing the government on their way out. One said the justice system was \u201ctoo deformed to be reformed.\u201d The other accused the government of orchestrating a \u201ctribally engineered war.\u201dOn top of all this now comes another calamity: famine.A formal famine declaration is rare \u2014 in the past 25 years, only a handful have been made worldwide. They are a cry for help (and for donors to give more money) and an admission that aid efforts have catastrophically failed. Blaming the South Sudanese government and rebels for intentionally blocking lifesaving supplies, United Nation officials said more than one million people could die.The United States helped birth this nation, building ministries, training soldiers, pumping in more than $11 billion since 2005. Americans, especially powerful Christian groups, cheered on the South Sudanese rebels during their decades-long liberation battle to split off from the Arab-dominated government of Sudan, which southerners simply called \u201cThe North.\u201dBut South Sudan is going down the North\u2019s same bloody road.By all accounts, South Sudanese soldiers have become brutal doppelg\u00e4ngers of the widely vilified northern Sudanese forces that they had rebelled against, waging war ruthlessly against their own people.Analysts say South Sudan has become shockingly similar to Darfur, the vast, western region of Sudan that plunged into conflict in the mid-2000s and became a global byword for atrocities against civilians.What happened there is happening here: government-backed militias, and sometimes uniformed soldiers, sweeping into towns, burning down huts, massacring civilians, gang-raping women and driving millions from their homes, leaving many to crowd into disease-ridden camps protected by United Nations peacekeepers.The South Sudanese government says it is putting down a rebellion \u2014 the same rationale used in Darfur. And it is true that armed groups rose up in 2013, led by ambitious Nuer politicians challenging Dinka hegemony just two years after South Sudan won its independence from Sudan.But the broader narrative of the two countries is beginning to blur. A commonly uttered line on Sudan is that it has been at war with itself since independence. Most analysts and even some South Sudanese government officials fear that could be South Sudan\u2019s destiny as well.\u201cWe are doing exactly what the North was doing \u2014 that is the irony,\u201d said John Gai Yoh, an adviser to South Sudan\u2019s president, Salva Kiir.\u201cI feel my life is meaningless,\u201d Mr. Yoh said, sitting in a large office in Juba, the capital. \u201cWhy is it that we had to fight all these years and end up here?\u201dHe said he stayed on as a presidential adviser because if people like him left, \u201cthe whole system disintegrates.\u201dSouth Sudanese officials admit that their government, led by Mr. Kiir, has been a huge disappointment.Take the economy. When South Sudan gained independence, it was churning out 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, generating billions of dollars that were supposed to be spent on schools, roads, playgrounds, health clinics, water treatment facilities, police stations, all the gear of a functioning state.Back in South Sudan, teachers are paid less than $3 a month, and many said they hadn\u2019t seen even that. Even ambassadors often don\u2019t get paid.A few years ago, the government struck a questionable revenue-sharing plan with Sudan. Instead of insulating themselves from oil shocks, as outside consultants urged, the South Sudanese cut a deal to make as much money as possible when oil prices were high.One of the few shards of hope, analysts say, is that Riek Machar, the former vice president and powerful Nuer politician who led the rebellion against the president, has been sidelined, relegated to exile in South Africa. Mr. Machar has been widely blamed for stoking ethnic violence and was considered a destabilizing force in the 1990s during the liberation battles, and few of South Sudan\u2019s neighbors, which have been trying to broker a peace, want him to return.But the issue of Dinka domination remains. The president, Mr. Kiir, is a Dinka, as are the chief of staff of the army and many top military and security officers.Government officials admitted that some of their soldiers had committed abuses, but the government denies that it is trying to stir up an ethnically driven war.In Yambio, most people are from the Azande ethnic group, and many say they have been brutalized by the Dinka. They also say some of their youths have joined the fight against the government.They call the rebels \u201cthe boys in the bush.\u201dIt\u2019s often hard to tell which came first, the oppression or the rebellion.In the past few months, small bands of Zande rebels have attacked government convoys and the houses of government officials. In response, the government has gone on a tear.United Nations officials said that in December, government soldiers, commanded by Dinka officers, had burned down a string of villages outside Yambio and massacred scores of civilians. In Yei, another town in the Equatoria region, United Nations officials said that government soldiers chopped up babies and threw the body parts in a river.The villages around Yambio have turned into ghost towns, empty huts staring lonesomely out at the wide dirt roads. Fields of peanuts, cassava, beans and corn have been abandoned. Some of the skinny papaya trees are so full of fruit at the top that they look like they\u2019re about to tip over. Nobody\u2019s around to pick them.Yambio was considered one of the best educated, peaceful and agriculturally productive parts of the country, but farmers have fled to camps for the internally displaced. The people here are now totally dependent on donations from aid groups, adding to the strain in dealing with the famine.Few want to return home, fearing their own government.\u201cSix Dinka commandos raped me,\u201d said one woman in Yambio, who asked that her name not be used for fear of reprisals.Not far away, David Angelo, 22, looked over his shoulders before slowly taking off his shirt. Standing in the sunlight, in front of a tiny hut in a displaced persons camp, he said he was not a rebel but had been captured by Dinka soldiers bent on revenge.His back, his neck and his shoulders bore fresh machete scars. \u201cThe government soldiers left me for dead,\u201d he said.\u201cWe went wrong,\u201d said Taban Deng Gai, the first vice president. But, he added, \u201cSouth Sudan is not a banana state.\u201dMany South Sudanese are now asking questions they thought they would never ask: Should they have voted for independence? Would their lives be better if South Sudan were still part of Sudan?These questions are academic for Mr. Burete, whose eyes shine with tears when he remembers his wife.He recalled how, at the end of each day, she would show him the money made from selling vegetables. If it was a good day, they would treat themselves to something special.\u201cShe loved to eat meat,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cShe loved to eat meat.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the given name of Simon Burete\u2019s wife on second reference.

{"Headline": "Tax on Saudi Aramco Oil Profits Is Cut to Prepare for I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported bySaudi Arabia announced a sharp tax cut for its state oil company on Monday, part of an effort to make it more appealing to international investors in preparation for its promised initial public offering.The tax rate is a vital piece in a puzzle the Saudis need to work out with investment bankers to determine the value of Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s biggest producer of crude oil. Current valuation estimates, ranging from $400 billion to $2 trillion, depend on various calculations of the worth of operations, projections of commodity prices, and costs including taxes.The Saudis hope to offer 5 percent of the company to foreign investors late next year, which would raise as much as $100 billion in what could be the biggest initial public offering in history.The new tax rate for Saudi Aramco will amount to 50 percent, slashed from 85 percent, retroactive to Jan. 1, according to a royal order. The company also pays a 20 percent royalty on revenues.\u201cThe new tax rate will bring Saudi Aramco in line with international benchmarks,\u201d Saudi Aramco\u2019s chief executive officer, Amin H. Nasser, said in a statement.The tax cut was announced a couple of months after intensive discussions with international bankers in Riyadh about how the offering should be structured. Bankers and independent specialists said the cut would help increase the cash flow available for dividends to future investors and also suggested that various Saudi interest groups were reaching a consensus on how to proceed with the privatization.\u201cIt is very much a positive move,\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Seznec, a Middle East energy specialist at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center. \u201cIt means the various Saudi parties involved \u2014 the state, the public investment fund and the royal family \u2014 are negotiating with the idea of coming to a solution.\u201dUnder a privatization, some combination of the government, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, members of the royal family and individual Saudis would share 95 percent of profits and dividends. Dividing that pie is a delicate issue because the government depends on the company for most of its revenue and the company is involved in many social programs, like building hospitals and schools.The Saudi finance minister, Mohammed al-Jadaan, said in a statement that the new tax code for Saudi Aramco would have no impact on government services because any tax revenue lost would be \u201creplaced by stable dividend payments by government-owned companies and other sources of revenue, including profits resulting from investments.\u201dSaudi Aramco does not publicly release information about earnings or the taxes and royalties it pays the government and others. Specialists say commodity prices and sales will determine profits and payments to shareholders, including the government and the royal family, with dividends taking the place of the higher taxes. The Saudis hope that new investment through the share offering will result in a bit of growth that will increase profits.Saudi Aramco\u2019s ability to provide financing for the government has been sharply reduced in the last three years as world oil prices have collapsed. Even after cuts in subsidies and social programs, this year\u2019s government budget deficit is expected to be $53 billion. The Fitch Ratings agency this month downgraded the country\u2019s sovereign credit rating for the second time in a year, and foreign reserves are in worrisome decline.Nevertheless, the taxation announcement was another sign that the initial public offering, which has been slow to get off the ground, may be gaining momentum. King Salman recently completed a three-week tour of Asia in which he advanced Saudi Aramco\u2019s campaign to become a major refining and petrochemical power in China, Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia. Mounting joint investments with some of Saudi Aramco\u2019s biggest customers should increase the value of Saudi Aramco to investors in the future, energy specialists said.Saudi Aramco recently agreed to pay Royal Dutch Shell $2.2 billion in an arrangement splitting their United States refining and marketing business, Motiva Enterprises. That deal will put the refinery in Port Arthur, Tex. \u2014 the largest in the United States \u2014 totally under Saudi Aramco control. That should allow Saudi Arabia to expand, or at least stabilize, oil exports to the United States, which have been declining as American domestic production increases.Energy specialists warn that the offering still faces hurdles. Saudi Aramco will need to be far more transparent to meet Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and members of the royal family may resist having shareholders from Western countries.Failure to attract a large sum of capital for the offering would be deeply embarrassing to King Salman and his favorite son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is pushing the privatization as part of a sweeping reorganization of the national economy.Mr. Seznec said that when he recently visited Saudi Arabia to lecture young middle managers at Saudi Aramco, he noticed a broad confidence that the offering would ultimately succeed.\u201cThere is so much emphasis in the higher levels and lower levels within the kingdom that this I.P.O. will take place,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir vision is to make Saudi Aramco like Exxon Mobil, but much bigger.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A version was introduced in 1969 after Congress discovered that \u2014 are you ready? \u2014 155 taxpayers with taxable incomes over $200,000 paid no tax.The minimum tax has gone through several iterations, but the essential intent has not changed: to limit the amount of deductions available to the richest Americans. Over the years, though, inflation has eaten away at its effectiveness \u2014 as has the exclusion of interest and dividend income, which insulates the richest Americans.Yet while policy makers on both sides of the aisle want to get rid of the alternative tax, their proposed solutions would have opposite effects. President Trump and congressional Republicans want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax in the context of lowering tax rates \u2014 especially for those at the top of the income ladder. The richest would benefit the most. By contrast, Senator Sanders\u2019s plan to ditch the A.M.T. is part of an effort to raise rates on the wealthiest Americans.What is interesting about the impact of the alternative minimum tax on Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 tax return, however, is that it does not illustrate either side\u2019s criticisms. Rather, it seems to be a rare case where the alternative minimum tax functioned exactly as it was meant to: to require a wealthy multimillionaire to pay more of a fair share. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, he paid 25 percent of $153 million in taxable income instead of the less than 4 percent that he would have paid without it.\u201cTrump seems to have been hit by the A.M.T.,\u201d Mr. Gale said. \u201cAt least in that one case, it seems to have worked as intended.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

But chief among them is America\u2019s own immigration policy, and experts said they were not surprised to see a slowdown even before Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration have taken full effect or his signature wall has been built.\u201cDeterrence through perception is central to these executive orders,\u201d said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cEven floating the possibility of expanding detention at the border makes somebody less likely to come.\u201dMark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that favors more limits on immigration, said all signs pointed to a decline in migration similar to that seen after the Reagan administration\u2019s sweeping immigration reform law of 1986.

The comments suggested some tension between them as the vote draws nearer.\u201cWe receive complaints from people,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said in the remarks reported on state television, as translated by Reuters. \u201cPeople should feel improvements regarding creation of jobs and manufacturing. It is not the case now.\u201dIt is not yet clear who may run against Mr. Rouhani, a moderate cleric. While he is said to enjoy a longstanding relationship with Ayatollah Khamenei, the president is not well liked by some other hard-line conservative elements of Iran\u2019s political hierarchy.In the 2013 elections, Mr. Rouhani won against a field of comparatively conservative rivals, partly on his pledge to negotiate an end to the international sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear activities, which had left the country economically weakened and isolated.Yet while Mr. Rouhani has received credit for that achievement, Iran\u2019s economy has not flourished as hoped. Moreover, foreign investment in the country remains muted and tenuous, leaving Mr. Rouhani potentially vulnerable to conservative critics who say he compromised Iran\u2019s nuclear autonomy without any clear benefit.Mr. Rouhani and his associates have countered that Iran has improved economically compared with the era of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. They also say many foreign companies remain reluctant to invest in Iran because of non-nuclear related sanctions by the United States, part of the long history of animosity between the two countries.Economists also have partly attributed Iran\u2019s persistent economic weakness to reliance on sales of oil \u2014 its most important export \u2014 in a heavily glutted market that has left prices depressed.Punctuating that point, the benchmark grade of crude oil in the American market dropped below $50 a barrel Thursday to its weakest level since December.Ayatollah Khamenei appeared to express frustration on Thursday over what he described as the government\u2019s failure to achieve a \u201cresistance economy,\u201d a reference to self-sufficiency and less reliance on imports.He acknowledged there had been some economic improvements under Mr. Rouhani but also said that \u201cif the resistance economy had been implemented fully and widely, we could witness a tangible difference.\u201dWhile Ayatollah Khamenei endorsed the nuclear agreement, he also has expressed wariness about any step toward reconciliation with the United States, describing the Americans as duplicitous and malevolent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Has Gone So High, It\u2019s a Problem", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIt\u2019s a nice problem to have, but it\u2019s still a problem.Stocks have soared so high that a cautious person might start worrying about oxygen supply.In January, the Dow Jones industrial average reached 20,000 for the first time. It crossed the 21,000 mark on March 1, and while it slipped on Thursday and then had a late surge on Friday, it still seems to have plenty of power left in it.That means that if you\u2019ve been in the market for a while, you are likely to be perching on a mountain of profits. Should you stay where you are and hope for further gains, or is it time to declare victory and move your money to safer ground? That\u2019s an eternal question, one that returns whenever the market rises spectacularly. The answer depends, of course, on your analysis of two very different issues: the current situation in the markets, and the one in your own life.The raw numbers for the stock market are astonishing: Even without counting dividends, the Standard & Poor\u2019s index has risen more than 6 percent since New Year\u2019s Day, nearly 20 percent in the last 12 months and roughly 250 percent since the start of the bull market in March 2009.Market history shows how remarkable that performance is.The current bull run is now the second longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group, a research firm. It is surpassed in duration only by one that ran from December 1987 to March 2000.In terms of strength, it ranks third, well behind that 1987-2000 bull market, which had an eye-popping gain of 582 percent, but not very far from one that lasted from June 1949 until August 1956, in which the market rose 267 percent.In a telephone conversation, he said that while some of the market\u2019s recent action has been very strong \u2014 \u201ca huge move\u201d upward on Wednesday after President Trump\u2019s speech to Congress, for example \u2014 the stock market\u2019s path since 2009 has generally \u201cbeen a series of slow, grinding moves\u201d with little evidence of irrational exuberance.Clearly, though, market fundamentals are less auspicious than they were eight years ago, when stocks had been battered in the ferocious downturn of the great financial crisis, and investors with foresight and audacity could buy at rock-bottom prices.For example, one widely followed metric, the price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 which tells you how much money is being paid, on average, for $1 of corporate earnings \u2014 has become much less favorable. It has climbed to 22, well above its five-year average of 18.2, according to data from Bloomberg. Consider that in February 2009, the ratio plummeted to 12.1, a paltry level reflecting widespread fear that both corporate earnings and stock prices would plunge. That moment was a turning point for the market, which has surged upward ever since. It may not be at a peak now, but investors are inhaling rarefied air, whether they know it or not.Yet it can be argued, as Mr. Birinyi does, that corporate earnings are rising, the economy is expanding nicely, and investors have been reacting fairly cautiously, keeping valuations within reasonable, if not optimal, bounds.The increasing likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase would have been a problem a year ago, Mr. Birinyi said, but it is a positive portent at this stage, because it signals that the central bank is convinced that the economy is in good shape and will keep expanding.That said, he also warned that in the current market, restraint and agility are important. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go all in on stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be careful.\u201dMr. Birinyi sits in front of a terminal all day, trading individual stocks whenever the prices tell him it makes sense to do so, which most people couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t attempt. \u201cWe get out of a stock if the price is no longer right,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will buy it again when it\u2019s better. We\u2019re ready for whatever happens.\u201dMost of us aren\u2019t steady stock traders, and need to be prepared for downturns in other ways. And if little is accomplished in Washington to fulfill investor expectations \u2014 or if there is an external shock, such as an international crisis \u2014 the market could fall sharply, Mr. Birinyi acknowledged. Furthermore, if the economy falters in such situations, the long rally in stocks could end violently.But even if you\u2019re a very long-term investor, it\u2019s smart to take inventory. If, for example, you will need a chunk of your portfolio for a down payment on a house or to pay a tuition bill or to replace a roof or buy a car, you may want to liquidate some of it now, congratulating yourself on your gains. In addition, even if you don\u2019t need to use the money, selling securities that have incurred losses may be a good move, Mr. Birinyi said. Losses will offset gains when it\u2019s time to pay your taxes, and many investors these days are fortunate in having plenty of gains.In any case, it is surely wise to make sure, after a remarkable run in the stock market, that you will be able to handle a sharp downturn when it eventually comes. Personally, I\u2019ve salted away my savings in broad stock and bond indexes with money that I don\u2019t expect to need for years, and I\u2019m careful to limit my own stock allocation. I don\u2019t ignore the market. I examine it daily, and if I become convinced that it is shaky, I will reduce my own holdings \u2014 and say so \u2014 but haven\u2019t taken much off the table lately. We all have to live with our own choices. I\u2019m choosing to celebrate but also to be very careful.Advertisement"}

Ross, a seminal theorist whose work over three decades reshaped the field of financial economics, died on March 3 at his home in Old Lyme, Conn. He was 73.The cause was sudden cardiac arrest, his wife, Carol Ross, said.The theory, which he developed in 1976, makes clear how powerful economic factors like inflation or spikes in interest rates can influence the price of an asset. At its core, the theory offers a framework for analyzing risks and returns in financial markets.Professor Ross also delved into the mysteries of the stock market and its inherent risks. He coined the term agency theory, which has been instrumental in finance and economics. Using the theory, he explored how companies, through governance, can align incentives for managers with those for rank-and-file workers.He is also credited with pioneering what is known as the binomial model for pricing stock options.Professor Ross relished marshaling complex theories honed in the academic world and applying them to Wall Street, where they could be used to address practical problems. His contributions to the finance industry earned him the Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics in 2015.J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, a co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank at the time, said in a statement that Professor Ross\u2019s work was the \u201cfoundation for all the risk-factor models we use today.\u201dAntoinette Schoar, a Sloan professor and the head of the school\u2019s finance department, said in a phone interview that \u201call of Steve\u2019s intellectually intricate finance theories were aimed at solving real-world problems.\u201dHis models, Professor Schoar added, \u201cwere both extremely elegant and extremely practical.\u201dThe binomial model alone, she noted, is ubiquitous on Wall Street.Professor Ross possessed an agile intellect and cared above all about getting his research right, even if doing so meant updating or changing his models to improve them, his colleagues said.His passion for accuracy was behind his arbitrage pricing theory. The mathematical model identified assets that were fundamentally mispriced, because they were trading at either too high or too low a price, and could be used to determine their true value.Professor Ross\u2019s work was applied across a range of fields, including asset pricing, investment management and corporate finance. And he helped launch many successful financial careers.He was also an adviser to government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Commerce Department and the Treasury. He was president of the American Finance Association in 1988 and at one point chairman of the American Express Advisory Panel.He wrote more than 100 articles about finance and economics and, as a co-author, \u201cCorporate Finance,\u201d a textbook used at business schools across the country.Stephen Alan Ross was born on Feb. 3, 1944, in Boston and raised in Brookline, Mass. He graduated from the California Institute of Technology, where he majored in physics. He went on to get a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. Before joining the M.I.T. faculty, he taught at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and at Yale University.His work has been recognized with numerous awards, including the 2007 Jean-Jacques Laffont Prize from the Toulouse School of Economics.In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Katherine, and a son, Jonathan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Trump Advisers Are Split on Paris Agreement on Climate Change", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is fiercely divided over President Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris agreement, the 2015 accord that binds nearly every country to curb global warming, with more moderate voices maintaining that he should stick with the agreement despite his campaign pledge.Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, is pressing the president to officially pull the United States from the landmark accord, according to energy and government officials with knowledge of the debate. But, they say, he is clashing with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who fear the move could have broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications.Next week, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to start the lengthy legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from coal-fired power plants. Those regulations are the linchpin of the last administration\u2019s program to meet the nation\u2019s obligations to reduce climate emissions under the Paris agreement.While the president cannot, as Mr. Trump suggested, unilaterally undo a 194-nation accord that has already been legally ratified, he could initiate the four-year process to withdraw the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest climate polluter from the first worldwide deal to tackle global warming. Such a move would rend a global deal that has been hailed as historic, throwing into question the fate of global climate policy and, diplomats say, the credibility of the United States.But it would also demonstrate to his supporters that Mr. Trump is a man of his word, putting American coal interests ahead of a global deal forged by Mr. Obama.On one side of that debate is Mr. Bannon, who as a former chief executive of Breitbart News published countless articles denouncing climate change as a hoax, and who has vowed to push Mr. Trump to transform all his major campaign promises into policy actions.On the other side are Ms. Trump, Mr. Tillerson, and a slew of foreign policy advisers and career diplomats who argue that the fallout of withdrawing from the accord could be severe, undercutting the United States\u2019 credibility on other foreign policy issues and damaging relations with key allies.Although Ms. Trump has not spoken out publicly for action to combat climate change, proponents and opponents of such action see her as an ally. Former Vice President Al Gore met with her during the Trump transition, and was ushered in by the \u201cfirst daughter\u201d to see the president-elect. The actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio even slipped her a DVD copy of his climate-change documentary.Mr. Trump wants to make a decision by next week, say people familiar with the White House\u2019s debate on the climate pact, in order to announce his executive order to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s climate regulations in conjunction with his plans for the Paris deal.\u201cIf the goal is to fulfill the president\u2019s campaign promises and implement his agenda, there is no value in staying in Paris,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, an adviser to the Trump transition and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have worked for years to undermine climate-change policies.Mr. Trump has cited Mr. Pyle\u2019s group as being influential in shaping his energy and climate proposals, including his campaign pledge to withdraw from the Paris deal.\u201cThe two greatest obstacles to a Clexit (climate exit from U.N. Paris agreement) are probably Ivanka and Tillerson,\u201d wrote Marc Morano, a former Republican Senate staff member who now runs Climate Depot, a fossil-fuel-industry-funded website that promotes the denial of climate science, in an email. \u201cTillerson with his \u2018seat at the table\u2019 views could be biggest proponent of not withdrawing the U.S. from the agreement.\u201dMr. Tillerson is a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which, like many major global corporations, endorsed the Paris agreement. While his former company once denied human-caused climate change, it has more recently publicly acknowledged the threat posed by burning oil and supported proposals to tax carbon dioxide pollution.Asked during his Senate confirmation hearing about the Paris accord, Mr. Tillerson said, \u201cIt\u2019s important that the U.S. maintains its seat at the table about how to address the threat of climate change, which does require a global response.\u201dUnder the Paris agreement, every nation has formally submitted plans detailing how it expects to lower its planet-warming pollution. The Obama administration pledged that the United States would reduce its carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. However, that pledge depends on enactment of Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations on coal-fired power plants, which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt intend to substantially weaken or eliminate.But under the Paris deal, those numerical targets are not legally binding, and there are no sanctions for failing to meet them. The primary legal requirements of the deal are that countries publicly put forth their emissions reductions targets, and later put forth reports verifying how they are meeting the targets. It would be possible for the Trump administration to stay in the deal and submit a less ambitious target.Even senior Republican voices in the foreign policy debate have said it may be wiser to stay in but keep a low profile.\u201cThere\u2019s really no obligation,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require us to do anything. I think they may take a little time to assess whether pulling out makes sense now.\u201dForeign policy experts say withdrawing from Paris would have far greater diplomatic consequences than President George W. Bush\u2019s withdrawal from the world\u2019s first global climate-change accord, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.\u201cI think it would be a major mistake, even a historic mistake, to disavow the Paris deal,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat and under secretary of state under Mr. Bush.\u201cIn international politics, trust, reliability and keeping your commitments \u2014 that\u2019s a big part of how other countries view our country,\u201d Mr. Burns said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an issue, except perhaps NATO, where if the U.S. simply walks away, it would have such a major negative impact on how we are seen.\u201dThe Paris deal is more consequential than Kyoto. Unlike that pact, which required action only from developed economies, the Paris agreement includes commitments from every nation, rich and poor, to cut emissions, including China and India, the world\u2019s largest and third-largest polluters. Also, the science of climate change has become far more certain and the impact more visible in the 20 years since Kyoto. Each of the last three years has surpassed the previous one as the hottest on record.Some of the United States\u2019 closest allies are urging the Trump administration not to pull out. In a letter to Mr. Trump after he won the election, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wrote, \u201cPartnership with the United States is and will remain a keystone of German foreign policy, especially so that we can tackle the great challenges of our time.\u201d They include, she wrote, \u201cworking to develop farsighted climate policy.\u201dAs Mr. Trump and his advisers weigh their Paris options, one proposal is gaining traction, according to participants in the debate: Mr. Trump could declare that the Paris agreement is a treaty that requires ratification by the Senate. The pact was designed not to have the legal force of a treaty specifically so that it would not have to go before the United States Senate, which would have assuredly failed to ratify it.\u201cIf there are camps forming in the White House, then let the people decide, the elected representatives,\u201d Mr. Pyle said. \u201cLet\u2019s put the question to them.\u201dProponents of that idea say it could shift some of the weight of the decision from Mr. Trump to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, at least in the eyes of some foreign diplomats, and of the president\u2019s daughter.An article on Friday about a disagreement among aides to President Trump over the Paris climate change accord referred incorrectly to the agreement\u2019s legal requirements that countries publicly put forth their emissions reductions targets, and later put forth reports verifying how they are meeting the targets. Those are the primary \u2014 not only \u2014 requirements. (Countries must show that they have taken some steps toward meeting the targets.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Robot Geometry (Very Wonkish)", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "But I have to admit that I was having a bit of a hard time wrapping my mind around exactly what he\u2019s saying, or how to picture this in terms of standard economic frameworks. So I found myself wanting to see how much of his story could be captured in a small general equilibrium model \u2014 basically the kind of model I learned many years ago when studying the old trade theory.Actually, my sense is that this kind of analysis is a bit of a lost art. There was a time when most of trade theory revolved around diagrams illustrating two-country, two-good, two-factor models; these days, not so much. And it\u2019s true that little models can be misleading, and geometric reasoning can suck you in way too much. It\u2019s also true, however, that this style of modeling can help a lot in thinking through how the pieces of an economy fit together, in ways that algebra or verbal storytelling can\u2019t.Imagine an economy that produces only one good, but can do so using two techniques, A and B, one capital-intensive, one labor-intensive. I represent these techniques in Figure 1 by showing their unit input coefficients:Here AB is the economy\u2019s unit isoquant, the various combinations of K and L it can use to produce one unit of output. E is the economy\u2019s factor endowment; as long as the aggregate ratio of K to L is between the factor intensities of the two techniques, both will be used. In that case, the wage-rental ratio will be the slope of the line AB.Wait, there\u2019s more. Since any point on the line passing through A and B has the same value, the place where it hits the horizontal axis is the amount of labor it takes to buy one unit of output, the inverse of the real wage rate. And total output is the ratio of the distance along the ray to E divided by the distance to AB, so that distance is 1/GDP.You can also derive the allocation of resources between A and B; not to clutter up the diagram even further, I show this in Figure 2, which uses the K/L ratios of the two techniques and the overall endowment E:Now, Avent\u2019s story. I think it can be represented as technical progress in A, perhaps also making A even more capital-intensive. So this would amount to a movement southwest to a point like A\u2019 in Figure 3:We can see right away that this will lead to a fall in the real wage, because 1/w must rise. GDP and hence productivity does rise, but maybe not by much if the economy was mostly using the labor-intensive technique.And what about allocation of labor between sectors? We can see this in Figure 4, where capital-using technical progress in A actually leads to a higher share of the work force being employed in labor-intensive B:So yes, it is possible for a simple general equilibrium analysis to capture a lot of what Avent is saying. That does not, of course, mean that he\u2019s empirically right. And there are other things in his argument, such as hypothesized effects on the direction of innovation, that aren\u2019t in here. But I, at least, find this way of looking at it somewhat clarifying \u2014 which, to be honest, may say more about my weirdness and intellectual age than it does about the subject.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Large Sections of Australia\u2019s Great Reef Are Now Dead, Scientists Find", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Great Barrier Reef in Australia has long been one of the world\u2019s most magnificent natural wonders, so enormous it can be seen from space, so beautiful it can move visitors to tears.But the reef, and the profusion of sea creatures living near it, are in profound trouble.Huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef, stretching across hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector, were recently found to be dead, killed last year by overheated seawater. More southerly sections around the middle of the reef that barely escaped then are bleaching now, a potential precursor to another die-off that could rob some of the reef\u2019s most visited areas of color and life.The damage to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the world\u2019s largest living structures, is part of a global calamity that has been unfolding intermittently for nearly two decades and seems to be intensifying. In the paper, dozens of scientists described the recent disaster as the third worldwide mass bleaching of coral reefs since 1998, but by far the most widespread and damaging.The state of coral reefs is a telling sign of the health of the seas. Their distress and death are yet another marker of the ravages of global climate change.If most of the world\u2019s coral reefs die, as scientists fear is increasingly likely, some of the richest and most colorful life in the ocean could be lost, along with huge sums from reef tourism. In poorer countries, lives are at stake: Hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish, and the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis.With this latest global bleaching in its third year, reef scientists say they have no doubt as to the responsible party.They warned decades ago that the coral reefs would be at risk if human society kept burning fossil fuels at a runaway pace, releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean. Emissions continued to rise, and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs.\u201cClimate change is not a future threat,\u201d Professor Hughes said. \u201cOn the Great Barrier Reef, it\u2019s been happening for 18 years.\u201dCorals require warm water to thrive, but they are exquisitely sensitive to extra heat. Just two or three degrees Fahrenheit of excess warming can sometimes kill the tiny creatures.It was obvious last year that the corals on many reefs were likely to die, but now formal scientific assessments are coming in. The paper in Nature documents vast coral bleaching in 2016 along a 500-mile section of the reef north of Cairns, a city on Australia\u2019s eastern coast.Bleaching indicates that corals are under heat stress, but they do not always die and cooler water can help them recover. Subsequent surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, conducted late last year after the deadline for inclusion in the Nature paper, documented that extensive patches of reef had in fact died, and would not be likely to recover soon, if at all.His aerial surveys, combined with underwater measurements, found that 67 percent of the corals had died in a long stretch north of Port Douglas, and in patches, the mortality reached 83 percent.By luck, a storm stirred the waters in the central and southern parts of the reef at a critical moment, cooling them, and mortality there was much lower \u2014 about 6 percent in a stretch off Townsville, and even lower in the southernmost part of the reef.Professor Hughes said he hoped the die-off this time would not be as serious as last year\u2019s, but \u201cback-to-back bleaching is unheard-of in Australia.\u201d The central and southern part of the reef had already been badly damaged by human activities like dredging and pollution.\u201cThe reefs in muddy water were just as fried as those in pristine water,\u201d Professor Hughes said. \u201cThat\u2019s not good news in terms of what you can do locally to prevent bleaching \u2014 the answer to that is not very much at all. You have to address climate change directly.\u201dAustralia relies on the Great Barrier Reef for about 70,000 jobs and billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue, and it is not yet clear how that economy will be affected by the reef\u2019s deterioration. Even in hard-hit areas, large patches of the Great Barrier Reef survived, and guides will most likely take tourists there, avoiding the dead zones.The global reef crisis does not necessarily mean extinction for coral species. The corals may save themselves, as many other creatures are attempting to do, by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms, establishing new reefs in cooler water.But the changes humans are causing are so rapid, by geological standards, that it is not entirely clear that coral species will be able to keep up. And even if the corals do survive, that does not mean individual reefs will continue to thrive where they do now.Coral reefs are sensitive systems, built by unusual animals. The corals themselves are tiny polyps that act like farmers, capturing colorful single-celled plants called algae that convert sunlight into food. The coral polyps form colonies and build a limestone scaffolding on which to live \u2014 a reef.But when the water near a reef gets too hot, the algae begin producing toxins, and the corals expel them in self-defense, turning ghostly white. If water temperatures drop soon enough, the corals can grow new algae and survive, but if not, they may succumb to starvation or disease.Even when the corals die, some reefs eventually recover. If water temperatures stay moderate, the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years.But the temperature of the ocean is now high enough that global mass bleaching events seem to be growing more frequent. If they become routine, many of the world\u2019s hard-hit coral reefs may never be able to re-establish themselves.Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Great Barrier Reef will ever again be as great as it used to be \u2014 at least not in our lifetimes,\u201d said C.

{"Headline": "Shadow Lending Threatens China\u2019s Economy, Officials Warn", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The chairman of China\u2019s biggest bank and a senior Chinese insurance regulator issued strong warnings on Saturday about the dangers of shadow banking to the Chinese economy, in the latest signs of growing top-level concern here about a rise in highly speculative, poorly regulated lending.Shadow banking, or lending that takes place outside official banking channels, plays a major role in the Chinese economy, where big government-controlled banks are often slow to lend to private businesses and entrepreneurs. But experts worry that untrammeled shadow lending could lead to ticking time bombs that could threaten the financial system of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Shadow banking \u201cis not subject to full regulation, or any regulation at all,\u201d Mr. Yi said. \u201cWe have to focus. If not, the real economy will suffer.\u201dChen Wenhui, the vice chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, said Chinese regulators were particularly trying to understand the swift expansion of internet lending platforms that are raising huge sums of money from the general public. Many of these lending platforms, which offer big returns and accept minimum contributions low enough to entice common workers, have disclosed fairly little about how they will invest the money they raise.The general public appears to be pouring large sums into new investment vehicles despite receiving scant disclosure, Mr. Chen said.\u201cThey just buy the investments,\u201d he added, \u201cThey have no idea what the product is.\u201dMr. Yi and Mr. Chen spoke at a panel on Chinese finance at the China Development Forum, an annual, three-day gathering that started here on Saturday and has mustered a long list of the world\u2019s most famous economists in addition to many top Chinese government and business leaders.Part of that borrowing went to pay for heavy investments in new infrastructure, like high-speed rail lines, and new factories for state-owned enterprises.But much of the lending appears to represent a speculative frenzy, often involving residential real estate, that has become of increasing concern to some Chinese officials, bankers and economists. Real estate prices in large and medium-size cities climbed 12 percent in the 12 months that ended in February, the National Bureau of Statistics said this week.Some kinds of shadow banking have seen spectacular growth, like entrusted loans. Entrusted loans are loans from one company to another, usually done through a bank to get around a ban on Chinese companies lending directly to each other. These loans \u2014 which are also kept off the books of banks \u2014 jumped 20 percent in the 12 months through the end of January, and now account for 9 percent of overall credit in China, according to a report last month from Natixis, a French-owned financial services firm.China\u2019s leaders insist that they understand the risks and contend that they will be able to control them. They say measures such as government and household debt as a percentage of economic output are not alarming by international standards, nor have bad loans as a percentage of overall bank loans reached a worrying level.\u201cWe are fully aware of potential risks and will take prompt and targeted action,\u201d Premier Li Keqiang said at his annual news conference on Wednesday.But as Mr. Yi\u2019s and Mr. Chen\u2019s comments underlined on Saturday, worries in China are focusing on how Chinese financial institutions raise the money that they lend \u2014 and what could happen if investors suddenly demand much of that money back.Mr. Yi\u2019s remarks to some extent represented an unusually blunt criticism of his bank\u2019s smaller competitors. I.C.B.C. is one of the so-called Big Four state-controlled banks that make up nearly half the country\u2019s banking system. Each of the four \u2014 the others are the China Construction Bank, the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China \u2014 has thousands of branches to collect deposits, a stable source of financing, although the banks also sell some wealth management products.Lacking that big deposit base, many smaller banks rely more heavily on the sale of wealth management products. Because banks usually keep those obligations off their books, they have greater flexibility to lend to more speculative projects and use the proceeds to pay higher interest to investors \u2014 provided that the more speculative borrowers repay their loans.Mr. Yi took aim at all risky forms of borrowing on Saturday. \u201cIf we do not deal correctly with shadow banking, the risks could be huge,\u201d he said, adding that the result had been \u201chigher leverage, too many derivatives and too many products with no transparency.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Gets Right on Trade", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Whatever confusion people might have about President Trump\u2019s agenda, his position on trade and manufacturing is crystal clear. \u201cI believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade,\u201d he said in his address to Congress Tuesday night. He called for corporate tax reform and export incentives, and he lashed out at Nafta and China for draining America\u2019s manufacturing base.Mr. Trump\u2019s stance on trade is one of his most popular positions, but many economists and policy makers are skeptical: They say that rapid automation will negate any gains made in bringing manufacturing jobs back, while the tariffs and other policies he has suggested using will ignite disastrous trade wars.The doubters are wrong on both points. American manufacturing\u2019s most advanced sectors remain big employers, and much of their payroll shrinkage stems from predatory competition from high- and low-wage countries, as well as offshoring by American multinationals. And the trade-war alarmists overlook the matchless, yet overwhelmingly neglected, leverage America holds over the global economy.Although cheap, labor-intensive goods often come to mind when Americans think of job-displacing imports, the more capital- and technology-intensive segments of manufacturing have hardly been immune. Sectors like motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment, nonelectrical machinery (like machine tools, farm machinery and power-generating turbines) and industrial chemicals add up to nearly half of manufacturing\u2019s enormous, chronic annual trade deficits nowadays.Such sectors still employ millions of Americans. For example, more than 947,900 jobs are currently found in automotive production (including 145,700 in the highest-value segments, like engines and powertrains and their parts), nearly 360,000 in semiconductor and related manufacturing, more than one million in machinery and more than 200,000 in pharmaceuticals. And a recent Commerce Department report indicates that in 2014 their trade shortfalls alone \u2014 leaving aside any impact from labor-saving technologies \u2014 cost more than 200,000 jobs, both in the industries themselves and throughout their American supply and logistics chains.Since then, moreover, trade deficits in advanced manufacturing have worsened, and the stagnation of productivity growth suggests that the robots have been replacing fewer workers. So trade-related job loss in these sectors surely has grown \u2014 and smart, pro-domestic manufacturing policies can bring them back.As for trade-war alarmists, they apparently assume that the same countries that rely so heavily on exports to the United States for their growth, economic development and employment will unleash attacks on their biggest and best customer.The United States is not only the world\u2019s biggest single national economy, but for all its recent sluggishness, it has also generally been the fastest-growing major economy, and it is the most open to imports. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the single largest export market for a fifth of the world\u2019s countries. That\u2019s why it has remained the world\u2019s largest consumer of foreign goods, despite slashing its previously huge purchases of foreign oil. That\u2019s largely why each percentage point of new American growth lifts global growth by much more than similar expansion in China, and nearly as much as growth in the euro area \u2014 which unlike the United States is relatively poor in natural resources and needs to buy many more commodities from overseas. That\u2019s also why nearly all leading countries and groupings \u2014 including the eurozone \u2014 have long-run trade surpluses with the United States.The United States plays an even more central role in countries that have come into Mr. Trump\u2019s trade crosshairs. Slow-growing Mexico, for example, would be performing much more sluggishly if it were not able to export the equivalent of 28 percent of its annual economic output to the United States. Its auto shipments to America alone are its biggest generator of foreign exchange reserves.True, China\u2019s economy is stronger and gradually becoming less export-dependent than Mexico\u2019s, but its growth slowdown has been crucially contained by the $600 billion (by its own dubious count) global trade surplus it amassed last year \u2014 nearly half of which is run with the United States. Indeed, China\u2019s sales to America constituted 4.4 percent of its annual economic output in 2015.Further, the numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. After all, governments in institutionally weak countries like Mexico, or undemocratic countries like China, tend to stay in power by lifting national living standards. Losing unfettered access to the American market could undermine the leaderships in both countries.It\u2019s unclear which trade measures Mr. Trump will use to draw factories and their workers stateside. Nor has he announced domestic policies to aid these efforts. But the official manufacturing job and trade statistics make entirely obvious that the rewards to the American economy will be substantial. And as Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday made clear, America has a president who understands its ample power to reap them.Alan Tonelson, the founder of RealityChek, a blog on economic and national security policy, and the author of \u201cThe Race to the Bottom,\u201d advised both the Trump and Sanders campaigns on trade policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Fuels Feeling in Scotland That Time Is Right for Independence", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byThat, one senior British diplomat said of the looming fight with Scotland, is the last thing London needs.Adding to Westminster\u2019s troubles, on Tuesday the leader of Sinn Fein, the Irish nationalist party, called for a referendum on Northern Ireland\u2019s leaving the United Kingdom and joining Ireland \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Even Welsh nationalists, sniffing an opportunity, began discussing independence.Holding a legally binding referendum in Scotland would require the approval of London. Few expect the authorities in Westminster to reject the request, but they could delay the timing, which some say would reduce the likelihood of a vote for independence.The last referendum was billed as a once-in-a-generation event, but the decision to leave the European Union has changed that. Sixty-two percent of Scots voted to remain in the bloc, making Scotland more pro-European even than London.The result crystallized a long-held feeling among Scots that a right-wing Conservative government in London did not represent them and their more-progressive sensibilities. And with the opposition Labour Party in crisis, the Conservative Party looks set to remain in power in London for years \u2014 possibly \u201cuntil 2030 or beyond,\u201d as Ms. Sturgeon put it on Monday.\u201cScotland hasn\u2019t voted Conservative in decades and yet has been ruled by a Conservative government for most of that time,\u201d said Mhairi Black, a Scottish National Party lawmaker in the British Parliament. \u201cWe voted against Brexit, and people are feeling the injustice of it.\u201dThe call for a new referendum has pitted Ms. Sturgeon, the pugnacious leader of Scotland\u2019s semiautonomous legislature, dominated by her Scottish National Party, against the tenacious prime minister, Mrs. May, whose Conservatives have an absolute majority in the British Parliament.It has also set two radically different brands of nationalism and economic policy against each other.As the language of national identity gains traction in the West, Scotland is no exception. But the Scottish brand of nationalism looks very different from the far-right varieties that have sprung up elsewhere \u2014 not least in neighboring England, where the U.K. Independence Party has been the noisiest supporter of Britain\u2019s withdrawal and part of the reason the once pro-European Conservative Party now takes a hard line on immigration, too.Rather than an exclusive nationalism rooted in ethnicity, Scottish nationalists speak of an inclusive civic nationalism that can accommodate American-style hyphenated identities.Humza Yousaf, Scotland\u2019s transportation minister and the son of Kenyan and Pakistani immigrants, summed it up: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, what matters is where we\u2019re going as a nation. You can be Pakistani-Scottish, Polish-Scottish, even English-Scottish.\u201dFor Ms. Sturgeon and Mrs. May, it is a winner-take-all political challenge. Ms. Sturgeon knows that she would need to win a new referendum; another loss would bury all hopes of secession for the foreseeable future. Nationalists point to the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec, where two independence bids failed, diminishing a once-vibrant secessionist movement.But in recent months, Scottish efforts to secure a special status in the withdrawal negotiations \u2014 such as access to Europe\u2019s single market \u2014 have fallen on deaf ears. \u201cOur efforts at compromise have instead been met with a brick wall of intransigence,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said on Monday.A measure of how icy relations between London and Edinburgh have turned is that Ms. Sturgeon\u2019s call for a new referendum seemed to catch Mrs. May by surprise \u2014 and might have been the reason she postponed an expected announcement on starting European exit talks on Tuesday.Mrs. May\u2019s frustration was evident. Accusing her Scottish counterpart of \u201ctunnel vision,\u201d the prime minister dismissed the proposed timetable for a Scottish referendum, in the autumn of 2018 or the spring of 2019, as \u201cthe worst possible timing.\u201dMs. Sturgeon wants to hold the vote toward the end of the two-year withdrawal negotiations that are to start this month. By that time, the outlines of a deal \u2014 one that would almost certainly leave Britain, and Scotland, outside the free trade area of the single market \u2014 would have become clearer. But Britain would not yet have left the European Union.Officials in London would prefer to postpone a vote until after the exit, when the Scots would face the prospect of being outside both Britain and the European Union.Before the last independence vote, Scots were told by London that the surest way to stay in the European Union was a vote to stay in the United Kingdom. Now that it has turned out to be a one-way ticket out of Europe, some Scots who opposed secession before have switched sides.However things work out, there is an unmistakable note of destiny building in nationalist circles.Three decades ago, Scotland\u2019s independence movement was little more than a fringe voice of romantic protest. Only one in four Scots voted for the nationalists. They have been galvanized above all by a sense of being ignored and patronized by the British Parliament, from the long and unpopular government of the former Conservative prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, through to the vote to leave the European Union.The Thatcher era, which politicized a generation of Scots and recruited activists like Ms. Sturgeon to the nationalist cause, changed Scotland, said Catriona MacDonald, a historian at Glasgow University. The political nationalism of the Scottish National Party is symptomatic of the Scotland that grew out of that time, she said. \u201cSurviving the Thatcher years emboldened Scottishness but it didn\u2019t essentialize it, it made it more accommodating \u2014 the opposite of UKIP,\u201d Ms. MacDonald said, referring to the U.K. Independence Party.In theory, the cards should be stacked against independence.But as the economic case for independence has weakened, for many, the emotional and political case has strengthened.Ms. Black, who has said that she may not run for re-election to the British Parliament because she found it \u201cdepressing,\u201d said she was angered by the idea \u201cthat you should vote against independence because the U.K. economy will suffer after Brexit.\u201dThese are fast-moving times and \u201cwith independence comes control,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you not rather know that when something happens you are able to respond instead of being at the mercy of a government you didn\u2019t vote for?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Since Trump, Quiet Upstate Road Becomes a Busy Exit From U.S.", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Residents of Champlain, N.Y., watch as migrants, both adults and children, use a country road to reach Canada, where they can seek asylum.Supported byCHAMPLAIN, N.Y. \u2014 Roxham Road is a quiet country road jutting off another quiet country road, where a couple of horses munch on soggy hay and a ditch running along the muddy pavement flows with melted snow. It cuts through a thicket of dormant trees, passing a half-dozen trailer homes and after almost a mile runs into a line of boulders and a rusted railing with a sign: Road Closed.Chris Crowningshiele has been driving a cab, on and off, for 30 years in this rural corner of upstate New York known as the North Country. He lives south of here in Plattsburgh, and his fares usually come from ferrying students from a state university there or picking shoppers up at a Walmart in his gray minivan. But in recent weeks, riders have been asking him \u2014 two, three, sometimes as many as seven times a day \u2014 to bring them to the end of Roxham Road.Mr. Crowningshiele picks up passengers in Plattsburgh, mostly at the airport or the bus station, and over the 25-mile drive north, they have told him that they had traveled from across the country. Some were migrants from Yemen and Turkey. They confided that they were fearful, of what was happening in the countries they wanted to leave behind \u2014 not just their homeland but now also the United States \u2014 and of what they faced once they stepped out of Mr. Crowningshiele\u2019s cab.\u201cYou wonder what\u2019s going through their heads, you know?\u201d he said. Many of his passengers have been families, with parents carrying young children and whatever possessions they could take with them.\u201cPeople just want to live their life,\u201d Mr. Crowningshiele, 48, said, \u201cand not be scared.\u201dGiven their proximity to Canada, people around here have always had some awareness of the world beyond the border. A pop music station in Montreal comes through clearly on the radio, and it is not all that unusual to make a run to the other side to shop. But the steady stream of cabs that have started driving up Roxham Road has forced them to reckon with life on the border and decisions made in Washington in ways they never have before.This is not exactly Trump Country. In Clinton County, which includes Champlain, Hillary Clinton eclipsed Mr. Trump by 610 votes. Many residents on Roxham Road said they did not bother to vote and had followed politics just enough to feel disenchanted, if not disgusted.\u201cI used to just blow everything off,\u201d said Melissa Beshaw, whose house is the second to last before the border. \u201cI was never into politics until this road became famous.\u201dShe, like some others, was quick to assign blame to Mr. Trump. Immigration advocates in Canada said the reasons for fleeing were more complicated: The president\u2019s executive order in January on immigration that affected countries that are mostly Muslim was certainly a factor, but so were frustration with the immigration process in general and concern over anti-Muslim rhetoric.Migrants have been coming to places like Roxham Road not because they want to sneak over the border; the expectation is to walk right into the arms of the Canadian authorities. An agreement between the United States and Canada makes it virtually impossible for them to ask for asylum at a legal border crossing; Canadian border officials would have to turn them back. But a technicality allows them to bypass the agreement by illegally setting foot in Canada.\u201cOnce they get arrested, they\u2019re already on Canadian soil,\u201d said Jean-S\u00e9bastien Boudreault, the president of the Quebec Immigration Lawyers Association, \u201cso we have to let them do a refugee claim.\u201dJust after a gentle rain let up on a recent afternoon, a blue Prius with a yellow taxi sign perched on its roof approached the border.A husband and wife got out. He loaded on a backpack, a duffel bag and several shopping bags. She carried a young boy. The couple declined to speak with a reporter, though the man said they were Turkish. The family was the second spotted arriving that day on Roxham Road, with at least two other cabs coming later. By the count of the people living on the road, it was a slow day. Almost 20 people had come the day before.As the family approached the border, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told them it was not legal for them to enter here. If they continued, he said, they would be arrested.\u201cI apologize about this,\u201d the man replied, his voice unsure, \u201cbut I have to break your rules.\u201dHe paused.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe couple hopped across a narrow, mucky creek that divides the two countries. A Canadian officer gently grabbed the woman\u2019s left arm as she held her son in the crook of her right arm, helping her up.Lawyers said families like this one were usually taken to immigration offices at the nearest legal border crossing, where they can officially ask for asylum. If they have identification and do not appear to pose a security threat, the lawyers said, they are typically released and given a bus ticket to Montreal, where they wait for a hearing on their refugee status. Many of them are staying at a Y.M.C.A. there.The border crossings, despite being freighted with emotion, happen quickly and can seem almost procedural, occurring over and over every day in recent weeks.Tony George Hogle Sr. has lived on Roxham Road for almost 25 years, moving in when it was still a strip of dirt. He said that years ago the road had been an official crossing. He certainly has noticed the pickup in traffic recently. He has seen people left at the intersection, forced to drag their suitcases a mile through the snow. His sleep apnea keeps him awake, he said, and he has seen taxis creeping up the road in the dead of night.Mr. Hogle did not vote in November and said he was \u201cleery\u201d of Mr. Trump. On some counts, he said, the president is \u201cdoing all right.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises about the economy and bringing back jobs had some appeal. There are some jobs around here, mostly in warehouses, Mr. Hogle said, but he wished there was better-paying work. He used to be a forklift driver in a warehouse before a medical condition left him on disability. His wife works at a gas station and at a discount store.\u201cI think what he set out to do, he\u2019s doing,\u201d Mr. Hogle, 54, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of his word.\u201dHe understood the president\u2019s motivation in pursuing his immigration policies, but the situation at his own doorstep made him question the \u201cway he went about it.\u201d\u201cI can see his point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to protect the United States. It\u2019s hard. Some are good. Not everybody\u2019s bad. Just like the white man \u2014 you have good ones and you have bad ones. There should be something better than this.\u201dAcross the street from Mr. Hogle, Matthew Turner said the influx had been unsettling. \u201cI\u2019m not O.K. with it,\u201d he said of the border crossings, \u201cbut I definitely can\u2019t blame them.\u201d He recently discovered the lock on his shed had been tampered with and worried that border security was not tight enough.\u201cI used to hunt along the border,\u201d said Parker Cashman, who was staying with Mr. Turner, \u201cand there\u2019s too many places where it\u2019s too easy to cross.\u201d\u201cMaybe we need to build a wall!\u201d Mr. Turner replied, jokingly. \u201cHave Canada pay for it!\u201dHe pointed out that Roxham Road can be hard to find. Until recently, if you typed it into Google Maps, the pinpoint landed on a roadway on the other side of the border. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like this road doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Mr. Turner, a 21-year-old warehouse worker.It is unclear how the border hoppers, as some call them, first found Roxham Road. There are moments when residents are frustrated by it, like the day when local television stations discovered what was happening and came out with their satellite trucks. But, mostly, they sympathize with the people passing through.Ms. Beshaw, who stays at home to raise two grandsons in her custody, said she had never had a conversation or even shared a word with the migrants. But she has watched as the taxis arrive again and again, and she sees the passengers, especially the children, getting out and trudging through rain, snow and bitter cold.\u201cI don\u2019t feel sorry for the adults as much as the kids,\u201d she said. Still, she understands their motivation. \u201cAll they want is a life like what we have,\u201d she said.Ms. Beshaw also wishes that life for her would return to how it was just a few weeks ago. \u201cIt was a quiet road,\u201d she said wistfully.As dusk settled in, dogs could be heard yapping through the woods, and Ms. Beshaw\u2019s grandsons pedaled around on their bicycles, chasing each other.Before long, darkness blanketed the trees and stars freckled the vast country sky. All was quiet on Roxham Road, except for the babbling water in the ditch. Still, just over the border, Mounties were posted on a muddy hill, waiting for the next car to arrive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Serbia Prepares to Elect a President Amid a Murky Media Landscape", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 When he was Serbia\u2019s information minister in the late 1990s, Aleksandar Vucic censored journalists, forced media critics out of business and served as chief propagandist for the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman reviled for the atrocities that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia.Today Mr. Vucic is the prime minister of Serbia, having been elected in 2014 as a reformer on promises to lead Serbia into a democratic future and membership in the European Union. He has renounced the extreme nationalist views of his past.Western leaders rely on him as a partner to maintain calm within the Serbian minorities in Kosovo and Bosnia, to support their migration policies and to keep sufficient distance from Russia \u2014 even though Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has professed his support for Mr. Vucic.However, Serbian journalists who have reported critically on Mr. Vucic say that little has really changed. They say that tactics of harassment and intimidation have made it almost impossible to do fair-minded journalism.\u201cS&M French Spy?\u201d was the lead headline in one issue.Other articles accused Mr. Dojcinovic of working alternately for organized crime, the businessman and philanthropist George Soros and Western intelligence agencies, without explaining how he managed to juggle working for all three at the same time.\u201cYou can\u2019t hold democratic elections in an undemocratic environment,\u201d Mr. Dojcinovic said.The repressive news media environment is one reason there is little coverage of Mr. Vucic\u2019s latest gambit: He is seeking Serbia\u2019s presidency and will face 10 other candidates on the ballot this Sunday. He is widely expected to win, but hopes to avoid a runoff. If the front-runner does not receive a majority of all votes, a runoff will be held on April 16, and the results of that head-to-head matchup might be less predictable.Mr. Vucic says he will resign as prime minister if he is elected. Although the president\u2019s job is mostly ceremonial on paper, it would give Mr. Vucic the ability to consolidate his power over all of Serbia\u2019s institutions: the ruling party, the Parliament, the government and now the presidency, which is supposed to be above politics.(The incumbent, Tomislav Nikolic, decided not to seek a second five-year term.)An opposition candidate, Vuk Jeremic, says the Serbian media landscape has become more murky, dangerous and even lawless, with journalists facing economic pressures and media owners facing threats and intimidation, smear campaigns by pro-government media and personal attacks from Mr. Vucic and his allies.\u201cIt has never been like this before, this kind of disbalance and inequity,\u201d says Mr. Jeremic, a former foreign minister, who says he almost exclusively uses social media to reach voters. \u201cIn this abnormal situation, you can\u2019t even start talking about freedom of expression.\u201dDejan Anastasijevic, 55, a reporter at Vreme, a weekly newsmagazine, said Serbia has \u201cnever had a really free and fair election for all candidates,\u201d but this election even surpasses past ones in the absence of a real fight.\u201cThere\u2019s no real debate anywhere,\u201d Mr. Anastasijevic said. The range in commentary is no more diverse than \u201cpro-Vucic\u201d and \u201cextremely pro-Vucic\u201d views, he said.Mr. Anastasijevic said the situation was in some ways even worse than during the time of Mr. Milosevic, who focused his propaganda on the state media while allowing a robust if small opposition press to operate \u201cas a fig leaf to show that he was not a dictator.\u201d\u201cToday there is less freedom of speech and more risk if you criticize Vucic or his associates,\u201d Mr. Anastasijevic said. \u201cHis inner circle controls most of the economy of Serbia, not just state companies but the private sector as well.\u201dA spokesman said Mr. Vucic was campaigning and unavailable for comment.One of Mr. Vucic\u2019s most vocal supporters is Dragan Vucicevic, the editor and owner of The Informer, which is known for salacious and sordid cover articles, many of them targeting Mr. Vucic\u2019s critics.\u201cEvery newspaper must have an attitude and in this newspaper Serbia and Serbian national interests always come first,\u201d Mr. Vucicevic said in an interview at an office where a portrait of Mr. Putin in a black fur cap looked down from the wall.While Mr. Vucicevic freely admits to being \u201cold friends\u201d with Mr. Vucic, he rejects accusations that The Informer is a political attack dog.\u201cWe are the only independent media in Serbia,\u201d Mr. Vucicevic says. \u201cIndependent from the U.S. government, George Soros, the evil European Union, the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Democratic Institute,\u201d he added, referring to Western entities that support press freedom but are often portrayed in right-wing media as henchmen for Washington.Since Mr. Milosevic left power, \u201cwhat little democratic gains we have made over the last 15 years are now going down the drain,\u201d said Jelena Milic, director of the liberal Center for Euro-Atlantic Studies in Belgrade. \u201cThere is no government, no state, no institutions and no separation of powers in Serbia. There is only Vucic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S., in Reversal, Issues Permit for Keystone Oil Pipeline", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 During his presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump repeatedly hailed the Keystone XL pipeline as a vital jobs program and one that sharply contrasted his vision for the economy with that of Hillary Clinton.\u201cToday we begin to make things right,\u201d President Trump said Friday morning shortly after the State Department granted the pipeline giant TransCanada a permit for Keystone construction, a reversal of Obama administration policy.The pipeline would link oil producers in Canada and North Dakota with refiners and export terminals on the Gulf Coast. It has long been an object of contention, with environmentalists saying it would contribute to climate change and the project\u2019s proponents \u2014 Republicans, some labor unions and the oil industry \u2014 contending that it would help guarantee national energy security for decades to come.The new secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, formerly the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, had recused himself from the decision. The announcement said the permit was signed by the under secretary of state for political affairs, Thomas A. Shannon Jr.The pipeline still faces hurdles before it can be built. It needs the approval of the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners who are concerned about their water and land rights. Protests are likely since the project has become an important symbol for the environmental movement, with the Canadian oil sands among the most carbon-intensive oil supplies. Mining the oil sands requires vast amounts of energy for extraction and processing.In addition, interest among many oil companies in the oil sands is waning amid sluggish oil prices. Extraction from the oil sands, situated in the sub-Arctic boreal forest, is expensive. Statoil and Total, two European energy giants, have abandoned their production projects. In recent weeks, Royal Dutch Shell agreed to sell most of its oil sands assets for $8.5 billion. And Exxon Mobil wrote down 3.5 billion barrels of reserves, conceding the oil sands were not economically attractive enough to develop for the next few years at least.Nevertheless, Canadian production continues to grow as projects that were conceived when prices were higher begin to operate. And the Keystone effort is central to the future of TransCanada, a major force in the Canadian oil patch.The United States Chamber of Commerce and other business groups applauded the administration\u2019s action. Jack Gerard, the president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, the primary industry lobbying arm, said the decision was \u201cwelcome news\u201d and was \u201ccritical to creating American jobs, growing the economy and making our nation more energy secure.\u2019\u2019Opponents say the pipeline is unnecessary at a time when American oil production is soaring and future demand has been put in question by increasingly efficient cars, electric cars and growing concerns over climate change.\u201cThe Keystone pipeline would be a straw running through the heart of America to transport the dirtiest oil in the world to the thirstiest foreign markets,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat.Originally planned to open in 2012, the Keystone XL would transport up to 830,000 barrels a day of Canadian and North Dakota crude to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines to deliver the sludgy oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana for processing. Most of the refined product would probably be exported, or it might enable domestic producers to export more oil produced in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.When the project was in the planning stages, the United States was highly dependent on oil from the Middle East. The drilling boom in shale fields in Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Colorado was still in its infancy.But in recent years, domestic production has nearly doubled, and the United States now exports increasing amounts of oil and natural gas. Oil prices have been slashed in half over the last three years, although many analysts predict that petroleum prices will rebound in the next decade, when the pipeline would begin to operate.For Canada, and especially Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the pipeline represents a mixed blessing. The pipeline would most likely raise the price of Canadian oil, which is now even more depressed than other international grades.Mr. Trudeau publicly supports the pipeline as a tool to give Canada\u2019s economy a lift, but an increase in oil sands production could undercut his commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as promised in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\u201cWe are pleased with the U.S. decision,\u201d said the natural resources minister of Canada, Jim Carr. \u201cKeystone XL will create thousands of good middle-class jobs for Canadians during construction.\u2019\u2019That argument has been weakened somewhat with the fall in oil prices in recent years that has made oil sands production less attractive on oil markets.Protests helped sway the Obama administration to reject the project, and environmentalists have been further emboldened by demonstrations last year in North Dakota, mostly by Native American groups, that have delayed another project, the Dakota Access Pipeline.Environmental groups are already promising to aid local groups in blocking the Keystone pipeline\u2019s construction. \u201cWe\u2019ll use every tool in the kit to stop this dangerous tar sands oil pipeline project,\u201d said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.The project would provide for thousands of construction jobs, and it has attracted the support of several labor unions.Mr. Trump has made infrastructure-building a centerpiece of his efforts to spur economic growth.\u201cThe fact is that this $8 billion investment in American energy was delayed for so long demonstrates how the American government has failed the American people,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday as he met with his National Economic Council at the White House.At the beginning of his term, he instructed the Commerce Department to establish a plan requiring that new pipelines be constructed with American-made materials like steel. But the White House has since suggested that the Keystone project would not be subjected to those rules because it is not a new project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Dutch Election, Eurogroup Leader\u2019s Fate Looks in Doubt", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 They discussed Greece\u2019s bailout. They grappled with pension issues. They pored over draft budgets.But Monday\u2019s meeting of the Eurogroup, the 19 finance ministers from countries that share the euro, was most notable for what it did not address: the future of their president.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and current president of the Eurogroup, has been one of the public faces of austerity in Europe. He has been praised for helping lay the foundations for the region\u2019s economic recovery, but has been scorned for arguing in favor of fiscal restraint even as countries like Italy and Greece have struggled to overcome economic downturns.The fight to fill the impending vacancy is likely to kick off a wave of jockeying among member states. The head of the Eurogroup plays an intensely political role, setting the tone for a bloc of ministers that presses individual governments to shore up their finances and grants political approval for bailouts.Candidates are already being discussed, including Spain\u2019s center-right economy minister and a Socialist member of the Slovak government. But whatever minister prevails, Germany, the region\u2019s heavyweight economy, is still expected to dominate on issues like Greece\u2019s bailout and regional budgetary rigor.\u201cDijsselbloem has essentially been Germany\u2019s agent in the Eurogroup,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.Mr. Dijsselbloem had been his country\u2019s finance minister for a matter of months when he took over as head of the Eurogroup in early 2013, and his tenure had a rocky start.An expert in agricultural economics who studied in Ireland and lives in the Dutch countryside, he incited controversy by endorsing a bailout of Cyprus that forced losses on many ordinary depositors.Though Mr. Dijsselbloem conceded that he made mistakes, and the Cypriot government agreed to a revised deal that put a greater burden on richer depositors, the stage was set for even tenser negotiations with Greece.By early 2015, Greece had been subject to years of tough austerity, and an increasing number of people were fed up with the seemingly never-ending belt-tightening measures sought by creditors. Thousands flocked to exuberant rallies against the country\u2019s lenders.In January of that year, Greeks voted in Syriza, a far-left party that campaigned on a broad pledge to roll back years of austerity measures, restoring cuts to salaries and pensions and securing a write-off of the country\u2019s huge debt burden. At the center of that effort was Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s combative finance minister.At a joint news conference with Mr. Dijsselbloem in Athens, Mr. Varoufakis flatly rejected working with the so-called troika \u2014 the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank \u2014 which had jointly demanded spending cuts and tax increases in exchange for loans.Those comments prompted a stony-faced Mr. Dijsselbloem to admonish his Greek counterpart for effectively seeking to derail the talks.Then, after Mr. Varoufakis left a pivotal meeting in late June, the Eurogroup\u2019s finance ministers continued to confer. Mr. Dijsselbloem said the session would proceed \u201cwithout the Greek colleague,\u201d declining to even use his counterpart\u2019s name.Ultimately, the Eurogroup failed to reach a deal with Greece, and it fell to national leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Mark Rutte of Holland to negotiate an agreement. Athens was forced to create a 50 billion euro, or $53.6 billion, privatization fund to help pay down debt in exchange for an international bailout, its third since 2010.Mr. Dijsselbloem certainly presided over more than an unending series of crises.The eurozone has expanded under his watch, with Latvia and Lithuania joining in 2014 and 2015. Eurogroup meetings have also run far more smoothly than under his predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, the current president of the European Commission, according to finance ministers and European officials.And since the European Central Bank introduced an effective backstop in 2012, buying bonds from eurozone countries with distressed economies, the Eurogroup has also allowed countries like France and Italy significant fiscal leeway.\u201cDijsselbloem is widely perceived as a good chair of the Eurogroup who has exercised a steady hand,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a Brussels think tank.But Greece has loomed large over Mr. Dijsselbloem\u2019s tenure, and is likely to dominate his successor\u2019s priorities.The country\u2019s debt still stands at 180 percent of gross domestic product, and nearly a quarter of the population is unemployed. The prospects for economic recovery remain bleak. Fearful of the political uncertainty caused by seemingly unending bailout talks, foreign investors have been wary of putting money into Greece.More recently, Mr. Dijsselbloem has tried to forge a more equitable policy for the country, pushing for meaningful ways to ease its debt burden. Last year, he drafted a three-stage debt-relief plan that was eventually accepted, albeit only after it was watered down in the face of opposition from Germany.The Dutch politician was \u201cvery austere\u201d at the outset of talks with the newly elected Syriza government in 2015, said Georgios Kyrtsos, a conservative Greek member of the European Parliament. But he became \u201cmore constructive\u201d as time went on, and Mr. Kyrtsos described him as \u201cextremely capable.\u201dAs a result, views of him improved. Anger toward Ms. Merkel or Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, is much fiercer within Greece, and Mr. Dijsselbloem\u2019s relations with Mr. Tsakalotos are a world apart from his confrontations with Mr. Varoufakis.And while many in the country celebrated when his Dutch Labor Party suffered heavy losses at the polls, several Greeks were circumspect about who might replace him and whether such a swap would have any impact.Germany holds outsize influence within the European Union, and in the Eurogroup in particular. Changing the bloc\u2019s leader is unlikely to have much impact on decision-making in Berlin.\u201cHe\u2019s just a yes-man of Europe,\u201d said Yiannis Garoutsos, 52, an electrician in Athens. \u201cHe was just doing Germany\u2019s dirty work.\u201cThey\u2019ll find someone just as accommodating to replace him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it was unclear late Wednesday whether the deal, if approved, would end the boycotts by sports leagues, businesses and others that have harmed the state\u2019s reputation and economy.Phil Berger, the Senate leader, and Tim Moore, the House speaker, announced late Wednesday that they had reached the agreement with the new Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. A bill repealing House Bill 2, which the legislature will consider on Thursday, would also create a moratorium on local nondiscrimination ordinances through 2020 and leave regulation of \u201cmulti-occupancy facilities,\u201d or bathrooms, to state lawmakers.\u201cCompromise requires give and take from all sides, and we are pleased this proposal fully protects bathroom safety and privacy,\u201d Mr. Berger and Mr. Moore said in a joint statement.Gay rights advocates were harshly critical of the bill. Cathryn Oakley, senior legislative counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, said that the compromise would leave lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people with no statewide anti-discrimination ordinance and no ability to seek such protections from local government for a number of years.\u201cWhat that means for the L.G.B.T. community is that we continue to be boxed out of nondiscrimination protections,\u201d she said.Chris Sgro, executive director of the gay rights group Equality North Carolina, said that the proposal \u201ckeeps North Carolina as the only state in the country obsessed with where trans people use the restroom through law.\u201dThis week, a new flurry of action over House Bill 2 came as the N.C.A.A. warned the state that it could lose the opportunity to host championship sporting events through 2022. The league had already relocated championship tournament games that would have been played in North Carolina during this academic year, including the Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament.The possibility of further punishment placed tremendous pressure on lawmakers in the basketball-obsessed state, a pressure exacerbated by the fact that the University of North Carolina men\u2019s basketball team has reached the N.C.A.A. tournament\u2019s Final Four and will be squaring off against the University of Oregon on Saturday night.Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In North Carolina, Governing With a Punch and a Handshake", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Perhaps the outcome was to be expected here in deeply conflicted North Carolina. While voters chose the brash, bullying TV boss of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d for president, they simultaneously chose an earnest, low-key character closer to Andy Griffith as governor.But nearly three months into his term, the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, will need more than his gentle, tobacco-country politesse to govern effectively. In basketball terms, Mr. Cooper is going to have to throw some elbows.\u201cI promise to listen, to engage, to build consensus, to compromise when possible,\u201d Mr. Cooper said during his address. \u201cI promise to fight only when we can\u2019t come to agreement \u2014 or when you leave me no choice.\u201dNorth Carolina has been split by extraordinary partisan strife as Republicans, historically the state\u2019s underdog party, enjoyed four years of undivided government, pursuing an ambitious agenda that Democrats saw as an assault on the environment, public education and minority voting rights.In response, the left repeatedly filled the halls of the State Capitol complex for protests, calling the movement \u201cMoral Mondays.\u201d Conservatives stewed at the implication that their small-government vision, which they credit with restoring the state\u2019s fiscal health and kick-starting a moribund economy, was somehow immoral.The challenge Mr. Cooper faces as he seeks to patch up North Carolina may serve as a test of whether the nation\u2019s increasingly belligerent political factions can find anything to agree on. The test is best exemplified by the fact that Mr. Cooper has been unable, thus far, to find a way to undo the Republican-backed law known as House Bill 2, which curbs protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It also requires transgender people in public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate.Mr. Cooper criticized House Bill 2 during his campaign against Gov. Pat McCrory, the Republican incumbent, who had signed the bill into law, and he continues to do so. In his speech last week, he referred to the law as \u201cthe dark cloud hanging over our state of promise,\u201d and called for its repeal.Many Democrats rose to applaud. Few Republicans did.A lawyer and lifelong Democrat, Mr. Cooper could fit a Hollywood casting director\u2019s vision of a Southern governor from either party. He is 59 years old and trim, with a full head of graying hair and a subtle drawl that betrays his roots in rural Nash County.For years, he served as a state representative, then Senate majority leader, earning a reputation as a competent centrist and heir to the state\u2019s moderate Democrat tradition.During last year\u2019s campaign, Mr. Cooper positioned himself as an even-keeled leader who would tamp down the drama in Raleigh. He won by nearly 10,000 votes, even as Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 175,000 votes statewide in the presidential contest.Republicans then spent nearly a month challenging the results. Before Mr. Cooper\u2019s swearing-in, legislators passed the contentious laws that weakened Mr. Cooper by loosening the governor\u2019s control over the state elections board, granting Civil Service protection to hundreds of Mr. McCrory\u2019s political appointees and giving the Senate the ability to approve or reject the governor\u2019s agency heads.On Friday, a three-judge state panel issued a mixed opinion, siding with Mr. Cooper over the elections board and the Civil Service jobs, but ruling that the Senate does have the power to approve his cabinet appointees.Even some Republicans took Mr. Cooper\u2019s suit challenging the laws as a sign that he would not be bullied.\u201cRoy\u2019s an easygoing, soft-spoken guy in person, and would generally avoid a fight if it were possible,\u201d said Carter Wrenn, a veteran strategist who worked on the Senate campaigns of Jesse Helms. \u201cAnd so I was a little surprised how aggressive he\u2019s been in responding. I guess he had no choice.\u201dMr. Cooper has rejected, for now, new legislation that would repeal House Bill 2, including a contentious provision that prohibits local governments from passing nondiscrimination ordinances.Mr. Hood said in an interview that he was concerned that Mr. Cooper, by appointing department heads, would be able to increase regulations that Republicans have pared back.In another significant change, Mr. Cooper and the new attorney general, Josh Stein, a Democrat, announced that they would withdraw the state\u2019s request for the United States Supreme Court to review a lower court\u2019s rejection of a Republican-backed law that limited access to the polls. An appeals court found that the law sought to \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d On Thursday, Mr. Cooper issued his first veto, of a bill that would make some judicial elections partisan.In his speech last week, Mr. Cooper eschewed such sensitive topics and instead focused on places where he thought the two sides might agree, such as raises for public-school teachers.The official response from Republicans was delivered by the Senate president pro tempore, Phil Berger, and it was blistering.\u201cThey call their neighbors who vote conservatives into office stupid, uninformed, dupes and deplorables,\u201d Mr. Berger said of liberals. \u201cTonight we heard the left\u2019s new champion. Roy Cooper is pushing their vision for the future of North Carolina, except it\u2019s not a vision for the future of North Carolina at all. It\u2019s a mirage. It\u2019s merely a retreat to our troubled past.\u201dThe next day, Mr. Cooper traveled to Wilmington, where he made his case to the local Chamber of Commerce. The reception was polite, but far from ecstatic \u2014 especially when he called for repealing House Bill 2, an idea that garnered only light applause.Deb Hause, a marketing coordinator, said House Bill 2 made some sense to her. \u201cI have daughters,\u201d Ms. Hause said, and she worried about changing traditional restroom norms.She said she had met Mr. Cooper numerous times and found him to be exceedingly pleasant.\u201cBut he\u2019s got a rough road ahead,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Policy Shift Helps Coal, but Other Forces May Limit Effect", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byMany fossil fuel executives are celebrating President Trump\u2019s move to dismantle the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan. But their cheers are muted, because market forces and state initiatives continue to elevate coal\u2019s rivals, especially natural gas and renewable energy.In coal\u2019s favor, there is the new promise that federal lands will be open for leasing, ending an Obama-era moratorium. Easing pollution restrictions could delay the closing of some old coal-fired power plants, slowing the switch by some utilities to other sources.And with the government pendulum swinging from environmental concerns back to job creation and energy independence, share prices of many energy companies, particularly coal producers, soared Tuesday on the news.For coal executives, however, optimism and expansion plans remain guarded. Regulatory relief could restore 10 percent of their companies\u2019 lost market share at most, they say \u2014 nowhere near enough to return coal to its dominant position in power markets and put tens of thousands of coal miners to work.\u201cAt the end of the day, coal will still have to compete with a host of other fuels,\u201d said Rick Curtsinger, a spokesman for Cloud Peak Energy, one of the country\u2019s leading coal producers. \u201cUtilities\u2019 long-term decisions are based on economics and the need for long-term certainty.\u201dJust as economic realities produced a frenzy of oil and gas drilling during Barack Obama\u2019s two terms as president \u2014 notwithstanding his environmental agenda and aggressive policies to combat climate change \u2014 economics and technological advances are bound to shape the country\u2019s energy landscape despite Mr. Trump\u2019s very different blueprint.Nothing has changed that landscape more than cheap natural gas, and improved drilling techniques in shale fields from Pennsylvania to Texas are driving down production costs to the point where gas supplies are growing and prices continue to slump.\u201cIf the Clean Power Plan is reneged upon, I don\u2019t think you will see utilities going back to investing in coal because they have already reduced their infrastructure and they already have commitments geared toward natural gas,\u201d said Tamar Essner, an energy analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services.Wind and solar power are also taking market share, as the costs of utility-scale generation have become competitive with those of hydrocarbons in many parts of the country.To be sure, fossil fuel companies will be helped by the Trump administration\u2019s initiative. The only question is by how much.Easing some regulations could foster the building of oil and natural gas pipelines across the country. That, in turn, could stimulate more drilling in certain basins, like the Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania.In addition, relaxing restrictions on flaring methane and hydraulic fracturing on federal lands could help some producers increase production. But shale oil and gas production in the United States is mostly done on private lands. Oil prices have fallen by half over the last three years, limiting the demand to drill on more federal land, at least for the moment.\u201cIt will depend on price,\u201d said Mark Boling, the executive vice president of Southwestern Energy, a major natural gas and oil producer. \u201cIt\u2019s the market that drives.\u201dMr. Boling said the administration\u2019s action would have no impact on his company\u2019s immediate plans. And he expects the industry to continue efforts to capture more leaking methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, because of innovations in leak detection and repair equipment.\u201cWe still plan to drive methane emissions down because we think it\u2019s part of our core business to be as efficient as possible in removing natural gas from the ground and getting it to our customers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are definitely going to do that.\u201dWhatever the federal policy, the outlook for renewable energy looks particularly bright. By the end of last year, 29 states had adopted rules to replace a substantial share of fossil fuel electricity production with cleaner power. California has set far more aggressive targets for environmental protection than the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, and promises to resist the federal government\u2019s new agenda.In addition, federal tax credits for wind and solar enacted during the Obama administration will continue for at least several more years, and they have the support of Republican members of Congress from states producing wind power, like Texas and Iowa.A recent report from Morningstar, which provides investment research, concluded that state mandates would continue to push the growth of renewables, and that efficiency upgrades in technology to generate natural gas would make it even harder for aging coal plants to compete.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.The analysis found that existing state mandates would result in enough renewable energy to meet nearly 20 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity use within eight years, with more than half of that growth coming by 2020 in large states like Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\u201cWe have millions of customers and investors who want clean energy,\u201d said Ignacio S. Gal\u00e1n, chief executive of Iberdrola, the Spanish company that operates the second-biggest wind-power portfolio in the United States after NextEra Energy.In an interview this month, he said that the contention by Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s new administrator, that carbon dioxide may not be a prime cause of climate change was \u201cjust like a joke\u201d and added that his company would continue to expand its wind and solar investments, whatever the fate of the Clean Power Plan.The company plans to increase its total United States renewable energy capacity by roughly a third by 2020. In recent weeks, Avangrid Renewables, an Iberdrola subsidiary, pledged roughly $9 million to lease 122,405 acres off Kitty Hawk, N.C., for wind development, a bet on an offshore industry that is just beginning to take off.Even some utilities that did not support the Clean Power Plan say they will continue to make long-term investments to meet their customers\u2019 demands, which in many states include a greener energy mix.\u201cWe think the rule went beyond E.P.A.\u2019s statutory authority and infringed on the rights of the states to manage the generating fleet,\u201d said Leo Denault, chief executive of Entergy, which has been working to lower its carbon emissions since the early 2000s. \u201cThat said, the potential of it rolling back does not change our commitment to being environmentally responsible.\u201dNicholas K. Akins, chief executive of American Electric Power, said that although federal policies under Mr. Trump could help extend the life of some aging coal plants, they would still have to compete against natural gas and renewables when it came time to replace them.\u201cOur plans remain the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to invest over the next three years $1.5 billion in renewables, $9 billion in transmission to optimize the grid. This industry is moving in a direction that really moves toward a clean energy economy. That\u2019s what our customers expect, that\u2019s what our shareholders expect.\u201dBut Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs, cautioned that abandoning policies like calculating the social cost of carbon or investing heavily in clean energy research and development could have powerful effects in the medium to long term.\u201cThe pace at which the energy system becomes less carbon-intensive, I think, is slower without supporting policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the world is going to shift to a deeply decarbonized economy by market forces alone.\u201dHiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Employers using payroll cards would have been required to guarantee that their workers could make free, unlimited wage withdrawals from at least one A.T.M. located \u201ca reasonable travel distance\u201d from their work or home.The rules also would have prohibited many fees, including charges for monthly maintenance, account inactivity and overdrafts, and for checking a card\u2019s balance and contacting customer service.The board did not deny that payroll cards can be problematic. The Labor Department has a \u201cwell-founded concern\u201d that employees receiving their wages through such cards \u201cmay be subject to excessive or hidden fees,\u201d the appeals board wrote. Still, only a body with authority over financial services \u2014 like the State Legislature \u2014 has the power to lay down new guidelines, it said.\u201cWe\u2019re all in favor of regulation and oversight and consumer protection, but this overreached,\u201d Mr. Purcell said.The Labor Department\u2019s rules contained vague language and provisions that posed technical challenges, he said. For example, the regulation required that employees be able to access their wages \u201cin full\u201d without fees, but cash machines are not designed to dispense pennies and nickels, Mr. Purcell pointed out.The Labor Department may appeal the industrial board\u2019s decision, shifting the dispute over to the courts.\u201cAll legal options are being reviewed so that these critical protections can be restored quickly and completely,\u201d said Cullen Burnell, an agency spokesman.\u201cOne of the things we think is really unfortunate is that as the president and members of Congress are rolling back consumer protections, New York\u2019s workers are going to be at further risk of exploitation and financial abuse,\u201d Ms. Shin said.Advertisement"}

In fact, they earned every penny by the book.Hefty compensation, it turns out \u2014 including regular pay, overtime and benefits \u2014 is not unusual for public safety employees in California.\u201cIt is routine now for firefighters to be up over $200,000, $300,000,\u201d said Mark Bucher, chief executive officer of the California Policy Center, a public policy think tank. \u201cLook at just about any city and you\u2019ll see the same thing.\u201dTake, for example, the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District, which covers a portion of southern Contra Costa County.The county\u2019s median household income is roughly $80,000.One reason for the high compensation: It can be cheaper for jurisdictions to pay big overtime \u2014 at 1.5 times or double regular pay \u2014 than it would be to add staff because of the pension liabilities attached to each new hire.For San Ramon firefighters, every dollar of salary means roughly one more dollar in pension contributions, said Paige Meyer, the fire chief. \u201cWhen I\u2019m paying over $2 for a full-time employee and I can pay a dollar and a half for overtime,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a substantial savings.\u201dAs a result, a firefighter paramedic with a salary of $87,700 who puts in long overtime hours can end the year with total compensation well above a quarter-million dollars.Pensions guaranteed to California police and fire personnel allow them to retire in their 50s and draw 70 percent or more of their peak pay as long as they live. Most private sector employees have no pensions.\u201cWhen I see someone attacking the benefits the Fire Department receives or the Police Department receives, my concern is: Why wouldn\u2019t you expect the same for yourself?\u201d he said. \u201cWe should act as a beacon.\u201d\u201cWe already have a crisis,\u201d said Joe Nation, a professor of public policy at Stanford University. \u201cHow does it end?

Coal is still used to generate electricity, Mr. Laiz said, but now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purchased from cheaper overseas sources. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe social fabric of this region is being destroyed, yet they are still using the same fossil fuel from 20 years ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Laiz said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last mines are dinosaurs.

So, too, was the political climate, as miners were at the forefront of major strikes and confrontations with the police. Those clashes had been covered by many. What attracted Mr. Laiz was the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical importance, which he set out to document with the help of Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Antonio Otero, a journalist who served as a consultant to the project.As recently as 10 years ago, the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s miners enjoyed a privileged position, earning as much as 4,000 euros a month. Mr. Laiz said that for every coal-related job, another 10 jobs were generated in business like restaurants, stores and hotels. Today, monthly salaries have dropped to about 800 euros, and towns that were once abuzz with 20,000 residents have shrunk to a tenth of that.As government policy shifted to favor cheaper overseas sources, the work force shrank. The lucky ones at least had pensions to support them, Mr. Laiz said. But many others were temporary workers who were not entitled to benefits.

{"Headline": "Set to Lift Interest Rate, Fed Embraces Investors\u2019 Optimism", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe Federal Reserve is poised to raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-March, significantly sooner than investors had expected, as it moves to keep pace with a wave of economic optimism that started with the election of President Trump.Ms. Yellen added that the Fed still expected to raise rates twice more later in the year, which she said would bring the benchmark rate close to a level that the Fed regards as neutral, with low rates no longer providing an inducement for borrowing and risk-taking. That outlook signals that an end is finally in sight for the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus campaign, devised during the depths of the financial crisis more than eight years ago.Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, delivered the same message at the same time at a conference in New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of substantial change in a relatively short time,\u201d Mr. Fischer said of the postelection shift in economic conditions. \u201cThere is almost no economic indicator that has come in badly in the last three months.\u201dAsked whether Fed officials were delivering a coordinated message, Mr. Fischer responded wryly, \u201cIf there has been a conscious effort, I\u2019m about to join it.\u201dThe impending rate increase could heighten tensions with the White House, which wants to stimulate growth by cutting taxes, reducing regulation and increasing defense and infrastructure spending. Fed officials have concluded the economy is already growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth should be offset by faster rate increases.Financial markets, however, are taking the prospect of higher rates in stride. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which is up more than 11 percent since Election Day, ended trading on Friday mostly flat.The prospective Fed move has modest short-term implications for consumers. Interest rates on car loans and some kinds of credit card debt will tick upward, but remain at low levels by historical standards. Rates on 30-year mortgages are up by about half a percentage point over the past year.The broader consequences depend on the Fed\u2019s ability to raise interest rates without slowing economic growth. The Fed\u2019s goal is to return rates to a level that neither encourages nor impedes economic activity. Over the past century, however, most of the central bank\u2019s attempts to strike that balance have ended in economic recessions.Fed officials have concluded, however, that monetary policy cannot deliver faster growth. The Fed\u2019s job is to minimize unemployment and moderate inflation. The unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is in a range Fed officials regard as healthy, and prices rose 1.9 percent in the 12 months ending in January, the closest the Fed has come since 2012 to hitting its target of 2 percent annual inflation.Now, after a week of discussions, analysts regard a March increase as highly likely.Some Fed officials appear particularly focused on the rise of the stock market. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who described markets as \u201cvery buoyant\u201d on Tuesday, has said in the past that if markets did not respond to rate increases, the Fed might need to act more forcefully to tighten financial conditions.It is also getting harder to dismiss the market\u2019s reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as a bout of temporary euphoria. Mr. Fischer noted on Friday that the stock market boom was creating wealth that people would begin to spend.Ms. Yellen pointed to an improvement in the global context. \u201cThe prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat,\u201d she said.Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.The shift in the Fed\u2019s language over the last week also may reflect a recognition that market expectations were not keeping pace with the Fed\u2019s evolving view of the economy. Ms. Yellen, in a February appearance before Congress, hinted that the Fed might be providing a little too much stimulus, describing the Fed\u2019s policy as \u201caccommodative.\u201d But at the start of this week, investors still put a low probability on a March increase.Markets are wary of the Fed\u2019s flirtations with interest rate increases, as the central bank in recent years has often found reasons for last-minute postponements.This time, the Fed chose to overwhelm any lingering doubts.\u201cWe are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time,\u201d Ms. Brainard said at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cAssuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path.\u201dFed officials often bury their latest views on monetary policy at the end of their speeches. Ms. Brainard\u2019s remarks came at the beginning, so that no one missed the point.Then came Friday, the last day on which Fed rules allowed officials to comment on monetary policy before the March meeting, and Ms. Yellen delivered the last word.\u201cAt our meeting later this month,\u201d she said, \u201cthe committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\u201dThe committee is scheduled to meet in Washington on March 14 and 15.A subheading on Saturday with an article about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to increase interest rates misstated the cause of prospective tensions between the Fed and President Trump. As the article correctly noted, it is the Fed\u2019s efforts to curb inflation \u2014 not inflation and joblessness \u2014 that may frustrate Mr. Trump.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Day Without a Woman\u2019 Protest Tests a Movement\u2019s Staying Power", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byOnce again in the young presidency of Donald J. Trump, women rallied against his administration on Wednesday, this time by skipping work, wearing red and refusing to spend money. But the protests were far smaller than the masses who turned the women\u2019s marches on Jan. 21 into a phenomenon, keeping the question open of whether protesters\u2019 fervor can be channeled into a sustained movement with demonstrable political results.In New York City, hundreds of people jammed into a Midtown block, and the Women\u2019s March on Washington said 10 of its organizers were arrested there for blocking traffic. The municipal court in Providence, R.I., shut down because seven of the clerks and a deputy court administrator stayed home from work. Schools in Alexandria, Va.; Chapel Hill-Carrboro, N.C.; and Prince George\u2019s County, Md., closed for the day because so many teachers stayed home.The strike was held on International Women\u2019s Day, and President Trump weighed in early with a restrained statement, writing a message of respect on Twitter for women and the role they play in the economy.On International Women's Day, join me in honoring the critical role of women here in America & around the world.It was always unlikely that a general strike, labeled \u201cA Day Without a Woman,\u201d would produce the same turnout as the post-inauguration marches. The strike lacked the marches\u2019 momentum coming off the election, as well as their virality and visuals, like the photogenic pink \u201cpussy hats\u201d that many attendees wore. It is also hard to tally participation or impact because employers could not provide counts of how many women stayed home, and retail figures are not yet available to show whether women stopped spending money.Some questioned the decision to call a strike at all. \u201cIn order to work, a general strike has to actually stop something from functioning,\u201d said Todd Gitlin, a former president of Students for a Democratic Society who has written about political movements. \u201cAnywhere it hasn\u2019t done that can\u2019t be counted as a success. It plays to your inner audience, not your outer audience.\u201dThe strike\u2019s leaders tried to manage expectations from the start. \u201cThe object for us isn\u2019t that we hope to shut the whole economy down,\u201d said Linda Sarsour, a co-chairwoman of the event who was arrested. \u201cWe see this as an opportunity to introduce women to different tactics of activism. Our goal is not to have the same numbers as the march.\u201dCritics have charged that the call for a strike reinforces one of the central tensions of this next wave of women\u2019s activism: the gap between white, privileged women and minority, lower-paid women, who may not be able to afford a day off from work and could lose their jobs. Ms. Sarsour said that was why organizers deliberately offered a menu of ways to participate if women could not strike.Janna Pea, a spokeswoman for the Women\u2019s March, said that as of Tuesday, more than 30,000 people had registered their intent to participate, most of them in the blue states of New York and California.One-day mass protests are valuable displays of political muscle and hard for politicians to ignore. Ultimately, Mr. Gitlin said, protesters must be wooed into the harder, more dogged work of continuous organizing and political participation that changes policies or wins elections.There is some anecdotal evidence that this is beginning to take place. Ms. Sarsour said the march had produced an instant national database that is being used to match first-time protesters with organizational tools for activism.Women, deployed by Planned Parenthood and other groups, were at the forefront of recent town hall meetings, confronting members of Congress about plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.More than 5,000 small-group meetings were held across the country last month, at the urging of the women\u2019s march organizers, to form networks to push for political change in local communities. A national call-in convened by a similar network of women\u2019s groups to encourage protests about health care drew 58,000 people in mid-February.And many women are joining forces with a bevy of groups that have sprung up since the election to foster activism with technological tools, such as Indivisible, which provides a template for influencing members of Congress; SwingLeft, which identifies nearby swing districts and offers opportunities to volunteer; and countless more.Many women marked the day in personal ways. Kellee Stemac, in the conservative city of Plano, Tex., said she had misgivings about asking women to strike, so she planned to wear red and spend money only at women-owned businesses.A few dozen red-clad demonstrators turned out at a downtown plaza in Lafayette, Ind. Gloria Goings, 63, a retired nurse and first-time protester, said she had come because of \u201cthe injustice that women deal with \u2014 like jobs, everyday life.\u201dThe same was true in Phoenix. Kristy King, who helped organize the January march, said that the strike was a welcome show of solidarity, but that low-income women might not have been able to attend. \u201cI could think of better ways of spending my time,\u201d she said a few hours after she decided to join Wednesday\u2019s protest at the Arizona State Capitol.In Denver, Theresa Newsom, a teacher, said she had driven 90 minutes from Colorado Springs for her first political march, noting proudly that she had a male substitute in her classroom.In Silicon Valley, where women have often battled hostile workplaces, many companies were eager to demonstrate their support. Uber, which has been weathering a storm caused by a female engineer\u2019s complaint about sexual harassment, sent a memo to employees last week saying they were welcome to participate in the strike, said MoMo Zhou, a spokeswoman for the company. Because Uber offers unlimited vacation time, no one will be docked pay.Facebook \u2014 where Teresa Shook, a lawyer in Hawaii, first posted the idea of a march on Washington \u2014 is marking International Women\u2019s Day with a 24-hour live feed of events.Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the advertising agency 360i, said that hundreds of the company\u2019s 600 New York employees were participating in some way. Jezebel, a news site aimed at women, was run on Wednesday by men.International Women\u2019s Day was also observed around the world. Women in Tbilisi, Georgia, demonstrated under a symbolic \u201cglass ceiling\u201d to illustrate limitations on women\u2019s advancement. Tens of thousands of Polish women held protests. In India, where a toilet is still an aspiration for many women, Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over a celebration of women who had worked hard to secure this basic item for their families.But not everyone had the option to protest. Jo Sorrentino, a 28-year-old arborist from Oakland, Calif., posted on Facebook that she would have lost a day\u2019s pay. On an hourly wage of $21.50, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t afford it.\u201dAn earlier version of a photo caption accompanying this article misstated a message printed on scarves.

{"Headline": "Trump Budget Proposal Reflects Working-Class Resentment of the Poor", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneAnd yet Mr. Trump\u2019s approach possesses a powerful political logic: The frazzled, anxious working-class men and women who voted for him like Social Security, Medicare and defense. Other government spending, not so much. Notably, there is little political cost for Mr. Trump \u2014 in fact, potential benefit \u2014 in going after means-tested programs for the poor.These programs appeal to two constituencies that working-class voters show little affinity for: the poor and urban liberal elites who can express enormous sympathy for the disenfranchised while ignoring the struggle of the white working class.His political calculation could, paradoxically, protect Social Security and Medicare, entitlements that the Republican Party has tried so hard to rein in. But in areas as diverse as food stamps and housing assistance, education for the disadvantaged and Head Start, it could further fray the rest of America\u2019s threadbare social safety net.Ms. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, writes that these struggling workers resent not only the poor beneficiaries of the government\u2019s largess but also the liberal policy makers who seem to believe that only the poor are deserving of help. And they bristle at the perceived condescension of a liberal elite that seems to blame them for their failure to acquire the necessary skills to rise to the professional class.By contrast, they see themselves as hard-working citizens who struggle to make ends meet, only to be left out of many of the government programs their taxes pay for.\u201cAll they see is their stressed-out daily lives, and they resent subsidies and sympathy available to the poor,\u201d Professor Williams wrote.The working-class whites who turned out so enthusiastically for Mr. Trump include people like Lee Sherman, 82, from Louisiana, living precariously on Social Security after a life of hard and dangerous work fitting pipes, and exposed to all manner of toxic chemicals, at a petrochemical plant.To people like Mr. Sherman, government benefits tied to work, like Social Security and unemployment insurance, are legitimate rewards for one\u2019s effort. Welfare recipients, by contrast, just \u201clazed around days and partied at nights,\u201d he told Professor Hochschild.Racial mistrust is never far from the surface: Only 13 percent of non-Hispanic whites draw benefits from means-tested programs, according to the Census Bureau analysis, compared with 42 percent of African-Americans and 36 percent of Hispanics. So while most beneficiaries of welfare programs are white, many working-class whites perceive them as schemes to hand their tax dollars to minorities.These resentments are hard to swallow on the left of the political spectrum. Since the 1960s, at least, liberal activists have held to the belief that a grand progressive alliance was possible: working men and women, the poor, immigrants, racial and other minorities coming together in a coalition to counter conservatives and their corporate allies.But could they be revived? As the president takes an ax to much of the government, the pressing question for liberals is whether a coalition can be built to protect the meager social safety net that remains. Could they draw back in the white working-class voters who rejected them so soundly in November?These voters care less about gender rights and minorities. They may not share liberal views on abortion rights. They are unlikely to support a safety net that allows a poor woman to stay at home while offering nothing to a hard-working couple tag-teaming day and night shifts to care for their children.But, Professor Williams notes, the liberal goal can\u2019t be saved without them: \u201cIf America\u2019s policy makers better understood white working-class anger against the social safety net, they might have a shot at creating programs that don\u2019t get gutted in this way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They\u2019ve said it\u2019s time for most of the nearly two million displaced people \u2014 many of them farmers and fishermen fighting to stave off hunger \u2014 to go home.But the soldiers were guiding the throngs of people into a future that was no more certain, and potentially just as dangerous, as the past they had fled.Maimta Modu, 62, had come to a displaced-persons camp with other residents of his tiny village, and now they have to pay soldiers a fee to be escorted back periodically to check on their crops. If he returns on his own, he said in a reference to Boko Haram, \u201cthose boys will slaughter me.\u201dCaught in the middle are people like Idi Hassan and his wife, who were in the convoy with six of their young children in his truck bed. The Hassans had been living for two years in the squalid camp in Maiduguri, relying on food handouts and eager to get back to their farm north of here, where they hoped to make a living.\u201cThe area has been liberated, and we\u2019re going home,\u201d Mr. Hassan said, sitting behind the wheel as his wife breast-fed their infant in the passenger\u2019s seat.Yet insurgents still roam the northeast and frequently crisscross roads like the one that was taking Mr. Hassan and his family home. Just weeks ago, Boko Haram ambushed soldiers along this very highway, killing seven of them.The narrow road is also the same one that Boko Haram used in January to ferry nine suicide bombers who set upon the same camp in Maiduguri that the Hassan family was leaving. Besides the bombers, two other people were killed in the attack, described by the authorities as the most coordinated of recent bombings.Many people fled rural areas to Maiduguri, which has doubled in size as displaced Nigerians have crowded into relatives\u2019 homes or settled into crumbling buildings, bus stations, schoolyards and the thousands of ramshackle thatched huts that dot the edges of the city.The Borno State government announced plans to close the camps in Maiduguri by the end of May, but said it would keep evaluating the situation. Now, one million uprooted people are making their way back home, according to the United Nations.Outside the city, military commanders say, all but small pockets of the countryside are now safe.\u201cFerocious attacks are a thing of the past,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Leo Irabor, the Nigerian Army commander leading the operation against the militants. \u201cWe are only picking up the pieces.\u201dIn late December, the military began reopening main highways that had been closed for years because of security worries. The state government has started rebuilding burned villages.The military push has allowed aid workers to fan out into new parts of the countryside to help people ravaged by famine or faminelike conditions. The United Nations has increased its efforts as well, working alongside the military and asking for $1 billion to help those affected by Boko Haram.Mr. Modu said soldiers had arrived in his village and given a two-week deadline for residents to move to a nearby town. The next day, insurgents ordered them to evacuate immediately. Residents then moved into a displaced-persons camp.In mid-January, a relief convoy driving on one of the reopened roads ran over an improvised bomb, setting fire to a food truck, burning all its contents and injuring a driver and his assistants.In another area deemed safe by the military, insurgents gunned down 16 people gathering wood not far from their homes. When aid groups make some supply runs in helicopters across the safe areas, the pilots fly high enough to be out of missile range.Diverging streams of displaced people moving in and out of the camps are making it hard for humanitarian groups to provide assistance. Those in the camps need food, and people going home need help reviving their farms. Both relief and development aid are needed.Some residents take risks. Muhammadu Sani was sewing a fishing net at a 26,000-person camp in the countryside on a recent day. Eager to feed his seven children, he would head regularly to a fishing spot an hour away. But transporting fish is banned, in an attempt to starve the insurgents. So Mr. Sani stuffs his catch down his pants to smuggle it home.In some areas, waves of displaced Nigerians have begun crashing into one another. In a rural community called Monguno, hundreds of people from newly liberated areas have crammed into mud-brick homes abandoned when Boko Haram first invaded. Now, the original homeowners are finding that people as desperate as they had been are living inside.Bulama Abatcha and Modu Bintumi had to ask for help from a community official to work out an arrangement in which Mr. Abatcha could remain in the other man\u2019s home rent free. Mr. Abatcha would take care of it until Mr. Bintumi was ready to leave a camp in Maiduguri, where he had fled two years ago.\u201cIf the owner comes any time soon,\u201d Mr. Abatcha said, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely find another place and move.\u201dIn other areas, the state government has forged ahead with full-fledged reconstruction, building concrete housing in villages that Boko Haram had reduced to ashes.But in places such as Benisheik, a community about an hour\u2019s drive from Maiduguri that was leveled by the militants, spacious new concrete homes are vacant. They are adjacent to pieced-together huts made of wood frames and ragged sheets, where returning residents are camped out until they are allowed to move into the concrete structures.Gov. Kashim Shettima of Borno State said that to cut down on ownership fights, officials wanted to make sure that all the units were completed before allowing anyone in. Women will have first pick of the homes, he said, because they have been affected the most by a war in which their sons and husbands were routinely killed.Each will receive an irrigation kit, 25 chickens and two goats to help stimulate the local economy.\u201cWe recognize that human population is the number one defense against insurgents, and we know that communities can remain isolated for years and give strength to insurgents,\u201d Mr. Shettima said. \u201cBut we will never compromise safety.\u201dIn one of the new concrete structures, complete with drop ceilings, Halima Hajiya Ibrahim, an older woman, danced and raised her hands, ecstatically showing visitors what she said was her new home. No one had told her that it had yet to be officially assigned; she was a squatter and was bound to be removed.Other residents who had returned to Benisheik said they were eager to move out of shelters that flood during the rainy season and offer no protection from the night chill.But many said they were still uneasy. Days earlier, a group of insurgents on motorbikes had crossed the road just outside town.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Reykjavik", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate18 PhotosA CONTEMPORARY HOME IN THE SUBURBS OF REYKJAVIK$860,470This split-level contemporary-style house with ocean views is in Hafnarfjordur, about a 20-minute drive south of downtown Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. The third-largest city in the country, with about 25,000 people, Hafnarfjordur is known as a fishing port and \u201cthe town in the lava,\u201d because of its many lava rock formations.This 3,073-square-foot house was built in 2002 and designed by the owners\u2019 daughter, said Asdis Osk Valsdottir, a broker with Husaskjol, the agency listing the property. It has a master bedroom and two open spaces that could easily be converted into additional bedrooms, she said.The house is four levels, arranged around a central courtyard. Stairs lead from the one-car garage to the entrance, a tall glass atrium. From there, steps connect to a living room with parquet floors, high ceilings and a dining area. There is a wooden deck off the living room, accessible through glass doors.The stairs from the entrance hall also lead up to the next level, where there is a kitchen, a small living room, an office that could be used as a bedroom and the master bedroom. The kitchen features mahogany cabinets, granite counters and stainless steel Siemens appliances. There is a small space off the kitchen for casual dining and a laundry room. There are two bathrooms: one close to the master bedroom, with a whirlpool tub and a shower, and a half-bath for guests near the kitchen.The top floor is dominated by a sitting room surrounded on three sides by windows with views of the ocean and surrounding city. This level also has a separate room that could be converted into a bedroom, Ms. Valsdottir said.The house sits on about a fifth of an acre, with a partially fenced yard, mature trees and shrubs. There is a courtyard accessible from the living room and a wooden deck.MARKET OVERVIEWThe home market in Reykjavik is \u201cbooming,\u201d said Jason Kristinn Olafsson, a sales representative with Miklaborg Real Estate. Prices have increased by 10 to 15 percent in the last 18 months, Mr. Olafsson said, and the average sales price is between 40 million and 50 million krona (about $363,000 to $454,000).\u201cPrices are very inflated, mainly because of shortage in housing,\u201d said Vilhjalmur Bjarnason, chairman of Hagsmunasamtok Heimilanna, an industry association. \u201cVery few new homes or building projects have been initiated by the municipal authorities in Reykjavik since 2008.\u201dThere are often multiple offers on properties as soon as they are listed for sale, agents say, and sales prices are often 4 to 8 percent above asking prices, especially in downtown and western Reykjavik, which are among the most popular neighborhoods. \u201cProperties usually sell very fast,\u201d Ms. Valsdottir said. \u201cAnd apartments with one, two and three bedrooms usually sell within days.\u201dIn Hafnarfjordur the market is slower, but it is starting to catch up to Reykjavik, Ms. Valsdottir said: \u201cSo even though the price increases have been substantial\u201d in the center of the city, she said, in the suburbs \u201cthere are still buying opportunities.\u201dWHO BUYS IN ICELANDForeign buyers are rare in Iceland, agents say, with most from European countries like Germany, Spain and Switzerland. \u201cInternational buyers need permission to buy property in Iceland,\u201d Mr. Bjarnason said. \u201cIt is rather easily attained, but more accessible for E.U. citizens than other nationalities.\u201dIn general, most buyers these days are upsizing from smaller homes, agents say, or are citizens who have been living abroad but are buying second homes in Iceland. There has also been an increase in buyers investing in homes as rental property, Mr. Olafsson said, noting that about 15 percent of Miklaborg\u2019s clients are investors.BUYING BASICSOnce a foreigner receives permission from the government to buy property, there are no restrictions on ownership, agents say.Most of the transactions are handled by the seller\u2019s agent. There are no buyers\u2019 agents in Iceland, Ms. Valsdottir said, \u201cSo if you want to buy a property in Iceland, you have to go directly to the listing agent.\u201dBuyers usually do not need a lawyer, Mr. Bjarnason said: \u201cThe real estate agency has the legal authority and handles buying and selling.\u201dOver all, the process is usually fairly straightforward, he added. \u201cIf finances and permits are in order, there are few obstacles, if any.\u201dWEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESIcelandic; krona (1 krona = $0.009)TAXES AND FEESTransaction costs are relatively low in Iceland, compared with those in other countries. Total closing costs are usually about 2.5 to 3.5 percent of the sales price, agents say. The buyer pays a stamp duty of 0.8 percent of the home\u2019s value, or 0.4 percent for first-time buyers, based on the government\u2019s appraisal. The seller pays the agents\u2019 fees, which are typically 1.5 to 2.5 percent of the sales price, and there is a value-added tax of 24 percent on the commission.The property taxes on this home are about $4,659 a year (515,020 krona), Ms. Valsdottir said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China to Raise Military Spending, but Less Than in Recent Years", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China said Saturday that its military budget would rise by about 7 percent this year, apparently the lowest increase in seven years, signaling that its leaders do not plan to engage the United States in an arms race even as President Trump seeks to bolster the Pentagon\u2019s spending.Addressing reporters before the start of the annual National People\u2019s Congress, Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for the legislature, said the increase would be \u201cabout\u201d 7 percent. She said defense spending would amount to roughly 1.3 percent of China\u2019s gross domestic product.Last year\u2019s proposed increase was 7.6 percent, though China has yet to release final figures indicating how much was actually spent. Those figures, and the exact number of this year\u2019s projected increase, will be revealed in a budget that the government releases on Sunday, when the national legislature starts its annual full session.Before 2016, the military budget had received double-digit increases for six years, a reflection of China\u2019s then-roaring economy.Chinese experts said the new budget would keep military spending roughly in line with the government\u2019s usual formula of G.D.P. growth plus inflation.As China\u2019s economy continues to slow, annual growth in the gross domestic product is expected to be about 6.5 percent. Inflation hovers around 2 percent. And the government must also find more money for health care, education and other increasingly expensive social needs.Ms. Fu said that China wanted good relations with the Trump administration but would respond to any challenges.\u201cPresident Xi Jinping and President Trump have had two direct phone calls, and the message was very clear, which is that there must be more cooperation between China and the United States so we become good partners,\u201d Ms. Fu said. But she added that China would watch the effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s global policy changes.\u201cOf course, everyone hopes that their impact will be positive, but if there are challenges, China will respond calmly,\u201d Ms. Fu said.The U.S. military is vastly more powerful than China\u2019s, as Ms. Fu noted. \u201cFundamentally, this is about the United States worrying that China could catch up and surpass the U.S. in its ability,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in fact there is a still a huge gap in ability between the U.S. and China, which is still a developing country.\u201dTo emphasize his intent to strengthen the American military, Mr. Trump visited the country\u2019s new aircraft carrier this week. The Gerald R. Ford is a nuclear-powered, 100,000-ton floating fortress due to be commissioned this year and is the first in a new generation of supercarriers.The United States has 10 Nimitz-class supercarriers. In contrast, China is building its first aircraft carrier, a diesel-propelled vessel, and has one refurbished carrier from Ukraine.Wang Xiangsui, a retired senior colonel in China\u2019s Air Force who is now director of the Research Center of Strategic Issues at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to increase military spending were unlikely to prod China into following suit. \u201cI don\u2019t think China will be oversensitive about this,\u201d he said.\u201cDespite all the aggressive talk, no one wants a war,\u201d Mr. Wang said. While the $54 billion increase sounds like a lot, he added, \"the Americans didn\u2019t achieve anything after spending six trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201dChina\u2019s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, who visited Washington this week and met briefly with Mr. Trump at the White House, probably had the military budget on his mind as he tried to judge the mood of the new administration, said Dennis J. Blasko, an American expert on the Chinese military.\u201cI\u2019m guessing Yang Jiechi was tasked to make an assessment of the state of the bilateral relationship to see if there may need to be a last-minute adjustment in reaction to the requested increase for the U.S. defense budget,\u201d said Mr. Blasko, a retired army lieutenant colonel and the author of \u201cThe Chinese Army Today.\u201dMr. Yang probably found the relationship to be on a sound enough footing, Mr. Blasko said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they want to get into a military budget fight with us, not even a rhetorical one.\u201dNi Lexiong, a naval expert in Shanghai, said that if China really felt the need to spend more heavily on the military, it would not hesitate to do so.\u201cIf China felt threatened, I don\u2019t think slower economic growth would stop them from spending more on the military,\u201d Mr. Ni said. \u201cYou have seen how the Chinese were willing to starve to build an atomic bomb. We do not worry about poverty when we think a larger military is necessary.\u201dHe said the new budget would allow China to keep modernizing its navy and air force, the two services currently getting the most attention. The navy launched 22 warships in 2016 to replace old ones, and the budget would let it keep up that pace this year, he said.\u201cA chunk of the expenditure will go towards developing and manufacturing the latest weapons for a stronger air force and navy,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe this speed of replacement will continue, because it has been one of China\u2019s long-term growth goals to build a military stronger than America\u2019s one day, in either quality or quantity.\u201dWhile China\u2019s future aircraft carriers are likely to be nuclear powered, the Chinese Navy will probably be focused on other, more important areas, said Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor at the China Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island.\u201cChinese submarine development and the building of destroyers and frigates are likely more expensive and more consequential for the overall military balance,\u201d he said.The People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s official budget was about $146 billion in 2016. Western groups that study the Chinese military say that actual spending is roughly 1.2 to 1.5 times greater than the announced figures.Chris Buckley contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "After Exiting Capital Controls, Iceland Still Wary of Private Investors", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIceland and Greece are rare examples of European countries experimenting with capital controls. Their approach to wooing back private investors is somewhat different. Iceland, which ended eight years of controls last week, seems altogether less starry-eyed.Kaupthing, one of Iceland\u2019s lenders that went bust in 2008, said on Sunday that it had sold a 30 percent stake in its so-called good bank, Arion, to hedge funds including Och-Ziff, as well as Goldman Sachs. The buyers have been given sweeteners to invest. After paying 48.8 billion kronur ($450 million) for their new stake, they get the option to buy an additional 21.9 percent at an undisclosed, higher price. The hedge funds and Goldman already own a big chunk of Kaupthing.Such terms look less saccharine than those doled out by Athens almost four years ago. For every share acquired in 2013, private investors in Alpha Bank were given the chance to buy 7.4 further shares at a price a shade higher than the buy-in price. While that meant there was a slight premium involved, it also came with the right to buy a much larger slab of the company\u2019s equity.A bigger difference is that in 2013, Greece was desperate to avoid full nationalization for its banks. Iceland, by contrast, wants to exit a banking collapse that has already happened. Even more so than Greece, it\u2019s important to get the balance between private investor and public finances right \u2014 after all, this is a tiny country where a banking sector whose assets exceeded 10 times gross domestic product eviscerated the nation\u2019s finances when it collapsed.A more basic difference is the economy. While Greece\u2019s gross domestic product did not grow in 2016, Iceland\u2019s jumped more than 7 percent. Greek banks are enmeshed in bad debts and the nation still has an unsustainable debt position partly caused by its euro membership, whereas debt as a proportion of G.D.P. in Iceland is recovering.As the colder country with a much warmer economy, Iceland can afford to be relatively picky.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Internet Is Saving Culture, Not Killing It", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne secret to longevity as a pundit is to issue predictions that can\u2019t be easily checked. So here\u2019s one for the time capsule: Two hundred years from now, give or take, the robot-people of Earth will look back on the early years of the 21st century as the beginning of a remarkable renaissance in art and culture.That may sound unlikely to many of us in the present. In the past few decades, we\u2019ve seen how technology has threatened the old order in cultural businesses, including the decimation of the music industry, the death of the cable subscription, the annihilation of newspapers and the laying to waste of independent bookstores.But things are turning around; for people of the future, our time may be remembered as a period not of death, but of rejuvenation and rebirth.Part of the story is in the art itself. In just about every cultural medium, whether movies or music or books or the visual arts, digital technology is letting in new voices, creating new formats for exploration, and allowing fans and other creators to participate in a glorious remixing of the work. This isn\u2019t new; from blogs to podcasts to YouTube, the last 20 years have been marked by a succession of formats that have led to ever-lower barriers for new and off-the-wall creators.But now something surprising has happened.In the last few years, and with greater intensity in the last 12 months, people started paying for online content. They are doing so at an accelerating pace, and on a dependable, recurring schedule, often through subscriptions. And they\u2019re paying for everything.You\u2019ve already heard about the rise of subscription-based media platforms \u2014 things like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify and Apple Music. But people are also paying for smaller-audience and less-mainstream-friendly content. They are subscribing to podcasters, comedians, zany YouTube stars, novelists and comic book artists. They are even paying for news.It\u2019s difficult to overstate how big a deal this is. More than 20 years after it first caught mainstream attention and began to destroy everything about how we finance culture, the digital economy is finally beginning to coalesce around a sustainable way of supporting content. If subscriptions keep taking off, it won\u2019t just mean that some of your favorite creators will survive the internet. It could also make for a profound shift in the way we find and support new cultural talent. It could lead to a wider variety of artists and art, and forge closer connections between the people who make art and those who enjoy it.\u201cWhat we want to do is change the entire financing mechanism that drives the production of content online,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cWe want to change how things are paid for and how the web runs. For us, it\u2019s a very, very big problem.\u201d\u201cI do think something has changed culturally,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cThis new generation is more concerned with social impact. There\u2019s a desire to vote with your dollars and your time and attention.\u201dSome of that is happening in the news business, too. The New York Times and many other newspapers reported a surge in subscriptions after Donald J. Trump won the presidency last year.Huge content platforms have been criticized for the way they treat artists. Even if lots of people are paying for services like Spotify, critics say that it can be difficult for musicians, especially smaller and less-well-known ones, to make a sustainable living from the platform.Yet many artists are finding ways around these difficulties. Thanks to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, artists can now establish close relationships with their fans. They can sell merchandise and offer special fan-only promotions and content. And after finding an audience, they can use sites like Patreon to get a dependable paycheck from their most loyal followers.This sort of alternative arrangement isn\u2019t easy to pursue; it can take time, effort and skills in unusual dark arts (such as how social-media marketing works). But there are signs it is catching on: At the Grammys last year, the award for best new artist went to Chance the Rapper, who has famously, proudly rejected every offer to sign with a record label and even to sell any of his music.If there are difficulties in navigating the modern cultural business, there are upsides, too.\u201cI don\u2019t have to go out on the road and play in bars,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be a father and I can be a husband. This normalizes my career. It normalizes the career of being an artist, which has never been normalized.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Nuclear Deal Could Be Gateway for Terrorism Legal Claims", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byThose judgments provided symbolic justice but came with little realistic expectation that Iran \u2014 which did not bother to contest the evidence \u2014 would actually pay all it owed, aside from its limited assets frozen in the United States. But now, those cases are colliding with another major legal and national security event: the Iran nuclear deal.In the first case of its kind, a group of attack victims \u2014 including estates of people who were killed \u2014 who won one of the default judgments against Iran has gone to a European court to try to enforce it. A judge in Luxembourg has quietly put a freeze on $1.6 billion in assets belonging to Iran\u2019s central bank, according to people familiar with the case.The fight is part of increasing instances in which domestic civil lawsuits against foreign entities over terrorist attacks have raised diplomatic and national security complications.Diplomatic and security specialists said the litigation also has broader significance. The essence of the 2015 deal was that Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions so it could reintegrate into the world economy. That goal would be undermined if any Iranian-linked assets in places like Europe were vulnerable to seizure to pay off the default judgments handed down by American courts.\u201cA ruling like this would make Iranian assets vulnerable in Europe which, for Iranians, would violate the spirit of the agreement if not the letter of it,\u201d he said.Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, did not respond to an email request to speak with someone in the Trump administration about its thinking regarding the effort. President Trump was a fierce critic of the nuclear accord during the campaign, saying President Barack Obama had negotiated a bad deal. But he has since given no public indication that he intends to follow through on his vow to abrogate it.The embassy of Luxembourg in Washington also did not respond to a request for comment.Complicating matters, the lawsuit that resulted in the default judgment did not stem from one of the attacks by Shiite terrorists that specialists generally agree were sponsored by Iran. Instead, it was brought by victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by Al Qaeda, the Sunni terrorist group.That judgment stagnated for years because there was no obvious way to collect it. But then it came to light that the Clearstream system in Luxembourg, which facilitates international exchanges of securities, was holding $1.6 billion in Iranian central bank assets that had been blocked under sanctions.Last year, lawyers for the Sept. 11 victims persuaded a judge in Luxembourg to place a new freeze on those assets while they sued over whether they could execute the default judgment against those funds, the letter said. Both Clearstream and the Iranian central bank, Markazi, are now trying to get that freeze lifted.\u201cThe Iran nuclear deal does not include terrorism issues or resolve outstanding legal claims, so you can support that deal and also support the enforcement of lawful, final judgments entered by the federal courts wherever Iranian assets are found,\u201d Mr. Wolosky said. \u201cAnd that is exactly what we are aggressively pursuing.\u201dIran \u201cwill certainly try to get these assets unfrozen so they aren\u2019t put at risk, but I don\u2019t see them walking away from the deal, even though this is a very novel, very creative use of the legal system to try to get these judgments enforced,\u201d he said.The case joins the growing log of lawsuits that try to assign blame for terrorist ties.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Struggling With Japan\u2019s Nuclear Waste, Six Years After Disaster", "Date": "2017-03-11", "News": "Supported byFUKUSHIMA DAIICHI NUCLEAR POWER STATION \u2014 Six years after the largest nuclear disaster in a quarter-century, Japanese officials have still not solved a basic problem: what to do with an ever-growing pile of radioactive waste. Each form of waste at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, where three reactors melted down after an earthquake and a tsunami on March 11, 2011, presents its own challenges.The Tokyo Electric Power Company is pumping water nonstop through the three reactors to cool melted fuel that remains too hot and radioactive to remove. About 400 tons of water passes through the reactors every day, including groundwater that seeps in. The water picks up radiation in the reactors and then is diverted into a decontamination facility.But the decontamination filters cannot remove all the radioactive material. So for now, all this water is being stored in 1,000 gray, blue and white tanks on the grounds. The tanks already hold 962,000 tons of contaminated water, and Tokyo Electric is installing more tanks. It is also trying to slow the flow of groundwater through the reactors by building an underground ice wall.Within a few years, though, and no one is sure exactly when, the plant may run out of room to store the contaminated water. \u201cWe cannot continue to build tanks forever,\u201d said Shigenori Hata, an official at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.The authorities are debating whether it might be acceptable, given the relatively low radioactive levels in the water, to dilute the contaminated water and then dump it into the ocean. But local fishermen are vehemently opposed. Many people still do not trust Tokyo Electric because of its bungled response to the disaster, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.The process of decontaminating the water leaves radioactive sludge trapped in filters, which are being held in thousands of containers of different sizes.Tokyo Electric says it cannot quantify the amount of radioactive sludge being generated. But it says it is experimenting with what to do with it, including mixing it with cement or iron. Then it will have to decide how to store it.The estimated 6,000 cleanup workers at the site put on new protective gear every day. These hazmat suits, face masks, rubber gloves and shoe coverings are thrown out at the end of each shift. The clothing is compressed and stored in 1,000 steel boxes stacked around the site.To date, more than 64,700 cubic meters of gear has been discarded, the equivalent of 17 million one-gallon containers. Tokyo Electric says it will eventually incinerate all this contaminated clothing to reduce the space needed to store it.The plant\u2019s grounds were once dotted with trees, and a portion was even designated as a bird sanctuary. But workers have cleared about 220 acres of trees since the meltdown spewed radiation over them.Now, piles of branches and tree trunks are stacked all over the site. Officials say there are about 80,000 cubic meters of this waste, and all of it will have to be incinerated and stored someday.Explosions during the meltdown filled the reactors with rubble. Workers and robots are slowly and carefully trying to remove this tangled mass of crushed concrete, pipes, hoses and metal.Tokyo Electric estimates that more than 200,400 cubic meters of rubble \u2014 all of it radioactive \u2014 have been removed so far and stored in custom-made steel boxes. That is the equivalent of about 3,000 standard 40-foot shipping containers.Thousands of plastic garbage bags sit in neat rows in the fields and abandoned towns surrounding the Fukushima plant. They contain soil that was scraped from land that was exposed to radiation in the days after the accident.Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment estimates that it has bagged 3.5 billion gallons of soil, and plans to collect much more. It will eventually incinerate some of the soil, but that will only reduce the volume of the radioactive waste, not eliminate it.The ministry has already begun building a massive, interim storage facility in Fukushima prefecture and negotiating with 2,360 landowners for the thousands of acres needed to complete it. And that is not even a long-term solution: The government says that after 30 years it will need another site \u2014 or sites \u2014 to store radioactive waste.The ultimate goal of the cleanup is to cool and, if possible, remove the uranium and plutonium fuel that was inside the three reactors at the time of the disaster.Hundreds of spent fuel rods are in cooling pools inside the reactors, and the company hopes to have cleared away enough rubble to begin removing them next year. The much bigger challenge will be removing the fuel that was in use in the reactor core at the time of the meltdown.The condition and location of this molten fuel debris are still largely unknown. In one reactor where a robot was sent in January, much of the melted fuel is believed to have burned through the bottom of the inner reactor vessel and burrowed into the thick concrete foundation of the containment structure.The plan is to completely seal the containment vessels, fill them with water and use robots to find and remove the molten fuel debris. But the rubble, the lethal levels of radiation and the risk of letting radiation escape make this an exceedingly difficult task.In January, a camera inserted into one of the reactors detected radiation levels high enough to kill a person in less than a minute. A robot that was sent into the reactor last month had to be abandoned after debris blocked its path and radiation disabled it.Tokyo Electric hopes to begin removing fuel debris from the reactor cores in 2021. The entire effort could take decades. Some say the radioactive material may prove impossible to remove safely and have suggested leaving it and entombing Fukushima under a concrete and steel sarcophagus like the one used at Chernobyl.But the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric say they are committed to removing all the waste and cleaning the site, estimated at a cost of $188.6 billion.\u201cWe want to return it to a safe state,\u201d said Yuichi Okamura, general manager of the company\u2019s nuclear power and plant siting division. \u201cWe promised the local people that we would recover the site and make it a safe ground again.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on March 13 about Japan\u2019s struggle with the radioactive waste that remains six years after the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant referred incorrectly to the discovery of lethal levels of radiation in one of the reactors in January. The radiation was detected with a camera inserted into the reactor, not a robot. Also because of an editing error, a picture caption with the article misidentified the contents of the shipping containers shown. They hold reactor maintenance equipment, not rubble.Advertisement"}

But none of his employees dared to tell him.When he got home, though, his wife told him it was there and he was appalled. But he was even more appalled when he showed up for work over the next few days and eventually \u201cevery jerk from the chairman to the clerk had a lump of peanut butter on his chin.\u201dThat spoof of underlings who witlessly mimic their bosses came to mind as I listened to Trump aides and allies justifying the president\u2019s Saturday morning Twitter rant alleging \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that President Barack Obama ordered Trump Tower phones be tapped during the 2016 campaign. It seemed like the whole Trump team was putting peanut butter on their chins. The only question was who had the biggest lump.But Sanders is just a flack. More troubling was watching an honorable soldier, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, dab on some Skippy and defend Trump\u2019s claim on CNN, saying that \u201cthe president must have his reasons.\u201dThen why doesn\u2019t the secretary of homeland security know them and why doesn\u2019t the president share them? And, by the way, why are you on television with peanut butter on your chin, saying the President has reasons but not saying what they are? That\u2019s how a morally bankrupt president soils everyone around him, even such a good man.Trump ran for office promising to protect Americans from terrorists, immigrants and free trade agreements. But who will protect us from him? If our president is willing to casually throw under a bus our most elemental principles of presidential conduct \u2014 such as, you don\u2019t accuse your predecessor of a high crime without evidence, just to divert attention away from your latest mess \u2014 we have a real problem.We have so many big, hard things we need to do, but big hard things can only be done together. And that takes a leader who can bring us together to do things worthy of our energies and dedication \u2014 like proper health care reform, immigration reform, tax reform and infrastructure investment, or properly working with China and Russia where we can and drawing red lines where we must.But it also requires trust in the integrity of that leader \u2014 that when things get tough, the leader won\u2019t bail and shoot his aides and followers in the back. There is not a G.O.P. congressman or U.S. ally abroad who today is not asking: Can I trust this guy when the going gets tough, or will Trump lay a fact-free Twitter rant on me? Can I even trust sharing information with him?Government moves \u201cat the speed of trust,\u201d observes Stephen M. R. Covey in his book \u201cThe Speed of Trust.\u201d \u201cThere is one thing that is common to every individual, relationship, team, family, organization, nation, economy, and civilization throughout the world \u2014 one thing which, if removed, will destroy the most powerful government, the most successful business, the most thriving economy, the most influential leadership, the greatest friendship, the strongest character, the deepest love. \u2026 That one thing is trust.\u201dDespite a bizarre number of meetings with Russians, no proof has surfaced that Trump\u2019s team colluded with Russia. What our top three intelligence services have declared, though, is that Russia did hack our election on Trump\u2019s behalf. And as more of our lives move to cyberspace, understanding exactly how that was done, how it is probably being done in European elections right now and how to deter this new weapon from undermining the West, which is Russia\u2019s goal, is a vital security issue. Without an electoral process we can trust, we\u2019re sunk.Sadly, most of the Republican Party today is morally AWOL, preferring to sweep the Russian hacking under the carpet rather than have a credible, independent investigation. That will lead people to question any collaboration Trump tries with Moscow.Moreover, one day soon something will happen \u2014 in North Korea, the South China Sea, Ukraine, Iran \u2014 that will require him to make a judgment call. Trump will have to look the American people in the eye and say: \u201cTrust me \u2014 I decided this based on the best information and advice of the intelligence community.\u201d Or, \u201cTrust me, we needed to work with Russia on this.\u201dAnd who will believe him? There is nothing more dangerous than a U.S. president who\u2019s squandered his trust before he has to lead us through a crisis.

I was interested in doing something much narrower: one country road, how it was playing a role in this and how nearby residents were responding to it.I reached out to local officials in Champlain and called the number for the taxi service listed on the side of the car that appeared in a local television news clip about the illegal crossings. Based on that, I decided that I should drive to Roxham Road, park and watch life unfold. While waiting, I walked up and down the quiet rural street and talked to its residents.

{"Headline": "Trump Says Regulations Impede. Perhaps Not in the Electric Car Business.", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThat\u2019s one possibility. We also have to consider another scenario: Loosening the fuel-economy rules could remove a primary incentive for big carmakers to catch up with innovative upstarts like Tesla and leave the American car industry out of step with a future ruled by electric motors rather than the internal combustion engine.This might happen because the effects of regulation are not as simple as Mr. Trump argues. The president\u2019s view that rules almost always hurt businesses is not supported by history. Researchers who study regulation and its effects on business said there have been numerous instances in which regulation speeds along, rather than impedes, technological progress. It has happened in the energy business, the electronics industry and health care.\u201cHaving long-term targets is driving investments in innovative technologies,\u201d said Don Anair, who studies the auto industry for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group. \u201cMaintaining those standards is critical for maintaining that progress.\u201dCar manufacturers disagree. A spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that represents automakers on policy issues, said that regulations themselves are not spurring sales.You might wonder why electric cars need help. If more efficient cars are so clearly better than their predecessors, shouldn\u2019t the market ensure their success?But that\u2019s not how technological progress typically works. New technologies \u2014 even ones that, on paper, look much better than old ones \u2014 usually start out at a severe disadvantage to the stuff they\u2019re up against. The first personal computers were costlier and less powerful than early mainframes, for instance, and early digital cameras were not as good as film cameras.Sometimes these technologies do not need a regulatory helping hand to get ahead. They merely get better with scale; the more that people bought digital cameras, the more manufacturers could invest in making better sensors, which became less expensive and offered better resolution, which in turn spurred sales, and on and on.Electric cars also depend on scale. Like the production of camera sensors and microprocessors, batteries and other components for electric cars also get less expensive when there is a mass market for these vehicles.But the process is slow, and it faces lots of hurdles. Switching to an electric car isn\u2019t like switching to a digital camera. Gasoline engines are entrenched in the transportation economy. To make your electric car work correctly, you need an infrastructure to support it \u2014 you need ways to charge it, repair it, maintain it, resell it. In the absence of that ecosystem, switching to a car based on a fundamentally new tech platform, even if might offer benefits in the long run, is going to be hard \u2014 which means that car companies won\u2019t have much incentive to build it.That\u2019s where regulation comes in. Traditionally, economists thought of regulation as a cost imposed by the government on companies. But in the 1990s, the economist Michael Porter argued that government rules could sometimes push industries to pursue technological innovations that they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise considered.In 2018, about 4.5 percent of a company\u2019s sales in the covered states must be zero-emission vehicles (the cars can be fully electric, plug-in hybrids or powered by hydrogen fuel cell). By 2025, that rises to 22 percent. But the requirements are flexible. To meet the standards, car companies can decline to make electric vehicles and instead buy \u201ccredits\u201d from other manufacturers; companies that sell more electric cars than the minimum standard can sell their extra credits.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that the standard itself is creating an environment of competition, which is leading to rapid advances in electrification over the last seven years,\u201d said Mr. Anair of the Union of Concerned Scientists.But the California rules under which we\u2019ve seen these advances were made possible by a federal waiver granted by the Obama administration. Some environmentalists now worry that the Trump administration could attempt to revoke that waiver \u2014 and with it, the nation\u2019s best shot at moving beyond gas engines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lesson Trump and the E.P.A. Should Heed", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn March 1983, President Ronald Reagan asked me to return to Washington to run the Environmental Protection Agency. I had been the E.P.A.\u2019s first administrator, from 1970 to 1973, and over the agency\u2019s first 10 years, it made enormous progress in bringing the country\u2019s worst pollution problems under control despite resistance from polluting industries and their lobbyists. A worried and outraged public had demanded action, and the government responded.The E.P.A. I returned to in the spring of 1983, some 28 months into President Reagan\u2019s first term, was dispirited and in turmoil. Its administrator, Anne M. Gorsuch, had been cited for contempt of Congress. Its budget had been reduced by almost 25 percent, with more cuts promised. Staffing had been slashed.While I awaited Senate confirmation hearings that April, several chemical industry chief executives asked to meet with me. I expected to hear complaints that over-regulation was stifling economic growth, just as I had heard 10 years earlier.Instead, I was stunned by their message. The public, they told me, was spooked about the turmoil at E.P.A. Americans didn\u2019t believe anything was being done to protect their health and the environment. They didn\u2019t believe the E.P.A., and they didn\u2019t believe the chemical industry. These executives had concluded that they needed a confident, fair and independent E.P.A. They knew that an environmental agency trusted by the public to do its job gave their businesses a public license to operate.A strong and credible regulatory regime is essential to the smooth functioning of our economy. Unless people believe their health and the environment are being safeguarded, they will withdraw their permission for companies to do business. The chemical industry executives who came in to see me that day felt this loss of public support and were asking me to reassure Americans that the government would do its job to protect them.Our collective freedom and well-being depends on a set of restraints that govern society and how it operates. Those restraints need to be clear and effective. They were not in 1983.The E.P.A.\u2019s new administrator, Scott Pruitt, comes to his job with this historical backdrop. Are there changes that can be made to improve how the agency operates? Certainly. But those changes can never be seen as undercutting or abandoning the E.P.A.\u2019s basic mission. That was the mistake made during the early Reagan years and why I was asked to return.One of the factors leading to the creation of E.P.A. was the recognition that without a set of federal standards to protect public health from environmental pollution, states would continue to compete for industrial development by taking short cuts on environmental protection. The laws that the E.P.A. administers create a strong federal-state partnership that has worked well for over 40 years. The federal government sets the standards and the states enforce them, with the E.P.A. stepping in only if the states default on their responsibilities.Budget cuts that hurt programs that states now have in place to meet those duties run the risk of returning us to a time when some states offered industries a free lunch, creating havens for polluters. This could leave states with strong environmental programs supported by the public at a competitive disadvantage compared to states with weak programs. In other words, it could lead to a race to the bottom.Voters may have supported Donald J. Trump believing his campaign rhetoric about the E.P.A. But they don\u2019t want their kids choking on polluted air or drinking tainted water any more than Hillary Clinton voters, and as soon as the agency stops doing its job, they\u2019re going to be up in arms.To me, the E.P.A. represents one of the clearest examples of our political system listening and responding to the American people. The public will tolerate changes that allow the agency to meet its mandated goals more efficiently and effectively. They will not tolerate changes that threaten their health or the precious environment.These are the lessons President Reagan learned in 1983. We would all do well to heed them.An Op-Ed article on Tuesday about the role of the E.P.A. misstated when the writer resumed leading the agency. It was 28 months into President Ronald Reagan\u2019s term, not 18 months.William D. Ruckelshaus was the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hotel Boom Comes to Texas", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byItinerariesThere had not been a hotel building boom in Texas in about a decade, said Daniel Moon, the vice president of the Sam Moon Group, a developer of shopping centers and hotels in the Dallas area. But recent relocations by corporate headquarters and population growth have been driving new demand, and there is still plenty of open space to build on around the major cities, he said. Mr. Moon\u2019s company, which has been in business since the mid-1980s, is building its own first full-service hotel, a Marriott Renaissance in Plano, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.The state\u2019s development-friendly attitudes are also a major driver, though each city\u2019s particular circumstances have also helped fuel the growth.The hotel industry in general has benefited from a strong national economy. As a result, the industry has experienced significant growth in the past seven years, said Eric Jacobs, the chief development officer in North America of Marriott Select Brands.One bellwether measurement is revenue per available room, which is the hotel industry\u2019s average daily room rate multiplied by its occupancy. Revenue per available room has had 83 straight months of year-over-year growth in the United States. In the past five to six years, hotels have also had the highest occupancy rates the industry has ever experienced, according to STR.The number of new hotels in Texas is notable. In 2017, Marriott plans to open eight hotels in Austin, seven in Houston and 23 in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, according to the company. Ninety-two other Marriott hotels are in the planning stages for the three metro areas. Hilton says it is planning for 75 new hotels there. InterContinental Hotels Group has more than 100 hotel projects in the Austin, Dallas and Houston metro areas, including the Candlewood Suites, Crowne Plaza, Even Hotels, Holiday Inn Express, Holiday Inn, Hotel Indigo, InterContinental Hotels and Resorts and Staybridge Suites brands.Houston, by contrast, \u201chas always been a Monday through Thursday hotel market,\u201d because so many of its travelers are there for business in the oil and gas industry, he said. The city is trying to diversify its economy by building meeting services.\u201cThe state is looking for supertanker hotels to put in next to convention centers,\u201d said Lauro Ferroni, the global head for research for the hotels and hospitality group at JLL, an international real estate investment, management and research firm based in Chicago. A 1,000-room Marriott Marquis recently opened next to the Houston convention center.In the Dallas area, a number of large mixed-use developments are going up. One area, called \u201cthe $5 Billion Mile,\u201d is being built in Frisco, in easy driving distance from both downtown Dallas and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Anchored by a new Dallas Cowboys headquarters, training center and indoor stadium, the area will include corporate office space, stores and housing. Seven hotels have been announced so far.All three metropolitan areas have comparatively few environmental regulations and an expanse of cheap land, and they put a premium on rapid approval of development, Mr. Powell, of Hilton, said.Local and state governments, known to favor spending on business interests over social programs, compete to offer sales tax breaks, real estate tax abatements and other incentives to draw in developers.They also \u201cinvest in roads and other infrastructure, which helps attract manufacturing, fill office space, and that drives demand for hotel rooms,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said.A move toward repurposing unused office space and other buildings, along with a tax credit, has also made hotel projects possible. Two examples are the new Westin in Dallas and a JW Marriott in Houston, Mr. Ferroni said. These kinds of projects would not be viable without government financial support, he said.New boutique and lifestyle hotel brands like Element and Aloft that started in Miami, San Francisco and New York are also now making their way to Texas, Mr. Ferroni said.There are always risks of overbuilding, Mr. Powell said. Even in the quick-build ecosystem of Texas, the time it takes to go from researching the idea of a new hotel to actually opening it can be three years or more. In that time, energy prices can significantly affect the Texas economy. \u201cBecause oil and gas prices have been low for the past few years, some projects in Houston have slowed or stalled,\u201d Mr. Powell said.The overall risk to hotel companies like Hilton and Marriott is limited, though, because they no longer own the majority of the properties that bear their name. Instead, they lease their brand names to independent developers, owners and real estate trusts.Hotel chains have become more \u201casset light\u201d in the past 10 years, said Jeff Higley, the vice president for digital media and communications and the editorial director of Hotel News Now. \u201cThey want to manage and franchise the properties but don\u2019t want to have real estate on their balance sheets.\u201dSTR estimates that the hotels under construction in these three areas are owned by more than 60 companies.Hotel owners in Texas are generally local developers and corporations. \u201cIt\u2019s a connected community,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIf you\u2019re already in the business, you\u2019re likely to hear before an investor in New York or San Francisco when land is available for sale. You know the permitting process and what you need to do, so you can move quickly.\u201dOf course, there are downsides to all this construction. Two of the metro areas, Houston and Dallas, have struggled with high levels of air pollution, and construction contributes to that through land clearing, the operation of diesel engines, working with toxic chemicals and dust creation. Surface water runoff at the construction site can also carry pollutants into local waterways and groundwater.The proliferation of hotels also means more competition, even within the same parent companies. Hotel builders, however, are betting that the overall growth in convention, business and tourist travel will more than compensate.Advertisement"}

The client liked his work and was inspired to write letters supporting the lawyer for a prospective judgeship. Likewise, that strikes me as being in the natural order of things.

And Judge Gorsuch seems to have made a conscientious effort to recuse himself from cases involving that former client. The headline represents powerful innuendo, but it\u2019s not warranted by the reporting in the article. The reporters obviously spent a lot of time on this piece, but my takeaway is that they had to stretch to try to come up with something to justify their investigative efforts, namely, they (and your editors) felt compelled to hint that there\u2019s a \u201csecretive web\u201d (did someone mention spiders?) of something untoward going on.Wilson Neely, New York, N.Y.Headline writers, pressed for time, can be the bane of careful reporters: \u201cIs that what our article implies?\u201d Why not a headline that just says, \u201cCourt Nominee Has Web of Ties To Philip F.

{"Headline": "Amid \u2018Trump Effect\u2019 Fear, 40% of Colleges See Dip in Foreign Applicants", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byThe president of Portland State University, Wim Wiewel, met last week with 10 prospective students in Hyderabad, India. But what started as a get-acquainted visit quickly turned into more of a counseling session, as the students expressed fears about coming to the United States this fall.One student, who is Muslim, said his father was worried that America had an anti-Muslim attitude, Mr. Wiewel recounted. \u201cSeveral others said they were concerned about the \u2018Trump effect,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.\u201cI\u2019d say the rhetoric and actual executive orders are definitely having a chilling effect,\u201d Mr. Wiewel wrote, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban.Like many universities across the country, the Oregon university is getting fewer international applications.Many officials cited worries among prospective students about Trump administration immigration policies. \u201cInternational student recruitment professionals report a great deal of concern from students all over the globe,\u201d the study said.Graduate schools appear to be feeling the worst pinch, with nearly half reporting drops. \u201cOur deans describe it as a chilling effect,\u201d said Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools.Still, despite the steady increase, the movement of students from one country to another is sensitive to fluctuations tied to political and economic forces. So some officials cautioned that a \u201cTrump effect\u2019 is just one possible explanation for this year\u2019s application figures. Beyond that, many schools, including New York University, the University of Southern California and Northeastern University, reported that their international numbers are up. Purdue University reported a 1.2 percent decline in graduate school applications.For several graduate schools, the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, which initially affected seven predominantly Muslim countries, could not have been more poorly timed. It was announced in late January as deadlines loomed for applications to some graduate programs, and it came on the heels of Mr. Trump\u2019s virulently anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign.Slumping graduate school applications can now be seen at universities ranging from giant Big Ten public universities like Ohio State and Indiana University to regional programs such as Portland State, with just over 27,000 students, including more than 1,900 international students.At Indiana University, international applications for undergraduate programs increased 6 percent, but graduate applications for some programs are posting big drops, said David Zaret, vice president for international affairs.Mr. Zaret said international applications to the masters program in business were down 20 percent, and down 30 percent in both the master of law program and at the School of Informatics and Computing. The university will not have problems filling the programs, but the drop might affect the overall quality of the applicant pool, he said.Ohio State has also seen an increase in international undergraduate applications but a significant overall drop \u2014 8.4 percent \u2014 in international applicants to its graduate programs, a university spokesman, Chris Davey, said. The biggest decline was among students from China \u2014 a fact Mr. Davey said did not support the \u201cTrump effect\u201d theory. In 2016, he said, there were 2,412 graduate applications from China; this year the number was down to 1,952.\u201cWe\u2019re inclined to say that the overarching factors that might be influencing this are probably global economic factors and it would be premature to conclude that it\u2019s the travel ban,\u201d Mr. Davey said. \u201cBut it certainly could be.\u201dBecause application deadlines at several larger colleges had passed before Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban was announced, some universities are more worried about the \u201cyield\u201d \u2014 the number of students offered admission who end up enrolling, said Frances Leslie, vice provost for the graduate division at the University of California, Irvine.Applications at Irvine are not down, but students have expressed concerned about coming to the United States, Ms. Leslie said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from students, even beyond the seven countries, expressing concern,\u201d Ms. Leslie said, referring to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, which were singled out in the first travel ban. \u201cThis year, even when students are admitted, they may not be willing to accept the offers.\u201dThe university will not have those numbers until April 15, a national deadline for students to make a decision.At Portland State, where undergraduate international applications are up 4 percent but international graduate applications are down 15 percent, the vice provost for international affairs, Margaret Everett, said she had heard recently from a Chinese student who canceled his application, citing the political climate.\u201cObviously we\u2019re concerned about the climate and the rhetoric and the administration policies and travel ban,\u201d Ms. Everett said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Jobs Report Is Telling Mr. Trump", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byEditorialHe may want to take credit for the 235,000 jobs created last month, but at this early stage of his administration, the tally reflects trends established under President Obama.Those trends are indeed positive. Job growth has averaged about 200,000 jobs a month for the past year, and the unemployment rate dipped last month to 4.7 percent. At that pace, the economy is steadily progressing toward full employment, that sweet spot where everyone who is able and willing to work can get a job.But it is not there yet, and for Mr. Trump, that poses a challenge. Will his policies foster the trend, or derail it?The underemployment rate, which includes part-time workers who need but cannot find full-time work, was 9.2 percent last month and would need to fall by about a point for there to be a truly robust job market.Another troubling sign is that lower-wage jobs in home care, hotel work and food service still account for much of the hiring. If better-paying jobs were being more reliably created, or if pay was not so stubbornly stagnant for many low-wage workers, the improving conditions would already be doing more to push wages higher.The gradual tightening in the job market has pushed up wages, but not enough to make up for years of stagnation for most workers.Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has thus far shown no interest in higher minimum wages, overtime protections and other efforts to improve labor standards, even though the data is telling him these measures work.So could fulfilling some of his promises. Federal infrastructure spending could bolster employment, wages and growth, especially at a time like the present when there is still slack in the labor market. So far, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to pursue such projects remains all talk. The rollback of the Affordable Care Act would most likely cost jobs.Mr. Trump has been given a leg up in delivering well-being to ordinary Americans. He needs to take advantage of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine \u2018Blockaders\u2019 Try to Cut Off Rail Traffic From Rebel Areas", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byUnidentified men carrying clubs attack a group of men who seem to have commandeered the freight train, and a fight ensues with sticks, hurled stones and a buzzing chain saw. The defenders of the train are getting the worst of it until an armed man arrives on the scene and fires a warning shot into the air, scattering the attackers.Tensions are rising along the border between Ukraine and the breakaway \u201crepublics\u201d in the eastern part of the country as Ukrainian nationalists from the western part seek to choke off all railroad traffic in what they are calling a blockade.The war in eastern Ukraine, now entering its third year, has been the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. Despite the continuing clashes, however, the lucrative cross-border coal trade has been peculiarly unaffected.The blockaders, as they call themselves, are a relatively new movement but are already becoming relevant to the delicate politics of peace in Ukraine, seemingly a focus of the Trump administration as it seeks to establish warmer ties with Russia. Their primary goal is to cut off the trains carrying coal from the east that powers industry in the west but also is a major source of income for the Russian-backed eastern republics.The idea, which has animated Ukrainian nationalist circles, is to force the financing of the breakaway regions and their three million or so inhabitants onto Russia\u2019s already weak economy by breaking ties with Ukraine\u2019s industrial base.\u201cPutin wants us to finance the war he started,\u201d Volodymyr Parasiuk, a member of Parliament and one of the movement\u2019s leaders, said in a telephone interview, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cHe wants the republics to finance themselves, by selling coal.\u201dThe government in Kiev says that the country \u2014 western as well as eastern parts \u2014 depends on the coal trade for hundreds of thousands of jobs, as well as heat and electrical power.Already the blockaders have forced a mine and a steel plant in the separatist region to shut down. And economists say half a million jobs and a total of $3.5 billion in revenue from steel exports depend on the coal trains. Some of that money ends up in the coffers of the breakaway regions.The blockaders say the club-wielding men in the video were thugs hired by the coal industry. Three people were wounded, including one man who suffered a broken leg. Ukrainian government police arrested 37 people, mostly the hired thugs.It is unclear how many people are involved in the blockade effort. The groups of mostly war veterans are not formally affiliated with any political parties or the government. For a month now, usually armed with hunting rifles and clubs, they have blocked railroad tracks that cross the de facto border into the pro-Russian areas, warming themselves by campfires and shooing away the police.In their camps along the railway tracks, they wear smudged camouflage and tattered winter coats, like hobos with a geopolitical agenda. At one spot, the men have welded the wheels of a coal train to the tracks, locking it in place and, naturally, preventing other trains from passing.In a remarkable example of big business emerging unscathed from the war, the companies of Rinat Akhmetov, a coal and steel tycoon who is Ukraine\u2019s richest man, have managed to move goods over the border in both directions, without interference from either army. Bloomberg recently estimated Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s net worth at $3.6 billion.A spokesman for Mr. Akhmetov emphasized the trade was legal and kept people on both sides employed. \u201cWe believe that private property is sovereign,\u201d Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s company, SCM Group, said in a statement Thursday.On Wednesday, the Ukrainian cabinet tried to defuse the crisis with a decree limiting trade with the enemy to food, medicine and other humanitarian goods, but also coal, recognizing that it is essential for Ukrainian industry.And the movement seems to be picking up political support in Kiev. Aliona I. Shkrum, a member of Parliament with the opposition Fatherland party, said the blockade does not violate international law, in contrast to sieges enforced by the Syrian government against rebel areas there, so long as food and medicine are allowed through, as they are now.Many of these activists already rue the compromises that the government of President Petro O. Poroshenko, who replaced Mr. Yanukovych, agreed to with Moscow in earlier peace deals, particularly what they see as a commitment to reintegrate the region politically and economically and stage elections before Russian troops leave.Any potential peace deal with the Trump administration seen as favoring Russia will only aggravate these tensions, inciting more rebellion among a hardened group of protesters.\u201cUkrainians have an idealistic idea of resistance,\u201d said Mr. Parasiuk, the member of Parliament who is supporting the blockaders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed\u2019s Era of Easy Money Is Ending", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWhen the Federal Reserve made its first tentative step toward ending its era of extraordinary monetary intervention, it earned a nickname: the taper tantrum. Global financial markets metaphorically bawled like a toddler on news that the Fed planned on \u201ctapering\u201d its stimulus program.That was nearly four years ago. Ever since, the Fed has moved to decrease access to easy money with the caution of a technician defusing a powerful bomb. After raising its interest-rate target above near-zero levels in December 2015, the Fed waited a full year before doing so again, the slowest pace of rate increases in the modern history of the central bank.Under the chairwoman, Janet Yellen, the Fed is likely to raise its target interest rate a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday \u2014 a mere three months after the last one. It will probably signal that two more rate increases, barring economic setbacks, are on the way in 2017.It\u2019s not the policy alone that is striking. Over several days this month, half a dozen senior Fed officials made public comments that suggested greater collective confidence and unanimity that the economy can handle tighter money than has been on display since the onset of the financial crisis nearly a decade ago.Making the comments all the more notable: Ms. Brainard was perhaps the Fed\u2019s most vocal advocate of caution on rate increases just a year ago, arguing that geopolitical risks loomed large.But something deeper may be afoot than just an improvement in the economic data. In both their tone and actions, Fed officials are displaying greater confidence that they know where the economy is heading \u2014 namely that it is converging on a state of full employment and inflation near their 2 percent target.\u201cWe are seeing an evolution away from a tactical approach toward a strategic approach,\u201d said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. \u201cTheir stance now is that they will focus on the destination, not the journey, and that they will lead markets rather than be led by markets.\u201dIndeed, the biggest contrast with this time a year ago is that financial markets seem to believe it. At the start of 2016, Fed officials were envisioning raising rates four times over the course of the year, but bond market prices suggested investors weren\u2019t buying it and thought only one or two rate increases were on the way.The markets were right. With some weak economic data and tumbling oil prices and volatile stock markets, the Fed stayed its hand.The start of 2017 could hardly feel more different. Stock markets are booming, as are measures of consumer and business confidence. Economic data, including jobs numbers Friday, have been solid. Investors see a 60 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates three or more times this year, based on prices in futures markets Friday.This time, in other words, the market actually believes the Fed will follow through with its plans to gradually raise rates.One piece of evidence is that Fed officials, during the week of Feb. 27 to March 3, confidently signaled that a March 15 rate increase was imminent. By doing so before the February jobs report was released, they were making clear that even if that report had been soft, they were committed to rate increases.The officials appear to have plotted a course to raise rates a few times a year with expectations of reaching the so-called neutral rate \u2014 at which monetary policy is neither stimulating nor slowing the economy \u2014 near the end of 2019. As of their December meeting, Fed leaders think that neutral rate is 3 percent.But at the Fed, the momentum now evident in the economy feels hard won, and officials may be reluctant to risk it by tightening the monetary spigots prematurely.Even if the central bank\u2019s most recent forecasts become reality, it will represent a historically slow pattern of monetary tightening \u2014 four years to raise interest rates by about three percentage points. In the 1994 cycle, engineered by the chairman Alan Greenspan, a rate rise of that scale happened in just 13 months.The big question for the months ahead is what it would take to change direction once again. Would a new soft patch in the economic data, a new bout of market turbulence or a new crisis lead Chairwoman Yellen and her colleagues to again retreat to the wait-and-see school of interest-rate increases?\u201cI do think there\u2019s some greater willingness to tolerate some shortfall in the data compared to expectations,\u201d said David Stockton, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Fed official. \u201cThey are exhibiting more confidence in the economy, but that doesn\u2019t mean that confidence couldn\u2019t dissipate in the face of some scary event.\u201dThe new, more confident, interest-rate-raising Fed will last, in other words, as long as events allow it to.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lygia Pape\u2019s Brazil, From the Beach to the Barricades", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewWhat do you do when your government cracks, and when dreams for the future die? How should your art change when social circumstances worsen? Pape, the most experimental and restless of Brazil\u2019s great postwar artists, offers one answer. She spent her whole life in Rio de Janeiro, and the upbeat abstract forms of her early paintings and reliefs rhyme with the buoyant mood of a nation on the move, when Bras\u00edlia, a futuristic capital, was rising in the heartland. But for the bulk of her career, from 1964 to 1985, she lived and worked under a dictatorship. She was briefly imprisoned, and tortured.New times called for a new art of public intervention, communal action, anthropological inquiry and boundless risk. Whether or not you agree with the protesters that Brazil\u2019s current political situation amounts to a coup, her edgy, unsettled art should be a standard for artists today in Brazil, and in another large, politically fraught country in this hemisphere.The Met Breuer\u2019s retrospective, \u201cLygia Pape: A Multitude of Forms,\u201d is the first for Pape in the United States, and it has been organized by Iria Candela, a Met curator of Latin American art. Though it\u2019s hardly perfect \u2014 stumbling particularly with Pape\u2019s films \u2014 it features galleries of exquisite beauty and command, especially in the early stretches.\u201cTt\u00e9ia 1.\u201dYet where artists in S\u00e3o Paulo often took a rigorous approach to abstraction, Pape and her Rio colleagues Clark and Oiticica were dreamier. In 1959 they veered into a more active, experimental mode they called Neo-Concretism, which prioritized participation, sensuality and the integration of art into daily life. (A copy of the Neo-Concrete Manifesto is on display here, from an age when artists still got their messages out in the Sunday paper.) Clark began her hinged bichos (critters), Oiticica made hanging wood constructions, and Pape started to make unbound books, meant to be handled, that channeled nature or the built environment into joyous abstraction.\u201cLivro da Cria\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d (\u201cBook of Creation\u201d), from 1959-60, comprises 16 square boards that translate prehistory into pure form: Red and white triangles suggest the discovery of fire, a folding fan stands for the invention of the wheel, and a rotating red disk symbolizes the invention of timekeeping. (You can fiddle with a replica here, fitting its cutouts together or spinning one page\u2019s concentric rings.) Later, displayed on a cramped wall you wish were a little longer, comes the 365-element \u201cLivro do Tempo\u201d (\u201cBook of Time\u201d), 1961-63, a major work from Pape\u2019s Neo-Concrete period whose red, yellow and blue reliefs function as a sort of abstract calendar.The same year, she took a huge white sheet, sliced at regular intervals, to one of Rio\u2019s many favelas. The children to whom she presented the sheet popped their heads through the slits, laughing and sticking out their tongues, as they unified their bodies into a collective organism that breathed and undulated, as gracefully as an octopus in the sea. \u201cDivisor\u201d (\u201cDivider\u201d) became one of Pape\u2019s most significant artworks; she restaged it several times in 1968 in much more glamorous parts of Rio. A social sculpture, it was complete only with group participation \u2014 though it was also, in a reversal typical of \u201960s Brazilian art, a biting metaphor for government surveillance and limits to freedom.Several of these films play on a loop in a tiny black box, and interesting but unessential materials, like title designs she did for Cinema Novo directors, delay the projection of major later works like \u201cCarnival in Rio\u201d (1974), a sociological portrait with a samba beat, and \u201cCatiti-Catiti\u201d (1978), a biting superimposition of Ipanema Beach glamour shots and darker texts about Brazil\u2019s colonization. Others are shown awkwardly at waist height, or on small screens in a darkened hallway. A proper film program would have helped.Much of the Breuer\u2019s fourth floor has been cleared for a ravishing late work, \u201cTt\u00e9ia 1,\u201d in which hundreds of golden filaments stretch from the ceiling to a large central platform. It\u2019s dazzling; it\u2019s sultry; it\u2019ll be selfie central. But don\u2019t let it sidetrack you from Pape\u2019s more pugnacious work with the camera, from her Super 8 footage shot in a favela on the sea to her documentary \u201cA M\u00e3o do Povo\u201d (\u201cThe Hand of the People\u201d), from 1975, which contrasts indigenous Brazilian art and handicraft with consumerist junk in Brazil\u2019s big cities.The films, more than anything here, offer a model for how to make art when the world outside seems to demand something more urgent. \u201cBrazil is made of perpetual disasters,\u201d Pape said in a 1997 interview. \u201cWe build the way Penelope weaves, and then someone undoes it.\u201dWhat the times required \u2014 and what today\u2019s Brazil, today\u2019s America, may require, too \u2014 was neither art for art\u2019s sake nor blunt propaganda, each in its own way a cop-out. They required an art plunged into life itself, uniting disparate figures into new fellowship, all under a common sheet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Breaks With Allies Over Trade Issues Amid Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 Vows", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byBADEN-BADEN, Germany \u2014 The United States broke with other large industrial nations over trade on Saturday as the Trump administration rejected concerns among allies about spreading protectionism and made clear that it would seek new approaches to managing global commerce.At a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging nations and the European Union, Steven Mnuchin, attending his first major international gathering as Treasury secretary, signaled that American policy would follow the campaign promises made by President Trump to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d and review existing trade agreements to seek better deals for the United States.As a result, the ministers\u2019 joint statement, normally a study in blandness, became an unlikely focus of controversy here. The representatives could agree only on a tortured compromise stating, in effect, that trade is a good thing. Adjectives like \u201copen\u201d were dropped, and the ministers omitted language used in previous communiqu\u00e9s that condemned protectionism, repudiating decades of free trade doctrine.For Asian and European officials, many of them meeting their Trump administration counterparts for the first time, it was a startling lesson in how Mr. Trump and his team are overturning long-held assumptions about international commerce.Mr. Mnuchin led off the ministers\u2019 meeting on Friday with a declaration that current trade rules were unfair to the United States, positioning the administration against virtually all the other participants, according to an official who attended the closed session and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.\u201cWe thought that it was very important for the communiqu\u00e9 to reflect what we discussed here,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a news conference on Saturday. \u201cThe historical language was not relevant.\u201dAt the insistence of the United States, the communiqu\u00e9 also dropped a pledge to observe the Paris accords on climate change. Mr. Mnuchin deflected questions on the issue, saying it was outside his purview.The American government\u2019s lack of reverence for existing norms and treaties is particularly unsettling to the change-averse Europeans, who are coping with weak economic growth and a surge in populism. The last thing they need is a disruption in commerce with their biggest trading partner.Some complained privately that the American delegation rode into this stately spa and casino town, where Romans once bathed in the mineral-rich waters, determined to shake up the existing order but without any clear idea of what should replace it.The disagreement over trade principles was a sharp contrast to the statement issued when the central bankers and finance ministers met in Chengdu, China, last July. \u201cWe underscore the role of open trade policies,\u201d the leaders said in the Chengdu communiqu\u00e9, which used the word \u201ctrade\u201d six times. They promised to \u201cresist all forms of protectionism.\u201dLess than a year ago, such a statement was not questioned. Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic still hoped for a trade pact between the United States and the European Union that would eliminate already low tariffs and harmonize regulations governing things like vehicle headlights.The best that the Group of 20 participants could come up with on Saturday was this: \u201cWe are working to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies.\u201dMr. Mnuchin argued that the news media\u2019s focus on the language of the communiqu\u00e9 was overblown and said that the discussions in Baden Baden had been congenial. \u201cWe were incredibly productive,\u201d he said.But he also made it clear that the Trump administration had a vastly different view than its recent predecessors. \u201cWe believe in free trade,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cWe want to re-examine certain agreements.\u201d\u201cBalanced trade has to be what\u2019s good for us and what\u2019s good for other people,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt has to be a win-win situation.\u201dThe communiqu\u00e9s issued at the end of Group of 20 summit meetings are meant to show that nations like Brazil, China, France and Japan can put aside competing interests and reach consensus, however vague, on major issues. The statements emerge from tortuous deliberations and are the opposite of impulsive.But even the usual boilerplate platitudes proved fraught at this summit meeting. For many European and Asian officials, meeting in a Belle \u00c9poch spa building with polished marble floors and chandeliers dangling from the ceiling, it was their first encounter with the Trump administration and its \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy.Some viewed the meetings as a chance to socialize with the new American representatives and to try to absorb them into the international order. Angel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and a participant in the meetings, said the chance to get to know Mr. Mnuchin was more important than any joint statement.\u201cWe want to make him feel comfortable; we want to make him feel at home,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda told reporters. \u201cThese meetings are not about the communiqu\u00e9.\u201dIn their public statements, European leaders played down the conflicts and said that the discussions had been amiable. The meetings in Baden-Baden came after Mr. Mnuchin visited Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, in Berlin.\u201cNaturally we have different points of view,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said at a news conference on Saturday in Baden-Baden. But he added, \u201cWe worked very hard for two days in a pleasant atmosphere.\u201dHe also denied that the American delegation was at odds with other participants. \u201cThe Americans were not isolated,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to impose punitive taxes on imported goods are a particular worry for Germany, whose economy is built around exports of automobiles and industrial machinery. The United States is the biggest purchaser of German goods, buying 107 billion euros, or $115 billion, worth last year. Germany imported goods from the United States worth 58 billion euros.The trade imbalance has made Germany a target for Trump administration officials, who have accused Germany of manipulating the value of the euro and have said they want to renegotiate trade terms directly with Berlin, even though that task is done at a European level by Brussels.\u201cWe are going to look to our counterparts to continue to trade, but to look to have more balanced trade,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThat means over time reducing our trade deficits. I think we can do that in a way that\u2019s good for the American worker, that\u2019s good for our companies and that\u2019s good for our counterparties.\u201dMelissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary of state specializing in North Korea.Mr. Kim said in January that North Korea was in the final stages of preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM: a weapon that could reach the United States. \u201cBased on what just happened at the test site, he doesn\u2019t seem to have been kidding,\u201d Mr. Revere said.The relationship is guided by \u201cnonconflict, nonconfrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said at a news conference with Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The Chinese state news media quoted Mr. Tillerson\u2019s echo of the Chinese phrasing, noting it approvingly.But behind the scenes, diplomats and analysts said there was little doubt that Mr. Tillerson had pressed China to enforce sanctions against North Korea and raised the possibility that the United States would bolster its missile defense in Asia if China did not rein in Mr. Kim.Mr. Tillerson was almost certainly sterner in private, according to the diplomat. \u201cI believe Tillerson repeated in the meetings what he said publicly in South Korea and Japan, and backed up Trump in his tweet,\u201d he said.That meant some public warmth was necessary, the diplomat said, because aside from talking about North Korea, Mr. Tillerson also had the task of setting a broad agenda for a summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi that is expected to take place in Florida in early April.Chinese analysts said Mr. Tillerson had probably encountered resistance to his arguments that the missile defense system \u2014 known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad \u2014 was of little danger to China, which firmly believes that the system erodes its nuclear deterrent.\u201cTillerson will repeat many times this is no threat to China, but Xi won\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University.The best chance for cooperation on North Korea might come if China decides to more dutifully enforce some economic sanctions, Mr. Shi said.That would be a relatively small price to pay the Americans for a smooth summit meeting in Florida, although it would further hurt China\u2019s already strained ties with North Korea, he said.\u201cMaybe Xi will broaden the punishment against North Korea somewhat, at the cost of further damaging relations with North Korea,\u201d Mr. Shi said. \u201cWe have punished North Korea many times, and Kim Jong-un hates China more and more. Maybe China will take some small steps to shut down a few trading companies, but not all.\u201d\u201cChina won\u2019t turn the sanctions from targeting the North Korean nuclear program into a punishment for ordinary North Korean people,\u201d The Global Times, a state-run newspaper that often reflects official thinking, said Friday.China has allowed large quantities of materials used to make a component of hydrogen bombs to pass through its borders to the North, according to the research group, the Institute for Science and International Security.A newly operating plant in North Korea that produces a key ingredient for hydrogen bombs is a glaring example of China\u2019s ignoring sanctions, the group said.The study found that a plant producing lithium 6 \u2014 used to manufacture hydrogen bombs that are more powerful than conventional nuclear weapons \u2014 was located at a chemical complex on North Korea\u2019s east coast.The North purchased mercury and lithium hydroxide in China, and the items were transported across the border, the president of the institute, David Albright, said. The two commodities are needed for the production of lithium 6, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Complex Cost of Brexit Gets Clearer", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byEditorialMuch has been said in these intervening months about the potential consequences of Brexit for Britain, Europe and the world, warning that the process will be hugely complex, impossible to complete in two years, painful for both sides, fraught with risk and riddled with a frightening array of unknowns.The European Union is no simple economic union, from which an exit means changing some trading rules. Since the Treaty of Rome was signed 60 years ago establishing the European Economic Community \u2014 the union marked the anniversary four days before Mrs. May dispatched her letter \u2014 the \u201cEuropean project\u201d has been an experiment in shared values, sovereignty, standards and laws among nations with differing histories, styles and languages.The negotiations might turn ugly over Britain\u2019s \u201cexit bill,\u201d the many billions of euros that the European Union may demand in various dues and contributions. The French have demanded that terms of the exit be settled before any trade talks. On the legal front, Britain needs to revise more than 12,000 regulations and thousands of laws that either incorporate or are shaped by European legislation. On the international front, Brexit is music to the ears of President Vladimir Putin, in whose zero-sum worldview any weakening of Europe equals the strengthening of his Russia.As for Europe, it\u2019s hard to overestimate the importance of the union in maintaining peace on the Continent, creating a functional single market, and serving as a potent counterweight to authoritarian countries.Whatever disdain the British might feel for the European Union, its survival and strength should be as important to Britain as they are to the remaining members. And however strongly the union might want to make an example of Brexit that other members will not want to follow, there is no gain in making the rift with Britain worse than it is. There is no turning back from Brexit, and the challenge now for Britain and the European Union should be to do the least harm to each other and the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Small Table Maker Takes On Alibaba\u2019s Flood of Fakes", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 From his desk in a downtown workshop, Greg Hankerson is at war with a Chinese company half a world away.One recent day, Mr. Hankerson fired up his web browser to scan for counterfeits. Several Taobao shops sell copies of various Vintage Industrial tables, including one with A-shaped legs and another with a glass top and propeller-like base, as well as cabinets and a metal locker.\u201cIt just keeps going and going and going,\u201d Mr. Hankerson, 45, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to pick weeds on a 70-acre farm.\u201dBut Mr. Hankerson wants to know why Alibaba doesn\u2019t do more to defeat counterfeiting, which damages the very same small businesses Mr. Ma says he intends to aid.Mr. Ma \u201cis making himself look like someone you can trust,\u201d Mr. Hankerson said. But, he added, his company is selling counterfeit products.That leaves many businesses, big and small, wondering why it has such a hard time finding fakes on its sites. Its online system for reporting counterfeits, many say, is cumbersome and prone to hiccups. Against one of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms, Mr. Hankerson employs his iMac, $74-a-month image-searching software, his phone and a lot of time \u2014 sometimes, he says, 12 hours a day.Yet if he doesn\u2019t invest the effort, he worries that a flood of cut-rate replicas could undermine the future of his business. Shops on Alibaba \u2014 shops that sometimes sell outside China \u2014 offer their copies at a fraction of Mr. Hankerson\u2019s prices. One Taobao store sold a version of his A-frame table, with a starting price of $5,295, for $24.\u201cIf this gets out of hand, people are going to be able to buy our stuff for next to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be devastating for us.\u201dAlibaba has long faced accusations that its sales platforms are a haven for fakes, and big organizations have been effective at bringing the problem to the fore.In a report submitted to the U.S.T.R. in October, Alibaba boasted about the technology and resources it uses to clean counterfeits from its platforms. The company says its systems are powerful enough to scan 10 million product listings each day. As a result, Alibaba said, it proactively removed 380 million suspect product listings in one 12-month period.\u201cThere are few companies (indeed, none, to our knowledge) that have taken the combination of steps Alibaba has taken, and has concrete plans to take, and certainly none that have put in place measures on the scale of Alibaba\u2019s,\u201d the company told the U.S.T.R.Alibaba also argues that many of the complaints against it are unfair. Counterfeiting and piracy are widespread in the Chinese economy. As private businesspeople, Mr. Ma and his team cannot shut down the culprits producing fake goods.Additionally, Alibaba suggests that it has been made into a scapegoat. In a statement in December, the company protested that the U.S.T.R. decision \u201cleads us to question whether the U.S.T.R. acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate\u201d \u2014 presumably referring to heightened anti-China sentiment amid last year\u2019s United States presidential election.The U.S.T.R. and industry experts contend that there is a lot more Alibaba could and should be doing to tackle fakes.\u201cThey are a leading technology company,\u201d said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, which represents many brands hurt by counterfeiting. \u201cIt is our hope that they use this technology to develop solutions and make sure those solutions are available for everybody.\u201dFor small enterprises, fighting fakes on Alibaba\u2019s sites \u201ccan become expensive, it can become frustrating, it can take time away from your sales, marketing and other creative endeavors,\u201d Mr. Lamar said.An Alibaba spokesman said that suggestions that small businesses do not get its attention are \u201cfalse\u201d and that they can qualify for the streamlined process if their submissions prove reliable. He added that its process for removing suspect listings is in place to address the large number of fraudulent claims the firm receives.\u201cThere are places that our systems can be improved to make them more effective, efficient and user-friendly,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are working hard every day to make these improvements a reality.\u201dMichelle Stennett, 38, a jewelry maker in Suwanee, Ga., found out counterfeiters had stolen her designs during a trip to Yiwu in eastern China in 2012 to buy supplies. Upon returning home, Ms. Stennett scoured Alibaba.com \u2014 an Alibaba platform that sells around the world \u2014 and discovered shop after shop selling copies of her wares.She first tried contacting the stores directly, ordering them to take down the offending goods. Some complied, but others didn\u2019t. Next she filed a couple of complaints to Alibaba, asking the firm to remove the copies. Although those were successful, she quickly realized that the scale of the problem and the paperwork Alibaba required were too much for her to handle as a one-person business.\u201cThere was no way I could go through the process,\u201d she said. There were \u201ctoo many.\u201dDespondent, Ms. Stennett said she stopped making jewelry for nearly a year. \u201cIf someone is going to take my design and mass-produce it, it is hard for me to compete with them,\u201d she said. When she resumed, in 2013, she decided to source her components only from American suppliers, hoping to make it harder for counterfeiters to replicate her products.Now Ms. Stennett rarely checks Alibaba, afraid of what she\u2019ll find. After a quick search of Alibaba.com one day in March, she spotted an image of one of her pendants, which she reported to Alibaba. It is no longer on the platform, but she said she still does not have time to hunt for fakes.\u201cYou\u2019re losing out on money,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause time is money.\u201dAlibaba did not respond to a request for comment on Ms. Stennett\u2019s predicament.Last year, a friend told her that she had found her designs being sold by a store in Australia. Confused, Ms. Long contacted the proprietor, who informed her she had purchased the clothing on Alibaba.com and had no idea the designs were originally from Reignland. Ms. Long looked at the Alibaba shop and was shocked to find a picture of her own son, one of the models in her promotional material, being used to peddle fakes of her clothing.Ms. Long did not know she could ask Alibaba for assistance in removing these counterfeits. Instead, she contacted several shops, which, in some cases, have cooperated and removed the offending products. But Ms. Long blames the spread of copies from Alibaba for the sudden decline in sales of one of her best-selling products, a pair of children\u2019s pants.A few months ago, she had been selling about 30 a week, she said. Now, she moves only five a month.Mr. Hankerson had worked at his father\u2019s financial firm and in I.T. services, building websites, before he began tinkering with furniture.He unexpectedly started Vintage in 2009, when his wife said she wanted a new patio table. Mr. Hankerson hammered one together and posted a picture on a website. He began making more tables and advertising them on the internet, too. \u201cI loved the experience so much that I just wanted to make a better table,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a mad artist.\u201dToday, the Vintage factory is abuzz with the sounds of welding, sawing and hammering. There is one nod to modern automation \u2014 a recently acquired computerized steel-cutting machine \u2014 but much of the manufacturing is done by specially trained employees with woodworking or metalworking skills.While his business was quickly growing, Mr. Hankerson had no idea counterfeiters were profiting off his work as well.He first learned he had a problem in 2014, when he spotted an advertisement on Facebook that included a photo of one of his A-frame tables. He contacted the seller, who said she had bought the merchandise from elsewhere. Intrigued and worried, Mr. Hankerson began searching for images of his designs using Google, and he discovered many of them around the web.\u201cYou would find one image, and you go and look at their catalog on Alibaba, and there\u2019s another and another and another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going down the rabbit hole.\u201dMany shops promote these fakes with pictures lifted from Mr. Hankerson\u2019s own website. One photo bouncing around Taobao features a Vintage console with framed snapshots of Mr. Hankerson and his family still hanging on the wall above it.Some Taobao sellers admit they get their designs from Mr. Hankerson. Liao Xiaoting, a customer service provider at Shang Jie Crafts Company, said her firm\u2019s designers use them as \u201creference\u201d to make their own furniture, with changes, mainly to the materials.Huang Geqing, proprietor of a Taobao shop called Creative Iron Factory, said that he copies Vintage\u2019s designs, manufactures replicas in Fujian province in eastern China, and uses Mr. Hankerson\u2019s photos to promote his own products. He first found Vintage\u2019s designs marketed on other Taobao stores, then traced them back to the original source.Mr. Huang estimates 100 shops may be selling fakes of Mr. Hankerson\u2019s furniture. The style \u201cis quite popular in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can make something exactly like it.\u201dMr. Hankerson said he had no idea how many of these fakes can be found outside of China. Though some of these likely counterfeits have been on Taobao, which has primarily Chinese users, he has also spotted them on the globally focused Alibaba.com.One furniture maker in India, Raja Rani Art Handicrafts, said two pieces of furniture it sells on Alibaba.com are based on Mr. Hankerson\u2019s designs. \u201cThis design is from Vintage Industrial, but we also manufacture the same design in our company,\u201d said Bobby Shukhla, who answered queries from The New York Times.Mr. Hankerson tried contacting sellers directly, asking them to take down his images. Most of them complied. He was also encouraged when Alibaba staff members removed all of the photos he targeted on Alibaba.com through its infringement-fighting process.But then he ran into difficulties. Last year, the website through which he could send Alibaba requests to remove suspect listings stopped working. He tried submitting and resubmitting the required paperwork on the site, even on different computers, only to have it return error messages.An Alibaba spokesman, in written responses, said that in October the company started an improved online system through which companies and people can report possible infringement on any of its platforms. He said that Mr. Hankerson has not tried to use this new system. Mr. Hankerson said he had but could not get it to work.Mr. Hankerson decided to step up his efforts. In August, he sent emails to Alibaba\u2019s investor and public relations departments threatening to raise a public ruckus about fakes on its sites.A manager at Alibaba\u2019s intellectual property protection department reached out. Mr. Hankerson handed over lists of more than 400 suspect images, only some of which were removed. Many of them, Mr. Hankerson was informed, were on a different Alibaba system and had to be removed through a separate process, which has not yet been undertaken.He argued that he shouldn\u2019t have to go to such lengths to get Alibaba to act. Once Alibaba has been made aware of his company\u2019s intellectual property, he said, the firm should proactively prevent additional postings of his photos or clean any suspect products from its platforms. Yet despite Alibaba\u2019s boast to the U.S.T.R., combing the millions of listings could be difficult or expensive.\u201cIt should be click and forget,\u201d he said. \u201cOur products should never be on their site.\u201dAn Alibaba spokesman said the company had tried to work with Mr. Hankerson to remove his images and resolve his technical problems. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the primary responsibility of protecting a brand rests with the brand itself,\u201d the spokesman wrote in an email.Additionally, Alibaba disputes the idea that it tolerates fakes. Intellectual property infringement \u201churts Alibaba\u2019s business and reputation,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether the infringement is against big brands or small companies.\u201dMr. Hankerson remains unmollified. He is talking to lawyers about his options and is trying to rally other small-business owners to the cause.\u201cThey want to have all those counterfeits,\u201d he said, \u201cand they want to make money off of it.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about American small businesses\u2019 fighting counterfeits on Alibaba\u2019s sales platforms misstated the Chinese company\u2019s relationship with a popular online payment system in China. The system, Alipay, is owned by a company controlled by Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman, not by Alibaba itself.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unraveling the Mystery of Who Lies Beneath the Cloth", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byMummy No. 30007, currently residing at the American Museum of Natural History, is a showstopper. She\u2019s known as the Gilded Lady, for good reason: Her coffin, intricately decorated with linen, a golden headdress and facial features, has an air of divinity. She\u2019s so well preserved that she looks exactly how the people of her time hoped she would appear for eternity. To contemporary scientists, however, it\u2019s what they don\u2019t see that is equally fascinating: Who was this ancient woman, and what did she look like when she was alive?With its somber lighting and music, the exhibition almost commands reverence; we are in the company of the dead, after all. But the show also includes virtual mummies that viewers can unwrap at interactive tables. The easy-to-navigate space reveals rare artifacts and three-dimensional imaging of what lies beneath the cloth. The hero of modern mummy investigations, the CT scanner, is prominently displayed at the start of the exhibition. It gives archaeologists an inside look at the millenniums-old specimens without damaging them. A century ago, scientists would unwrap their finds, often harming them in the process \u2014 one of the real mummies in the show was decapitated when archaeologists removed its face covering.The Gilded Lady, though, was never unwrapped. Archaeologists used CT scanning to create a 3-D print of her skull, which helped a forensic artist reconstruct her facial features. They even determined her potential cause of death \u2014 tuberculosis \u2014 about 2,000 years ago. Dating to Roman-era Egypt, she was probably in her 40s when she succumbed, had curly hair and an overbite.But way before visitors meet the Gilded Lady, they are taken to Peru, where about 7,000 years ago the Chinchorro people became the first known civilization to practice mummification, thousands of years before the Egyptians. They used stone knives to cut flesh from the bones of the dead. Then the preparers would dry or smoke the flesh, clean the bones and reinforce the skeleton using reeds and clay. Then they would reattach the skin to the body and paint it black or red. One of the final steps was to adorn their mummies with a clay mask, modeled from the person\u2019s face, and add a wig. Few of these fragile masks have survived, but a replica is on display encased in glass.Dozens of other societies in the region of what is now Peru also mummified their dead. It was a way to preserve family members and establish a dynasty. They would pack them into bundles of cloth or wool, shaped like a sitting person. Sometimes ceramics or personal items would be put in the bundles. The Chancay culture in Peru placed the bundles upright in pits, and retrieved them during festivals, or when they wanted to show off their ancestors. Mummification was a way to keep family members close, unlike the ancient Egyptians, who sought to set up the dead for an afterlife with the gods. A full-size diorama shows what a pit looked like.This section also displays several skulls that were manipulated to have bumps or appear oblong. Archaeologists think that some Peruvian cultures practiced cranial shaping on the developing skulls of newborns.(The exhibit was organized by David Hurst Thomas, curator of North American archaeology, and John J. Flynn, a curator of fossil mammals, both at the American Museum of Natural History.)In the Egypt section are the more familiar types of mummies. Egyptians began mummifying their dead around 3,500 B.C., preparing them much more extravagantly than the Peruvians did and using an early form of embalming.To prepare a body, the Egyptians made an incision in the abdomen and removed the intestines, kidneys and lungs, usually leaving the heart in place. They used hooked instruments to extract the brain through the nostrils. It was tossed. Ancient Egyptians placed little value on the brain, believing thoughts came from the heart, according to archaeologists. The organs were preserved and stored in jars, which would be placed in the mummy\u2019s tomb. The bodies were cleaned and soaked in a solution, and then left to dry for five or six weeks. After a mummy was dried, oils were rubbed on its skin, sometimes for days. Then, the body was wrapped, from each individual toe up to the head.The first Egyptian station features four canopic jars, which safeguarded the organs of the deceased. They are adorned with the faces of a jackal, a baboon, a human and a hawk, which represent different Egyptian gods Huddled in a fetal position nearby is the exhibition\u2019s oldest mummy, at between 5,000 and 6,000 years old and found in Egypt. Her dried feet and skull emerge from what appears to be a straw or cloth covering. This woman was preserved not by embalmers, like the Gilded Lady, but by natural causes \u2014 a reminder that some mummies are accidents.The diversity of coffins in the Egyptian section reflects wealth disparity. Not everyone was a mighty pharaoh or prosperous merchant able to afford a fancy sarcophagus made of stone or a coffin made of imported wood that was painted with elaborate designs of Osiris, god of the underworld, and stored in a grandiose tomb. There are also coffins in the familiar curvy Egyptian shape made of cheap wood for those seeking an economy-class ride to the afterlife. Many of the extravagant sarcophagi are damaged, victims of looting.What the mummies from Peru and Egypt have in common is the care that went into their preparation, and their placement in cloth bundles or elaborate sarcophagi, to be put on display for life after death, whether that meant for family members or for the gods. In witnessing them now, viewers become part of that afterlife.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s election. Turnout was the highest in decades.\u2022 The far-right populist party of Geert Wilders gained seats, but did not perform as strongly as expected. Exit polls suggested that it was tied for second place with the conservative party Christian Democratic Appeal and the center-left pro-European party Democrats 66 \u2014 each with 19 seats. Also making a relatively strong showing were the left-leaning Greens, with 16 seats. The leftist, euroskeptic Socialist Party is projected to have 14 seats.\u2022 The big loser appeared to be the mainstream Labor party, which had governed with the mainstream conservatives led by Mr. Rutte. The exit poll put it in seventh place, with nine seats.\u2022 Turnout was 82 percent, the highest in decades.\u2022 All 150 seats in the lower (and more powerful) house of Parliament are up for grabs. It takes a simple majority, 76 seats, to govern. Coalitions are the norm. The landscape is highly fragmented, with 11 parties represented in the current Parliament and 13 parties expected to be in the next one.\u201cDemocracy is definitely alive,\u201d said Mark Bovens, a political scientist at Utrecht University, noting the high turnout. \u201cThe nationalist parties have won seats, compared to 2012 \u2014 Wilders\u2019s party has gained seats, as has a new party, the Forum for Democracy \u2014 but their electorate is stable; it has not grown. And some of the traditional parties have moved in a more nationalistic direction, taking a bit of wind out of his sails. You see the same strategy in Germany.\u201dIn a victory speech broadcast live on television, Mr. Rutte said, \u201cThe Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said no to the wrong kind of populism.\u201dHis nemesis, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, called the result in the Netherlands a \u201cvote for Europe, a vote against extremists.\u201dAt the Christian Democratic Appeal\u2019s party, which was held in a tram museum, the crowd cheered the party\u2019s projected second-place finish (in a three-way tie).\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m just happy that the P.V.V. is not as big as we feared,\u201d said Robbert-Jan van Duyn, a 29-year-old alderman from the city of Almere, referring to Mr. Wilders\u2019s party, the Party for Freedom.Guests in the refurbished red-brick depot credited the party\u2019s apparent success to its charismatic leader, Sybrand Buma, and the fact that the party was not part of government during the last four years, when painful cuts were introduced by the coalition of Mr. Rutte\u2019s party and the Labor Party.It is hard to imagine a place where it is easier to vote than in the Netherlands. If you\u2019re a commuter going to work in one of the larger Dutch cities, chances are there will be a voting tent set up in the train station where you board and where you get off.If you were taking high tea at the Hotel Des Indes in The Hague, there was a voting booth one flight up from the wood-paneled lobby.Shopping at a grocery store or going to a bar? Some have tables with makeshift voting booths.Playing football or working out? You can vote at sports complexes. You can also vote in community centers, mosques and churches, libraries, homes for the aged and concert halls.Voters don\u2019t have to live where they vote, so those vacationing on islands in the North Sea can walk into local polling places and cast their ballots. In the village of Schiermonnikoog on the island of the same name, 105 percent of the population had already voted as of 5 p.m. The extras were visitors to the island.In this country with 12.9 million eligible voters, there are 9,000 polling places, so the lines are relatively short and all voters need to show is their registration card anywhere in the municipality where they live. (Those voting outside their municipality need a special pass.)Most polling sites are open from 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., but one \u2014 a flower kiosk in the train station at Castricum, in the north \u2014 got a head start. It opened just after the stroke of midnight, and by 1 a.m., 97 people had cast ballots there.\u2014 ALISSA J. RUBIN and CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE As of 9 p.m., 82 percent of the electorate had voted, up from 75 percent in the 2012 parliamentary elections.Some polling stations were running out of ballot papers, according to the national broadcaster NOS.\u201cIt\u2019s already a record,\u201d Jan den Boer, 60, the administrator of a community center in The Hague that adjoins the city\u2019s largest supermarket, Albert Heijn, said in the afternoon.As he munched on a meat sandwich known as a broodje bal, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve already had 900 people vote, maybe more; people are coming in all day. Usually it\u2019s just the morning and evening after work.\u201d\u201cThey always say it\u2019s important to vote, and this year there\u2019s more of a difference between parties.\u201dAt a voting station the southern town of Sittard, a veteran election monitor who was distributing ballots said: \u201cI have never seen anything quite like this. Today people started early and they\u2019re still coming. It\u2019s been nonstop.\u201d\u2014 ALISSA J. RUBIN and MARLISE SIMONS Brendan Groeneveld, 30, who works in tech support in the city of Almere, east of Amsterdam, said he was supporting Mr. Wilders\u2019s Party for Freedom primarily because of his hobby: Airsoft, a gladiator-like pastime similar to paintball, but that uses toys nearly indistinguishable from real firearms, he said.\u201cIt is legal, but uncertainties in Dutch law are giving the players a lot of headaches, in regards to some peripheral items,\u201d he said. The Party for Freedom supports expanding the legal use of firearms, he said, \u201cand they\u2019ll at least give more transparency and clarity in regards to what\u2019s allowed and what\u2019s not.\u201d (Mr. Groeneveld added that he would also like to be able to have real firearms for hunting.)Mr. Groeneveld said that his mother was Canadian and his wife was American, but expressed worries about Islam. \u201cA lot of Dutch culture is giving way to other cultures, and Islam is the most in-your-face, an obnoxious one,\u201d he said.On the other end of the spectrum from Mr. Wilders is a new figure: Jesse Klaver, 30, the leader of the Greens. The party holds just four seats in Parliament but seems poised to make big gains.Younger, more energetic and more openly urban and cosmopolitan than many of his rivals, Mr. Klaver has made an unabashed appeal to voters in larger cities and their suburbs, emphasizing the country\u2019s international image as a place that welcomes refugees, protects the environment and has a dynamic postindustrial economy.The son of a Moroccan father (whom Mr. Klaver says he did not know) and an Indonesian-Dutch mother, Mr. Klaver was raised as a Catholic \u2014 a minority in this largely secular nation \u2014 and started his career with the National Coalition of Christian Trade Unions.With looks that remind many people of a younger Justin Trudeau and an American style of campaigning that included a big final rally that was styled as a \u201cmeet-up\u201d with drinks, he is a charismatic newcomer.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Henk Janssen, a hotel manager in Valkenburg, in the south of the country, said he was voting for the party of Mr. Rutte, the prime minister.\u201cI vote for stability, for the people in government now,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf the world seems to be on fire. People are undermining each other, insulting, lying, creating conflict. Not only in our country but around the world.\u201dHe said he believed that a voter uprising or even a violent confrontation over immigration was possible, because \u201cthe mood is harsher everywhere. People are becoming more extreme, more willing to fight when they disagree.\u201dWith the elections over, he hopes a new government \u201ccan calm things down. The political climate right now is unhealthy.\u201d He noted the threat of Islamist extremism and tensions with Russia and Turkey.When Mr. Wilders briefly campaigned in the town of Valkenburg, \u201cit was really abnormal, police everywhere, a helicopter flying circles over the center,\u201d said Anna van Meersen, a shop attendant in the town. \u201cHow could a man like that govern us?\u201dBrit Maanen, 20, a receptionist at a wellness center in Heerlen, said she and her friends were not voting. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand enough of what goes on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear a lot of talk among politicians, but we don't hear much difference. We see a lot of people who want some power, or a lot of power.\u201dMs. Maanen said she had grown up in a multicultural society where she was used to seeing immigrants. In her hometown, Heerlen, she said she was pleased to see \u201cfewer women who are totally veiled.\u201d\u201cMany wear headscarves. But not many are now covering up their faces. I feel better about that, not so uneasy.\u201dWhat does she want from the new government? \u201cIn this country we have freedom of religion, freedom of expression. We want to keep it that way.\u201d\u2014 MARLISE SIMONSPaul van\u2019t Veer, 44, a D.J. and music programmer who also works in a record store, grew up attending antinuclear rallies in the city of Zwolle in the central-eastern Netherlands.On Wednesday, he planned to vote for the Party for the Animals. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the only parties that really cares about how the world will be in 15 or 20 years,\u201d he said at a cafe in Zwolle. \u201cThe environment is one of the main issues that hasn\u2019t been talked about much before these elections. It\u2019s a bigger fear for me than terrorism is.\u201dBut Mr. Veer\u2019s father has moved in a different direction. He plans to vote for Mr. Wilders\u2019s Party for Freedom.\u201cI\u2019m very sad about that,\u201d the son said. \u201cNowadays I\u2019m kind of ashamed of Holland because there seems to be far more hate and racism and intolerance than ever came to the surface before.\u201dOther voters in Zwolle said they hoped to stem the populist tide.Iris Groenendyk, 27, a child protection worker, said she had voted for the centrist party Democrats 66, based on its positions on education and health care. \u201cI\u2019m a bit scared, because of the fact that there are a lot of people who are interested by Wilders\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d she said.Theo van Uden, 66, a human resources manager at a provincial Dutch court, said he was voting for the opposition Socialist Party, because income inequality was his main concern.After nearly three decades of using voting machines, the Dutch reverted in 2009 to paper ballots marked with red pencils. For this election, the government has tightened security further, after reports that Russian-associated hackers were trying to gain access to government computers late last year.In what the Dutch are calling the \u201cfour-eyes principle,\u201d each vote will be counted and verified by two people at the polling station. Tallies will then be recorded by hand and initially sent by text message to the municipality. The ballots and tally sheets will then be physically delivered to municipal voting centers so that the counts can be double-checked and verified.There are 12.9 million eligible voters, out of a population of 17 million. Women have had the vote since 1922. The minimum age is 18; about 850,000 citizens will be old enough to vote for the first time.Voting is by proportional representation. Voters choose one party\u2019s list \u2014 there are 28 parties competing \u2014 and candidates from the list make it into Parliament based on their party\u2019s share of the total vote.There is no minimum threshold in the Netherlands. A party that gets 1/150th of the votes cast is guaranteed one of the 150 seats.In the picturesque heart of Mr. Wilders\u2019s hometown, Venlo, just across the border from northwest Germany, there did not appear to be a strong swell of support for him.\u201cI share some opinions with him, but he shouldn\u2019t be so radical,\u201d said Paula Vanhegen, 64. \u201cOtherwise we get a second Hitler and we don\u2019t want that.\u201dMany younger and middle-aged residents seemed convinced that Mr. Wilders\u2019s party wouldn\u2019t even make it into second place. Stan Koolen, 19, an agribusiness student, said he was convinced Mr. Rutte\u2019s party would win.For three working mothers sipping coffee in the old town square, TV and social media played a big part in helping them decide.\u201cLife in the Netherlands is good,\u201d said one of them, Miriam Swaghoven, 43, adding that Mr. Rutte had represented the country well for eight years.Mr. Wilders is unique in that he has taken advantage of a loophole that allows him to lead a party with seats in Parliament even though, as a technical and legal matter, his \u201cparty\u201d is an association, and is not covered by some of the Dutch and European Union law that pertains to political parties.For legal purposes, Mr. Wilders is the sole member of his Party for Freedom. Everyone else is part of the party\u2019s association \u2014 the Dutch word \u201cvereniging\u201d \u2014 and they are not required to pay dues.There is no requirement in the Netherlands that candidates on the party lists for which citizens cast votes need to be party members. But every other party in the Dutch Parliament is organized along traditional lines, with members paying dues.By having an association rather than a party, experts say, Mr. Wilders retains control over the party\u2019s platforms and is able to keep much of his financing secret, because under Dutch law, the head of the party must report all income and expenditures to party members, and he is the only one. (Only larger sums \u2014 expenditures over 4,500 euros, or about $4,780, and debts over 25,000 euros, or about $26,500 \u2014 need to be disclosed to the government.)An earlier version of this article included an outdated account of the process for asking the leader of the largest party in Parliament to try to form a governing coalition. Parliament invites the leader to do so, not the monarch.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the hobby that Geert Wilders engages in. It is Airsoft, not Airsport.Reporting was contributed by Alissa J. Rubin, Milan Schreuer and Christopher F.

{"Headline": "Drought and War Heighten Threat of Not Just 1 Famine, but 4", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byBAIDOA, Somalia \u2014 First the trees dried up and cracked apart.Then the goats keeled over.Then the water in the village well began to disappear, turning cloudy, then red, then slime-green, but the villagers kept drinking it. That was all they had.Now on a hot, flat, stony plateau outside Baidoa, thousands of people pack into destitute camps, many clutching their stomachs, some defecating in the open, others already dead from a cholera epidemic.\u201cEven if you can get food, there is no water,\u201d said one mother, Sangabo Moalin, who held her head with a left hand as thin as a leaf and spoke of her body \u201cburning.\u201dInternational aid officials say they are facing one of the biggest humanitarian disasters since World War II. And they are determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past.Once again, a lack of clean water and proper hygiene is setting off an outbreak of killer diseases in displaced persons camps. So the race is on to dig more latrines, get swimming-pool quantities of clean water into the camps, and pass out more soap, more water-treatment tablets and more plastic buckets \u2014 decidedly low-tech supplies that could save many lives.\u201cWe underestimated the role of water and its contribution to mortality in the last famine,\u201d said Ann Thomas, a water, sanitation and hygiene specialist for Unicef. \u201cIt gets overshadowed by the food.\u201dThe famines are coming as a drought sweeps across Africa and several different wars seal off extremely needy areas. United Nations officials say they need a huge infusion of cash to respond. So far, they are not just millions of dollars short, but billions.At the same time, President Trump is urging Congress to cut foreign aid and assistance to the United Nations, which aid officials fear could multiply the deaths. The United States traditionally provides more disaster relief than anyone else.\u201cThe international humanitarian system is at its breaking point,\u201d said Dominic MacSorley, chief executive of Concern Worldwide, a large private aid group.Aid officials say all the needed food and water exist on this planet in abundance \u2014 even within these hard-hit countries. But armed conflict that is often created by personal rivalries between a few men turns life upside down for millions, destroying markets and making the price of necessities go berserk.In some areas of central Somalia, a 20-liter jerry can of water, about five and a quarter gallons, used to cost 4 cents. In recent weeks, that price has shot up to 42 cents. That may not sound like a lot. But when you make less than a dollar a day and your flock of animals \u2014 your family\u2019s pride and wealth \u2014 has been reduced to a stack of bleached bones and your farm to dust, you may not have 42 cents.\u201cThere is no such thing as free water,\u201d said Isaac Nur Abdi, a nomad, who sat in the dusky gloom of a cholera treatment center in Baidoa this month. He fanned his elderly mother, whose cavernous eye sockets and protruding cheekbones bore the telltale signature of famine.Scenes like this are unfolding across the region. In Yemen, relentless aerial bombings by Saudi Arabia and a trade blockade have mutilated the economy, sending food prices spiraling and pushing hundreds of thousands of children to the brink of starvation.In South Sudan, both rebel forces and government soldiers are intentionally blocking emergency food and hijacking food trucks, aid officials say. On Saturday, six aid workers were killed, complicating relief efforts even further. Entire communities are marooned in malarial swamps trying to survive off barely chewable lotus plants and worm-infested swamp water.South Sudan and Somalia, for instance, have relatively few vehicles and almost no industry. But their fields are drying up and their pastureland is vanishing, scientists say, partly because of the global effects of pollution. People in these countries suffer from other people\u2019s driving, other people\u2019s manufacturing and other people\u2019s attachment to things like flat-screen TVs and iPads that most Somalis and South Sudanese will touch only in their dreams.It\u2019s not simple to get food and clean water into these areas where everything is dried out, yellow and dead.Baidoa itself is controlled by Somalia\u2019s fledging government and African Union troops. But just a few miles outside the town, it is Shabab country, belonging to the Shabab militant Islamist group that has banned Western aid agencies.\u201dThe fact that people are dying near Baidoa and we can\u2019t get there, it makes me crazy,\u201d said Patrick Laurent, a water and sanitation coordinator hired by Unicef in Somalia.Aid officials defined resilience as the ability to adapt to sudden environmental or political shocks. Resilience programs included livestock insurance and better water management, especially in Africa.Some aid officials never liked this term, saying it seemed patronizing, as if Africans were built to suffer. Still, the resilience subindustry roared on.But just as many of the new resilience programs were being funded, these latest crises hit, one after the other.\u201cThe environment didn\u2019t give time for these resilience efforts to bear fruit,\u201d Mr. Laurent said.Ms. Thomas, the Unicef water and hygiene specialist, said that during Somalia\u2019s last famine, the deadliest areas were not the empty deserts where there was little food but the displaced-persons camps near urban areas where, comparatively speaking, there was plenty of food.The reason was that the crowded camps became hotbeds of communicable diseases like cholera, a bacterial infection that can lead to very painful intestinal cramps, diarrhea and fatal dehydration. Cholera is often caused by dirty water and spread by exposure to contaminated feces through fingers, food and flies.Malnutrition certainly played its part; famine victims, especially children, were compromised by a lack of nutrients. They arrived in the camps from wasted areas of the interior with their immune systems already shot.But in the end it was poor hygiene and dirty water, Ms. Thomas said, that tugged many down.If rivers and other relatively clean water sources start drying up, as they are right now in Somalia, this sets off an interlocking cycle of death. People start to get sick at their stomachs from the slimy or cloudy water they are forced to drink. They start fleeing their villages, hoping to get help in the towns.Camps form. But the camps do not have enough water either, and it is hard to find a latrine or enough water for people to wash their hands. Shockingly fast, the camps become disease factories.Water, of course, is less negotiable than food. A human being can survive weeks with nothing to eat. Five days without water means death.Different strategies are being emphasized this time around to parry the famine. One is simply giving out cash.United Nations agencies and private aid groups in Somalia are scaling up efforts to dole out money through a new electronic card system and by mobile phone.This allows poor people to get a monthly allowance and shop for staples like fresh vegetables, powdered milk, pasta, dates, sugar, salt and camel meat.Cash payments are often better for the local economy than importing sacks of food, and the people get help fast.At the cholera treatment center in Baidoa, which logged in more than 30 cases on a recent day, many people had little inkling of what caused cholera.When Mr. Abdi, whose mother was nearly dead from the disease, was asked what had made his mother sick, he said the cause was simple.It was the hot season.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Immigration System, Lauded by Trump, Is More Complex Than Advertised", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 Canada\u2019s merit-based immigration system received a loving mention by President Trump this week in his speech to Congress. Mr. Trump, who has railed against illegal immigration and talked tough about tightening borders, said adopting that kind of system would cost American taxpayers less and help increase wages for poor workers.But in Canada, immigration is not just about selecting newcomers based on their skills. It is part of a system that promotes both the economy and the country\u2019s multicultural society, which has arguably become as much a part of Canadian identity as hockey. And it is largely seen as a way to increase immigration, not reduce it.\u201cCanadians are more likely than citizens of any other industrial country to think immigration is essential to the economy and the future of the country,\u201d said Jeffrey Reitz, a professor of ethnic and immigration studies at the University of Toronto.Part of that enthusiasm is the country\u2019s recognition that, with an aging population, immigration is essential to economic growth. Add to that Canada\u2019s geography \u2014 a long border with the prosperous United States to the south and the Arctic to the north \u2014 and illegal immigration is less of an issue.And finally, Canadians have a wholehearted belief in the merit-based immigration system, which creates a positive feedback loop.\u201cThe advantage of our system is the people who come in \u2014 everyone agrees they\u2019ve passed some sort of merit system,\u201d said Ravi Pendakur, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa. \u201cThe Canadian population in particular is more willing to buy into immigration. They can see it\u2019s managed, and that\u2019s an advantage.\u201dThe program does have its drawbacks. It has become enormously complex, ever-morphing and a source of huge backlogs.Created in 1967, the merit-based system was seen as a way to select immigrants based on their \u201chuman capital\u201d and not simply their country of origin, as had been the tradition. The idea was to bring in immigrants, regardless of where they were born, with vetted qualities that would make them the most successful at integrating into the Canadian economy.Candidates received points for their level of education, ability to speak one or both of the country\u2019s official languages, work experience, age, a job offer and what immigration officials called adaptability, which meant they came with family or had family here.Two years ago, the country revamped the entire system, increasing the possible points to 1,200 and valuing a job offer at 600.Other applications were put in a job bank for employers to select. Successful applicants were promised a six-month approval, but unsuccessful ones had to reapply.Add separate point systems drafted by the country\u2019s provinces and territories based on their job markets, and the system grows even more head-scratching. Saskatchewan, for instance, is recruiting long-haul truck drivers and hospitality workers, while Alberta wants food and beverage processors.\u201cI teach this stuff and I find it confusing,\u201d said Prof. Audrey Macklin, director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Center for Criminology and Sociolegal Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently confusing, plus it keeps changing.\u201dStill, the principle remains: The immigrants coming in under this system are well educated, literate in the local language and have great credentials.\u201cIf America changes toward our system, the Apples and Microsofts and Googles will be very happy,\u201d said Robert Vineberg, a retired regional director general of immigration. \u201cBut the vegetable growers in California will not be so happy.\u201dMr. Vineberg offered government immigration statistics from 2015 as an example. That year, Canada identified 66,360 newcomers as economic immigrants for their occupational skills.Around 36,300 were categorized in the top two classes, meaning they were fluent in one national language and had a college degree. Most would have been recruited for a specific job, Mr. Vineberg said: for instance, vice president of a company or administrator of a hospital. Another 22,700 were picked for a job in skilled trades, like an industrial electrician. They needed the language skills to read a blueprint and follow complicated directions, and at least some postsecondary training and certification in their trade.Only 2,177 were brought in as laborers, and even they would have been chosen for specific positions, most likely in a hard-to-fill job or a remote location \u2014 for instance, a Japanese-speaking hotel receptionist in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Mr. Vineberg said.His example, however, illuminates the contradiction at the center of the immigration system.In 2015, almost 272,000 people were granted entry, and only a quarter were picked for their merit. Most of those counted in the economic class were family members, chosen not for their human capital \u2014 although many might also be educated and intend to work \u2014 but their blood ties.\u201cThe statistics convey the impression that Canada chooses most people based on economic criteria, and perhaps policy makers think this reassures Canadians that immigration serves Canada\u2019s economic interests,\u201d Professor Macklin said. \u201cIn reality, most people still enter on the basis of kinship. The idea that this can be easily or significantly altered is a bit of a fantasy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to be relaxed about immigration when your only land border is a huge wall with the United States,\u201d Professor Reitz said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For 3 Indiana Brothers, \u2018America First\u2019 Cuts 2 Ways", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byEVANSVILLE, Ind. \u2014 When Alcoa abruptly announced last year that its aluminum smelter near here would close, some longtime workers talked of burning the place down.One of those laid off, Brandon Marshall, 39, said he had never given much thought to where the products he bought were made. But now he goes out of his way to support American jobs.\u201cIf there\u2019s a tape measure built in the U.S. for $15 and one from China for $6, I try to catch myself now and pay for the American one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hit home.\u201dThe blow to America\u2019s industrial work force from globalization, and the sometimes xenophobia-tinged anger over trade deals that fueled a political upheaval last year, are not hard to find in southwest Indiana.Should Mr. Trump impose steep import taxes on goods from Mexico and China, economists say it could drive other nations to raise taxes on American exports \u2014 at a cost in American jobs.\u201cIf he wants to start a trade war, there\u2019ll be a negative impact on Indiana,\u201d said Sudesh Mujumdar, chair of the economics and marketing department at the University of Southern Indiana. \u201cYou might think you\u2019re protecting a class of workers, and end up having an impact on others.\u201dThe complex filaments connecting average Americans to the forces of global trade can be seen in the lives of Mr. Marshall, laid off by Alcoa, and his two older brothers: Troy, 46, who works on the factory floor at Toyota in Princeton, Ind., where a map with pins in 20 countries depicts the reach of its exports; and Jeremy, 41, an elementary schoolteacher, who is struggling to maintain his perch in the middle class.Import tariffs that might have protected Brandon\u2019s smelting job could theoretically threaten Troy\u2019s job at Toyota, as well as raise the living costs for Jeremy, who finds that even as a member of the white-collar middle class, he needs a second job to make ends meet.\u201cI\u2019m a teacher, I\u2019ve got a budget,\u201d Jeremy said over dinner at Applebee\u2019s with Brandon, while Troy was working the night shift.Would Jeremy buy a $15 American tape measure \u2014 and would he see it as protecting his brothers\u2019 jobs?The Marshall brothers grew up 40 minutes north of Evansville in Oakland City, Ind., the sons of Les Marshall, a coal miner who worked underground for 27 years. He died of a massive heart attack at 62, barely a year after retirement.\u201cHe was pretty adamant about getting your education so you don\u2019t have to work these hard, dirty hours,\u201d Jeremy said.Brandon got a bachelor\u2019s degree, but hated his time working as a draftsman in an office. \u201cI gained weight; I\u2019d go home and be mentally stressed,\u201d he said. \u201cPhysical labor, you may hurt muscle-wise, but you\u2019re moving around. It\u2019s better for you.\u201dWhen he lost his $85,000 job at the Alcoa smelter, the best work he could find paid $45,000, soldering components at a company that makes broadcast antennas. His wife, Crystal, had to go back to work filing and painting nails to help with the family\u2019s expenses.He has taken the lifestyle adjustment in stride. \u201cI\u2019m not the person to sit back and have a pity party,\u201d he said.There are also some benefits. He has more time for his two young children: \u201cThey were big mommy\u2019s kids before,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that Dad is home more, they\u2019ll jump on the couch next to me to watch Dad\u2019s TV shows. If I did work 60 hours a week on night shift at Toyota, those moments wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201dAll three brothers voted for Mr. Trump, embracing his promises to build a wall with Mexico, run the nation as a business and rebuild American manufacturing.But a combination of higher costs to produce Highlanders and retaliatory tariffs that would slow exports could mean fewer workers in the Indiana factory. Troy Marshall, who is a 15-year Toyota employee, recognizes the risks of a protectionist trade policy.\u201cWorking in manufacturing in the U.S., I understand if people aren\u2019t buying your product then I don\u2019t have a job,\u201d he said.Nonetheless, he still favors taxing foreign-made goods. He said higher consumer prices would be acceptable if they protected America\u2019s industrial workers. Americans, he said, would learn to adjust their lifestyles.\u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s sort of a reset of the American economy,\u201d Mr. Marshall said. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. I don\u2019t think we need all the stuff we buy.\u201dHis attitude seems shaped by his confidence that his own job at Toyota, one of the region\u2019s best-paying blue-collar employers, would be secure even if the plant were to shed jobs. After several promotions, he is a supervisor of quality assurance, enjoying good wages, a 401(k) plan and other benefits.\u201cThat way of life has really evaporated,\u201d said Jonathan Weinzapfel, who was Evansville\u2019s mayor the year Whirlpool left, idling 1,100 workers.And blue-collar workers are not the only members of the middle class being squeezed. Jeremy Marshall, who has a master\u2019s degree and earns about $50,000 a year teaching at an elementary school, has long worked a second job \u2014 first mowing lawns, now as a home inspector.His workday is longer and more stressful than it used to be, he said. \u201cI go home, and I\u2019m mentally zapped. Everything\u2019s data-driven. It\u2019s always analyzing data, creating assessments to create more data.\u201dAt Applebee\u2019s, as the conversation circled around the complexities of trade, Brandon Marshall, once in favor of strict protectionism, seemed to shift his view. He considered how tariffs might strain Jeremy\u2019s budget and threaten Troy\u2019s job.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what would happen if we shut the borders off and had to start surviving on our own,\u201d Brandon said.\u201cThe thing about Trump, he never had to worry about a $15 tape measure compared to a $6 one,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s got good intentions. He wants to keep the jobs here. But if all those parts coming for Toyota cost more money to get here, is it going to turn jobs away in the long run?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Parrot", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byA parrot flies out the window in Soviet Russia. The owner rushes to the Moscow offices of the K.G.B., where he tells an agent: \u201cI just want to make clear that any views my parrot expresses are exclusively its own.\u201dWe are not yet worrying about what our parrots might blurt out in Donald Trump\u2019s America. But there are disturbing signs. This presidency is about the fear-driven closing of borders and minds.In his magisterial novel \u201cHumboldt\u2019s Gift,\u201d Saul Bellow quotes Samuel Daniel: \u201cWhile timorous knowledge stands considering, audacious ignorance hath done the deed.\u201dAudacious ignorance is hard at work in the White House. The only solace is that, with Trump, it\u2019s accompanied by paralyzing incompetence.That was three decades ago. Trump won\u2019t change. At 70 he\u2019s what he was at 40 in crankier and bulkier form. His political formula was already clear: mythical American humiliation calls for muscular American nationalism led by a macho American savior. It was not very original, but then forked human nature does not change.The few adults in his circle, already weary of putting out fires caused by foolishness, may be able to temper excesses here and there, but the president sets the course. Time to start thinking about what a post-American Europe and a post-American Asia will look like. One certainty: They will be less stable. Another: Russia and China will assert broader, more exclusive spheres of influence.Trump sees moral equivalency between the United States and a Russian regime that murders dissenting politicians in broad daylight, brutalizes its opponents, hacks into the American election, and traffics in the whopping lie. He is so beholden to, or seduced by, Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia that he will not murmur criticism. Enough said. This is a moral abdication of such proportions that America\u2019s alliances are left without ideological foundation.

Hope in a new era of normalized relations with the United States.What emerges most clearly from those interviewed is a desire to enjoy a more certain, and robust, economic future.In this, the Cuban people seem to be in agreement with their government. For the Cuban state, led by Ra\u00fal Castro, allowing entrepreneurs to open small businesses, normalizing relations with the United States and expanding tourism have been central to the country\u2019s hunt for economic growth.These three policies were among the most highly supported by the Cubans interviewed in the survey, done by the independent research group NORC at the University of Chicago. Eight of 10 Cubans interviewed felt tourism to the country should be increased, and 95 percent said having a high level of economic growth was an extremely or very important goal.And yet Cubans seemed to have little faith in their government\u2019s capacity to deliver on those goals. Only three in 10 felt the economy would improve in the next three years. And just 13 percent said the current economy was good or excellent. Three-quarters of Cubans believed they must be careful in saying what they think, at least sometimes.Over half of those Cubans interviewed said they would like to leave the country if given a chance, and 70 percent of those individuals said they would move to the United States if they could.The interviews were conducted in person in October and November, before the inauguration of President Trump, who has threatened to rescind President Obama\u2019s 2014 decision to restore diplomatic ties between the nations.While Mr. Trump has remained relatively quiet about Cuba since taking office, his administration announced it is conducting a full review of the policy and could decide to cut off ties again.But that would not be what Cubans themselves appear to want.Of those interviewed, 55 percent felt that better relations with the United States would be a good thing, while only 3 percent felt it would be mostly bad.Advertisement"}

Tom Perez, labor secretary in the Obama administration and now chairman of the Democratic National Committee, countered that Mr. Trump had \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to do with the job gains. \u201cTrump inherited an economy from Barack Obama with the longest streak of private sector job growth in history,\u201d he said.At the same time, jobless claims are near a 44-year low, and the stock market is surging. Revisions to previous estimates raised the three-month average of monthly job gains to 209,000 and annual wage growth to 2.8 percent, further bolstering the case for those who argue the economy is strong enough to withstand a rate increase.Also significant was the increase in the labor participation rate to 63 percent, a result of rising employment even among people without a high school diploma. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be some optimism that these people are feeling they finally have a chance,\u201d said Diane Swonk, founder and chief executive of DS economics in Chicago.On the other end are employers who are seeing acute labor shortages. \u201cThey\u2019re offering training programs now,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cThey\u2019re complaining about it. But that\u2019s what tight labor markets do. It forces you to invest more to work with less.\u201dBalancing those two goals is tricky.Lauren Griffin, senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA, said the scarcity of qualified workers had compelled employers to raise wages, strengthen benefits and improve amenities at the office. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people in orientation classes,\u201d Ms. Griffin said, \u201cand they get up and leave because they\u2019re contacted about another job that might be more money.\u201dAt the same time, a broader measure of unemployment \u2014 which includes the millions of Americans who have given up looking for work or who are working part time but would prefer full-time jobs \u2014 dropped to 9.2 percent last month but is still high given how tight the labor market looks otherwise.Many Americans who live outside urban centers also have been excluded from most of the rewards of the recovery.\u201cHigher-wage jobs might be following educated, young workers, who are increasingly living in dense, urban neighborhoods as other demographic groups move to the suburbs,\u201d said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, a job-search site. \u201cBroader economic shifts also favor big cities: The occupations projected to grow tend to be more urban, while shrinking sectors like manufacturing and farming tend to be located outside large metros.\u201dThat is disappointing for people with longstanding ties to smaller, more rural communities. \u201cA lot of this has to do with mobility,\u201d said Steven W. Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, an insurance company. \u201cPeople are going to have to move where the jobs are and not expect the jobs to come where they are.\u201dAlthough the Trump administration has had little time to make any substantial policy changes, the expectation of a reduction in taxes and regulations and the possibility of vast infrastructure spending have created optimism among employers and blue-collar workers.Mr. Trump has promised to expand the economy by 4 percent a year, create 25 million jobs in the next decade, revive manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit.Achieving all that would be difficult in the best of circumstances, let alone with the potential headwinds facing the White House. Dissension among Republicans and the unpredictability of Mr. Trump\u2019s course in several policy areas could dampen job growth.Certainly the snapshot of February\u2019s labor market is good. The question is, if the economy does slow, whether Mr. Trump will accept the legitimacy of weak reports as enthusiastically as he does good ones.Mr. Spicer suggested the president would. \u201cNumbers are going to go up and down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recognize that.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatCohenNYTAdvertisement"}

Out stepped a stream of people in business suits, according to a neighbor, all speaking Chinese.But while the buyer\u2019s identity remained unknown, a person with knowledge of the deal said that the new owner, who spent over $2 million for the childhood home of the current president of the United States, is a woman from China.\u201cWhy is there an influx of Chinese people interested in this house, of all people?\u201d the neighbor said she recalled wondering. \u201cWhat do they want?\u201dThe house on Wareham Place has become another curiosity in the vast orbit of properties connected to Mr. Trump, even though he last lived in the five-bedroom home, built by his father, Fred C. Trump, when he was 4. The house\u2019s intrigue lies not just in the price it fetched in an auction by Paramount Realty USA \u2014 $2.14 million, more than double the price of comparable houses in the area \u2014 but also in the mystery surrounding the buyer. She remains unknown, shrouded behind the limited liability company.A thin trail of documents associated with the sale led first to a second-story office on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, of Michael X. Tang, a lawyer who represents Trump Birth House. In the cramped and bustling office, which, according to its website, specializes in facilitating Chinese purchases of American real estate, a woman at a desk welcomed visitors.\u201cOh, about the Trump house,\u201d she said. She continued: Mr. Tang declined to comment.Documents show that Mr. Tang was also the lawyer for a seemingly unrelated transaction on a palatial home in Old Westbury, N.Y., which sold for more than $3.6 million in 2014 to a person named Jiying Wei. The redbrick mansion, tucked at the end of a cul-de-sac and abutted by a private tennis court, is a far cry from the modest butter-colored childhood home of Mr. Trump. But, according to a person with knowledge of the sale, the mansion\u2019s owner is a relative of the woman from China who bought the Trump family home.Standing in the collonaded entryway of her home a few doors down in Old Westbury, a neighbor, who declined to give her name for privacy reasons, deepened the mystery: The only person who lives in the mansion, she said, is the family\u2019s son, a local college student; the rest of the family lives in China.The trail dead-ended at the cul-de-sac: The house was empty and the owner could not be reached.\u201cI did have some expectation that the purchaser would be a huge Trump supporter from within America,\u201d Misha Haghani, principal of Paramount Realty USA, said of the Jamaica Estates home. He declined to reveal the identity of the buyer. \u201cBut it is entirely possible that the purchaser is a huge Trump supporter from outside of America,\u201d he said.Cathy Han, a real estate agent in New York who specializes in marketing high-end properties to Chinese buyers \u2014 including apartments in Trump-owned buildings \u2014 said she was not surprised that the home had been purchased by a Chinese buyer.\u201cWhen I saw it was Trump\u2019s birth house property for sale, I knew immediately it would get a lot of attention from Chinese buyers,\u201d Ms. Han said. \u201cI know he is a controversial figure in the States, but among Chinese people, Trump is a very popular kind of character in China.\u201dShe said the image that Mr. Trump liked to promote of himself as a successful businessman resonated in China.\u201cThe whole thing about Trump is he has no experience in politics, but now he is the president of the U.S.A.,\u201d she said. \u201cThe story is like a movie: It\u2019s kind of inspiring, in a way, that a person can rise up to that position. And I think most Chinese people kind of respect that journey.\u201dThe home had been owned by Isaac Kestenberg, purchased with his wife, Claudia, in 2008 for $782,500. On Election Day last year, as Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendancy seemed possible, Michael Davis, a real estate investor, made an offer on the house, he said, ultimately purchasing it for about $1.4 million. Neither Mr. Kestenberg nor Mr. Davis knows who bought it this time, they said.The sale to Trump Birth House closed on March 23. \u201cI hope that the broader economy has as much lift from the president\u2019s policies as the president\u2019s childhood home got,\u201d Mr. Davis said.On Tuesday, rain pelted the crocuses popping up outside the home on Wareham Place.

If you have complaints, O.K. You want to file charges, fine. Look for evidence,\u201d Mr. Duterte told a gathering of mayors in Manila, the capital.\u201cBut still, I will kill you,\u201d he warned the criminals and drug users who have been the focus of his crackdown.The president spoke just weeks after a retired police officer said he would be willing to testify in domestic and international courts that Mr. Duterte had ordered him and other hired hit men to routinely carry out killings when Mr. Duterte was mayor of Davao.Mr. Duterte said his tough anti-crime stance was \u201cthe only formula that worked in my city\u201d of Davao, and voters across the country elected him last year by a wide margin to replicate that policy nationwide.\u201cAnd human rights groups have been after me for a long time. They say my mouth encourages the police\u201d to take the law in their own hands, he said. \u201cBut now, I have included the military because drugs have become a threat to national security.\u201dLast week, Mr. Duterte signed an executive order that revived his antidrug crackdown. It was temporarily suspended when rogue police officers were implicated in the murder of a Korean national whom they had kidnapped and accused of being a drug dealer.That order created the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs, which reports directly to the president and is backed by the military.Two men, Arthur Lascanas, a former Davao City police officer, and Edgar Matobato, a self-described hit man, have said they were members of a \u201cdeath squad\u201d led by Mr. Duterte that targeted petty criminals, drug traffickers and political opponents.Their lawyer, Jude Josue Sabio, said both men\u2019s statements were tantamount to accusations of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and they would take their case to the International Criminal Court in The Hague by April.\u201cBoth Matobato and Lascanas are vital witnesses to prove that the Davao death squad was used by Duterte as a template, or as a strategy or policy, for crime control through extrajudicial killings since he became president,\u201d Mr. Sabio said in an interview.Their accusations came after a report by Human Rights Watch, which found that the police had falsified evidence to justify unlawful killings and that the majority of those killed were poor. The report urged the United Nations to create an \u201cindependent, international investigation\u201d into the killings.Rommel Banlaoi, the director at the Center for Intelligence and National Security Studies, said accusations against Mr. Duterte of human rights abuses should be handled domestically.\u201cThere is still a general support on the war against drugs, but the opposition is raising the issue of extrajudicial killings as a pretext to challenge the reign of Duterte,\u201d Mr. Banlaoi said. \u201cIf Duterte fails to perform and the Philippine economy deteriorates to a level that hurts the stomach of the middle class, not to mention the lower class, the opposition can muster support to topple his regime.\u201dMr. Duterte has said the accusations against him were attempts to destabilize his administration.\u201cWhen will I stop? When you threaten me with extrajudicial accusation? That threat has been going on since I was a mayor,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cJust try.\u201dHe told the police to continue their drug raids and to shoot criminals if necessary. \u201cI have said those who are accused while in the performance of their duty, I have your back.\u201dIf police officers who followed his orders were convicted of crimes, he said, he would pardon them.\u201cThen I will say, \u2018Go back to the person who accused you, and kill him.\u2019 I will pardon you,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday by a vote of 68 to 31.The position puts Mr. Zinke in control of 500 million acres of United States land \u2014 roughly a fifth of the nation \u2014 and charged with balancing the department\u2019s contradictory duties of conserving land and mining it for resources at a time of intense pressure from energy producers, environmental activists, state lawmakers and his own boss, who made fossil fuel jobs a crucial part of his campaign platform.\u201cRyan, he\u2019s always called himself a Teddy Roosevelt Republican,\u201d Mr. Schustrom said. \u201cBut his record has been inconsistent.\u201d\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who has tried to transfer millions of acres of public lands out of federal control.Mr. Chaffetz cited a stop he had made the day before in Emery County, Utah. \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\u201cI am an unapologetic admirer of Teddy Roosevelt,\u201d Mr. Zinke said at a January nomination hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where he evoked Roosevelt on 10 occasions. \u201cI fully recognize and appreciate there are lands that deserve special recognition and are better managed under the John Muir model of wilderness, where man has a light touch and is an observer.\u201dMr. Zinke entered politics in 2009, serving two terms in the Montana Legislature, and became the state\u2019s at-large representative in the United States House of Representatives in 2015. He splits time between Washington, Whitefish and Santa Barbara, Calif., the hometown of his wife, Lola. He has three adult children: Wolfgang, Konrad and Jennifer.Mr. Zinke\u2019s critics, however, point to policies they call \u201cfar from Rooseveltian.\u201dMore recently, he held listening sessions for a bill that would overhaul the Antiquities Act by requiring approval from local residents before a president designates a national monument. Roosevelt signed the 1906 law, and presidents have used it to push through unpopular preservation projects.In some Whitefish circles, that set alarm bells clanging. \u201cIt seemed to contravene, to contradict, his stance that public lands are sacrosanct,\u201d said Richard Hildner, 71, the deputy mayor.As secretary, Mr. Zinke will face several challenges, including a $12.5 billion maintenance backlog at national parks; ecosystems and budgets ravaged by drought and fire; environmental activists invigorated by the highly public protest of the Dakota Access pipeline; tattered relations between Interior Department employees and local communities; and a president whose job promises may hinge on his ability to push fossil fuel projects through the door.It is expected that Mr. Trump will push the interior secretary to restart drilling off the Alaskan and the Atlantic coasts, which Mr. Obama had blocked through 2022. Mr. Obama made the decision to close off the Atlantic drilling after residents from hundreds of coastal cities and towns, from Richmond, Va. to Charleston, S.C., passed resolutions opposing it.Opening the waters off tourist towns like Myrtle Beach, S.C., to drilling could reignite protests.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s 2018 fiscal blueprint calls for a steep 11 percent cut to the Interior Department\u2019s roughly $13 billion annual budget. The White House is expected to push for most cuts to come from the Interior Department\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service, which designates endangered species. Yet the office has a backlog of more than 500 species of plants and animals that are awaiting a legal determination of protection under the Endangered Species Act.An early point of contention will be Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, a vast canyon region set aside for protection in late December by Mr. Obama, using the Antiquities Act. Some conservative lawmakers hope that Mr. Zinke will push Mr. Trump to overturn that decision, which they say will hurt the local economy.But no president has ever undone the wilderness protections designated by a previous president under the act.\u201cHe\u2019s going to be moving into uncharted territory if he does that,\u201d said Eric Washburn, an expert on Interior Department policies at Bracewell, a Washington law firm.In his testimony before Congress, Mr. Zinke said he would visit Utah and make a recommendation, adding that his general view was that if local lawmakers oppose a monument, \u201cwe should defer a lot of that to the state.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, referred incorrectly to the agency\u2019s work regarding the Endangered Species Act. While the agency has a backlog of plants and animals awaiting a determination of protection, it is not under a court order to make those decisions.Coral Davenport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking the Two-Hour Marathon Barrier", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byPhys EdLowering the men\u2019s marathon world record to below two hours could be easier than some experts have predicted, according to a timely new study of how to run fast. Of almost equal interest, the rest of us could use a few simple tweaks to improve our own, admittedly more pedestrian race times.The current world record for the 26.2-mile distance, set by Dennis Kimetto of Kenya in 2014, is 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. To shave close to three minutes from that time and drop below two hours, the study finds, may require only a few simple adjustments to elite runners\u2019 racing strategies and equipment.Several programs, some funded by running shoe companies, are working with small groups of world-class male runners in an attempt to shatter the two-hour barrier.To date, much of the effort in these programs has focused on improving runners\u2019 strength and endurance through longer or more strenuous training. But some scientists have begun to ask whether it might be worthwhile to focus more intently on other aspects of running and, in particular, economy.In simple terms, running speed depends on both a runner\u2019s aerobic capacity and his or her running economy, also known as efficiency. If one athlete is more efficient than another, his body can use less energy to go at the same pace as the other runner and he should be able to run longer or harder.They began by considering the environment, which can have an outsize effect on running speed. Headwinds and hills reduce efficiency. So one quick way to improve efficiency and speed, they write, is to run downhill. The current world record was set in the Berlin Marathon, which is mostly flat or downhill.International sports regulations specify that, for world-record consideration, a course cannot drop more than about 140 feet from beginning to end. But a marathon course with precisely that much altitude loss would allow an elite runner to be about 1 percent more efficient and faster, the researchers calculate.Reducing wind resistance would provide an even greater boost, they next determined. Specifically, if every racer in a small, lead group ran for about three minutes at the head of a line of other runners and then dropped to the back of that group, as bike racers do in a pace line, the runners would all be faster than if they ran side by side. Each racer would use more energy than normal while at the head of the line, since he would be blocking the wind for the others, but would conserve a great deal of energy when tucked in behind the other runners, producing a significant net improvement in efficiency, the researchers calculate.Finally, they found that by changing shoes, marathoners could very easily increase their speed. Shoes are costly, in terms of efficiency. It takes energy to swing legs, and the energy demands are amplified if weight is on the foot. In past studies, the Colorado researchers had found that adding 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) to the weight of a shoe reduces a runner\u2019s efficiency by about 1 percent. Lighter shoes make more efficient runners. When Mr. Kimetto set the current world record, he wore shoes that weigh about 244 grams each, the researchers write. Had his shoes been 100 grams lighter, he might have run the same course a minute faster, they conclude.Taken together, these strategies could potentially improve a world-class racer\u2019s efficiency by almost 3 percent in a given marathon, the researchers calculate, which should reduce their finishing times by nearly four minutes and easily drop the world record below two hours.Whether you\u2019re looking to get under the five-hour-mark or qualify for the Boston Marathon, this guide is for you. The good news is that the same training strategies can be used to hit any marathon time goal.Given this data, \u201cI think we will see a sub-two-hour marathon a lot sooner than many people think,\u201d says Rodger Kram, a professor of biomechanics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who conducted the study with Wouter Hoogkamer, a postdoctoral researcher at the same school, and Christopher Arellano, a professor at the University of Houston.In the meantime, Dr. Kram says, these strategies might also substantially improve efficiency and race times for the rest of us.Look for a marathon that advertises itself as having a downhill course, he says. Running the California International Marathon in Sacramento, for instance, which drops about 340 feet from start to finish, could allow an otherwise four-hour marathon runner to shave about 2.5 minutes from his or her finishing time, compared to running a completely flat course, Dr. Hoogkamer estimates.Similarly, convincing a few fellow runners to join you in a pace line during the marathon might shave nearly four minutes from your time if you would normally finish in four hours, Dr. Hoogkamer says.Finally, lighter shoes could lower your time by another minute or so, although it\u2019s wise to break in any new shoes well in advance of race day to avoid blisters or other problems.Advertisement"}

Chris, who has a degree in engineering but is trying to build a business as a freelance photographer, researched the area and thinks there are more freelance jobs there. They will also be near several military bases, an employment option if they cannot find full-time work, she said.Money worries are not new to Tanya, who grew up in poverty in Yazoo City, Miss., in the Mississippi Delta. She remembers moving often as a child because her parents could not pay the rent. The water and electricity were frequently cut off.Tanya said that growing up in poverty and seeing poverty every day had a significant influence on her political choices.\u201cGiven that there are a lot of economic issues right now, social welfare programs are essential and help people from being homeless to keeping people from having their health become detrimental,\u201d she said.Money was also scarce during her five years in the Navy. \u201cSo you kind of get used to living very basic,\u201d she said.The first time in her life that she thought she had enough money was after she was discharged and moved to Reno, Nev. \u201cI started to make good money in the civilian world \u2026 and I lived a little more lavishly, maybe too lavishly, and ended up in bankruptcy,\u201d she said, and \u201cthen, of course, I reverted back to the basics again.\u201dChris, 46, grew up in Arkansas; he also filed for bankruptcy after leaving the military because he lived beyond his means.While Tanya no longer has a paycheck she can count on, she receives disability compensation of nearly $2,000 a month for a back injury she sustained during a training exercise in the Navy.Chris, who served during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was also receiving $2,000 a month in disability compensation for a number of physical and emotional issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder. But in December, that payment was halted for six months after a paperwork error resulted in his being overpaid.The couple has health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs; Tanya\u2019s ex-husband covers their son\u2019s insurance.While they drive newer vehicles, they shop for things marked down to the lowest price and closely monitor their utility costs.Chris said he is hopeful about their situation, and he likes a lot of what President Trump is doing. \u201cLike wanting to renovate the V.A. system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would really impact us, but how is he going to do it?\u201dTanya said she is not sure of their future. \u201cWe are happy with living simply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried to find the least extravagant house in the neighborhood.\u201cI\u2019m at peace with the fact that I don\u2019t have to have a lot of money to be happy.\u201dRob Moritz lives in North Little Rock. He has spent more than 30 years covering politics, state and local government and crime news for newspapers in Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas.Colorado SpringsAvalon Manly is proud of who she is and what she represents as a feminist, bisexual, social activist, writer, artist and teacher living in the famously conservative stronghold of Colorado Springs.And defying what she sees as an unfair image of her fellow millennials as \u201clazy and entitled,\u201d Avalon, 27, works hard. She teaches at a Colorado Springs middle school. She also does \u201cpart-time pittance work\u201d to bridge the gap between her $44,000 teaching salary, in an area with a median income of about $54,000, and her bills. She calls them \u201cside hustles.\u201d\u201cEvery millennial I know has a side hustle or two,\u201d said Avalon, who does freelance design work, editing work and writing. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who has one job and makes a living at it.\u201dShe scrambles because she is digging out of a financial hole she created when she lost her job in 2014 and turned to credit cards to fill the gaps in her monthly budget. It\u2019s a choice that taught her a particularly painful lesson in personal finance.\u201cThere were months during the great season of unemployment where I would send out 15 job applications and then I would sit on the couch and have panic attacks,\u201d she said.\u201cI was really dumb,\u201d she said, explaining how she took temporary and part-time jobs to generate income and negotiated with her bank and credit companies for relief.\u201cWe live in this system that correlates wealth with character,\u201d Avalon said. \u201cIf you are doing well financially, you must be a good person. And if you are doing poorly, you must be a bad person. What an unjust narrative that is.\u201dShe might have recovered from her financial woes more quickly, but chose a lower-paying teaching job in a neighborhood with one of the lowest per-capita incomes and highest crime rates in the region, turning down more lucrative offers.\u201cMy friends and I tend to be very activist, very passionate about people and passionate about doing meaningful work,\u201d she said.She admits she would fit in better in more progressive Colorado communities like Boulder or Denver, but she is committed to staying here. \u201cMy family is here,\u201d she said, and she likes to be near them.Avalon moved back after a three-year stint in New Orleans, where she taught in a poor public school as a member of Teach for America. And she is making no compromises as she plants roots here.Instead, she wants the community to adjust. \u201cThere are more of us here than people realize,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe are working to change Colorado Springs.\u201dShe is tempted to take higher-paying jobs, but says her work is too important to leave. She points to a seminar she led for new Teach for America corps members.\u201cWe had a very real conversation about supporting queer kids,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard to watch all the new teachers\u2019 faces when we talked about the need to support queer kids in states that legislate against them.\u201dBill Vogrin has worked as a reporter, editor and columnist for 35 years, primarily for The Associated Press and The Colorado Springs Gazette. He has lived in Colorado Springs since 1994.Grand Rapids, Mich.Money has been a burden for Kate Elenbaas for much of her life, a constant reminder of how her family struggled financially, and then how her addiction to alcohol nearly killed her.\u201cFrom the time I was a little kid, money has somehow or another woven itself in and out of my life in a negative way,\u201d said Kate, 53. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I made bad decisions, did desperate things.\u201dNow, 15 years sober on Feb. 1, Kate still does not have a nest egg, or even her own home. Yet she lacks for nothing and makes a point to donate to organizations that help people who are homeless and addicted.She is a therapist at Thriveworks Counseling and Life Coaching, and she made $57,000 in 2015, just above the median income for this area. She rents a small two-bedroom home on the northwest side of this city, and the only luxuries she allows herself are a 2008 Jeep Commander and a 60-inch 4D television with a stereo sound system.She owes more than $70,000 in student loans, some from attending college in her 20s and the rest from earning a master\u2019s degree in social work in 2010.\u201cSobriety has taught me I could be so much worse off, and I tell myself that daily.\u201dHer parents divorced when she was 7, and Kate said her mother remained acrimonious toward her father about child support. That bitterness extended to Kate.\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for her, but it would be one thing if my mother would have instilled in us the idea that, \u2018Look, we may not have much money, but we have enough,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut every week and every day there was an argument about money. My mother would berate me \u2014 tell me I was ungrateful.\u201dWhile Kate\u2019s family was considered middle class, most of Kate\u2019s friends were in the upper income range. It made her feel insecure, she said, and she became the life of the party, the class clown.\u201cI found friendships through humor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut inside, I was insecure. I realized my alcoholic behavior \u2014 what I thought and how I felt about myself \u2014 started in childhood.\u201dThat behavior escalated in her adult life. A fifth of vodka would temporarily cure the physical toll the disease was taking on her. She suffered from the shakes, retching, hair loss and nosebleeds, and she was desperate for money to pay for liquor and cigarettes. She pocketed money from the till while working at a fast-food restaurant. She stole quarters from her nephew\u2019s piggy bank.\u201cYou feel horrible, but when you are in the throes of addiction \u2026 \u201d she said. \u201cI was at the point where I had to drink all the time. I existed on a fifth of vodka and a pack of cigarettes.\u201dKate finally reached her \u201cbottom\u201d in 2002, when her sister rushed her to a treatment center.\u201cThe doctor took a look at me and said, \u2018She won\u2019t make it through the weekend,\u2019\u201d Kate said.She remembers waking up in a hospital intensive care unit three weeks later. She weighed 106 pounds. She had suffered from alcohol encephalitis and cirrhosis of the liver. Her body had begun to shut down.\u201cObviously I lived, but it was a very long and tenuous recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cA liver specialist told me I\u2019d aged my body by 10 years. I went through menopause at 40. I still feel chronic pain and arthritis. Everything has been accelerated.\u201cBut by God\u2019s grace, here I am, and I realize what\u2019s important. I have a good life.\u201dMary Ullmer has been an associate editor for espnW.com since 2011. She is a Michigan native who worked in the newspaper industry for nearly three decades. She returned to her home state in 1999.New Albany, Ind.Wesley Shears thought he\u2019d arrived. Still in his 30s, he was on the fast track at work, owned his first home \u2014 a small three-bedroom in Lexington, Ky. \u2014 and with his wife had a combined income in excess of $100,000.But his degree in architecture could not protect him when building projects dried up after the country\u2019s financial crisis in 2008.\u201cI survived many rounds of layoffs,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, there was nobody else to lay off.\u201d The house went soon after, lost in a bankruptcy.In what should have been his prime earning years as an architectural designer, Wesley scrambled to continue his livelihood, finding only a string of hourly wage jobs.\u201cIt just looked like everything was stepping up and then boom, boom,\u201d said Wesley, now 44, from the small living room in the duplex he rents for $800 a month in New Albany, Ind., just across the river from Louisville, Ky. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me. I think it\u2019s this whole generation that I\u2019m a part of. Because there\u2019s a lot of people that I went to college with that I connect with on Facebook \u2026 they\u2019re just kind of in the same boat.\u201dTo make ends meet, he managed an office, directed projects for a cabinetmaker and was a substitute teacher in the New Albany school system. \u201cThere\u2019s one school right down the road in a bad neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had me on speed dial.\u201dA year ago, Wesley separated from his second wife, Kristin. He now lives frugally with his 11-year-old son, Hank, a fifth grader at Hazelwood Middle School, along with two cats and two Jack Russell terriers. The family recently stopped using the upstairs bathroom, he said, because the leaky pipes send water through the downstairs ceiling. An older son, Cowen, 18, is a freshman at Butler University, and he also lives with them.\u201cMoney was the end-all, be-all growing up,\u201d Wesley said. \u201cIt seemed what you would strive for. Now what makes me happy is just everything\u2019s taken care of, everything\u2019s paid for. The lights are on. There\u2019s food. Stuff like that.\u201dWhen Hank needs new sneakers, Wesley buys a high-end brand, so they last longer. His own shoes, he said, come refurbished. Occasional trips to Goodwill and the Salvation Army augment his wardrobe. Entertainment comes courtesy of one of the few remaining neighborhood video stores \u2014 where kids\u2019 movies are free. Cable TV is a splurge. Internet, he said, is a necessity.\u201cWhen stuff is really, really, really needed, I can make it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI take it to the very last point. If I can\u2019t make it then, I reach out. I don\u2019t want to, but I do.\u201dHe also helps others, serving food at a soup kitchen, as a volunteer coach at his son\u2019s school, and at his church. What he has lost in bank accounts, he has gained in relationships, including a new love interest.Wesley said he is confident that his current struggle will be a catalyst for his sons\u2019 future success.\u201cI do have dreams and I have no plans of letting them go,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus on myself and my two boys is clearer, and with my current job I will be a homeowner again and move ahead financially in life.\u201dJohn Mura is director of communications for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. He worked for 36 years as a reporter and senior editor at newspapers in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Kentucky.Los AngelesNatalie Davis was married with a 5-year-old and three months pregnant with her second child when her husband died. She was 31.\u201cNobody expected him to die at 45,\u201d said Natalie, now 36. \u201cHe literally just dropped. Metaphorically speaking, that can happen to anything. It was a wake-up call.\u201dIn the years after his death, Natalie relied heavily on her credit cards and accrued lots of debt.\u201cGoing through high school and college, I always had some sort of a credit-card debt,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019d worked hard to get out of debt,\u201d and she had finally established good credit. But as she struggled to deal with the loss of her husband, she ran up credit card bills again.\u201cNow I find myself digging out of another debt hole,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be careful about where I put my money, where I spend it. I hate packing my lunches for work, but I do it.\u201dWhile she is considering where to cut corners, and what she can allow herself, her philosophy on money is relatively simple.Natalie does not have any savings, which she says makes her a little more cautious but is not a source of great anxiety.The biggest trade-off she has made was leaving a full-time executive position to spend more time with her 10-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. \u201cI\u2019m the only parent they have,\u201d she said, \u201cand they\u2019re young.\u201dShe is now a freelancer working with clients in fashion merchandising and product development. The flexibility is important to her, but her salary can swing by as much as $20,000 a year, without ever quite amounting to six figures. She said her number of clients had grown, but she was not completely removed from the financial struggle.But the change was worth it to get time with her children. \u201cI see their development getting so much better,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially my son.\u201dNatalie said she was getting over the guilt she felt about not being able to give her children everything, especially in the absence of their father.\u201cThis is what we have, and this is what we\u2019re going to work with,\u201d is her mantra, of sorts. \u201cI\u2019m definitely less hard on myself about not being able to provide in all aspects. I just cut myself a little more slack, because I used to physically lose hair over it.\u201dThis mom has also carved out two small luxuries for herself that she says have made her life much better, even if she can feel it in her wallet.\u201cI\u2019m going out tonight,\u201d she says, on one of the evenings she sets aside to spend with other mothers. Only in the last year has she felt comfortable enough with \u201cbiting the bullet, and hiring a babysitter because it was needed.\u201dThe other little thing she says she will not bend on is having a housekeeper come once a month to help out.\u201cIt chops off an entire day for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s time I can now take my kids out and do things with them. I don\u2019t feel so guilty about that anymore, but I used to.\u201dJarrett Hill is a freelance journalist in Los Angeles. He hosts Back2Reality, a politics and pop culture podcast for NBCBLK.Florissant, Mo.Alonzo Adams doesn\u2019t know if the old saying will hold true for him.\u201cBlack preachers don\u2019t retire, they die,\u201d said Alonzo, a 42-year-old pastor and father of four. Particularly at smaller, modest churches like his, he said, pastors\u2019 families often divert their own money to fill the church\u2019s coffers, leaving little for retirement savings.It\u2019s a cycle Alonzo is hoping to break. In addition to tending to New Jerusalem\u2019s flock, he works a full-time job at the Department of Agriculture and runs a small janitorial business that cleans offices overnight. His wife, Ronica, 40, home-schools three of their four children and runs a cake-baking business out of their home.\u201cMy wife was diagnosed with lupus two years ago. Kneading all the fondant, and all of these things to make these cakes and put all this stuff together, it hurts her,\u201d Alonzo said from his home in Florissant, Mo. Ronica has to work, he said, even though he puts in 75 to 80 hours a week. \u201cThis is the world that we live in,\u201d he said.Even with the extra jobs, the Adams family brings in a maximum of $76,000 each year, just about the median income in their ZIP code. They have trouble saving, he said, and have no retirement nest egg.The financial pressure of raising four kids is apparent and frustrating. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re not buying as many groceries as we normally would,\u201d Alonzo said.But it is not the hustle that bothers him. It is the feeling that no matter how hard he works, no matter the choices and sacrifices he makes, he barely keeps his head above water \u2014 after a lifetime of watching white classmates, friends and co-workers excel, seemingly with ease.\u201cI\u2019m educated. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m ignorant. I try to speak intelligently. I try to carry myself, and even I get to the point where I just get frustrated and want to lash out,\u201d Alonzo said. \u201cThen I look at my cousins, my friends, people who I went to school with, people who I just see on the street on a daily basis. And I just see how they respond, how angry they get, and how they lash out.\u201dIt is the weight of an economic stagnation and anxiety that North St. Louis County\u2019s residents have carried over the years, and one of the factors that fueled the unrest following the police killing of the teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014.\u201cI can\u2019t condone it,\u201d Alonzo said of the disturbances, \u201cbut oh my God, I have to tell you how much I understand it.\u201dHe has done his best to get ahead. He served in the Navy, graduated from the University of Missouri, read up on I.R.A.s and 401(k)\u2019s \u2014 all the while remembering his grandfather, also a preacher, who spent his life picking cotton in Mississippi.What Alonzo knows about finances, he taught himself.Today, he is helping his son, who is his oldest child and an aspiring engineer, go to college locally. He and his wife spend more on rent than they can easily afford, but want their kids to grow up in a safe neighborhood.He may spend the rest of his life working, but at least he will have tried to set up his son and daughters for a life easier than his.\u201cThey are a product of their environment,\u201d Alonzo said, sitting at his dining room table over a cake his wife had baked. \u201cSo what environment am I willing to pay for now to ensure that they can have a better later?\u201dRyan Schuessler is a freelance journalist who grew up in St. Louis. He has lived in Chicago since 2015.Oakland, Calif.Christina Chung, 39, still remembers being one of just a few children in her middle school who lined up in the cafeteria for the free lunch program. It didn\u2019t make her feel bad, exactly, but she was aware that she came from one of the poorer families in her upper-middle-class Orange County, Calif., neighborhood. \u201cI was around a lot of people feeling that I didn\u2019t have what they had,\u201d she said.Now, as a mother of one with a second child on the way, she packs a lot of lunches and realizes food is an easy way to spend and to save. \u201cSo we cook at home a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe rarely do takeout or delivery.\u201dChristina is Korean-American. Her parents met in Southern California and \u201cwere all about assimilation and the American dream,\u201d she said. When Christina was little, her father worked as a computer scientist and the family bought a small home, but he had flashy tastes, \u201clike buying a new Acura.\u201d Her mom was more practical and \u201cwould immediately return it.\u201dChristina\u2019s father struggled with mental illness, and life got harder as he got older. He owned a gas station for a while, then couldn\u2019t hold down a job or be an effective parent; he died when she was 13.Her mother went from being a stay-at-home mom for Christina and her younger sister to working multiple jobs as a translator, a thrift store manager and an office assistant for a car repair shop.Christina worked, too, babysitting, then at various jobs throughout high school. \u201cIf we wanted to buy a CD, we had to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no asking Mom for that.\u201dChristina took out student loans to attend the California Institute of the Arts, then went into education. She chose a career that offers modest financial rewards in order to focus on service. \u201cWork for me was about finding meaning,\u201d she said of her job as a curriculum developer. \u201cThe money was secondary.\u201dShe is cleareyed about the consequences and benefits of her choices. She loves the creative life she has built with her husband, an administrator in an independent school, and their 4-year-old daughter in an apartment in the Temescal district with stable, under-market-rate rent. They both D.J. on the side and have a rich community of friends \u2014 she works a 30-hour week to have more time with their daughter.But, she says, she sometimes wonders if she is \u201clike super-insane to have so little money.\u201dThe couple only started using credit cards a couple of years ago and have no debt, but little savings. The bulk of what Christina earns goes toward rent and child care. They cannot save enough for a down payment on an apartment or house of their own.\u201cI have always had expensive taste, but I won\u2019t go into debt,\u201d she said. \u201cLike this couch. It\u2019s falling apart but it\u2019s Room & Board. I always try to find the things I like but used, like on Craigslist.\u201dChristina feels a deep allegiance to her diverse Oakland neighborhood. But as it gentrifies she realizes they are, in some ways, trapped. Skyrocketing rents mean \u201cwe couldn\u2019t even afford to rent another house on this block right now.\u201dMeanwhile, as real estate values escalate, the local elementary school still ranks poorly. \u201cWhy would we send our kids to that school when no one else I know would ever put it in their top five?\u201dNow Christina is expecting their second child. The couple waited to conceive until their first daughter would be entering kindergarten so they could avoid double day care costs.They\u2019re committed to sending their children to public school, but quality concerns have driven Christina to at least consider private options if she can find a place that costs around what they already pay for preschool. The change, however, would place a serious squeeze on the family budget.What about college? Christina said her children will be expected to attend college \u2014 just as she and her sister were \u2014 and to pay for it. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting a free ride from us,\u201d she said with a laugh.Jeanne Carstensen is a writer in San Francisco. She is the former managing editor of The Bay Citizen and Salon.com.Duquesne, Pa.In Tara Thompson\u2019s weekly calculations on how to scrape by on $20,000 a year, her daughters are always at the heart of the equation.Kayla, 18, is a busy high school senior planning for college. Kaiya, a 15-year-old sophomore, is training to be a nurse at a vocational school where she spends half her days. Tara tries to make sure they have clothes, food and field trips, which is no easy task when you are a single parent earning less than half the county\u2019s median income.\u201cAs long as my kids have everything they need,\u201d she said, \u201cwhatever I can do that week, I do. Whatever I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dShe said she knows that money shapes the way people think about you. \u201cThe way you dress and look and the way you eat: Everything is based on what you can afford to do, and people judge you on that,\u201d she said.Tara, 39, works as a home aide in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh, earning $12 an hour caring for people in their 90s. She is paid only if she shows up \u2014 if her clients are sick, or if she is, less money comes in that day. \u201cMy last paycheck was lower than normal because my daughter had the flu and was in the hospital for three days,\u201d she said, \u201cso I missed work.\u201dShe would be more than willing to get a second job, but her daughters\u2019 school district does not have any activity buses, and so she needs to drive them around in the afternoons.That is especially challenging because the city where the Thompsons live, Duquesne, Pa., became so poor five years ago that it could no longer afford to maintain a high school, and its students were divided between two nearby districts.Duquesne was once part of a bustling, economically vibrant stretch of steel mill cities along the Monongahela River, which flows into Pittsburgh. Most of the mills shut down more than 30 years ago, and today, Duquesne is mostly African-American, with a median household income that is about the same as Tara\u2019s.To make ends meet, Tara and her daughters live in the home of her sister, who is a nurse. Also sharing the five-bedroom house is their mother and her sister\u2019s son.\u201cI have looked at a couple of other places to live, but they need a $1,500 deposit or the first and last month\u2019s rent,\u201d Tara said. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t want to move my kids into the projects because of the alcohol and drug addictions and the danger.\u201dBeside her earnings, Tara gets about $3,400 a year in child support from Kayla\u2019s father, and she relies heavily on her earned-income tax credit each year, which ranges from $6,000 to $7,000.\u201cWhen I get my income tax check,\u201d she said, \u201cI pay off whatever bills I have and then it\u2019s gone.\u201dA big part of what sustains her is her church, First Presbyterian Church of Duquesne, where she is an ordained elder.\u201cI grew up afraid of God,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I said or did something someone didn\u2019t like, I was told I was going to burn in hell. When I started going to this church 14 years ago, I saw for the first time what God really wanted for me.\u201cI still struggle a lot, but the difference now is, I know that God is with me.\u201dMark Roth is a freelance writer who was an editor and reporter at The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for 33 years, retiring in 2015. He also teaches science writing at Carnegie Mellon University.Scottsdale, Ariz.Somehow, over more than three decades in the Phoenix area, David and Laura Demson, husband-and-wife haircutters, have hopscotched through 10 or so hair-salon locations and raised three children.What goes around comes around, and now their business, Salon Rock, is only 13 doors away from the Scottsdale bar where they first met in 1984 when it was called Cowgirls.David, 54, looks like David Lee Roth, the rock singer, and Laura, 57, looks like Nancy Wilson, the blond guitarist from Heart.Despite their rock star looks, they say they rarely drink, they don\u2019t do drugs, and they regularly attend Grace Chapel, a local evangelical charismatic church.Faith and music, secular and nonsecular, are big parts of their lives.The $100 white guitar that Laura threw out the window after a fight with David hangs on the wall of Salon Rock.

Money. \u201cWhen you have no money, there\u2019s a lot of stress,\u201d Laura said.In their lush periods, mostly in the 1990s (when they were able to charge as much as $150 for a haircut and coloring), they made as much as $100,000 a year. Now they are lucky to make $48,000 a year, slightly below the local median household income of $50,000.A mishandling (by David) of payroll taxes brought large tax penalties from the Internal Revenue Service in 1988 and ruined their credit rating.The 2008 recession hit them especially hard. They had to scrimp and were not able to save. Laura has no savings account. David has the minimum $5 in his. \u201cWe are flying by the seat of our pants,\u201d David said.Money was so tight, the Demsons used food stamps and food banks to get by. David, a diabetic, gets insulin and other treatments under the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the state\u2019s Medicaid agency for low-income people.Recently, the Demsons and two of their children moved in with David\u2019s mother. She has a nearby 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house, fully paid for. \u201cHow do we get by?\u201d David said. \u201cWe live rent-free.\u201dDavid\u2019s mother, Peggy, 84, allowed him to take out a $50,000 second mortgage \u2014 $30,000 to remodel Salon Rock and $20,000 for surgery to reset River\u2019s jaw, flawed since infancy.The couple has given up going to the movies, eating out and vacationing in San Diego. Laura misses makeup and mostly uses the free samples from stores\u2019 bonus programs.\u201cLooking back, I wish our parents, who knew about money, taught us more about money,\u201d said Laura, who was one of eight children. Her father was a General Motors executive, and her mother was a jazz singer.\u201cFor our own kids,\u201d David said, \u201cwe\u2019re teaching by example.\u201dAnthony Ramirez is a former reporter for The New York Times.

By the time she and her students traveled back home, Mr. Trump had issued a flurry of executive orders and she was even more assured of the trip\u2019s success.\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting,\u201d said Jordan, 31, a graduate of Washington State University. \u201cI\u2019ve been instructing them that there are limits to the presidency.\u201dJordan, a Democrat, was dismayed to hear that one of the president\u2019s first acts was to suspend a planned cut in housing-loan insurance rates. While the Tacoma housing market is not quite as hot as Seattle\u2019s, prices are escalating. It\u2019s another challenge for millennials trying to buy into the American dream.\u201cAny move on those loan insurance rates can make the difference of $50 or $100 a month,\u201d said Jordan, who has just a small amount of savings.For now, buying a house is on the back burner. When it comes to decisions about money, she factors in an unusually painful but important chapter of personal history.In January 2010, her younger sister was killed in the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti. Molly Hightower had traveled to Port-au-Prince to volunteer with Friends of the Orphans and was working with children when the building they were in collapsed.Her sister\u2019s death made Jordan rethink most things in her life. \u201cOne of the biggest things was my \u2018one day\u2019 mentality,\u201d she said. \u201cI was stockpiling away money, waiting for \u2014 I don\u2019t know: a partner, a better job, more money \u2014 unclear. But I was waiting to do the things I always wanted to do.\u201dWhen her sister died, Jordan was 24. Molly was 22. \u201cI realized that waiting to experience life was stupid because hers had been taken so suddenly and I could be next,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI began living.\u201dFor Jordan, who has two brothers and whose father is a general manager of a steel mill in the Puget Sound area, that meant travel. Over the last seven years, she has visited 23 countries, backpacking for weeks at a time during breaks from her teaching job in Tacoma.\u201cI have run marathons, bought a car, seen hundreds of events and shows \u2014 including musicals, plays, concerts, sporting events \u2014 and have gone to a dozen bachelorette parties around the nation, celebrated friends in a variety of ways and fallen in love,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of those things are worth the small number in my bank account to me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a huge savings,\u201d she said, adding that if something were to happen, she would have support from her parents, Mike and Mary, until she got back on her feet.And now Jordan has another big-ticket financial item on the horizon. When she returned from Washington, D.C., Michael surprised her by proposing. He took her to the pier on the Tacoma harbor, and friends, family members and a photographer were there.\u201cThese weddings are such a burden we put on each other,\u201d Jordan said, referring to herself and her friends. \u201cBut now that I\u2019m getting married, it\u2019s my turn to get back some of the money I\u2019ve spent the past few years!\u201dLaura Vecsey is a freelance writer specializing in real estate news.

{"Headline": "Why I Support a Border-Adjustment Tax", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMOUNT PROSPECT, ILL. \u2014 The United States corporate tax rate has been stuck at 35 percent for three decades. In that time, other leading countries have slashed their corporate rates to an average of 25 percent, with many far below that figure. This tax rate discrepancy puts domestic manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage and creates incentives for them to engage in \u201cinversions\u201d (using openings in the law to change their tax nationalities) or to move production and jobs offshore.Fortunately, there\u2019s widespread agreement in the business community on the need for lower corporate taxes. Unfortunately, there\u2019s strong disagreement over the best approach.One proposal that has generated debate is that favored by the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The plan would cut corporate rates to 20 percent while offsetting lost revenue with a so-called border adjustment, which would tax imports and rebate taxes on exports. Critics, including many retailers, have expressed fear that consumer prices would skyrocket as a result.From my perspective, as the chief executive of an American manufacturer of currency processing and authentication equipment, a border-adjustment tax makes complete sense as part of an overall tax package.In general, it\u2019s a good idea to shift the United States tax system toward consumption as opposed to production, which a border-adjustment tax would do. More than 150 of America\u2019s trading partners currently impose consumption taxes, or \u201cvalue added\u201d taxes, of up to 25 percent on American exports. This means that American-made exported goods are burdened with the costs of American taxes as well as those of foreign taxes. Our foreign competitors face no such consumption tax when entering the American market, but they enjoy value-added rebates from their home countries, which help lower their prices in our market.My company needs corporate tax relief, but I don\u2019t want the country to incur huge budget deficits as a result. Nor do I want to see a big hike in individual income taxes. Additional revenue has to be found, though, and a consumption tax that raises revenues while leveling the international playing field would serve two valuable purposes at once.Cutting business taxes and rebating taxes on my exported machines would allow my company to increase sales. Although my costs would rise somewhat because I have to import certain components that are no longer made domestically, the border tax would compensate for that loss by canceling out the tax-rebate advantage currently enjoyed by my foreign competitors.More sales for my company would entail factory expansion, a larger work force and greater tax revenues for my city, state and country. Hopefully, such border-adjustability would also create the conditions for businesses in the United States to once again supply the components needed to build my equipment.Those who object to the border-adjustment proposal \u2014 chiefly retailers who sell imported goods \u2014 claim that there will be exorbitant price increases for consumers. But there is reason to think any such increases would be smaller than critics suggest, as the tax would be applied only to the (lower) wholesale price at the border, not to the (higher) retail price in their stores.In the meantime, if retailers intend to pass along the full cost of the tax to their customers, perhaps those higher prices could be mitigated for lower-income Americans by a tax credit phased out over, say, three years \u2014 during which time retailers should be able to find or help establish American suppliers to meet their needs at lower cost.There is some question about whether a border-adjustment tax would be rejected by the World Trade Organization as an import barrier or export subsidy. But an American border tax would not be different in any relevant way from the longstanding consumption taxes that our foreign competitors currently enjoy with the blessing of the W.T.O., so it should not be judged any differently. If the W.T.O. \u2014 principally a bureaucratic collaboration of America\u2019s competitors \u2014 were to reject an American border-adjustment tax, it might well be time for the United States to re-evaluate its relationship with that organization.Theoretically, tax systems should collect revenue efficiently and distort markets as little as possible. But in an age of large-scale market distortion driven in part by the consumption taxes of our foreign competitors, why should American companies like mine be unilaterally disadvantaged because of misplaced fealty to an idealized tax system?The United States economy is a big ship, and it can\u2019t turn on a dime. However, a border-adjustment tax would provide a large impetus toward fixing many of the problems afflicting us.William J. Jones is the chairman and chief executive of Cummins Allison.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Does Mount Rushmore Exist?", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "The Voyages IssueThis gargantuan shrine to democracy has never felt so surreal.Supported byThey wanted to stay forever, to be swallowed by the crowds, but we were on a different pilgrimage, in search of a different America, so we continued on.Late that night, finally, we reached South Dakota.It was unfathomably empty. In downtown Rapid City, we idled at empty intersections, block after snowy block, waiting for traffic lights that governed no traffic. Emptiness is, to some degree, South Dakota\u2019s natural condition: It is the 17th-largest state in the country but has only the 46th-largest population \u2014 the square mileage of Senegal, the people of Fort Worth. The emptiness reaches a new extreme in winter, when all the tourists scatter and the open spaces take over. The map-boards on the sidewalks, set up to guide pedestrians from shop to shop, were covered in a crust of snow. Our hotel, a grand old lodge built concurrently with Mount Rushmore itself, bragged of hosting six presidents over the decades. But its rooms, in February, were cheap and vacant, and we met no one in the grand lobby except imitation wooden Indians and mounted bison heads.Why were we there? Why had I dragged my family \u2014 my wife and our Snapchatting 12-year-old daughter and our longhaired, talkative 9-year-old son \u2014 away from work and school to see, of all places, Mount Rushmore?I couldn\u2019t say, exactly. All I knew was that I seemed to be suffering a crisis of scale. America was taking up a larger part of my mind than it ever had before. It was dominating my internal landscape, crowding out other thoughts, blocking my view of regular life. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was reaching its proper size, growing the way a problem tends to grow just before a solution is found, or if it was swelling the way an organ does before it fails and bursts.I felt drawn to Mount Rushmore, instinctively, like a spawning fish to the head of a river. I wanted to look American bigness squarely in the face.Somewhere on the way to Mount Rushmore, we realized that none of us knew, for sure, which presidents were carved into the mountain. The image was so familiar that we had never really bothered to look closely. After some discussion, we managed to agree on George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. But who was the fourth? John Adams? Benjamin Franklin? Alexander Hamilton? We were just guessing figures from money. We had to look it up. It was Thomas Jefferson. I asked my son to draw me a picture, from memory, of Rushmore, and after several minutes of earnest work, he revealed something that looked like a police sketch of a middle-aged Beatles cover band that has been caught shoplifting after a gig at a strip mall. None of the presidents had a nose, Roosevelt\u2019s glasses had fallen off and Jefferson (who sported a jet-black mop-top) was on the wrong side of Washington. Otherwise, we all agreed, the picture was excellent.\u201cI think I really nailed Abraham Lincoln,\u201d my son said. \u201cHe has that long face and skinny chin.\u201dMy wife read in the local paper about a man who was in trouble for setting off an elk stampede with a drone. We drove off into the South Dakota vastness.This changed suddenly in the 1870s, when the notorious George Armstrong Custer arrived to make a map of the Black Hills. (In a bizarre coincidence \u2014 history ripped from today\u2019s headlines \u2014 Custer\u2019s most trusted Indian guide joined the expedition from Standing Rock and was named Maga.) In the course of their exploring, Custer\u2019s men discovered gold. Word flew across the nation (\u201cFrom the grass roots down, it was \u2018pay dirt\u2019\u2009\u201d), and before long a fire hose of white Americans went spraying into the isolated land, violating an Indian treaty with impunity, setting up mining towns and trading posts, blasting roads through mountains, changing the nature of the place forever.Before long, of course, the boom went bust. Many miners left; the region\u2019s economy sagged. In the 1920s, local boosters proposed an eccentric solution. What if some of the Black Hills\u2019 ancient rock could be carved into a monument to American history \u2014 a patriotic tribute that would also serve, in this new era of automobiles, as a roadside attraction? Spindly granite towers, it was suggested, could be carved into free-standing statues honoring heroes of the American West: Red Cloud, Sacagawea, Lewis and Clark. Instead of gold, South Dakota could harvest tourists.Only one American sculptor seemed up to the task. He was, like the sculpture he would create, a larger-than-life weirdo: John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum, son of a Danish immigrant, friend of Auguste Rodin, publicity hound, populist, salesman, self-styled tough guy with a white Stetson and a flowing scarf and a dark, bushy mustache. At the time, Borglum was working on another huge sculpture chiseled into the front of a mountain: a tribute, in Georgia, to great heroes of the Confederacy \u2014 Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson. (The project was initially sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and entangled with the Ku Klux Klan.)When Borglum was enticed to visit the Black Hills, he saw presidents: Washington, Lincoln. Anything else, he argued, would be too limited, too provincial, not sufficiently star-spangled \u201cU.S.A.!!!\u201d Borglum believed that America was a special artistic challenge, a place so heroically grand that the effete styles of Europe could never hope to do it justice. \u201cArt in America should be American,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdrawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement.\u201d He accepted the challenge to transform the Black Hills.From the beginning, the project struck many locals as absurd. Controversy raged in the newspapers. To carve statues in the mountains, one wrote, \u201cwould be as incongruous and ridiculous as keeping a cow in the rotunda of the Capitol building.\u201d \u201cWhy not just paint a mustache on everything?\u201d another asked.Funding for Mount Rushmore was touch-and-go, as was political and public support. But Borglum would not give up. The project took far longer, and cost far more money, than anyone could have imagined. Logistics were murderously complex. Men were lowered over the rock face on sling chairs; carving was done mainly with dynamite and jackhammers. At one point, a crack running through the stone threatened to break Thomas Jefferson\u2019s nose, so his face was blown off the mountain and started again in a different spot.The sculpting of Mount Rushmore began in 1927, with a ceremony overseen by President Calvin Coolidge, who wore a comically large hat. Work spanned 14 years, encompassing some of the defining spasms of American history: the Great Depression, the beginning of World War II. Separate dedication ceremonies were held for each of the four faces; Franklin Roosevelt himself came to dedicate Jefferson. The sculpture was finished one month and one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Work would have continued \u2014 the plan was to depict each of the presidents down to the waist \u2014 but funding began to dry up again, and Borglum died, and after a few finishing touches, the figures were abandoned as good enough. This was precisely the moment when American influence was about to explode, the dawn of 50 years of prosperity and cultural dominance. Mount Rushmore was completed, conveniently, just in time to serve as a kind of superheated mascot for the mythology of the Greatest Generation and baby boomers: that America\u2019s hugeness is bound up with its nobility, that it deservedly dominates the globe.The granite of Mount Rushmore is so hard that the sculptures will erode at a rate of one inch every 10,000 years.Huge thrusts of rock burst out of the landscape at random intervals in the forest. My wife said they looked as though they had fallen from outer space.\u201cThey\u2019re just rocks, Mom,\u201d said our daughter, who was listening to Chance the Rapper on one earbud. \u201cCalm down.\u201dWe passed over quaint wooden bridges that curled like pigtails and through old stone tunnels that looked, every time, as if they were going to rip off our side mirrors. More than once, I had the feeling that we were driving in a theme park. Each tunnel had been carefully blasted to frame a perfect view of Mount Rushmore. The presidents were watching us come to them. Our daughter screamed when she saw them and made me pull over so she could get a good angle for Snapchat.\u201cI hate pictures,\u201d our son said. \u201cYour mind is your own picture-taker-thing.\u201dAt one point, we passed a roadside cliff that looked vaguely like a face, and we all spent several minutes debating whether it had been carved like that deliberately or if we were maybe going slightly crazy in the snowy, empty woods. Soon everything we saw started to look like a face: rocks, trees, snowdrifts. \u201cThey\u2019re haunting me!\u201d our daughter shouted. \u201cEvery rock I look at! I don\u2019t understand life!\u201dBy the time we pulled into the Mount Rushmore parking garage, after an eternity of winding, everyone was exhausted and starving. The park\u2019s restaurant was closed for renovation, so we settled into a sort of triage-unit cafe next door. We ate in tense silence. The food was bad. I drank a beer called Honest Abe Red Ale, the can of which featured a picture of Mount Rushmore below the slogan GET SICK-N-TWISTED. Our son complained, bitterly, that his plastic cup of applesauce was \u201chot.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d he said \u2014 and that \u201chere\u201d seemed to encompass everything: the cafe, Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, America, the 21st century.After lunch we walked outside, to the viewing deck, and there \u2014 well, there was Mount Rushmore. That was really the biggest thing you could say about it: There it was. Rushmore is a ubiquitous American image, tattooed on the inside of every citizen\u2019s eyelids, so it felt disorienting to see it in three-dimensional space, pinned to this particular spot on the earth. We had the viewing deck almost to ourselves, which meant that the presidents and our family faced off. Four of us, four of them.There was Washington, out front, the leader of the band \u2014 noble, aristocratic and smooth, his mouth a grim stone line. A dollop of snow stuck to the bridge of his nose. Peering over his shoulder, like a shy sidekick, was Jefferson, his big nose held high, showing his nostrils to the world. (This was not an artistic choice; the grain of the rock forced Borglum to tilt the head back.) Lincoln stood apart from them, heavy eyebrows frosted with snow, and in the middle, almost swallowed by the mountain, was Teddy Roosevelt, with his wire-rimmed spectacles and Freddie Mercury mustache. They were all looking in slightly different directions, not at us but far over our heads, into the great American distance.I must admit that, in person, I was not especially moved by the beauty of the sculptures. They were, essentially, traditional busts, distinguished mainly by their insane scale and placement. The novelty of it was stronger than the beauty.What stood out most was everything around the presidents\u2019 faces: the Black Hills landscape that spreads and spreads, incorporating eons of old rock and new growth, last century\u2019s roads and yesterday\u2019s snow. This was something that was hard to appreciate in photographs, which tend to be tightly cropped \u2014 just the presidents, stony and smooth. But the mountain itself is magnificent: rough and rutted and craggy, like an ancient crocodile\u2019s back. The stone is warped and twisted, a frozen surge flowing toward and around the artificial faces; it is like a diagram of the geological energy that thrust it into being nearly two billion years ago. This speaks to forces much larger than America or nationalism of any kind. It made the giant heads look small.I felt a rush of emotion that was not patriotism but awe: awe at human weirdness, at our capacity to create, in the actual world, such an improbable and unnecessary artifact as this. Why had humans done this? Why did Mount Rushmore exist?\u201cOh, it\u2019s a nice little mountain thing,\u201d my son said appreciatively, and then he asked if we could leave.Outside Custer was the Crazy Horse Memorial \u2014 another granite mountain being carved, Rushmore-style, into the enormous likeness of a historic figure. This one depicted Crazy Horse, the enigmatic leader of the Oglala Sioux, one of the fiercest defenders of the Black Hills from the indignity of white invasion. It was a sort of corrective to Rushmore, a reclaiming of the landscape by the people from whom it was stolen. My family was tired and refused to get out of the car, so I walked through the museum myself. I looked at a tiny model of the monument. The carving has been in progress, without federal funding, for nearly 70 years. The finished figure would be 563 feet tall, sitting on his horse, pointing toward the Black Hills.I understood the impulse, of course, but it also struck me as strange: to honor a Native American leader in terms of Rushmore-style gigantism.And it began to seem foreign to me, our American obsession with size. We are born a fantasy of bigness. We are tall and strapping, with big hats and big hair and loud clothes and booming voices. We drive our big cars through the epic landscapes of our giant continent. We work in tall buildings, where we give 110 percent in order to build larger-than-life careers that distinguish us from the huge teeming masses of our fellows. Our great ideas define infinite eras. Our big weapons win big wars. We are economically, geographically, culturally and spiritually huge: the Gigantic States of America.There is something childish about this fantasy \u2014 the way it tends to conflate virtue and size. Why does goodness have to be huge? It is a dangerous belief, and one that inevitably causes stress and confusion when \u2014 as it must \u2014 it runs up against reality. Inevitably, there will be a shift in scale; the dominant thing (nation, culture, religion, demographic) will begin to shrink. Does it lose its virtue with its dominance? If we truly believe that, then what virtue will we not be willing to sacrifice to make ourselves feel big again?At the gift shop, I bought a length of braided sweet grass, which was said to dispel negative energy; we set it on our dashboard as we pulled away.Later, as the sun was beginning to set, we drove through the spreading wilderness of Custer State Park. We passed through huge, shaggy herds of buffalo, which raised their heads and stared. The landscape seemed to change every 500 feet: lakes, buttes, forests, gashes of red dirt. A small herd of pronghorns glided over a bluff, ghostly white on the snow. It was as beautiful as any land I\u2019ve ever seen; driving through it inspired the kind of awe that the sculptures of Rushmore had not. But then again, we never would have seen this landscape if we hadn\u2019t come to look at Rushmore.At one point, our car was besieged by a herd of burros. They surrounded us completely, forcing us to stop. We rolled our windows down. They stuck their heads in and worked their giant lips; we could see, deep inside their mouths, tiny sets of teeth clacking away in anticipation of food. It was like a horror movie, but hilarious. The burros were not native to the Black Hills: Their ancestors had been brought to the region as pack animals, then set loose, so these creatures were a result of many generations of acquired wildness. We had nothing to feed them, so they started licking our car, presumably for the salt from the roads. When we got out later, the entire vehicle was covered in thin white swirls.She pointed me to the Rushmore view, and sure enough, there it was, unobstructed. But it was so far away that you could barely see it. Binoculars hung by the window. Even magnified, the heads were tiny. Borglum made the sculptures on Mount Rushmore 80 times as large as an average human head \u2014 each one roughly the size of a sperm whale. This window shrank those heads down to the size of a pin.As the evening wore on, the view got stranger. Outside, somewhere in the wilds of the Black Hills, a fire was burning. As the sky darkened, the fire grew and grew, and from our perspective through the window, it was directly in front of Rushmore. It sent its smoke into the presidents\u2019 miniature faces, and the smoke glowed an eerie red. George Washington looked at us through the screen of a red cloud. It seemed like one of those weird meteorological events, an eclipse or a comet, that ancient cultures invested with meaning. Tiny giant America seemed to be burning.Advertisement"}

The goal, Ms. Fairfield says, is to produce visual, explanatory and investigative journalism at a time when, as today\u2019s article indicates, the calamities caused by climate change seem to be intensifying.In addition, a brigade of climate journalists, she said, will help to bring a greater degree of consistency and a centralized expertise to a subject area that is affecting more and more of the world\u2019s population.Of course, the global ramifications of climate change mean that the climate team is a prime candidate for collaborations with The Times\u2019s far-flung bureaus \u2014 which brings us back to the international dateline.Mr. Cave shipped off to his new post in early January, but not before brainstorming story ideas with members of the new climate team.\u201cBefore Damien went to Australia, we got together and looked at some opportunities to work together,\u201d Ms. Fairfield said. \u201cAnd we identified the demise of the Great Barrier Reef as a good potential story.\u201dThe plan was to produce a longer-term piece of enterprise journalism \u2014 until Mr. Cave and Justin Gillis, who reported on the story from New York, caught wind of a study (to be published today as the cover article in the journal Nature) that detailed the extent of the reef\u2019s destruction.\u201cThey quickly put their heads together,\u201d Ms. Fairfield said, \u201cand wrote a big story off the news.\u201dMany similar collaborations \u2014 enterprise and otherwise \u2014 are likely to follow, and that jibes with Ms. Fairfield\u2019s vision for The Times\u2019s climate coverage.\u201cClimate change is by definition a global story,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we want to be able to reach readers all over the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Bronx, Heroin Woes Never Went Away", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byBig CityIf the South Bronx were a state (its population of more than a half-million makes it roughly equivalent to Wyoming\u2019s) it would have the second-highest rate of drug overdose deaths \u2014 34 per 100,000 people \u2014 in the country, after West Virginia. The majority of these deaths are due to heroin, which during the past several months has arrived in New York, as it has in many other places around the country, laced with fentanyl, a painkiller typically used to treat late-stage cancer patients, and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.Most of what is getting here, said Dr. Mary T. Bassett, New York City\u2019s health commissioner, seems to come from China; since July, nearly half of all fatal drug overdoses in the city have involved fentanyl.In the Bronx, among people like Ms. McCauley who work with addicts, there is an aversion to the notion that the crisis has only recently emerged. At Boom, staff members I met with last week talked about the persistent presence of heroin in the area, a problem generally ignored by the larger world.\u201cWhen people talk about this epidemic as something new, it\u2019s not,\u201d Jos\u00e9 M. Davila, Boom\u2019s president and chairman, told me. \u201cThe opioid epidemic has been rampant here for a long time.\u201dWhat we are seeing today is a protracted living history, the residual effects of previous traumas as a generation of men and women who grew up with addicted parents now find themselves, in middle age, similarly in the thrall of heroin.Boom operates according to the principles of harm reduction; it does not aim to push everyone who walks in the door toward recovery. Instead, it offers an array of health services, including a needle exchange program and counseling about managing addiction, if handling life more effectively while using drugs is all the client can foresee. (Last year, when a spate of young women came through the door at about the same time, all pregnant, the first thing that caseworkers did was give them a baby shower.)On the afternoon I visited, some clients were seated together watching a \u201cBourne\u201d movie; nearly all were men in their 40s and 50s. In that sense, the opioid crisis in the Bronx looks as it does elsewhere in the country; a sizable number of the addicted are men who never reaped the benefits of the economy that bestowed so many riches on the well-educated over the last 20-plus years. The difference is that nearly all of the men in the room watching Matt Damon were black or Latino and had not found their way to their particular addictions through prescription painkillers, which have been the route, to a great extent, for whites. Studies show that doctors have historically prescribed fewer pain medications to blacks than whites \u2014 the result, the theory goes, of an implicit bias about the propensity to develop a habit.And yet the Bronx had the highest number of overdose deaths of any borough in 2016. Although overdose rates actually decreased for whites in the borough last year, they went up for both blacks and Latinos, who accounted for the vast number of deaths.This comes at a time, of course, when proposed cuts to drug treatment tied to the fate of the Affordable Care Act could mean a virtual obliteration of services for the poor, a situation Dr. Bassett sees as \u201ccatastrophic.\u201dThe last presidential election revealed a vast rural and urban divide in the country, and yet the opioid crisis has emerged as a ground of shared misery. The attack on it offers some hope for bipartisan healing. Can that hope be fulfilled?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Dip Bucks a Streak of Trump-Inspired Optimism", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byIt had been one of Wall Street\u2019s more confounding streaks.Until Tuesday morning, the stock market\u2019s benchmark, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, had gone 64 consecutive trading days without declining more than 1 percent at any point in a trading session.Making the streak even more remarkable, such extraordinary composure from investors had occurred in a period of political volatility as fresh controversies dogged the Trump White House and Europe braced for elections in France and elsewhere on the Continent.This optimism was tested Tuesday as the major market indicators ended down more than 1 percent, led by a sell-off in financial stocks.\u201cThere is a saying that the market makes fools of us all,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, director of research at Pension Partners, an investment advisory firm. \u201cAnd that is true here because we have been in one of the most peaceful, calm periods in the history of the stock market.\u201dThe question now is whether, after months of mostly ignoring political headlines, investors will weigh the possibility that problems with repealing the Affordable Care Act and the uproar over the Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties with Russia could weaken the president\u2019s ability to pass market-friendly laws.On Tuesday, the S.&P. 500 closed down 1.24 percent, its sharpest daily decline since October. At 161 days, it was the longest period between closing declines of 1 percent or more in the index since June 1985.In terms of intraday trading, the period without big drops in the index was the longest since 1962, beating by a wide margin the previous record of 34 days in mid-1995.For the day, the narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended down 1.14 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index finished off 1.83 percent.Large financial stocks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase led the way down on Tuesday as investors began to show concern that President Trump\u2019s daily political battles might harm his ability to push through an ambitious economic agenda. The S.&P. financials index had its biggest fall since late June, in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.The value of the dollar slipped against the euro and other major currencies.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.41 percent, generally an indication that investors were selling riskier assets and piling into safer securities like government bonds.Since November, the stock market rally has been fueled by expectations that President Trump, helped by Republican majorities in the House and the Senate, would be able to push through tax cuts, roll back regulations and kick-start a round of government-backed infrastructure spending.No signs indicate those expectations have fundamentally changed. A one-day, 1.24 percent decline three months into one of the better starts to an investment year in recent memory is no indication that a correction could be imminent, market specialists said.And many observers remain convinced that the combination of fiscal stimulus, a strong economy and low but gradually rising interest rates will remain a powerful lure for investors.\u201cThis will be the first time since the mid-1960s that the federal government may provide a positive impulse to an economy that is at full employment,\u201d said Bob Miller, a senior bond investor at BlackRock.Because interest rates are so low, a round of rate increases from the Federal Reserve is not likely to harm growth assets like stocks, Mr. Miller said.It has been precisely this type of optimistic outlook that has kept the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX \u2014 also known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge \u2014 at such historically low levels.Low volatility readings are generally seen at the end of an economic expansion as confidence, wages and markets rise in unison.Such is the case now, Mr. Bilello said, which ought to be a warning to investors that good times do not last forever.\u201cThis would be the ninth straight year that the S.&P. finishes the year higher than the year before,\u201d Mr. Bilello said. \u201cAnd if you combine that with very high valuations, it means that investors should expect more volatility going forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Undo Vehicle Rules That Curb Global Warming", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is expected to begin rolling back stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution that contributes to global warming, according to people familiar with the matter, essentially marking a U-turn to efforts to force the American auto industry to produce more electric cars.The announcement \u2014 which is expected as soon as Tuesday and will be made jointly by the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, and the transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao \u2014 will immediately start to undo one of former President Barack Obama\u2019s most significant environmental legacies.During the same week, and possibly on the same day, Mr. Trump is expected to direct Mr. Pruitt to begin the more lengthy and legally complex process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Obama\u2019s rules to cut planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants.The regulatory rollback on vehicle pollution will relax restrictions on tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and will not require action by Congress. It will also have a major effect on the United States auto industry.Under the Obama administration\u2019s vehicle fuel economy standards, American automakers were locked into nearly a decade of trying to design and build ever more sophisticated fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric and hybrid models. The nation\u2019s largest auto companies told Mr. Trump last month that they found those technical requirements too burdensome.The E.P.A. will also begin legal proceedings to revoke a waiver for California that was allowing the state to enforce the tougher tailpipe standards for its drivers.E.P.A. officials did not respond to emails requesting comment on the move.On Feb. 21, a coalition of the 17 largest companies that sell cars in the United States sent two letters to Mr. Pruitt, asking him to revisit the tailpipe rules. They said it may be \u201cthe single most important decision the E.P.A. has made in recent history.\u201dThey complained about the steep technical challenge posed by the stringent standard, noting that only about 3.5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it. That even excludes some hybrid cars, plug-in electric cars and fuel cell vehicles, the automakers wrote. \u201cEven today, no conventional vehicle today meets that target.\u201dThe automakers estimated their industry would have to spend a \u201cstaggering\u201d $200 billion between 2012 and 2025 to comply and said the tailpipe emissions rule was far more expensive for the industry than enforcing the Clean Power Plan.Former Obama administration officials and environmentalists denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s expected announcement.\u201cThe rest of the world is moving forward with electric cars. If the Trump administration goes backward, the U.S. won\u2019t be able to compete globally,\u201d said Margo T. Oge, a former senior E.P.A. official and the author of \u201cDriving the Future: Combating Climate Change With Cleaner, Smarter Cars.\u201d\u201cThis means they\u2019ll just keep polluting,\u201d said S. William Becker, the executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. He also predicted that \u201cif this administration goes after the California waiver, there will be an all-out brawl between Trump and California and the other states that will defend its program.\u201dThe tailpipe pollution regulations were among Mr. Obama\u2019s major initiatives to reduce global warming and were put forth jointly by the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department. They would have forced automakers to build passenger cars that achieve an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, compared with about 36 miles per gallon today.Eventually achieving those targets would have drastically reduced the nation\u2019s vehicle tailpipe pollution, which accounts for about a third of the United States\u2019 total greenhouse gas emissions.Those regulations are locked into place for vehicle model years through 2021, and just before Mr. Trump took office, the E.P.A. put forth a final rule intended to cement them for vehicles built from 2022 through 2025. However, the E.P.A. did not jointly release its plan to do so with the Transportation Department, leaving a legal loophole for the Trump administration to take advantage of.The E.P.A.\u2019s Clean Power Plan regulations, which would cut climate-warming pollution from power plants, will probably be much harder for Mr. Pruitt to undo. He will have to legally withdraw the existing rule and propose a new rule to replace it, a process that could take up to two years and is expected to be fraught with legal challenges and delays along the way.The effort to undo the tailpipe standards will be much more legally simple. After withdrawing the Obama administration\u2019s requirement for model years 2022 through 2025, the Trump administration will have a year to put forth an alternative set of efficiency standards, people familiar with the matter said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All Eyes on China as U.S. Signals New Tack on North Korea", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson signaled on Friday that the Trump administration was prepared to scrap nearly a decade of United States policy toward North Korea in favor of a more aggressive effort to eliminate the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Whether that means pre-emptive action, which he warned was \u201con the table,\u201d will depend a great deal on how China responds.North Korea relies on Chinese trade and aid to keep its economy afloat, and China has long been unwilling to withdraw that support. Up to 40 percent of the North\u2019s foreign currency \u2014 essential for buying goods abroad \u2014 comes from a network of about 600 Chinese companies, according to a recent study by Sayari Analytics, a Washington financial intelligence firm.The Chinese leadership is likely to bristle at such criticism, but it may be reviewing its options, given the collision course that North Korea and the United States seem to be on.Last month, Beijing showed a new willingness to punish its longtime ally when it suspended imports of North Korean coal, saying it had reached the annual limit allowed under United Nations sanctions. Customs figures later showed that China had in fact imported only about 30 percent of the quota for 2017.Yang Xiyu, a veteran Chinese diplomat involved with North Korea, said Mr. Tillerson may be able to persuade Chinese leaders to do more when he meets with them in Beijing this weekend, particularly against Chinese companies that do business with the North.Mr. Yang cited as a potential model the case that United States officials built last year against a Chinese executive accused of selling North Korea a chemical that can be used in nuclear-enrichment centrifuges. While Beijing was not happy about the case, it eventually accepted it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, but it was the right way to push the issue to a solution,\u201d he said.But Mr. Yang, who was a top negotiator for China during six-nation talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2009, suggested that those companies may now be vulnerable.If the United States continues to present evidence of illegal activities that contravene China\u2019s responsibilities under United Nations sanctions, \u201cthere is a great deal of room for cooperation,\u201d he said. He noted that China had published five executive orders, totaling more than 900 pages, listing items banned from export to North Korea.\u201cSuch activities violate China\u2019s adherence to those orders,\u201d he said.Mr. Yang added: \u201cThe United States should say, \u2018Let\u2019s extend our cooperation to implementation of the United Nations resolutions on sanctions.\u2019 They should say, \u2018Starting with the Hongxiang case, let\u2019s move forward.\u2019\u201dIn Beijing, Mr. Tillerson met with China\u2019s top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and the foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Saturday. He will see President Xi Jinping on Sunday.\u201cWe have committed ourselves to do everything we can to prevent a conflict from breaking out,\u201d Mr Tillerson said at a press conference after meeting Mr. Wang.The secretary said China and the United States \u201cwill work together\u201d to see if they could make North Korea take \u201ca course correction and move away from nuclear weapons.\u201dMr. Tillerson declined to specify the \u201cnumber of steps\u201d that would be taken to achieve that goal.Over the past quarter-century, the Chinese government has been unwilling to cripple the North Korean economy, fearing a refugee crisis or a destabilizing conflict on its border. North Korea imports virtually all of its oil from China, and cutting off the spigot could severely undermine the North Korean economy. Doing so, however, would almost certainly cause chaos in North Korea, something China fears.Round after round of economic sanctions have failed to persuade North Korea\u2019s leaders to abandon their nuclear ambitions.China has long justified its support for North Korea on humanitarian grounds, and rejected accusations that it has been unwilling to get tough on Pyongyang.But with North Korea closing in on its goal of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear payload to the United States, and the Trump administration deploying a missile defense system to South Korea that China considers a threat to its security, the Chinese leadership\u2019s calculus may be shifting.Mr. Ruggiero said the United States would be likeliest to achieve Chinese cooperation from a position of strength.In 2013, he noted, when the Treasury blacklisted North Korea\u2019s primary foreign exchange bank for contributing to the proliferation of nuclear materials, the Bank of China, one of China\u2019s major commercial banks, immediately closed its account with the North Korean outfit.Now, no major Chinese banks deal with North Korea for fear of being penalized by the United States, though smaller ones do, along with front companies operating along the North Korean border with few links to the United States financial system, according to American sanctions experts.\u201cThis is a good example of China acting to cut off North Korea\u2019s activities inside China when those actions threaten China\u2019s economic interests,\u201d Mr. Ruggierio said of the Bank of China\u2019s severance of its North Korea connections.A more recent episode that could serve as a model came last week, when the United States Department of Commerce fined ZTE, one of China\u2019s biggest technology companies, $1.19 billion for breaking sanctions and selling electronics to Iran and North Korea.But such measures are likely to have much less impact in North Korea, which is already isolated, than they did in Iran, a major trading nation, sanctions experts said.\u201cNorth Korea has one of the smallest international trade profiles on earth,\u201d said Joseph M. DeThomas, a former American ambassador who served as a State Department adviser on Iran and North Korea sanctions. \u201cNorth Korea often has to end-run the entire financial system to move money. They do things the old-fashioned way: sending guys on airplanes with suitcases full of money.\u201dBut Marcus Noland, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he believed the organized export of labor earned the North Korean government less than has often been reported \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars per year, probably less than half a billion, he said. \u201cThe next time you hear the claim of $2 billion annual earnings from the organized export of labor, remember not to believe everything you hear,\u201d he said.Far more has been contributed in foreign currency by Chinese companies doing trade across the border, said Jessica Knight, director of analysis at Sayari Analytics. \u201cCustoms data indicates more than $8 billion in cross-border trade between China and North Korea since 2013, much of it in commodities like coal and steel,\u201d she said.Whether any sanctions at all will deter the North from its nuclear pursuits is far from clear. The former United States defense secretary William J. Perry, who dealt with the North Korean problem during the Clinton administration, said on Friday in Beijing that he doubted they would.\u201cWe have sanctioned them a hundred times, and it didn\u2019t stop developing nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem to be prepared to suffer economic deprivation for the people so they can achieve the preservation of the regime, which they think that nuclear weapons is going to do for them.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting, and Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen\u2019s Message: My Work Here Is (Mostly) Done", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byMonetary PolicyThe economy will keep growing just enough to put more Americans back to work, but without overheating to generate excessive inflation. American workers will see gradual pay raises that keep compensation rising faster than inflation. Interest rates will rise gradually, while staying low by historical standards. And that\u2019s all before accounting for any major stimulative policies that may emerge from the Trump administration and Congress.That was the view of the economy sketched by the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, at her first news conference of 2017 on Wednesday. In short, the Fed believes that after nearly eight years of trying to nurse the economy back to health, its work is nearly done.The general sense of rosiness isn\u2019t really anything new \u2014 for years, Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, have forecast that the economy will steadily converge toward a Goldilocks-like state of being neither too hot nor too cold.Two things have changed. First, that day now feels imminent, with the unemployment rate at 4.7 percent and inflation closing on the 2 percent the Fed thinks best. That is a key reason the Fed raised its interest rate target Wednesday. Second, markets now believe the Fed\u2019s message that higher rates are on the way; bond markets suggest that the Fed will actually follow through with its intentions on gradual interest rate rises. You couldn\u2019t say that a year ago.\u201cThe simple message is: The economy is doing well,\u201d Ms. Yellen told reporters.The overwhelming message was of gradualism \u2014 both on the rate of economic improvement and the Fed\u2019s own efforts to wind down its era of low interest rates.She suggested no urgency toward a tightening of the money supply that might suggest a hair-trigger readiness to accelerate interest rate increases. Ms. Yellen evinced little fear that the Fed is behind the curve, suggesting that two more interest rate increases are on the way over the remainder of 2017.This will, if these plans stay in force, remain the slowest cycle of interest rate increases in modern history.The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third consecutive quarter.She also displayed little of the fear of setback that has been pervasive at the Fed for years. The central bank has spent the last eight years trying to help the recovery along with a series of monetary interventions; more than any other institution in Washington, it owns the recovery.That has also meant that the Fed has acted with haste to signs of softening. In the winter of 2016, for example, barely a year ago, the central bank backed off plans for more rate increases after a steep stock market sell-off and a rise of economic pessimism.After years of persistently undershooting its 2 percent goal for inflation, the Fed explicitly, if subtly, raised the possibility on Wednesday of erring in the other direction. The central bank\u2019s policy committee said it would be monitoring \u201cactual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201dIn this context, \u201csymmetric\u201d implies that it aims for 2 percent inflation and would be equally displeased by inflation that was too high or too low. That implies that the Fed is not inclined to overreact to the possibility that inflation could drift slightly \u2014 and in the Fed\u2019s view temporarily \u2014 above 2 percent in the coming months.After the announcement, the interest rates on Treasury bonds actually fell. That implies that markets were ready for signals of even more aggressive rate rises.And the clearest signal that the Fed is in steady-as-she-goes territory was in how Ms. Yellen talked about the possibility of new tax cuts or infrastructure spending that might arrive in the months ahead.There has been \u201cno reassessment\u201d of those odds, she said. Presumably if that happens, the Fed would indeed raise interest rates more quickly, but Ms. Yellen shows no desire to pre-emptively get ahead of what the rest of the government is doing.Given the vagueness and uncertainty around those plans, that maintains options for officials at the Fed. If policies along those lines materialize, they can plug them into their models and accelerate the pace of rate increases; if Congress is bogged down in stalemate, they won\u2019t.It has been a long time coming, and Ms. Yellen went out of her way to avoid mounting a metaphorical \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner. But in the substance of her policies, it is evident that the Fed feels it has mostly accomplished its job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Motors: A Brand Is a Terrible Thing to Waste", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBut any benefit of the $2.9 billion sale is worrisomely short-term, an unwelcome skid away from the passenger-car technology. Any gain for G.M. in selling off the divisions known for building some of its most sophisticated small- and medium-sized passenger cars is outweighed by the real hazard to the corporation\u2019s longer-term health as well as that of the world\u2019s population, who most clearly don\u2019t benefit from greater emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants associated with larger, less fuel efficient cars. Along with G.M.\u2019s decision to join other car companies that have pleaded for a rollback of pending fuel economy regulations, the sale raises the question of how much G.M. learned from previous energy crises and its 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout.But if anything seems shortsighted about the sale, it is the self-inflicted loss of passenger- and small-car engineering smarts that Opel represents. With the Trump administration\u2019s avowed intention of rolling back Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards and frontal assaults on the Environmental Protection Agency and other air-quality regulators, G.M. has seemingly forgotten all the earnest statements it made back in 2009 when it was seeking a federal bailout. Back then, it just couldn\u2019t wait to get the Chevy Volt into production, and it promised it was going to be a responsible partner in cleaning up the environment it helped pollute. Now it wants to sell more gas-guzzling Chevy Suburbans, which are so much cheaper to make and more profitable to sell than ordinary-size Chevy Cruzes and Buick Regals that, well, they just can\u2019t help themselves.The last time gas prices soared, G.M.\u2019s lack of competitive passenger cars helped, along with a failing economy, push it into bankruptcy. And giving up on Opel (whose models are rebadged as Vauxhalls for the British market) is a big step in the direction of not having competitive passenger cars. Opel is a key center of G.M. excellence, competing with high credibility in the tough German market, where cars with superior safety, economy and driving dynamics are expected, unlike in the United States and China. In Opel therefore one finds what is arguably G.M.\u2019s finest assemblage of experience, knowledge and smarts in the world of passenger and small car design. Many of today\u2019s most dynamic G.M. passenger-car offerings \u2014 its best Buick sedans, for instance \u2014 are rebadged Opels. Moreover, the loss figures claimed for Opel and Vauxhall in Europe don\u2019t account for the revenue generated by these vehicle designs worldwide when sold under G.M. nameplates.Walking out on Europe and its European workers may be a recipe for short-term profit, but in the long term it could sting. The nativist impulse to quit the world\u2019s third-largest car market may suit the mood in Washington. But as G.M. ought to know by now, it\u2019s easier fixing a brand than starting a new one.Jamie Lincoln Kitman, a lawyer, is the New York bureau chief for Automobile Magazine.Advertisement"}

Her marriage at the age of 15 to the son of a French baron set in motion a family scandal whose intricacies enthralled the novelist Stendhal.The Baron de Pontalba, enraged when he learned that his daughter-in-law\u2019s dowry was to be paid in installments and foiled in his 20-year attempt to seize her property, burst into her bedroom at the family\u2019s country estate in France in 1834, took out a pistol and shot her three times in the chest. Wounded but still alive, Micael, as she was known, led him in a chase around the house that ended when the baron, admitting defeat, turned his gun on himself.The newly minted baroness turned her hand to property development. She built the mansion on the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honor\u00e9 that is now the American Embassy.

{"Headline": "Tony Blair\u2019s Lesson for President Trump", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byIt was a passionate appeal to his country to reject its version of Trumpism. Blair said the U.K. must reconsider Brexit, the narrowly won 2016 vote to withdraw from the European Union.It is a speech worth reading because the parallels between Brexit and Trumpism are profound. At their core, both seek to undermine the big systems that have stabilized the globe and spread prosperity, security, rule of law, democracy and openness after two world wars: the European Union, the global trading system, Nafta, NATO, the United Nations and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.Brexit and Trumpism argue for abandoning or diminishing all of these in favor of an economic nationalism that will \u2014 supposedly painlessly \u2014 make Britain and America better off.Playing with these big systems is dangerous, not because they don\u2019t need improving \u2014 they do \u2014 but because many of the prescriptions \u2014 let\u2019s just put up a wall or exit \u2014 will make things so much worse for so many more people. The critics are great at pointing out the flaws of these systems, but they always forget to mention the hundreds of millions of people they lifted from poverty to prosperity and the extraordinary 70 years of peace they maintained since the end of World War II.In their place, the Brexiters and Trumpsters want to return us to a globe of everyone-for-themselves nationalisms that helped to foster two world wars. They speak of leading grand \u201cmovements.\u201d Their vow is \u201crip it, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d As Blair noted, \u201cThe one incontrovertible characteristic of politics today is its propensity for revolt.\u201dIf we choose at this time to diminish America\u2019s global leadership and these big stabilizing systems \u2014 and just put America first, thereby prompting every other country to put its own economic nationalism first \u2014 we will be making the gravest mistake we possibly could make.That was a big part of Blair\u2019s speech. Blair is unpopular in the U.K. \u2014 but that\u2019s precisely what liberated him to say what many in British politics know to be true but won\u2019t say: Brexit was a stupid idea, based on an old political fantasy of a minority of conservatives; it was sold with bogus data; and following through on it will make Britain poorer, weaker and more isolated \u2014 and Europe more unstable.\u201cThe British pound is down around 12 percent against the euro and 20 percent against the dollar since the Brexit referendum,\u201d he noted. \u201cThis is the international financial market\u2019s assessment of our future prosperity: We will be poorer. The price of imported goods in supermarkets is up, and thus so is the cost of living.\u201dThe way Blair described Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s commitment to executing Brexit \u2014 no matter what \u2014 sounded just like G.O.P. leaders\u2019 support for Trump\u2019s ideas after they had denounced them as utterly crackpot during the presidential campaign. \u201cNine months ago,\u201d Blair said of May, \u201cshe was telling us that leaving would be bad for the country, its economy, its security, and its place in the world. Today, it is apparently a \u2018once-in-a-generation opportunity\u2019 for greatness.\u201dBlair added: \u201cMay says that she wants Britain to be a great, open trading nation. Our first step in this endeavor? To leave the largest free-trade bloc in the world. She wants Britain to be a bridge between the E.U. and the U.S. Is having no foothold in Europe really the way to do that?\u201cWe are told that it is high time that our capitalism became fairer. How do we start laying the foundation for such a noble cause? By threatening Europe with a move to a low-tax, lightly regulated economy, which is the very antithesis of that cause.\u201dAnd what will future historians say about all those immigrants who came to the U.K. and were a key reason for the pro-Brexit vote, Blair asked? \u201cThat the migrants were terrible people who threatened the country\u2019s stability? No, they will find that, on the whole, the migrants were well behaved, worked hard, paid their taxes and were a net economic benefit to the country.\u201dBlair recalled other bogus arguments that were used by Brexit advocates and that have already evaporated \u2014 like the notions that leaving the E.U. would save Britain some $440 million a week for its national health care service and that there was a danger \u2014 most effectively exploited in a fear-inducing poster \u2014 that Syrian refugees would overwhelm the U.K., but there was no Syrian refugee flood.\u201cNone of this,\u201d concluded Blair, \u201cignores the challenges that stoked the anger fueling the Brexit vote: those left behind by globalization; the aftermath of the financial crisis; stagnant incomes for some families; and the pressures posed by big increases in migration, which make perfectly reasonable people anxious and then feel unheard in their anxiety.\u201dThat is true in America, too. Donald Trump is not wrong about everything. We do need to fix our trading relationship with China, which has taken advantage of some of our openness. NATO members should pay their fair share for the alliance. We can\u2019t let in every immigrant who wants to come to America. We do need to rebuild our infrastructure and enact sensible deregulation.It\u2019s what Trump believes \u2014 but is provably wrong \u2014 that scares me.Like that imports from Mexico and China \u2014 not robots, software and automation \u2014 are the big culprit in taking middle-class jobs; that we are being swamped by immigrants from Mexico, when immigration from Mexico today is really net zero (most migrants are coming from failed states in Central America, which Mexico, the second-largest source of paying tourists to our country, plays a key role in preventing); that climate change is a hoax and we should lower emission rules on coal-fired power plants to restore coal jobs and ignore the long-term health implications and the impact on better-paying clean-power jobs; that the key to restoring middle-class jobs is not by investing in people, health care, infrastructure and lifelong learning, but rather by imposing a border tax. And that the E.U., NATO, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Nafta are just outdated pillars of a global, oppressive \u201cadministrative state\u201d that needs deconstructing \u2014 rather than pillars of a liberal democratic order that have globalized our values and our rules and our standards to our great benefit.As Blair said of the E.U.: \u201cIn the long term, this is essentially an alliance of values: liberty, democracy and the rule of law. As the world changes and opens up across boundaries of nation and culture, which values will govern the 21st century? Today, for the first time in my adult life, it is not clear that the resolution of this question will be benign. Britain, because of its history, alliances and character, has a unique role to play in ensuring that it is.\u201dSo does America. But the spread of those values doesn\u2019t animate Trump. The world is a win-lose real estate market for him. In the short term, he may rack up some discrete wins. But America became as prosperous and secure as it is today by building a world in our image \u2014 not just a world where we\u2019re the only winners.Advertisement"}

Many other companies also declined to commit their executives to intervening with the president on climate-related policies.But Ms. Friedman emphasized that Mr. Immelt was outspoken, and she cited G.E.\u2019s focus on clean energy, including Current, a subsidiary that focuses on products and services in energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage to large customers.\u201cHe\u2019s pretty out there and clear,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s his position in every conversation he has.\u201dA PepsiCo spokesman, Jay Cooney, said the company believes that \u201ccombating climate change is critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers and our world.\u201d Kevin Gardner of Walmart, said its environmental commitments were \u201cembedded in our business.\u201dThomas Hushen, spokesman for Campbell Soup, said the company supported \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in the Paris agreement and the continuation of low-carbon policies and investment in a low-carbon economy.\u201d Campbell\u2019s chief executive, Denise Morrison, participates in Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory council because \u201cwe believe it is important to have a voice on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees.\u201d Mr. Hushen said.Corporations, especially those with strong consumer brands, have been increasingly responsive to customer and shareholder concerns about climate change. And the global nature of their businesses means many of their customers are in countries where there is a greater acceptance of the science behind climate change, and the need to tackle it.Walmart, Intel, General Motors and Lockheed Martin \u2014 all of which have senior executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business councils \u2014 have signed on to the principles of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofit groups working to make corporate purchases of renewable energy easier. Last year, General Motors said it would generate or procure 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050.Dell, another company with the president\u2019s ear, says it expects to reduce the energy intensity of its products by 80 percent by 2020.\u201cIn many cases, I think businesses disagree with the administration,\u201d said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder resolutions to advocate for greater corporate environmental and social responsibility.\u201cPeople still care about climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cThe administration may not, but they do have consumers and employees and reputations to uphold.\u201dAn Intel spokeswoman, Katie Lewallen, said, \u201cRegardless of regulatory changes, we intend to continue our commitment to environmental stewardship, including working to fulfill the climate change pledge we made in 2015.\u201dEnvironmentalists also worry about the influence of companies that have opposed climate regulations. General Motors and Ford, for example, successfully advocated a review of stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution.Businesses are pushing for policies to fight climate change \u201cbecause of a well-balanced economic judgment of whether or not they should,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group.He added that sentiment among corporate executives had, after the 2009 global climate conference in Copenhagen, shifted away from the belief that fighting climate change would be too expensive.\u201cIn Paris, there was a very significant number of business leaders that had changed their minds and considered that it was going to hurt the economy if we don\u2019t do something,\u201d he said.Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump vs. Congress: Now What?", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "FeatureAfter the president suffered his first defeat on Capitol Hill, can the White House still make good on its legislative promises?Supported byIt was hoped that the dinner could also establish some sort of common ground between Ryan and Bannon, the two figures who would arguably wield the greatest influence over how Trump\u2019s campaign promises became law \u2014 or didn\u2019t. Ryan was a fixture among establishment Republicans even before joining Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential ticket in 2012, his previous labors on the House Budget Committee cementing his reputation as the charts-and-graphs wizard of fiscal conservatism. Bannon, by contrast, was a renegade autodidact who read Plato and had seemingly materialized from nowhere to become the intellectual architect of Trump\u2019s campaign and, later, administration.Up to this point, Ryan had epitomized to Bannon everything that was wrong with the Republican Party. Discussing the two parties\u2019 shortcomings, Bannon later told me, \u201cWhat\u2019s that Dostoyevsky line: Happy families are all the same, but unhappy families are unhappy in their own unique ways?\u201d (He meant Tolstoy.) \u201cI think the Democrats are fundamentally afflicted with the inability to discuss and have an adult conversation about economics and jobs, because they\u2019re too consumed by identity politics. And then the Republicans, it\u2019s all this theoretical Cato Institute, Austrian economics, limited government \u2014 which just doesn\u2019t have any depth to it. They\u2019re not living in the real world.\u201dBreitbart News, the far-right media outlet Bannon ran before becoming the chief executive of the Trump campaign in August, had described Ryan, referring to his position on immigration, as \u201carguably the most pro-amnesty G.O.P. lawmaker in Congress\u201d \u2014 an apostasy of nearly impeachable proportions from Bannon\u2019s perspective. Worst of all, Ryan all but abandoned Trump during the 2016 campaign. After the leak in October of the damaging \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, Ryan told fellow Republican House members on a conference call, \u201cI am not going to defend Donald Trump \u2014 not now, not in the future.\u201d A Republican lawmaker on the call told Trump what Ryan had said, yet another reason for Bannon to regard himself as Ryan\u2019s worst enemy.But as the dinner progressed, it became clear that Bannon and Ryan actually had some ideas in common. Over memorably bad chicken Parmesan, Ryan described his vision for a \u201cborder-adjustment tax,\u201d which would levy taxes on imports while offering exemptions for exports. His tax package would include \u201cimmediate expensing,\u201d he explained, in which capital expenditures would be written off against profits in the first year rather than over time. It also would abolish the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax.These were ideas Ryan had been pushing since 2008. Now they had Bannon\u2019s attention. Taken together with a drastic reduction in corporate taxes, Bannon believed, Ryan\u2019s scheme would spur a renaissance of a manufacturing-based export economy, producing high-income labor in keeping with Trump\u2019s populism. \u201cI would actually say,\u201d Bannon remembers observing admiringly, \u201cthat this tax reform comes as close to a first step of economic nationalism as there is.\u201d\u201cI would call it \u2018responsible nationalism,\u2019\u2009\u201d Ryan said, according to Bannon.Bannon laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of folks in the Senate say this is breathtakingly radical.\u201dHe meant it as a compliment. To Bannon, the entire world order \u2014 from the two political parties to the Wall Street reliance on leveraging to multiculturalism \u2014 was undergoing an extraordinary realignment, one made manifest in the 2016 election. According to Bannon\u2019s vision, economic nationalism would reorient priorities to the working class\u2019s benefit. Trade deals, jobs programs, tax incentives, immigration restrictions, environmental deregulation and even foreign policy would ultimately serve to restore the primacy of those Trump called \u201cthe forgotten Americans.\u201dIn March, when I spoke to Trump by phone, I asked him what the term \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d meant to him. Compared with Bannon\u2019s revolutionary fervor, his reply was surprisingly cautious. \u201cWell, \u2018nationalism\u2019 \u2014 I define it as people who love the country and want it to do good,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see \u2018nationalism\u2019 as a bad word. I see it as a very positive word. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t trade with other countries.\u201dFirst, Obamacare would be repealed and replaced. Next, an austere budget would be passed, with emergency funds allotted for the construction of a wall along the Southern border. Then would come a tax-reform plan, presumably of the type Ryan and Bannon discussed. And finally, a bipartisan coalition would deliver a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Trump\u2019s desk. If all this came to pass by the end of 2017, it would lend some credence to Trump\u2019s pledge that this would be \u201cthe busiest Congress we\u2019ve had in decades.\u201d But by March, this timetable was looking like a formidable \u201cif.\u201dTrump wanted to make sure that he was given adequate credit for his achievements, even in his administration\u2019s infancy. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been here for a tiny speck of time,\u201d he said, \u201cand what I\u2019ve done with regulations, moving jobs back into the country, what I\u2019ve done with airplane pricing and buying is amazing. We\u2019ve done a lot. I think we\u2019ve done more than anybody for this short period of time.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson would take exception to this claim. And Trump\u2019s significant actions to date have consisted entirely of executive orders. What he has not yet demonstrated is his ability to actually shepherd a bill into law.But like Kushner, Bannon has never worked in government or at a policy-making institute and has no meaningful experience when it comes to getting legislation passed. On the Hill, he has a few random associations \u2014 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative John Culberson of Texas among them. Otherwise, he remains a looming but indistinct presence to the lawmakers who will be needed to pass most of Trump\u2019s agenda.Bannon\u2019s interest in this agenda predated his association with Trump. One evening in January 2013, two guests showed up for dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that Bannon liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. One was the man Bannon would later describe to me as his \u201cmentor\u201d: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. The other was Sessions\u2019s top aide and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a jittery 27-year-old named Stephen Miller.Two months earlier, Obama decisively defeated Mitt Romney in the presidential election, prompting Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to commission an analysis of the state of the party and its future, known colloquially in Washington as the \u201cautopsy,\u201d which would be delivered that spring. The only certainty was that the report would urge Republicans to court the growing Latino electorate \u2014 which had voted for Obama by a 44-point margin that November \u2014 by championing comprehensive immigration reform. The three men at the dinner table that night were among the few Republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion.These votes were gettable, Bannon believed. As he would later tell me: \u201cThe working class, and in particular the lower middle class, understands something that\u2019s so obvious \u2014 which is that they\u2019ve basically underwritten the rise of China. Their jobs, their raises, their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built China. Because China\u2019s really built on investments and exports, right? People are smart enough to know that they\u2019re getting played by both political parties. The two may be different on social issues, but when it comes to fundamental economics, they\u2019re both the same. That\u2019s why the American working class is interested in trade. It\u2019s linked to their lives.\u201dSessions shared Bannon\u2019s belief that the Republican Party needed to emphasize immigration reduction, border security and the preservation of working-class jobs through trade policy rather than courting Latino voters with a bill he regarded as \u201camnesty.\u201d As Sessions would write in a memorandum to his Republican colleagues six months later, \u201cThis humble and honest populism \u2014 in contrast to the administration\u2019s cheap demagoguery \u2014 would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party.\u201dAt some point during the five-hour dinner, Bannon recalls blurting out to Sessions, \u201cWe have to run you for president.\u201d Just two years earlier, in 2011, he made a similar pitch to Sarah Palin, after completing a documentary about her called \u201cThe Undefeated.\u201d Palin demurred. She was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth, she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by Bannon\u2019s warning that she stood little chance of defeating Obama.Now he delivered a similar message to Sessions. \u201cLook, you\u2019re not going to win,\u201d he recalls saying. \u201cBut you can get the Republican nomination. And once you control the apparatus, you can make fundamental changes. Trade is No.100 on the party\u2019s list. You can make it No.1. Immigration is No.10. We can make it No.2.\u201d Acknowledging that the drawling Alabama senator lacked Palin\u2019s charisma, Bannon said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the anti-candidate.\u201d But Sessions told Bannon he did not see himself running for president. \u201cIt was pretty obvious by the end of the night,\u201d Bannon recalled, \u201cthat another candidate would have to do it.\u201dTwo months later, on March 15, 2013, Bannon happened to be attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when Trump took the stage. Trump had been a marginal figure at most in politics up to that point, entertaining a Reform Party run in the 2000 election \u2014 when he speculated that he would probably take more votes from the Democratic candidate than the Republican one \u2014 and leading a conspiratorial crusade in 2011 to force Obama to release his birth certificate. The possibility that he might be a suitable host body for Bannon\u2019s worldview had not occurred to Bannon before Trump spoke.But Trump\u2019s grousing references to China\u2019s economic superiority, to 11 million \u201cillegals\u201d and to the erosion of America\u2019s manufacturing sector were right out of Bannon\u2019s playbook. From his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building, Stephen Miller, too, watched Trump\u2019s speech. By 2014, Miller was sending emails to friends expressing the hope that Trump would run for president. By the time Trump announced his candidacy, in June 2015, Sessions was officially uncommitted but privately of the view that Trump was best suited to tap into the movement that he, Miller and Bannon discussed over dinner more than two years earlier.Chaffetz and other House conservatives freely acknowledge that Trump is not cut from their cloth, but they say they could not care less as long as he gives them what they want. Selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia was \u201cthe best thing the president did in his first 50 days,\u201d Chaffetz told me. He and his conservative colleagues have been cheered by Trump\u2019s recruitment of former House colleagues and conservative stalwarts like Vice President Mike Pence; Tom Price, the health and human services secretary; and Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director.When Chaffetz and I spoke in March, he had met with the president twice so far \u2014 access he considered \u201csuch a huge sea change\u201d from the stony silence Republicans say they encountered from the Obama White House. Most important, the Trump agenda\u2019s first three projected legislative moves \u2014 the Obamacare repeal and replacement, an austere budget and tax reform \u2014 were intended to keep conservatives happily in Trump\u2019s camp. In turn, when the agenda moved on to less conservative items like infrastructure and trade agreements, Trump and Bannon would fully expect Republicans, including Ryan, to remember whose message resonated most with working-class voters last year.Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, is Trump\u2019s chief point of contact on the Hill. When McCarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in Bakersfield, Calif., in the late 1980s, his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, Judy, gave him an autographed copy of Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cI thought it was great,\u201d he told me. In McCarthy\u2019s view, Trump is a master of today\u2019s media, much as Lincoln and Kennedy were in their own times. \u201cHe\u2019s mastered instantaneous Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like owning newspapers.\u201dTrump has found a kindred spirit in McCarthy, a coastal extrovert of ambiguous ideological portfolio who (unlike Ryan) would far rather talk about personalities than the tax code. And as the former minority leader in the California Legislature during the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger, McCarthy is experienced in the care and feeding of celebrity egos. Since Trump\u2019s nomination, the two have spoken frequently by phone \u2014 to date, Trump has never been known to directly email or text anyone \u2014 about the cast of 535 characters with whom the president must now deal.But in the end, what Trump needs from the majority leader is not gossip but votes \u2014 216 of them, to be exact, in the House. And McCarthy\u2019s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest. In his previous capacity as House whip, he was thwarted by members of his own party when it came to subjects as diverse as reauthorizing a Patriot Act they deemed too intrusive, a farm bill they considered too expensive and a border-security bill they regarded as too lenient. His most reliable obstacles have been the three dozen or so House conservatives known as the Freedom Caucus, a two-year-old group of fiscal hard-liners. Early this year, McCarthy predicted to me that the new president would quickly subjugate the Freedom Caucus. \u201cTrump is strong in their districts,\u201d McCarthy told me. \u201cThere\u2019s not a place for them to survive in this world.\u201dWhen we spoke on the morning of March 7, Trump assured me that he would not bully the Obamacare-replacement bill\u2019s loudest Republican critics, like the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, on Twitter: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to,\u201d he said. \u201cMark Meadows is a great guy and a friend of mine. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever disappoint me, or the party. I think he\u2019s great. No, I would never call him out on Twitter. Some of the others, too. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need to. Now, they\u2019re fighting for their turf, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be obstructionists. I spoke to Mark. He\u2019s got some ideas. I think they\u2019re very positive.\u201dBut on March 21, in a meeting with the Freedom Caucus about the bill, Trump called out Meadows by name, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to come after you, but I know I won\u2019t have to, because I know you\u2019ll vote \u2018yes.\u2019\u2009\u201d Meadows remained a \u201cno\u201d on the bill, and among conservatives, he was far from alone. One of the Freedom Caucus\u2019s most outspoken members, Representative Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho, believes that the Trump White House was led astray by Ryan\u2019s confidence that he knew what conservatives wanted when drafting the bill. \u201cThe legislation has to go through the body, not the top,\u201d Labrador told me. \u201cAnd if our leadership thinks now that we\u2019re a unified body, that they can do things while ignoring us, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dLabrador is an affable but decidedly stubborn 49-year-old Mormon and former immigration lawyer who moved as a child with his single mother from Puerto Rico to Las Vegas. He was interviewed by the president-elect for the post of interior secretary at Trump Tower last December \u2014 though Trump selected Labrador\u2019s House colleague Ryan Zinke for the post a few days later.For now, Labrador and other Freedom Caucus members have been willing to blame House leaders like Ryan and McCarthy for drafting a health care bill that was not to conservatives\u2019 liking. They aspire to remain philosophical whenever Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka persuades her father to propose initiatives like paid family leave, as he did during his joint-session speech. \u201cI didn\u2019t stand up when he said that,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only part of the speech where I thought, That\u2019s not even close to what my party stands for.\u201dTo House conservatives like Labrador, the Republican Party stands for limited government. To Trump and Bannon, big-ticket items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking America\u2019s debt. As Chaffetz admitted to me, \u201cOn the spending front, things could slip away really quickly.\u201dLabrador says he would defend Trump\u2019s cuts but doubts that many of his colleagues would. \u201cWhat he\u2019s going to learn is that members of Congress are unwilling to take the tough votes,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen he learns that, what\u2019s going to be the next step?\u201d In Labrador\u2019s view, Trump\u2019s only sane recourse will be to accept the need for entitlement reform. \u201cAt some point, the reality of the budget is going to have to hit him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have this economic nationalism \u2014 Bannon is very smart, he clearly helped him with his messaging, it was so successful \u2014 but at some point, that theory is going to hit reality.\u201dWhen I spoke with Trump, I ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn\u2019t hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. Trump\u2019s reply was immediate. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. In fact, Trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. \u201cWe\u2019re also going to prime the pump,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I mean by \u2018prime the pump\u2019? In order to get this\u201d \u2014 the economy \u2014 \u201cgoing, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that\u2019ll be going, we\u2019re going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that\u2019ll happen.\u201d A clearer elucidation of Keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by Obama.The one clear point of agreement between the Trump economic nationalists and the House conservatives is the one Ryan and Bannon identified over dinner in January: tax reform. But in so doing, they will be picking a fight that may prove perilous to Republicans. The border-adjustment-tax proposal that Ryan floated to Bannon has never been able to get past K Street lobbyists and wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers.When I asked Trump if he was a fan of the border-adjustment tax, he replied: \u201cI am. I\u2019m the king of that.\u201d Almost no other country grafts an import tax onto a corporate tax, and it\u2019s possible that enacting a border-adjustment tax might well be in violation of the World Trade Organization\u2019s agreements. Of course, Bannon has openly advocated abandoning the W.T.O. anyway, because of China\u2019s membership in it. Still, the specter of new taxes on American corporations, higher prices for consumers and a jump in the dollar\u2019s value may compel an unusual confederacy against the tax-reform plan.Perhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon\u2019s economic nationalism is Washington\u2019s military hawks. John McCain is among those not mollified by Trump\u2019s pledge of enacting \u201cone of the largest increases in national-defense spending in American history.\u201d McCain scoffed when I brought this up to him. \u201cOf course that\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at 1981 and Reagan\u2019s commitment to rebuilding the military, there\u2019s no comparison to this 3 percent increase. It\u2019s a shell game, my friend.\u201dDespite his obvious differences with Trump, McCain was willing to work with him \u2014 but Bannon\u2019s presence seemed to confound such prospects. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting,\u201d McCain said, \u201cbecause I have decades of experience with Kelly, with Mattis, with Dan Coats, McMaster,\u201d referring to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly; Defense Secretary James Mattis; Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence; and H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. \u201cWe discuss issues all the time. I think this is probably the finest national-security team that I\u2019ve ever observed. It\u2019s almost schizophrenic, in that I obviously don\u2019t have conversations with Steve Bannon, but I do with Reince Priebus \u2014 he was my Republican chair in Wisconsin in my 2008 presidential campaign. So it\u2019s almost a schizophrenic \u2014 that\u2019s not the right word. A very divided kind of relationship. Paradoxical.\u201dEarly in the afternoon of Feb. 9, several Democratic senators met with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss the Gorsuch nomination and other matters. Among them were Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. All four are moderates who are up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump carried in 2016 by titanic margins \u2014 the least of which, in Donnelly\u2019s state, was nearly 20 points. If Democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the Senate majority, they will need to hold these four seats.But if Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin and Tester need to be seen back home as willing to work with Trump, the president needs them as well. Republicans enjoy a precarious 52-to-48 advantage in the Senate. On matters like the Supreme Court, Trump can count on all 52. On votes requiring a simple majority, any two of those Republicans could fall away, and Pence could preserve the win with a tiebreaking vote. But a trio of fiscal hard-liners (like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Mike Lee), military hawks (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio) or social moderates (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito) could deny Trump a majority, unless he could swing at least one Democrat to his side.The words were scarcely out of Donnelly\u2019s mouth before Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent for that, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to help get it passed.\u201d He then asked Pence, who was in the room, \u201cWhat do you think, Mike?\u201d Trump was apparently unaware that Pence, as the governor of Donnelly\u2019s state, had refused to back the senator\u2019s initiative, claiming instead that burdensome federal regulations were to blame for outsourcing. According to Donnelly, Pence gamely replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s like what Joe describes, I\u2019ll do everything I can to help.\u201dDonnelly, a thick-handed Irish Catholic with a barroom guffaw, had met Trump once before. In January 2011, he was among the so-called Blue Dog Coalition, composed of conservative House Democrats \u2014 what remained of them, anyway, after the previous November\u2019s disastrous midterms \u2014 who traveled to New York for their annual retreat. At a hotel conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the 20 or so Blue Dogs received a procession of guests, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton. Only one of their scheduled appointments required that they go to their guest \u2014 and so they did, by bus, to Trump Tower.Trump greeted them in his boardroom, with its commanding view of Central Park. He was charming but also brash. \u201cRemember, at that point he wasn\u2019t really talking about running for office,\u201d recalls one attendee, former Representative Dan Boren of Oklahoma. \u201cBut what strikes me was how he talked about the same issues \u2014 the wall, China \u2014 that became his stump speech years later.\u201dIt was evident to the Blue Dogs that Trump was no Clinton or Bloomberg when it came to the issues. Says former Representative Ben Chandler of Kentucky, who was also in attendance: \u201cThe difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark. Trump just made bald assertions, really.\u201d Particularly memorable to Chandler was Trump\u2019s insistence \u201cthat one of the best things the country could do was slap a massive tariff on the Chinese.\u201d Chandler continued: \u201cHe seemed not to understand that this would probably cause the entire world economy to melt down by causing a huge trade war. What I remember more than anything else was our general reaction afterward. And it was one of disbelief.\u201dToday Donnelly remains offended by what he calls Trump\u2019s \u201ccrazy stuff,\u201d as well as the alternative to Obamacare that Trump supported. But he does not begrudge Trump his showmanship. \u201cHe came to the Carrier plant,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on that issue since Day 1. I was begging people in the Obama administration to come out and talk to our workers. Donald Trump came out there. And Donald Trump talked to our workers. You can tell people you care. But it matters if you show up.\u201dThe Senate Democrat who, to outward appearances, seems closest to Trump is Joe Manchin, who met face to face with the president-elect in Trump Tower in December. Before the meeting, Bannon took the West Virginia senator aside. \u201cThe thing you need to know about Trump,\u201d Bannon said, \u201cis he doesn\u2019t care about the Republican Party and he doesn\u2019t care about the Democratic Party. He just wants to put some wins on the board for the country.\u201d In the meeting, Trump asked Manchin what could be done for coal miners. Manchin replied that he should support his Miners Protection Act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. According to Manchin, Trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure.Later that month, Manchin went on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d \u2014 the one show on MSNBC that Trump has been known to watch \u2014 to discuss, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Newtown school massacre, the need to expand background checks on gun purchases. Within an hour after Manchin was offscreen, his cellphone rang. It was Trump. Manchin was not completely forthcoming about the conversation, but he did tell me that he envisioned \u201ca complete opportunity\u201d for new gun-safety legislation. Unlike with Obama, he said, \u201cno one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights.\u201dIn his conversations with Manchin and Donnelly, Trump was essentially throwing his support behind a Democratic initiative without first checking with the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to ask what he thought of those proposals. Had he done so, the answer in each case would have been: not much. (Though on the coal miners\u2019 legislation, Manchin said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing Mitch McConnell go from a \u2018No, no and hell no\u2019 to now dropping his own bill. Which is fine, so long as we get it.\u201d) Still, Trump may have little choice but to indulge Democrats on some of their pet issues, given that he will need their votes on two of the most critical pieces of his agenda: infrastructure and trade deals.Until now, Trump has divulged few details about this trillion-dollar infrastructure venture. On the campaign trail, he frequently cited America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges. He bemoaned the potholes defiling the runways at La Guardia Airport, where he parked his two planes. During Donnelly\u2019s visit with Trump in the Roosevelt Room, the president \u201ctalked about the Queens-Midtown Tunnel with the tiles falling off, which he would see on his way to La Guardia,\u201d Donnelly recalled. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel.)When I asked Trump for more specifics, he gingerly offered a few morsels: \u201cThis is something that\u2019s going to be a real infrastructure bill, where real work is going to be done on bridges and roads and airports and things that we\u2019re supposed to be doing. So it\u2019s not just a political piece of paper. We\u2019re going to do infrastructure, and it\u2019s going to be a very big thing.\u201dTrump\u2019s description struck me as uncharacteristically modest. Bannon had evoked a more gleaming vision when he told me: \u201cLook, economic nationalism is predicated on a state-of-the-art infrastructure for the country, right? Broadband as good as Korea. Airports as good as China. Roads as good as Germany. A rail system as good as France. If you\u2019re going to be a world-class power, you\u2019ve got to have a world-class infrastructure.\u201dWhen I asked the president if his initiative might include such features, he replied: \u201cYes. It could, it could. You look at Japan and China, where they have the fast trains, and we don\u2019t have any. You look at other countries where we used to be the leader, and now we\u2019re the laggard. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore.\u201dWhat also may not happen is House Republicans\u2019 supporting a trillion-dollar bill that is at least somewhat reminiscent of the stimulus bill they unanimously opposed eight years ago. It\u2019s also possible that even moderate Democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to Trump\u2019s rescue. After all, the president remains intensely unpopular among Democrats, who continue to nurture hopes that Trump is one Russia connection away from impeachment. As a senior White House official told me of Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court: \u201cThe comment we often get from Democrats is, \u2018That\u2019s a great nominee.\u2019 Oh, so you\u2019re voting for him? \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 Why not? \u2018My base would go crazy, and I\u2019d be primaried.\u2019 That environment has to change before we can have any of these conversations.\u201dTrump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors. The press pool was then ushered out before the Democrats could say anything in front of the cameras. When Neal was given a chance to speak, he informed Trump, Pence, Bannon, Kushner and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that America had in fact prospered as a result of past trade deals. Neal emphasized the crucial role that the Panama Canal played in the economic vitality of the Eastern Seaboard. Other than Ross, no one on Trump\u2019s team seemed aware of this. \u201cThey were a bit surprised,\u201d Neal later told me. He was also struck by the White House\u2019s abhorrence of multilateral pacts, which seemed to him to be na\u00efve. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to negotiate 148 bilateral agreements with W.T.O. members does not seem realistic,\u201d Neal said. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re all of a sudden going to have a free-trade agreement with Great Britain, that\u2019s going to take years to do.\u201d Later, Neal said, Ross privately assured him that the Trump administration \u201cwould not give up on multilateral deals.\u201dNeal\u2019s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of Trump and Bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric. Of all the legislative lifts, none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements, which require a simple majority approval by both the Senate and the House. Scrounging up 15 Democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 Republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue. But just as Democrats like Neal in the Northeast would fight for a trade deal that benefits their region, so will Republican lawmakers along the Southern border rebel at an effort to repeal Nafta. As McCain told me, \u201cIf you negated Nafta, it would send my state into a severe recession.\u201d He assured me that Trump\u2019s nationalist posture would not provoke only regional opposition. He conjured up another Republican era \u2014 not Reagan\u2019s, not Bush\u2019s, but instead that of Herbert Hoover, when two Republican lawmakers joined with a Republican president to design a protectionist initiative that ultimately caused American exports to plummet during the Great Depression. \u201cSomewhere,\u201d McCain said with a dark chuckle, \u201cMr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley are smiling.\u201dWith customary bravado, Trump told the conservative members that he didn\u2019t want to squeak by with just a one-vote victory. \u201cI want all 237 of you,\u201d he said, according to Duncan, referring to the entire House Republican conference. That included the more moderate members, who had told Trump they felt that the White House wasn\u2019t paying sufficient attention to their concerns. Later in the day, Trump hosted another meeting with the moderates, where Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania informed Trump that he remained a \u201cno.\u201d According to an attendee, Trump angrily informed Dent that he was \u201cdestroying the Republican Party\u201d and \u201cwas going to take down tax reform \u2014 and I\u2019m going to blame you.\u201dUntil that day, Duncan had been an unyielding \u201cno\u201d on the bill. The previous week, he delivered an impassioned speech to the vice president and other Republicans, insisting that this vote constituted \u201cour generation\u2019s rendezvous with destiny \u2014 a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal Obamacare.\u201d In a text to me, Duncan pointed to history: \u201c39 men in a hot room in 1787 had the courage to break from the norm and empower a nation.\u201dBut now the four-term congressman was, for the first time in his life, sitting across the table from a president who was personally appealing for his support. The White House was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing. Duncan left the meeting and spent a few hours pondering, as he would later put it, \u201cthe greater opportunity we as Republicans have.\u201d By that evening, Trump had won Jeff Duncan\u2019s vote.\u201cYou get about nine months to do the big things,\u201d Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, told me at the beginning of the year. Nine months seemed like a long time then, the calendar spacious and the legislative deal-making possibilities plentiful. But more than two of those months are gone already \u2014 and the path to future wins, as Trump foresaw in his meeting with the Freedom Caucus, is now more complicated. When he took office, Trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the White House. By the time I spoke with him in early March, however, he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers. He still saw himself as the closer in chief \u2014 but then that was \u201ctypical, I would think, of a president,\u201d he mused. \u201cSome more than others.\u201dAn article on April 2 about President Trump and Congress described incorrectly the legislative process of renegotiating trade agreements. A simple majority approval by both the Senate and the House \u2014 not two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 is needed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Park Geun-hye, South Korea\u2019s Ousted Leader, Is Arrested and Jailed to Await Trial", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byA judge at the Seoul Central District Court issued the warrant early Friday morning, warning that if Ms. Park were not taken into custody quickly she might \u201cdestroy evidence.\u201d The charges against her include bribery, extortion and abuse of power.In December, the National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to impeach Ms. Park, and she was formally removed from office on March 10.Moon Jae-in, the liberal opposition leader considered most likely to win the May 9 election to select a new president, has vowed to review that decision, as well as an unpopular deal she struck with Japan over the so-called comfort women, or Korean sex slaves, used by Japan\u2019s army during World War II.Mr. Moon is also viewed as less confrontational toward North Korea and China, and has advocated dialogue to halt the North\u2019s nuclear and missile threats.Ms. Park had spent the night in the prosecutor\u2019s office waiting to learn if she would be placed under arrest. Shortly after 3 a.m., Judge Kang Bu-young issued the warrant and Ms. Park was taken to a jail outside Seoul, the South Korean capital.Prosecutors had already said that they would indict the former president on 13 criminal charges regardless of whether the judge issued an arrest warrant. Once her trial begins in the coming weeks, Ms. Park will commute from her cell to a Seoul courthouse.On Thursday, hundreds of emotional supporters were gathered near her two-story, red brick house in southern Seoul as her motorcade pulled out for the hearing. Some tried to push past police officers lining the road.\u201cWe can\u2019t let you go!\u201d they shouted, some of them trying to hurl themselves onto the road. Protesters also threw yellow plastic police fences at uniformed officers who tried to push them back.The 10-minute ride was nationally televised, with a fleet of television crews following her car.If she is convicted of bribery, Ms. Park, 65, could face between 10 years and life in prison, although her successor has the power to free her with a special presidential pardon.Ms. Park\u2019s arrest added another tragic chapter to the story of her family, which has mirrored the country\u2019s tumultuous modern history.Her father, Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979, was considered the initiator of the country\u2019s dramatic economic growth but was also vilified as a dictator who used martial law and torture to silence dissidents.In 1974, her mother, Yuk Young-soo, was fatally shot by a pro-North Korean assassin who had targeted her husband. Ms. Park\u2019s father was assassinated five years later by his spy chief.After leaving the presidential Blue House, Ms. Park lived in seclusion, unmarried and without children. In the succeeding decades, while the country moved toward democracy, her family drew little attention.Then in the late 1990s, as the economy faltered in the financial spasms that engulfed Asia, and South Koreans began yearning for the kind of charismatic and stern leadership her father represented, Ms. Park was catapulted into political stardom.She seized the opportunity and won a parliamentary seat in 1998, casting herself as a faithful daughter on a mission to rebuild the nation and restore the honor of her father and his generation, whom she credited with fighting Communism and creating a vibrant, world-class economy from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War.In 2013, she returned to the Blue House, her childhood home, after winning the presidential election. She was the first child of a former president to win the presidency.Older South Koreans were among her most fervent supporters, while critics warned that she was trying to take the country back to its authoritarian past.Four years later, her career ended in disgrace. In a speech last November, as the growing scandal paralyzed her government, she tearfully confided that she regretted ever becoming president.While a majority of South Koreans believe her ouster was merited, Ms. Park\u2019s fall from grace has been hard to accept for many older, conservative South Koreans who still worshiped her father and family as Koreans once did their ancient kings.Last fall, local news media and former associates of Ms. Choi\u2019s began exposing lurid details of Ms. Park\u2019s alleged conspiracy to abuse her presidential authority to help Ms. Choi, one of her few friends, to collect bribes or extort large \u201cdonations\u201d from big businesses.Ms. Park was the first South Korean leader to be forced from office in response to popular pressure since the country\u2019s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960 after protests against his corrupt, authoritarian rule.Mr. Chun was sentenced to life in prison while Mr. Roh was sentenced to 17 years. Both were pardoned and released in December 1997.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the arrest of Park Geun-hye, the recently impeached president of South Korea, erroneously attributed a distinction to Ms. Park at one point. She is not the first South Korean leader to be jailed since the country\u2019s transition to democracy; as noted elsewhere in the article, two former military dictators, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, were arrested in 1995.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Health Bill Faces Revolt From Conservative Forces", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After seven years of waiting longingly to annul President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, Republican leaders on Tuesday faced a sudden revolt from the right that threatened their proposal to remake the American health care system.The criticism came even before lawmakers knew the cost of the replacement plan and how many people might lose their health care if it were enacted.House Republicans were rushing the legislation through two powerful committees \u2014 Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce \u2014 with the hope of a full House vote next week, an extraordinarily compressed time frame considering that the legislation affects many parts of the United States economy and could alter the health care of millions of Americans.A comparison of the House Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare and the current law.But the swift opposition from fellow Republicans signaled that they might have to drastically reconsider their approach, and the White House portrayed the bill as a work in progress. If more than a dozen House Republicans defect, the bill will be in jeopardy, with Democrats almost certainly united as a bloc.\u201cDoing big things is never easy,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan conceded at a news conference on Tuesday after absorbing broad-based criticism of the bill. Still, he guaranteed he would drum up the 218 votes needed for passage, saying, \u201cThe nightmare of Obamacare is about to end.\u201dVice President Mike Pence met Tuesday with conservative members of the House to assure them that their feedback was still being considered, and President Trump entertained a group of House Republicans charged with persuading their colleagues to vote for the measure.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do something that\u2019s great, and I am proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis will be a plan where you can choose your doctor, and this will be a plan where you can choose your plan. And you know what the plan is. This is the plan. It\u2019s a complicated process, but actually it\u2019s very simple, it\u2019s called good health care.\u201dSome White House officials insist that Mr. Trump will be directly engaged in persuading lawmakers to back the bill.But many of the factions that provided financial and political support to back Republicans who vowed to wipe out the Affordable Care Act are nowhere near satisfied with the option rolled out on Monday.The Republican bill would scrap the mandated coverage in the Affordable Care Act in favor of tax incentives to coax people to purchase health care. But the legislation maintains many of the act\u2019s mandates and basic benefits, including prohibiting insurers from denying policies for pre-existing conditions or capping benefits in a year or a lifetime.Some conservatives have labeled the House plan \u201cObamacare lite,\u201d saying it is nearly as intrusive in the insurance market as the law it would replace. In particular, they dislike the delay in getting rid of the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. They also dislike the tax credits in the Republican plan, which can exceed the amount a consumer actually owes in federal income taxes, meaning that the Internal Revenue Service would be issuing checks to cover insurance premiums. The House plan also maintains many of the demands on insurers that the Affordable Care Act has, including a defined suite of \u201cessential benefits\u201d that all insurers must offer.Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said that he would introduce a \u201cclean repeal\u201d bill and that Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, would offer a companion bill.Republicans have been counting on Mr. Trump to use his influence to persuade wavering members to support the plan. But despite his characterization of the bill as \u201ctremendous\u201d on Tuesday, others in his administration seemed to concede that changes, perhaps major ones, were likely.Speaking to reporters after meeting with Senate Republicans at the Capitol, Mr. Pence offered the White House\u2019s imprimatur, calling the bill the \u201cframework for reform.\u201d He added that the administration was \u201ccertainly open to improvements,\u201d making clear that the wrangling had just begun. Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said twice at a briefing with reporters at the White House that the bill was \u201ca work in progress.\u201dHe also suggested that some provisions Mr. Trump is seeking, like the ability to buy insurance across state lines and the lowering of drug prices, might be addressed through regulation.Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, said Mr. Pence had portrayed the bill as a work in progress that would no doubt be amended, perhaps significantly. \u201cThe bill that was introduced last night is still open for negotiation and certainly for modification,\u201d Mr. Meadows said. \u201cAnd we took that as very encouraging news.\u201dThe response from insurers was largely muted on Tuesday. They have praised the initial steps taken by the administration to stabilize the individual market, and they said they were encouraged by the desire to provide a smooth transition in the next two years. But several questioned the adequacy of the tax credits.\u201cIt is important that the tax credit for 2020 creates a marketplace that enables people to get the coverage they need at a price they can afford,\u201d Alissa Fox, a senior vice president at the BlueCross BlueShield Association, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to working with Congress to create a stable and affordable private market.\u201dBy proceeding so swiftly, and largely in secret, Republicans have opened themselves to the same criticisms that they leveled at Democrats in 2010. If the bill is passed by the full House as early as next week, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has promised to bring it immediately to the Senate floor without a single hearing.\u201cAfter years of howling at the moon about Democrats rushing through the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the mantra they said over and over and over again on the floor here and in the House, \u2018read the bill\u2019 \u2014 Republicans are having committee votes two days after the bill is released,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor. \u201cNo wonder they don\u2019t want anyone to know what\u2019s in the bill.\u201dThomas Kaplan and Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from Washington, and Reed Abelson from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Broader View\u2019 vs. \u2018An Invasion\u2019: Dutch Voters Speak Out on Immigration", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byKhalid Nabil, 28, is a translator who lives in the northern town of Heerhugowaard. He is a third-generation descendant of immigrants in the 1960s.My hope is that one day immigrants are as welcome as they were in the \u201960s, \u201970s when they were needed. And that the problems, which I am not ignoring, are not looked upon with an eye of fear and segregation, but with sincere interest in the cause of the issues. My concerns are that the once so tolerant Netherlands will turn into a frightened right-wing country that is beyond recognition._____Goda Choi, 37, is an internist and hematologist in Haarlem, originally from Seoul, South Korea. As a Korean immigrant, I grew up in the Netherlands in the 1980s. I went to a multiethnic elementary school with children from all backgrounds, including Suriname, the Antilles, Turkey and Morocco. We all spoke Dutch, cheered for the national football team winning the European Championship in 1988, and at school we were allowed to share anything that made our culture special. We celebrated Easter and Christmas, but always with delicious treats from all over the world. One threat did make me anxious as a child: I was kept in a slight fear that all immigrants would be deported if the far-right political party Centrum Democraten would gain control of government._____I\u2019m a white Dutch woman and I married a Dutch man of Turkish descent. When I tell people about him, they often act surprised and ask me how his family responded. The assumption is that Dutch people are tolerant, but that Turkish or Muslim people are not. I have never experienced suspicion from my family-in-law. Ironically, the suspicion and the prejudice I do encounter are expressed by white Dutch people._____Inge van Leipsig, 41, is a social worker in Rotterdam. She said that immigration had given her \u201ca broader view of the world.\u201dI can\u2019t picture my life without Lebanese cuisine, ras-el-hanout, tzatziki, pho or banh mi. It is a great thing to be able to walk out the door and find Turkish, Moroccan and Indian shops around the corner. Immigration has given me the opportunity to learn more about other cultures and religions, and I have enjoyed that a lot.Stefan Schenk, 25, is a student who lives in Andijk. It\u2019s not immigration, it\u2019s an invasion. If it\u2019s not stopped, violence will take over peaceful democratic solutions. I swung from left to right. Geert Wilders will be the only viable candidate._____Henk Biesheuvel, 47, from Vierpolders, works in maritime shipping. He said he feared an \u201cIslamic wave\u201d taking over the country.We\u2019ve welcomed immigrants since the 1950s or so. They did the jobs that we refused to do. That was the first generation, and I think we are now at the fourth generation. They gave hardly any problems. What does pose a big problem is the forced immigration, laid upon us by the E.U., of refugees. It causes turmoil and uncertainty and we can\u2019t seem to find a 100 percent proven method to filter out the bad guys and to make sure that only the worst cases (those who need our support the most) are allowed to stay with us._____Aldo de Beunje, 45, works in information technology in Tilburg. He wants to welcome refugees but believes that some groups are more criminal than others, and that those taking advantage of the system should be sent back.Some Muslim people have no respect for our values (towards women, gay people, abortion, etc.). This is something we have fought for over the years. If you come to the Netherlands, you accept this. Or leave. We like to hang on to our values. Also, crime needs to be addressed. I would never have thought that I would seriously consider voting for Wilders. But I am.Thijs de Boer, 22, is a student in The Hague. He said that living in a majority-immigrant neighborhood had made him more tolerant toward immigration.I shamefully have to admit that when I lived in a village I liked P.V.V.\u2019s thoughts and ideals, while I never came in contact with immigrants. Some of my friends back there like the P.V.V., and it\u2019s hard to relate to them. All I can say is just talk to people before you create a negative opinion about them. It helped me a lot!Lian Priemus, 51, is a television director in Amsterdam. She spent most of last year running a small refugee shelter. Some of the refugees, she said, had become real friends. But she remained worried about their integration.In my opinion, we \u2014 as a free, democratic society \u2014 can handle all this, but it takes much more time and effort than we and our governments realize. And maybe more than some of us want to admit. But I believe denying the problems and doubts is the wrong solution. If we do so, we push people with concerns away from us and push them to the far right._____Ren\u00e9e Blanken-Verstraten, 66, is a retired bank employee in Rotterdam. My concerns are that terrorists travel along with people who are victims of the war. These victims are of course most welcome here. If the immigrants are willing to assimilate, our society might become more interesting. One can always learn from other people\u2019s customs, culture, kitchen and religion.I feel misrepresented by the political system that has turned into a popularity contest when discussing sensitive and highly complex issues such as immigration. Immigration itself has not changed my sense of Dutch identity, but the public debate and direction in which we are headed certainly has made me feel less proud of my country.Jasper Stel, 29, lives in Groningen and works as a financial adviser. He said that the economy and climate issues played a larger part in his political choices than immigration. The response below is translated from the Dutch.Everything that\u2019s not going well in our (very prosperous) society is blamed on immigration, and indirectly on the E.U. as well. When I look around me, I don\u2019t see any changes compared to a few years back. And that while immigration increased and emigration decreased, year after year. This may not be the sensational story you are looking for. But believe me when I say that the majority of Dutch people are not troubled by immigrants. The only thing that changed is that they\u2019ve become the \u201cnew\u201d scapegoat of politics._____Eva Bezem, 30, spent her childhood in Flanders, which she described as right-wing and conservative. Today she is an immigration lawyer in Amsterdam. I help women who are victims of domestic violence, often of Moroccan nationality, and who are dependent on their husband for their Dutch residence rights. They have been kept in their Dutch houses for years without learning anything of the culture or language. Many of them are my age, and they cannot wait to start studying Dutch, and have their own life. They will integrate successfully after deciding to start on their own.When I go back to the south of the Netherlands or Flanders, I do not have the impression that people consider my work a positive influence on society \u2014 moreover, they will more likely bring up the whole discussion on fear for terrorists and/or criminals. However, when I explain an individual case of a family of migrants and what they have been through, people will understand and sympathize. It seems more the fear of the unknown.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Pope the Anti-Trump?", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byOpinionONE emerged from a crisis conclave, the other was elected after the strangest campaign in recent American history. Both have upended traditions and reached outside the usual channels to speak to the concerns of ordinary people. Donald J. Trump and Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the president and the pope, are the world\u2019s most famous populists. But they are in conflict.To grasp why Pope Francis has become the flag-bearer of the global anti-Trump resistance, consider his Feb. 17 appearance at a university campus in Rome, where one of the students who asked him a question was a Syrian woman, Nour Essa. The pope knew her well. Hers was one of three families, all Muslim, he had brought back with him on the return flight from his visit to a refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece. He has helped dozens of refugees make new lives in Italy. Two families live in the Vatican itself, whose high walls and fortress features are these days at odds with the border-dissolving pope within.In the courtyard of the university, Roma Tre, where Ms. Essa has won a scholarship to study biology, she asked Francis to respond to Europeans who believe migrants threaten the continent\u2019s Christian culture. Migration, he told her, is not a danger but a challenge, a spur to growth that has expanded Europe\u2019s culture, not weakened it.\u201cWhen there is this welcoming, accompaniment, integration, there\u2019s no danger with immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cA culture is received and another offered. This is my response to fear.\u201dThe pope\u2019s populism is not intended for popularity \u2014 a fickle thing, and anyhow, his soars far above any politician\u2019s \u2014 but proximity. This is a pope who likes to come in close.As Europe\u2019s borders stiffen and nativist movements gain footholds in elections, such bold assertions of universal humanity, backed by action, have made Francis a bridge maker in an age of wall building. In part because he anticipated the current political crisis long before it happened, his Greek-chorus commentary on the upheavals matters.\u201cIn moments of crisis, discernment doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he told the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds in January, around the time of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cDiscernment\u201d is an important word for the pope; it is key to his Jesuit spirituality. He meant in this case the capacity to detect the \u201cspiritual motions\u201d \u2014 the presence of good and evil \u2014 in events. In times of crisis, that capacity disappears, and projection, scapegoating and hysteria take over. Francis gave the example of Hitler, pointing out that he was elected by his people and then destroyed them.Populist politicians, the pope said, promise to \u201cgive us back our identity and defend us with walls, with wires.\u201d In a letter to Modesto, Calif., community organizers in February, he deplored political leaders who rely on \u201cfear, insecurity, quarrels and even people\u2019s justified indignation, in order to shift the responsibility for all these ills on to a \u2018non-neighbor.\u2019 \u201dPope Francis and President Trump provide rich material for contrast. One is, notwithstanding his weaknesses, a spiritual leader of extraordinary maturity; the other, his strengths aside, is a thin-skinned, petulant narcissist. One is a celibate who lives in simplicity and austerity, embracing the disabled and the diseased; the other is a thrice-married germophobe who lived in a gaudy gold tower and mocks the feeble.And yet: The world\u2019s two most compelling populists have more in common than some might admit. Take, for example, their extraordinary capacity for connection, bypassing traditional methods; their defiance of convention, even their iconoclasm; or their delight in challenging existing elites on behalf of the people. Both seem energized by opposition, even if they respond to it differently \u2014 Mr. Trump by ranting and belittling his critics; Francis never directly, but gently, in pointed asides.Politically, too, they share a beef with globalism. Both, in the broadest sense, are nationalists. When Stephen K. Bannon, the White House chief strategist, says the United States is \u201cnot an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders\u201d but rather \u201ca nation with a culture and a reason for being,\u201d he says nothing Francis has not expressed often.The pope is no mere liberal. Born in Argentina, he was shaped by a movement of Catholic continental nationalism that saw social justice and economic sovereignty as key to a better future for Latin America. He grew up under and was unquestionably influenced by Peronism, a communal movement that in the 1940s and 1950s galvanized working-class and lower-middle-class support against the liberal establishment of the day, rooting its politics in the religious and nationalist values of ordinary Argentines. Although he later descended into autocracy, Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n at his early best embodied what Francis sees as the purpose of statecraft: He created work, integrated the excluded (Per\u00f3n gave women the vote), and built consensus around core values.Throughout his papacy, Francis has criticized the lack of that higher purpose in the technocratic liberal administrations of Europe and the Americas that have dominated since the 1980s. He deplores the way political principles have been replaced by market logic and how governments have failed to defend the interests and values of ordinary people. Speaking to Jesuits in Rome last October, he lamented the loss of \u201cbig politics,\u201d the craft of making unity out of diversity and creating what he calls a \u201cculture of encounter,\u201d a society that integrates everyone \u2014 rather than a \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d in which the poor and the unwanted are cast off.This puts the pope at odds with Trumpism in myriad ways. His encyclical on the environment, \u201cLaudato Si\u2019,\u201d contains a hard-hitting indictment of a politics consumed by immediate results and of the way governments pander to the electorate to the detriment of its long-term interests. In it, he deplores the capture of politics by economics, and politicians who glibly promise ever more growth even as current models of consumption and production are destroying the planet. It is fierce stuff, the fruit of a mind that has spent decades engaged in these questions.With the students at Roma Tre, he applied the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s famous concept of \u201cliquid modernity\u201d to the economy of the West. Why do developed countries have such high levels of youth unemployment? he asked, adding that the \u201cliquid economy\u201d leads jobless young people into addiction, suicide or terrorism. Against this metaphor of liquidity, he posits a \u201csocial economy\u201d that invests in people and opens access to ownership and opportunity by spreading work.Equally deplorable to Francis is the liquid society, in which family and community bonds are hollowed out by me-first ideologies. Francis, like many popes before him, wants a vigorous civil society that holds both state and market to account.Because both pope and president are critics of a neoliberal globalism that weakens local ties and benefits educated elites at the expense of the common man, the diametrical opposition of their visions is all the more striking.The Trump-Bannon response is to chafe at the wounds of popular resentment, promising to relieve it by building walls, raising tariffs, shutting out migrants and dismantling the state to release the energies of popular capitalism. They underpin this plan with a commitment to nurture and promote a culture that is defined as white and Christian, framing globalist media elites as \u201cenemies of the American people,\u201d and Muslims and other foreigners as potential terrorists who dilute or threaten that culture.Francis sees the surging tide of jobless and migrants as part of the same global crisis produced by dehumanizing capitalism. When he speaks to workers, he asks them not to see migrants as threats or rivals, but as fellow victims of the liquid economy, and to make common cause.And he helps them act. Quietly, Francis has over the last four years been supporting and guiding a global association of \u201cexcluded workers\u201d like garbage pickers and migrant laborers, acting as their visible leader. At the gatherings of these \u201cpopular movements\u2019\u201d \u2014 two at the Vatican, one in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and recently in Modesto \u2014 he continually stresses that deep and lasting change will come when those on the margins unite, creating strong social institutions that deepen the bonds of trust and solidarity.\u201cMany people are hoping for a change capable of releasing them from the bondage of individualism and the despondency it spawns,\u201d he told the attendees of the second meeting, in Bolivia in 2015.\u201cI would even say,\u201d he added, \u201cthat the future of humanity is in great measure in your own hands, through your ability to organize and carry out creative alternatives, through your daily efforts to ensure the three L\u2019s (labor, lodging, land).\u201dIn Francis\u2019s post-neoliberal future, the poor of the world act with the church and civil-society organizations to create an economy that serves human flourishing, while calling on states to receive migrants in solidarity. In Mr. Trump\u2019s post-neoliberal future, former chief executives, billionaire hedge-fund managers and real estate moguls dismantle the state to make capitalism yet more liquid, but use the state to stiffen borders.That said, the kernel of the rift between the pope and the president is ultimately religious. Mr. Bannon believes the Catholic Church has to be rescued from Francis, whom he sees as part of the global elite (a description that would certainly surprise the pope). Mr. Trump\u2019s chief ideologue has formed a curious alliance with Pope Francis\u2019s archcritic, Raymond Burke, an American cardinal based in Rome, in their shared conviction that \u201cChristian culture\" is engaged in a deadly rivalry with Islam \u2014 the Samuel Huntington thesis, shared by the Islamic State, of an enduring \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201dFrancis abhors this notion and rejects it at every turn. Religion, which is universal (because God is), can never be captured by a national culture; nor can true religion ever be the cause of terrorism and violence. For Francis, all fundamentalism \u2014 whether Christian or Muslim or nativist \u2014 is atheism, and all violence in the name of religion is simply nonsensical. (This is what he meant when he surprised many Catholics by describing the slaying of a French priest, Jacques Hamel, by Islamic State sympathizers in July last year as \u201cabsurd violence.\u201d)For the pope, a Christian nation that defends its faith by turning away people in need is not protecting its faith but poisoning it; being true to Christianity requires seeing all as equal creatures of God, whoever they are and whatever they believe. When journalists discovered that the 12 refugees traveling back with the pope from Lesbos in February were Muslim, they asked him why he picked them.\u201cI didn\u2019t make a religious choice between Christians and Muslims,\u201d he answered. \u201cThese three families had their documents in order. There were, for example, two Christian families who didn\u2019t. This is not a privilege. All 12 of them are children of God. It\u2019s a privilege to be a child of God.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Elsewhere a man has grown a suitcase for a face, while a teenager\u2019s tongue has fled his body, verbs soon spilling out and assuming forms of their own.

{"Headline": "Samsung Bribery Scandal Threatens South Korea Success Story", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Jay Y. Lee, heir to one of the world\u2019s biggest corporate empires, followed in the footsteps of his prominent father. He took charge of key businesses. He hobnobbed with his country\u2019s president. He brought in new ideas.The thought of Mr. Lee in jail has raised a tantalizing prospect for many South Koreans: This time could be different.Mr. Lee and key aides are accused of using bribes to cement the family\u2019s control of the Samsung empire \u2014 an accusation that, if proven, would add to growing public perception that the country\u2019s business elite are in it only for themselves. The ensuing scandal threatens to topple South Korea\u2019s government and lead to tougher moves against big business here.Prosecutors also indicted a group of executives tasked with cementing Mr. Lee\u2019s grip over the sprawling empire \u2014 a group that critics say epitomizes where the country\u2019s business culture went wrong.But it also includes the growing realization that, to compete, Samsung and South Korea as a whole will have to take a hard look at the way they do business.Like its home country, Samsung is a giant in transition. The conglomerate is one of the world\u2019s top sellers of televisions and smartphones, a key supplier for the innards of Apple\u2019s iPhones, and the maker of products as varied as cargo ships and credit cards. Its many companies posted estimated combined sales of $262 billion. By itself, it accounts for one-fifth of its home country\u2019s exports.Mr. Lee still may emerge unscathed. He argues that he didn\u2019t commit bribery and that, instead, he is the victim of extortion. Samsung said in a statement that it neither paid bribes nor sought favors, and said the truth would come to light in court.But Mr. Lee\u2019s troubles \u2014 he was arrested, unprecedented for the leader of South Korea\u2019s largest company, before he was indicted \u2014 were a jolt to those who assumed Samsung could once again turn to its political ties for help.Samsung, which means \u201cthree stars\u201d in Korean, has long prospered from politics. Founded by a grandfather of Mr. Lee as a small fish and produce trader in 1938, it branched out into new businesses after the Korean War, including textiles, sugar and alcohol \u2014 and later, in 1969, electronics.The two sides struck a compromise. Mr. Park allowed Mr. Lee\u2019s grandfather and other business leaders to keep their wealth. In return, he urged them to invest in the country\u2019s economic development and to back his push to make South Korea an export powerhouse. To help, he plied them with cheap bank loans, beneficial \u201cbuy Korea\u201d policies and other inducements.\u201cTo South Koreans, chaebol have two faces,\u201d said Kim Sang-jo, an economist at Hansung University in Seoul and an authority on Samsung. \u201cOn one hand, chaebol symbolize corrupt ties between business and politics, so people call for reforming chaebol. On the other hand, the economy is so heavily dependent on chaebol that people fear that shaking them too much might make them collapse.\u201d\u201cSouth Korean people,\u201d he added, \u201chave never had a chance to learn how a modern globalized company should be run.\u201dIn a move that is now part of Samsung\u2019s internal lore, Lee Kun-hee told his (mostly male) executives to \u201cchange everything except your wife and kids\u201d and worked to improve Samsung\u2019s quality. He brought in foreign experts. When one batch of phones turned out to be defective, in 1995, he gathered thousands of them into a pile at one of Samsung\u2019s factories and set them on fire. The effort worked. Today Samsung is one of a very few electronics makers to command premium prices for its high-end televisions, smartphones and kitchen appliances.But Samsung also found itself repeatedly entangled in some of South Korea\u2019s biggest corruption scandals. Lee Kun-hee was twice convicted, first of bribery and then of tax evasion. Each time, he received a suspended prison term and was later pardoned by the president.When Lee Kun-hee\u2019s son, Jay Y. Lee, now 48, took effective reins of the family empire, he didn\u2019t do it alone.The Lee family\u2019s ownership in the various Samsung companies isn\u2019t clear because many are not publicly traded, but it is widely believed to hold only small minority stakes. Instead, it controls the companies through loyal executives, as well as through interlocking contracts and shareholdings between the companies and other shadowy links.At Samsung, some of the most loyal executives staffed the corporate strategy office. The office linked Samsung\u2019s chairman with a host of professional executives who run dozens of individual Samsung subsidiaries, which together now employ a half-million people globally. But the office had a less publicized role: It worked to enable the Lee family to pull off the dynastic transfer of control over Samsung\u2019s management.Mr. Lee, polite and casual where his father could be remote and distant, by title a Samsung vice chairman, had the appearance of a with-it executive who wanted to bring Samsung into the modern era. Though Samsung\u2019s electronics arm made cutting-edge hardware, it was largely missing out on the boom in mobile apps and online services. He also believed that Samsung\u2019s strict corporate culture was holding back innovation.In a few ways, under Mr. Lee, Samsung began to loosen up. He began a campaign to discourage managers from using harsh language with underlings, a common occurrence in South Korean offices. He also pledged to cut meetings and office hours, encouraged workers to challenge their bosses, and barred employees from using hierarchical titles in addressing one another \u2014 a norm in the South Korean corporate world. The initiative, heavily touted by the company, was called Start-Up Samsung.But critics still saw a top-down approach. For example, the company announced Start-Up Samsung with a coordinated pledge from top executives.At the same time, the corporate strategy office was coming under fire for another move, a deal that would strengthen the family\u2019s hold on Samsung \u2014 but one that would also engulf it in scandal.The trick was getting government approval \u2014 and to win it, prosecutors say, Mr. Lee and the corporate strategy office broke the law.In a statement, Samsung said shareholders of both companies approved the deal before any donations were made. But it also said it introduced measures to manage donations, including greater public disclosure and more reviews by executives and directors.Ms. Choi\u2019s relationship with Ms. Park last year ignited a nationwide scandal. Ms. Choi, who has no formal government title, was reported to have been involved with writing Ms. Park\u2019s speeches, choosing top government officials and even selecting her outfits. As the scandal spread, the alleged bribes came to the attention of prosecutors.Others have said that the company culture has grown more strict since Mr. Lee\u2019s father was incapacitated and pressures on the company to perform well under Mr. Lee grew.\u201cThey forgot their fathers\u2019 and grandfathers\u2019 entrepreneurship,\u201d said Mr. Moon, the opposition leader, referring to Mr. Lee and other third-generation chaebol leaders, \u201cand chose to make easy money.\u201dStung by the scandal, Samsung closed the corporate strategy office. Skeptics point out that Samsung has done that before. Mr. Lee\u2019s father disbanded the office when he ran into legal trouble, only to re-establish it under its current name once those troubles blew over. Its functions may simply migrate to another part of the empire, they say.\u201cThe mission right now is to save Jay Y. Lee,\u201d said Chang Sea-jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Saving Private Ryan.\u2019\u201dSamsung said in a statement that its companies would be managed independently by its chief executives and directors.But there is reason to believe this time could be different.Already Mr. Lee has been punished more than his father, who never spent any time in jail. The case also implicates South Korea\u2019s president, while approval ratings for her pro-business party have plummeted, meaning political protection from the top is less likely. And public anger about collusion between companies and the government has never been greater, with protests breaking out this year.It isn\u2019t clear whether somebody else may emerge to lead Samsung. Lee Boo-jin, Mr. Lee\u2019s sister and the country\u2019s richest woman, runs the Samsung affiliate Hotel Shilla, which also operates duty-free shops. With her brother in jail, some analysts speculated that she might try to increase her profile within the vast corporate empire. But most analysts say Samsung\u2019s complicated hierarchy is already dominated by executives loyal to Mr. Lee.While analysts warn it isn\u2019t likely anything will immediately change, Samsung is undoubtedly facing a new level of pressure and scrutiny.\u201cThe thing about Samsung is, it\u2019s a giant wound-up ball of yarn of cross-holdings,\u201d said Geoffrey Cain, the author of a coming book on Samsung. \u201cThe setup is so complicated that sometimes I wonder if a group of smart people could find a way to tug at the right connection and find a way to loosen it up, to unravel it a bit, just to see if they could pull it away from the company.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s never happened in Korea before.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

It would have a separate insurance subsidiary to provide insurance in Britain.A.I.G. currently has a single insurance company in Britain, with branches in Luxembourg and other parts of the European Union, as well as Switzerland.The insurer said that it would continue to support its European business from Britain, which it considers a core market and is the home to its largest operation in Europe.He added that Luxembourg \u201coffers us a secure location in a stable economy with an experienced and well-respected regulator in continental Europe close to many of our major markets.\u201dThe insurer said it expected to have the new structure in place in the first quarter of 2019, subject to approval by regulators.A.I.G., which currently has three employees in Luxembourg, declined to say have many people might move as a result of the change.An A.I.G. spokeswoman said that there would be \u201csome changes at a senior leadership level, but wider impacts are expected to be minimal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump\u2019s Blinkered Fiscal Vision", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byEditorialWorse yet, some Republicans may call for limiting Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed reductions by cutting instead from Social Security and Medicare, which Mr. Trump has pledged to protect. That would be needlessly tightfisted. A rich nation with a resilient economy can afford to care for both the poor and the elderly. Besides, support for the elderly is already becoming stingier as a result of changes instituted years ago, including an increase in the Social Security retirement age from 65 in 2002 to 67 by 2027.That is not to imply that all spending cuts are off limits. But it\u2019s sensible to mix them with tax increases. The approach of Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans would deeply cut taxes even as spending is slashed.Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers say tax cuts spread prosperity by generating economic growth and thus increasing federal revenue \u2014 a thoroughly debunked claim. Experience shows that large tax cuts either deepen the nation\u2019s debt or necessitate spending cuts. Forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that if tax revenue is not increased in the coming decade, spending cuts of $3 trillion \u2014 or about 25 percent outside of Social Security and Medicare \u2014 will be required to keep the debt at its current level of 77.5 percent of the economy. Clearly, if defense spending rises in the coming decade, as Mr. Trump has called for, while tax revenue declines, either the debt will rise or spending cuts will need to be even deeper.Both outcomes can be avoided by abandoning deep tax cuts. It would be wise to take on new debt for stimulus during economic downturns or for infrastructure investments, but not to finance tax cuts during a military buildup. Economic activity could be encouraged by bolstering wages, including federal overtime protections. Tax revenue could be raised in constructive ways, including a carbon tax.Giving the wealthy never-ending tax cuts while gutting programs for the middle class would create more of the resentment and inequality Mr. Trump has promised to address.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chinese-Backed Dam Project Leaves Myanmar in a Bind", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byAUNG MYIN THA, Myanmar \u2014 For six years, Daw Kaw Bu has waited to return to the village she was forced to leave to make way for a dam that has yet to be built.\u201cI pray to God to let me work on my own land again,\u201d she said on a recent afternoon, sitting outside the wood-shingled home in Aung Myin Tha, where she was resettled in early 2011.She may get her answer soon, when a government-appointed commission makes a recommendation on the fate of the $3.6 billion, Chinese-financed Myitsone Dam.The decision is a daunting test for Myanmar\u2019s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who risks angering China, the region\u2019s economic powerhouse, if she cancels the project, or the public if she lets it go forward.Analysts say the commission\u2019s report would provide her the political cover to kill an unpopular white elephant that she inherited from Myanmar\u2019s former military government.But getting out of the deal would be difficult. If her government cancels the project outright, it could have to repay some $800 million that the state-owned Chinese developer says it has already spent on the project.If Myanmar offers China other dam projects in return, a compromise her government has floated, they are likely to impinge on disputed ethnic areas where they could threaten the peace talks she has championed since her political party came to power last year.The Myitsone Dam is among the largest of many Chinese-financed energy and mining projects approved by the military junta that ruled Myanmar until 2011. It is especially contentious because it would be the first dam to cross the Irrawaddy River, the mythic cradle of civilization for Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Burman majority.But perhaps the most incendiary objection was that under the deal struck by the ruling generals, 90 percent of the dam\u2019s electricity could go to China. As protests spread to Myanmar\u2019s cities, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s revered pro-democracy leader at the time, spoke out against the dam.The decision, widely seen as a victory for the forces of democracy, shocked Chinese officials and businessmen. Many remain incredulous that the dam was delayed at all in a country that needs more electricity to power its fast-growing economy.Although the contract has never been publicly disclosed, details have leaked out over the years. A person who supports the dam and is familiar with the contract, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Myanmar was guaranteed 10 percent of the dam\u2019s electricity at no cost and could buy more on request.The government\u2019s 15 percent stake in the dam would earn it about $18 billion over a 50-year concession period, analysts and local news reports said.The Chinese developer owns the remaining 80 percent.One reason for that, experts say, is that there is no grid connecting the dam to Myanmar\u2019s major towns and cities.\u201cDoes Myanmar need electricity? Yes, for sure,\u201d said David Dapice, an economist at Harvard who has studied Myanmar\u2019s hydropower sector. \u201cDoes it need Myitsone? No. There are many other hydro sites that could be developed. And in the country\u2019s south, gas generation would be cheaper than transmitting hydro over long distances.\u201dCanceling the dam, however, would upset relations with China, Myanmar\u2019s biggest trading partner.Recognition is growing among Chinese officials and experts, analysts said, that the diplomatic and business strategies that worked well when Myanmar was ruled by generals are no longer viable.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned our lesson from focusing too much on the elites, and now we know that deals and agreements are not solid if they are not based on people-to-people relations,\u201d said Fan Hongwei, a Myanmar specialist at Xiamen University in China.Executives at the company declined a request for an interview. But in a written statement, Wang Qiyue, the project\u2019s general manager, said that the company would \u201clisten carefully and offer our practical advice\u201d to any new proposals from Myanmar officials.The dam would provide Myanmar \u201cits own cheap, renewable energy,\u201d he said, a better option than importing power or using more expensive or nonrenewable energy sources.Officials close to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi have said that negotiations were underway for Myanmar to pay China, or apply the money to other projects, if the dam is not built.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, U Zaw Htay, said last year that as a compromise for not building the Myitsone Dam, she was prepared to offer the Chinese a series of smaller hydropower projects that are less of a threat to the environment.But Myanmar\u2019s best potential hydropower sites are all in conflict areas, said Tom Kramer, a researcher in Yangon at the Transnational Institute, a Dutch organization that studies ethnic issues in Myanmar. Approving new projects there, he said, could set off renewed fighting among the very armed groups that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is struggling to bring to the negotiating table as part of a fragile national peace dialogue.But whether the money is used to repay China or build alternative dams, it is not clear where Myanmar would come up with $800 million, a sum greater than its roughly $600 million health budget.On a recent afternoon near the site of the Myitsone Dam, there was no sign of Chinese workers or dam-building equipment. From the bank of the Irrawaddy, the only movement visible near the unfinished dam site was a slender fishing skiff that drifted lazily on the current.Residents of Aung Myin Tha, a nearby village where about 300 families were resettled, said it had some advantages, like the 16-bed hospital and roads built by the dam developer. But most families now have less farmland and diminished access to the Irrawaddy and traditional hunting grounds, and opposition to the dam remains strong.\u201cIf the Lady lets it happen, Kachin people will protest,\u201d said one villager, Daw Ja Khawn, using the popular moniker for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the whole country behind us, which will be easy because the whole country is already against it.\u201dDozens of families have taken matters into their own hands, moving back to their old villages, even though electricity was cut off there.\u201cI built my house to challenge the Chinese,\u201d said one, Daw Lu Ra, who was eating a freshly caught fish by candlelight at a restaurant overlooking the headwaters. \u201cEven if they told me to move again, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201dWai Moe contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.

{"Headline": "I Loved My Grandmother. But She Was a Nazi.", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMy grandparents were Nazis. It took me until recently to be able to say \u2014 or write \u2014 this. I used to think of and refer to them as \u201cordinary Germans,\u201d as if that was a distinct and morally neutral category. But like many \u201cordinary Germans,\u201d they were members of the Nazi Party \u2014 they joined in 1937.My grandmother, who lived to be almost 100, was not, as I knew her, xenophobic or anti-Semitic; she did not seem temperamentally suited to hate. Understanding why and how this woman I knew and loved was swept up in a movement that became synonymous with evil has been, for me, a lifelong question.She and my grandfather grew up in a working-class suburb of industrial Dortmund, where unemployment was rife; it had been occupied by the French after World War I. They joined the Nazi Party to be youth leaders in an agricultural education program called the Landjahr, or \u201cyear on the land,\u201d in which teenagers got agricultural training. My grandmother always maintained that she had joined the Nazis as an \u201cidealist\u201d drawn to the vision of rebuilding Germany, returning to a simpler time and, perversely, promoting equality.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know\u201d was a kind of mantra for her on the long walks we took when I visited her at the farm she lived on, not far from where she grew up. \u201cBut didn\u2019t you hear what Hitler was saying?\u201d I would ask, grappling with the moral paradox of a loving grandmother who had been a Nazi.My grandmother would shrug and answer something like, \u201cHe said a lot of things \u2014 I didn\u2019t listen to all of them.\u201d Didn\u2019t she see Jews being rounded up and taken away, or at a minimum, harassed by the police? No, she maintained, not in the countryside where she lived. And anyway, she was focused on her own problems, on making ends meet and, once the war began, protecting her children.In German there are two words for knowing: \u201cwissen,\u201d which is associated with wisdom and learning, and \u201ckennen,\u201d which is like being acquainted.\u201cBut what did you think when you started hearing the rumors about concentration camps?\u201d I would press her. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever listen to the foreign news reports?\u201d\u201cAllied propaganda\u201d was my grandmother\u2019s answer. That\u2019s what Hitler said it was. And she, like many Germans, trusted him. Her trust, apparently, relieved her of the need to understand.How do I square the loving grandmother I knew until her death, in 2011, with this person? I have often worried that my attempt to understand the choices she made \u2014 and didn\u2019t make \u2014 might be confused with an attempt to justify or forgive. But for me it is the only way I know to confront the past and take responsibility.My grandmother heard what she wanted from a leader who promised simple answers to complicated questions. She chose not to hear and see the monstrous sum those answers added up to. And she lived the rest of her life with the knowledge of her indefensible complicity.But in her willingness to talk about a subject few members of her generation would, she taught me the vital importance of knowing better.An Op-Ed essay on Saturday about a writer\u2019s Nazi grandmother inaccurately described an aspect of life in Nazi Germany.

{"Headline": "Airport Will Temporarily Shut, Disrupting a Nigerian Lifeline", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byAbuja JournalTravelers must climb a grimy stairwell to get to gates for boarding. The restaurant food is usually stale. The coffee is powdered. Security officers sometimes ask for a little extra something for their efforts. The bin they use for stashing confiscated items on a day not long ago held an assault rifle.Yet for Nigerians living in the sleepy capital, Abuja, the airport with its more than 80 flights a day usually serves the purpose of getting them to their destinations, despite delays and cancellations that plague any busy airspace.And so the government\u2019s announcement that it plans to close the airport for six weeks starting early Wednesday to repair a runway has prompted fears about a major disruption to Abuja\u2019s lifeline to the rest of the country and the world.After mounting complaints about the poor state of the runway from airlines, and with safety consultants fearing impending disaster, government officials finally acceded to fixing its many cracks and holes \u2014 repairs that are 15 years overdue.Officials decided the damage was so bad that it couldn\u2019t be fixed piecemeal and required a total shutdown of operations. They have said repairs should take no more than six weeks, but skeptical passengers accustomed to unfulfilled government promises worry that work could drag on for months.I passed through the low-slung airport a few times recently. Construction equipment was already in place. Passengers balled up at the entrance were in typically testy moods. I was fleeced by a man claiming he would handle my ticket purchase on Air Peace, a domestic carrier, only to realize too late that he was merely a go-between with big shoulders who could muscle his way to the front of the line.The government\u2019s Plan B for the airport isn\u2019t soothing concerns. Planes are to be rerouted to a tiny airport in Kaduna, where on a typical day only a handful of flights go in and out. A new terminal being built in Kaduna to handle the influx was still under construction.Passengers will be ferried free of charge by bus on a roughly three-hour trip to Abuja along a road famous for kidnappings and banditry in a region where nomadic herdsmen and farmers engage in frequent deadly clashes. Officers from the air force, road safety corps and the secret police will be posted along the road linking the two cities, and officials have assured the public that everyone will be safe.While the shutdown will cause hassles for travelers, it will upend the financially fragile lives of workers in an economic ecosystem that thrives both inside and on the fringes of the terminals.Food service providers, security services and others say they may not be able to pay workers.\u201cKaduna is not that big. Not all of our staff can go there,\u201d said Aliyu Oladimeji, a manager whose baggage-handling company still hadn\u2019t decided how it would sort out employee salaries during the shutdown. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. We just have to bear it.\u201dSandra William runs a restaurant selling dishes like rice, vegetable stews and semo, a doughy wheat-based ball used for dipping in her stews, to travelers in the arrivals hall. She is worried the six weeks of nonoperation won\u2019t be deducted from the annual rent she pays for her stall.\u201cFor me, safety is first,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still going to affect me. If we don\u2019t sell, I can\u2019t pay my rent.\u201dTo add to the anxiety, President Muhammadu Buhari left the country for medical treatment in January and has yet to return.Many people fear that shutting the airport in the capital is going to further isolate the nation from help that it badly needs to pull out of its economic mess.Aid groups that in recent months have ramped up logistically challenging operations in the nation\u2019s northeast, which has suffered pockets of famine, are trying to rearrange humanitarian flights that normally leave from Abuja.\u201cEverybody is worried in Nigeria,\u201d said Emmanuel Onyekwena, the chief executive of Tolmann Allied, who uses the Abuja airport at least once every two weeks to travel for his company, which supports the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry. \u201cThe seat of power is here. The people who make decisions are here.\u201dThe Abuja airport opened in 1982, and it hasn\u2019t had a thorough resurfacing since then, said Henrietta Yakubu, acting general manager of the corporate affairs for the Department for the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria. Temporary patches put on the runway every few weeks by maintenance crews are no longer working, Ms. Yakubu said.\u201cProper maintenance should have been done, but it wasn\u2019t done,\u201d she said.Some international airlines have decided to reject the government\u2019s plan to fly to Kaduna and instead are rerouting flights to Lagos until the Abuja airport is operational. Domestic travelers accustomed to hopping a 70-minute flight from Lagos to Abuja face a nearly 11-hour drive that can be much longer with traffic.In past months, fliers of Nigerian skies already had been experiencing big problems. The country has had a shortage of dollars, and airline fuel, imported using foreign exchange, has at times been difficult to secure. Flights have been canceled \u2014 prompting full-fledged brawls at airline counters, documented on social media.On a recent sunny afternoon, Jesse Shedrack, one of the 850 taxi drivers who ferry passengers into town, was waiting under a canopy by the airport terminal with other drivers, all of whom were outraged that their work would be cut off.\u201cIt\u2019s a federal capital,\u201d he said. \u201cYou close the airport for six weeks, it\u2019s unheard-of.\u201dMr. Shedrack and other drivers said they couldn\u2019t relocate to Kaduna because they would come into conflict with an association of drivers who work there. \u201cIf we go there, there will be a riot,\u201d he said.The closing will also upend the lives of children who sell bags of six or seven peanuts in the shell, of men who push luggage carts for a fee, of people who hawk manila folders stuffed with a type of spicy beef jerky, of money changers and phone credit sellers \u2014 all of whom rely on travelers to manage their precarious financial situations.Abdul Ganiyu sells tiny luggage padlocks for the equivalent of about $1 in the airport parking lot. He has grown accustomed to earning between $12 and $24 a day, enough to feed his wife and two children. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do for income when the airport closes and is praying repairs stay on schedule.\u201cI\u2019m just hoping God opens a way for us,\u201d he said.Chris Stein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He said that too many Europeans took the benefits of peace for granted and that the unification project could run aground as nations, and citizens, turned inward.There is \u201cfearfulness\u201d in Europe, the pontiff said, according to his prepared remarks. \u201cToday\u2019s prosperity seems to have clipped the continent\u2019s wings and lowered its gaze.\u201dFrancis, a staunch advocate of migrants\u2019 rights, said that although European civilization had its roots in Christianity, Europeans must embrace a \u201cmulticultural world.\u201d He urged leaders and citizens to rediscover a deeper capacity for empathy and tolerance.Forgotten, he said, \u201cis the tragedy of separated families, poverty and destitution born of that division.\u201d\u201cWhere generations longed to see the fall of those signs of forced hostility,\u201d he added, \u201cthese days we debate how to keep out the \u2018dangers\u2019 of our time: beginning with the long file of women, men and children fleeing war and poverty, seeking only a future for themselves and their loved ones.\u201dHis comments appeared to be aimed at least partly at Eastern European countries that have resisted the influx of migrants \u2014 many from war-torn and poverty-stricken regions in the Middle East and Africa \u2014 that fled to the Continent in record numbers in recent years.The idea of the weekend meeting was for the heads of state to break away from the seemingly endless crises of the past decade \u2014 and perhaps even rediscover a sense of aspiration and optimism. Beata Szydlo, the Polish prime minister, was among the most enthusiastic in her greetings of the pope, stooping to deliver what appeared to be a kiss to the papal ring.Its decision to leave plunged the union into another crisis, even as the bloc\u2019s leaders struggled to manage a flood of migrants whose arrival strengthened the appeal of populist anti-European Union and anti-immigrant politicians in countries like France, Germany and the Netherlands.Yet there was dissension in the run-up to the gathering, with Poland and Greece threatening to block the Rome Declaration. The bloc is also still reeling from a debt crisis earlier in the decade and efforts to save the euro that led to crushing levels of austerity in countries like Greece.The Treaty of Rome was the start of the longest period of peace in recent centuries, Francis reminded the leaders on Friday. European integration had its basis in a \u201cclear, well-defined and carefully pondered project,\u201d he said. But there has been a \u201clapse in memory,\u201d he said, and many ordinary people no longer identify with the idea that arose from the ashes of the Second World War and the end of the Soviet Union.The European Union is in danger of stagnation, even collapse, if leaders fail to inspire confidence in the project and to overcome populism and extremism, the pope warned.\u201cWhen a body loses its sense of direction and is no longer able to look ahead,\u201d he said, \u201cit experiences a regression and, in the long run, risks dying.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Endangered Antiquities Act", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsBecause these presidential actions change the status quo and prevent development, they have sometimes incited local opposition. But over time, the growing popularity of these places often led Congress to recast them as full-fledged national parks.Congress can always overturn a president\u2019s monument designation, but has done so only a dozen times. Nearly all involved areas less than 2,000 acres, and the last time it happened was in 1980. But no president has ever attempted to rescind a monument established by a predecessor, and it is unclear whether a president even has the power to do so. Instead, like Congress, presidents have often used the act to expand monuments (and on occasion, to shrink them).As our population grows and our rich natural and historical heritage faces increasing threats, we should be looking to protect more places that can inspire and inform present and future generations and offer them recreational opportunities. That is the incomparable legacy of the Antiquities Act, and its necessity is as vital today as it ever was. It would be shortsighted in the extreme for Congress to change a single word of what has been, by practically every measure, one of the most fruitful and farsighted laws it has ever put on the books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Taxes on Imported Cars Feed Trade Tensions With U.S.", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 A Jeep Wrangler can cost $30,000 more in China than in the United States \u2014 and the reasons illustrate a growing point of tension between the two countries.Manufactured in Toledo, Ohio, the Wrangler is a descendant of the jeeps that were used by American forces in World War II. Equipped with a 3.6-liter engine and a five-speed automatic transmission, the Rubicon edition of the Wrangler has a suggested retail price of $40,530 in the United States.But in China, the same vehicle would set a buyer back by a hefty $71,000, mostly because of taxes that Beijing charges on every car, minivan and sport utility vehicle that is made in another country and brought to China\u2019s shores.Those taxes on imported cars have become a growing area of friction between the United States and China. American former officials and current advisers to President Trump say that concern about the widening United States deficit in automotive trade has become a pressing issue ahead of the president\u2019s meeting in Florida next month with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.Hinting at potentially tough talks to come, Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary, raised the issue of auto trade in the first question to Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier, at a closed-door meeting on Monday, participants in the meeting said on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.Mr. Li did not answer the question directly, the people said, instead responding that every country faced trade issues, and that China had its own trade deficits with a few countries, like Australia, from which it imports a lot of raw material.Mostly because of taxes in China, \u201can imported car can be double the price when compared with a domestically produced car,\u201d said Bill Russo, the former chief executive of Chrysler China. \u201cThis acts as a powerful motivation, especially for mass-market brands, to localize their products in China.\u201dBut the industry dynamics are complex. American auto companies, which have come to depend on China as a major source of revenue, have been largely quiet despite Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. Building cars in China keeps them close to a vast Chinese supply chain and saves on transportation costs.Companies like Fiat Chrysler, the manufacturer of the Wrangler, also set prices in China that allow somewhat higher profit margins.Pricing can depend on factors like taxes, shipping, certification costs, equipment options, the size of the market and other details, said Ariel Gavilan, a Fiat Chrysler spokesman, in an emailed reply to questions. \u201cWe also take a look at the competitive landscape \u2014 i.e. what are the prices of the vehicles we compete against \u2014 before determining our pricing strategy.\u201dIndustry figures have also long talked about the possibility of exporting big volumes of China-made cars to the United States. In an early test, General Motors started shipping the Buick Envision model from a factory in eastern China\u2019s Shandong Province to the United States last year. That decision irritated the United Automobile Workers union. G.M. officials said that the Envision, a midsize sport utility vehicle, was designed for the Chinese market and is made only at the Shandong factory.There is only a small chance that Chinese automakers would set up assembly plants in the United States, the way Japanese automakers did in the 1980s to allay trade tensions. China\u2019s highly fragmented industry includes a number of fairly small manufacturers producing low-cost models, making the economics difficult, while Chinese automakers must still deal with quality problems.Parts are also an issue. In January, the most recent month for which data is available, the United States had $817 million in automotive exports to China, including finished cars and auto parts, and $1.71 billion in automotive imports.Still, American negotiators might have better luck in that area, as some Chinese parts makers are already investing in the United States to diversify. Fuyao, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of automotive glass, has built a large factory in Ohio to supply car-assembly plants in the state. Officials with Fuyao have been criticized on social media in China, however, for investing offshore instead of keeping jobs within China.Fuyao declined to comment on its plans in the United States.Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm, said Fuyao\u2019s Ohio factory could be the start of a larger trend that might help soothe trade frictions.\u201cThose large local suppliers are willing to invest in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a major issue for those large, local suppliers. They are willing to do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Planned Rollback of Climate Rules Unlikely to Achieve All Trump\u2019s Goals", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisPresident Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Tuesday to roll back most of President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change legacy, celebrating the move as a way to increase the nation\u2019s \u201cenergy independence\u201d and to restore thousands of lost coal mining jobs.But energy economists say the expected order falls short of both of those goals \u2014 in part because the United States already largely relies on domestic sources for the coal and natural gas that fires most of the nation\u2019s power plants.\u201cWe don\u2019t import coal,\u201d said Robert Stavins, an energy economist at Harvard University. \u201cSo in terms of the Clean Power Plan, this has nothing to do with so-called energy independence whatsoever.\u201dAmericans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Yet, coal miners also should not assume their jobs will return if Trump\u2019s regulations take effect.The new order would mean that older coal plants that had been marked for closings would probably stay open, said Robert W. Godby, an energy economist at the University of Wyoming. That would extend the market demand for coal for up to a decade.But even so, \u201cthe mines that are staying open are using more mechanization,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not hiring people.\u201d\u201cSo even if we saw an increase in coal production, we could see a decrease in coal jobs,\u201d he said.Legal experts say it could take years for the Trump administration to unwind the Clean Power Plan, which itself has not yet been carried out because it has been temporarily frozen by a Supreme Court order. Those regulations sought to cut planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution from coal-fired power plants. If enacted, they would have shut down hundreds of those plants, frozen construction of future plants and replaced them with wind and solar farms.While the number of coal mining jobs has dropped in the United States, they do not represent a significant portion of the American economy. Coal companies employed about 65,971 miners in 2015, down from 87,755 in 2008, according to Energy Department statistics.And though the percentage of coal mining jobs dropped sharply, economists said that was not driven by the Clean Power Plan. Rather, they blamed two key forces: an increase in production of natural gas, which is a cheaper, cleaner-burning alternative to coal, and an increase in automation, which allowed coal companies to produce more fuel with fewer employees. The rollback of Mr. Obama\u2019s regulations will not change either of those forces, economists say.2016 is the hottest year on the historical record and the third consecutive record-breaking year, scientists say.The coal industry nonetheless cheered the move.\u201cThese actions are vital to the American coal industry, to our survival, and to getting some of our coal families back to work,\u201d said Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of Murray Energy, one of the nation\u2019s largest coal mining companies.But even Mr. Murray conceded that he did not expect the Trump administration\u2019s order to return coal mining numbers to their former strength. \u201cI really don\u2019t know how far the coal industry can be brought back,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s directive on Tuesday will also eliminate about a half-dozen of Mr. Obama\u2019s smaller executive orders and memorandums related to combating climate change.White House officials said they included lifting a ban on new coal mining on federal lands, and recalculating a budgeting metric known as the social cost of carbon that, under the Obama administration, limited pollution by arguing that global warming outweighed economic benefits for industries. Combined, while the measures may not revive the coal industry, they are likely to ensure the United States\u2019 emissions of planet-warming pollution remain high.But experts say Mr. Trump\u2019s order signals that the United States will not meet its pledges to cut its emissions about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\u201cMeeting the U.S. terms of the Paris Agreement would require full enforcement of the current regulations, plus additional regulations,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. \u201cIt takes a comprehensive effort involving every country doing what they committed to and more.\u201dHe said Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u201csends a signal to other countries that they might not have to meet their commitments \u2014 which would mean that the world would fail to stay out of the climate danger zone.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Takes a Gamble in Cutting Programs His Base Relies On", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s proposal on Thursday for deep cuts to the budgets of a broad part of the federal bureaucracy was billed as a tough-minded and necessary corrective to the growth of the government\u2019s power. But even members of his own party questioned some of the cuts \u2014 and what was not being cut.The harshest criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget came from Democrats and liberal organizations. But in a city where many federal programs enjoy longstanding bipartisan support, some Republicans also assailed the president\u2019s judgment.\u201cWhile we have a responsibility to reduce our federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the president\u2019s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,\u201d said Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cWe will certainly review this budget proposal, but Congress ultimately has the power of the purse.\u201dMr. Trump was elected on a promise to wage war against what he has frequently mocked as a bloated and ineffective federal work force, and he is betting that his first budget will help consolidate support by calling for a significant shift of resources away from established programs that aid the poor, the environment, foreigners and the arts.The president\u2019s plan would cut spending for many agencies to historically low levels.He said that after-school programs had failed to help children in schools, that housing programs were \u201cnot well run,\u201d that government health research had suffered \u201cmission creep\u201d and that grants to local communities \u201cdon\u2019t do any good.\u201dMr. Mulvaney waved aside questions about cuts to the United Nations, saying that they \u201cshould come as a surprise to no one who watched the campaign.\u201d And he said that the president made no apologies for eliminating the government\u2019s efforts to curb climate change.\u201cWe\u2019re not spending money on that anymore,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe consider that a waste of your money to go out and do that.\u201dThe approach is a risky gamble for Mr. Trump, whose victory in November came in part by assembling a coalition that included low-income workers who rely on many of the programs that he now proposes to slash. For now, the president and his advisers appear willing to take that risk by casting the administration as better caretakers of taxpayers\u2019 money. \u201cWe are trying to focus on both recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.White House officials said steep cuts at the State Department and increases in the military budget would refocus the United States away from helping other nations, sending a message that Mr. Trump intends to make greater use of \u201chard power\u201d around the globe.They also said the president\u2019s budget would increase resources for military veterans.Military supporters praised Mr. Trump for beginning what they believe is a needed rebuilding of the armed forces, though several key lawmakers said that even his proposed increase would not be enough for a military that they say is too small and unprepared to meet modern threats.Conservatives hailed his vision as an antidote to decades of bureaucratic growth even as they predicted fierce resistance from the interest groups and lawmakers with deep links to the affected agencies and the beneficiaries of the programs that will see their budgets slashed.\u201cThat sound you hear from Washington, D.C., this morning is the weeping and gnashing of teeth from bureaucrats and politicians who have built the federal government into an industry on the backs of taxpayers,\u201d said David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative free-market advocacy group.The Trump administration's proposed budget for 2018, released on Thursday, severely cuts funds for the E.P.A and State Department and increases spending on national security.Reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal came in a flurry of angry statements on Thursday morning as various other groups began preparing their lobbying campaigns to block the president\u2019s plan in Congress.Christine Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, called the proposed cuts to the Labor Department a \u201cdraconian\u201d budget that \u201cis virtually a complete breach of faith with America\u2019s workers.\u201dAmnesty International called the cuts to foreign aid \u201cshameful\u201d and predicted \u201cglobal consequences.\u201d The Union of Concerned Scientists said cuts to scientific programs were \u201cantiquated ideas and misguided science, which will hurt our economy, kill jobs, make us less safe.\u201d The American Library Association said that eliminating federal funds for libraries was \u201ccounterproductive and shortsighted.\u201d Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said, \u201cThis budget takes a meat cleaver to public education.\u201dEnvironmental activists criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s priorities. Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, said that \u201cthe only thing that matters in his America is corporate polluters\u2019 profits and Wall Street billionaires.\u201d\u201cIf Trump refuses to be serious about protecting our health and climate, or our publicly owned lands, then Congress must act, do its job and reject this rigged budget,\u201d Mr. Brune said.The president\u2019s plan would make deep cuts in most areas to pay for increased military spending.For Mr. Trump, the complaints from nearly all quarters may serve to amplify his image as an outsider who is not beholden to the special interests in Washington. That could help the White House pressure Republican lawmakers to embrace his vision for a spending plan.But the early reaction from members of his party on Capitol Hill was muted at best, reflecting in part the discomfort among many of the party\u2019s leaders with a budget that makes no progress on tackling the growth of entitlements.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who has long asserted a need to overhaul entitlement programs as a means to fiscal discipline for the federal government, told reporters that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the proposed increases in military spending but said little else about the contents of the budget blueprint.Earlier in the day, Mr. Ryan issued a statement saying he was \u201cdetermined to work with the administration to shrink the size of government, grow our economy, secure our borders and ensure our troops have the tools necessary to complete their missions.\u201dHe did not address any of the proposed cuts.Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, called Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal \u201ca solid step toward addressing the gross overspending that is driving our national debt.\u201d He said the president should be \u201ccommended\u201d for making some tough calls.He did not pledge to support Mr. Trump\u2019s spending plan, however, adding that he looked forward to working with his congressional colleagues \u201cto craft and pass a balanced, fiscally sound budget in the coming months.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How High Can the Haute Jewelry Market Go?", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byThe luxury market, once considered immune to the twists and turns of the economy, has a weak spot, as the high-end watch industry knows all too well. With exports of Swiss timepieces having suffered in 2016 their steepest decline in seven years, all eyes are on China, where faltering demand has inspired no small amount of soul-searching among luxury executives.But sales of haute joaillerie have proved more resilient. Loosely defined as jewels that sell for $100,000 or more (often much more), the category will come under scrutiny this week as members of the trade gather in Switzerland for the annual Baselworld luxury watch and jewelry fair.The question has become: How high can the haute market go?\u201cThe whole space, much like the watch space, has been through a reset in terms of demand over the last couple years, driven by the slowdown in Chinese consumption, driven by changes in tourism,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Timelin, a partner at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in London. \u201cAnecdotally, the number of my clients who have said they\u2019ve had customers make commitments to spend $1 million plus \u2014 people willing to put down significant deposits on stones that have not yet been procured \u2014 all suggest we\u2019ve begun to turn a corner.\u201dThe latest figures bolster that assessment. In January, the Geneva-based luxury group Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont \u2014 which owns 19 luxury brands including Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Piaget \u2014 announced that sales at its jewelry maisons in the final quarter of 2016 had increased by 8 percent compared with the same period in 2015. And for LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, owner of Bulgari, Chaumet and De Beers Diamond Jewelers, sales of watches and jewelry grew by 5 percent in 2016.Over all, the luxury jewelry market is expected to reach $37.8 billion in 2017, and grow by an average of 2.1 percent annually over the next four years, according to the market research firm Euromonitor International.One key growth factor, Mr. Timelin said, is a projected surge in the number of millionaires to 56 million in 2025, from 25 million in 2015. \u201cA large chunk will come in the U.S.,\u201d he said.As a result of the optimism fueled by such forecasts, the high-end jewelry business \u2014 which remains largely unorganized and therefore ripe for brand consolidation \u2014 is attracting newcomers enchanted with its potential.The Mumbai-based Nirav Modi introduced his high-jewelry brand in 2010 and now has eight boutiques around the world, including stores on luxury main streets in New York, Hong Kong and London. In 2017, Mr. Modi said, he plans to open 10 more boutiques in markets where he sees promise, including India, greater China, the United States and Europe. He has vowed to have 100 stores by 2025.Mr. Modi says that while sales of one-of-a-kind jewels are fueling his growth, so, too, are midprice jewels (which cost from $10,000 to $50,000), a point echoed by many of his peers in fine jewelry.\u201cThe jewelry that is increasing its performance is the accessible jewelry, in terms of number of pieces but also in terms of sales,\u201d said Karl-Friedrich Scheufele, co-president of Chopard, a luxury watch and jewelry brand based in Geneva. \u201cJewelry pieces are conceived not as once-in-a-lifetime investments or special-occasions gifts but more like expensive fashion accessories.\u201dTo understand that phenomenon, consider two developments that have transformed the jewelry industry over the last decade.The first is a replay of what happened to the fashion business 25 years ago, when brands began to dominate a landscape once ruled by a global coterie of mom-and-pop boutiques, said Thomas Tochtermann, an independent adviser to fashion and jewelry companies who is based in Hamburg, Germany.He referred to \u201cnarrative jewelry,\u201d or pieces that tell a story, and to a growing appreciation for a much wider spectrum of stones, including semiprecious gems, as dynamics shaping the world of high jewelry.Although Mr. Bos didn\u2019t mention the M-word, it\u2019s clear that the millennial generation\u2019s views on adornment weigh heavily on the category.\u201cThe key word is \u2018wearable,\u2019\u201d said Ward Landrigan, chairman and chief executive of the fine jeweler Verdura. \u201cI started in this business in New York at the end of 1964 and, for a long time, the big glamour of the major emeralds, rubies, diamonds \u2014 the great big pieces \u2014 is what people aspired toward. Now it\u2019s a different generation. People making the big money today don\u2019t show it off the same way. They want pieces you can wear and not look like Queen Elizabeth. They don\u2019t even aspire to that big look.\u201dThis is just as well, given that makers of the most elaborate and expensive jewels \u2014 the cost of which is almost always driven by the size, quality and availability of the gemstones \u2014 may find supply to be their biggest challenge.\u201cIf we consider the top end \u2014 anything, I would say, above $500,000 \u2014 it\u2019s a market that grows but can only grow so much,\u201d Mr. Babin said. \u201cBecause the gems in that segment are so extraordinary.\u201dJust ask Chopard. At an event in Paris in January, the brand unveiled a suite of 23 flawless diamonds \u2014 including five weighing more than 20 carats each \u2014 cut from a 342-carat rough stone nicknamed the Queen of Kalahari. The firm sourced the D-flawless diamond directly from the Karowe Mine in Botswana through a unique partnership with its owner, the Lucara Diamond Corporation, and made a documentary film tracing its journey from the mine through the cutting and design processes.At the Oscars in February, the actress Charlize Theron wore a pair of mismatched earrings weighing more than 50 carats from the resulting jewelry collection, named Garden of Kalahari. She was not the first person to stake a claim on the diamonds.\u201cWe already have requests for the big pieces,\u201d said Caroline Scheufele, Mr. Scheufele\u2019s sister and co-president. \u201cBut it\u2019s my wish that they stay together because it\u2019s a very special story. Maybe for some generous husband or someone who has three of four daughters?\u201dAdvertisement"}

View him as Mr. Ridley\u2019s response to the argument that illegal immigrants are taking jobs from American workers. Connor, a drug addict trying to get clean, can\u2019t handle the hard labor, and he\u2019s pretty much the only Caucasian in the fields. Americans are not exactly lined up to fill the backbreaking, low-paying jobs. The contractors who provide workers to the big farms have to lie and obfuscate to get anyone, legal or illegal, to jump in their trucks.That\u2019s the same issue, essentially, facing Jeanette Hesby (Felicity Huffman), who has married into a family that owns one of those big tomato farms. The more she learns about what the operation does to make money, the more it troubles her.So this incarnation of \u201cAmerican Crime\u201d wants us to think more deeply about what it takes to bring us the products we expect at the price we want to pay. In the broader sense, the season is skeptical about various versions of the American dream. Everything, it seems, comes at a painfully high cost, even that baby Ms. King\u2019s character so desperately wants. The in vitro procedures she has been trying are punishingly expensive, and, just as with an illegal immigrant\u2019s border-crossing grasp at a better life, there is no guarantee of success.Yes, the series sometimes grows a bit preachy: This installment, like its predecessors, tends to indulge in extended scenes whose dialogue can sound as if it were from a PBS documentary or a newspaper expos\u00e9. But you have to admire the ability of Mr. Ridley and his actors to wrap the earnestness in a compelling package.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Braces for the Now-Possible Impossible", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Now we know.Now we know about election upsets, about wrong predictions and unreliable polls, about the blind assumption by many of us in the media that voters tend to think as we do.We know that a majority of British voters have decided that their country should leave the European Union, we know that Donald J. Trump has been elected president of the United States, we know that Geert Wilders, the populist candidate who likes to call himself \u201cthe Dutch Trump,\u201d will most likely emerge as the winner of the Dutch parliamentary election next week. We know of the nationalist Polish government\u2019s disregard for the rule of law.So now we also know that the possibility of Marine Le Pen being elected president of the Republic of France on May 7 is no longer impossible.True, all rational calculations tend to prove otherwise: Doesn\u2019t the French electoral system wisely leave voters two weeks to cool their heads between the first and second rounds? Don\u2019t we have a tradition of rallying behind the \u201cdemocratic\u201d candidate in the end, as we did in 2002 when Jacques Chirac faced Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie, in the second round? Isn\u2019t the glass ceiling of 50 percent of the votes unbreakable for an extremist candidate?But rational calculations do not fool anybody anymore. These are not rational times. As weeks and months go by, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s verdict on Mr. Trump\u2019s victory keeps haunting some of us: \u201cWhat seemed impossible,\u201d she said on Nov. 9, \u201cis now possible.\u201dWe are now bracing ourselves for the possible impossible. \u201cThe threat is real,\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande acknowledged publicly for the first time last weekend, when I asked in an interview whether a Le Pen victory would kill the European project. \u201cBut France will not give in.\u201dWill the dam hold? This is a French campaign like no other. All the political patterns established since 1958, when the present Constitution was adopted, have come apart. The National Front has been a fixture of national politics for 40 years, but never before has its presidential candidate been a consistent front-runner. Today, none of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s opponents doubt that she will get to the second round; in fact, they are not even fighting her. They are fighting among themselves to win second place on April 23, to have a chance to beat her in the runoff.Never before has a sitting French president decided not to run for a second term, as Mr. Hollande did in December, acknowledging his historically low popularity. Never before have all the established figures of French political life been thrown out so brutally in primary elections as in the ones that sent Nicolas Sarkozy into retirement and crushed Manuel Valls\u2019s longstanding ambitions. A new word has been created for this unforgiving trend: \u201cle d\u00e9gagisme\u201d (\u201cd\u00e9gagez\u201d means \u201cget out of here\u201d). Having taken stock of the thirst of the voters for renewal, an astonishing number of legislators \u2014 roughly a quarter of the present National Assembly \u2014 will not run for re-election to the Parliament in June.While Ms. Le Pen confidently blazes ahead, staying on script and making progress among women, farmers and disillusioned middle-class voters, the mainstream party on the right offers the most disconcerting spectacle that any election has witnessed. Faced with charges that he gave his wife and children fake jobs to the tune of nearly a million dollars on Parliament\u2019s payroll, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a conservative former prime minister who is now the Republican candidate, has stopped campaigning. All his energy is spent fighting those allegations and vowing again and again to fight on. Back-room negotiations involving party barons have failed to produce an alternative candidate, nor to persuade Mr. Fillon to quit. Senior aides and allied politicians have deserted him. Increasingly desperate, he has taken on the judges investigating his case, accusing them and the press of carrying out \u201ca political assassination\u201d and trying to \u201ckill the presidential election.\u201d France, he claims, is in a state of \u201cquasi civil war.\u201dSo Marine Le Pen can stay put: Mr. Fillon does the job for her. She has judicial worries of her own over fake jobs for National Front aides at the European Parliament, but who cares when so much attention is focused on her rival?The party of the traditional right used to be Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s well-oiled, ruthless political machine. It now looks like a ruin in a war zone. As Mr. Trump would put it: This is a mess. He would love it.This is the great political battle for the heart and soul of Europe. With the approach on March 25 of the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, the founding document of European unity, France\u2019s partners in the European Union are anxiously watching every step of this campaign. In Berlin, the anxiety borders on panic: Never have the stakes been higher for the future of the European project. Despised by the American president, attacked by Russia, abandoned by Britain, the European Union, with France and Germany as its pillars, needs to regroup for a new start. The election in France of a far-right, Europhobic president vowing to leave the eurozone would kill that dream. Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, told Der Tagesspiegel last week that a Le Pen victory would bring \u201cthe E.U. to the edge of the abyss.\u201dWill France stop the wave of populism? This is what this election is about. Some experts are already speculating that if the National Front leader is elected, she will not be able to muster a majority in Parliament in the June election. The most likely result would then be a \u201ccohabitation,\u201d in which a President Le Pen would have to work with a center-right or center-left prime minister and government. In that case, the two blocs would have to negotiate a compromise on some crucial issues; the first would be saving the euro.This is where we are. As the saying goes, let\u2019s hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.Sylvie Kauffmann, the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trumpcare vs. Obamacare: Apocalypse Foretold", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byLet me offer one assertion and ask two questions.The assertion is that something like this was to be expected. The C.B.O. came in even worse on coverage than most predicted, but it was obvious that the news would be terrible because that\u2019s what the logic of the situation told us. Obamacare imposes a mandate to induce healthy people to sign up, offers means-tested subsidies to make insurance affordable and expands Medicaid to take care of people with really low incomes. Trumpcare eliminates the mandate, slashes subsidies overall and redirects them to those who don\u2019t need them and sharply cuts Medicaid. Of course that leads to a huge drop in coverage.Or to put it differently, Obamacare is actually an intelligently designed system, and Republican claims that they could do much better even while slashing funding so they could cut taxes on the rich were always obvious nonsense. Trumpcare is a slapdash, incompetent piece of legislation; but even a much more competent set of people couldn\u2019t have done better given the constraints of Republican Party ideology.Again, I wouldn\u2019t count out the possibility that this law will be rammed through regardless, with budget analyses relegated to the category of fake news. Democrats might even want to hope that this happens, so that there is no question about who to blame if insurance collapses. But the lemming-like way Republicans rushed into this disaster is still amazing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raiders Leaving Oakland Again, This Time for Las Vegas", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byThe N.F.L. gave its approval on Monday for the Oakland Raiders to move to Las Vegas, casting aside decades of fears that putting a team in the gambling capital would corrupt the sport, while sending the team to a new and growing market but one that is far smaller.The team owners, meeting in Phoenix, voted overwhelmingly, 31-1, persuaded that having a team in Las Vegas would allow the league to capitalize on the city\u2019s booming tourist trade and image of excitement, and on its willingness to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars toward the construction of a new stadium.For years, major leagues steered clear of Las Vegas because some owners worried that putting a team there would lead more players and referees to rub elbows with unsavory characters from the gambling world trying to influence games. But such attitudes have faded with the growth and acceptance of gambling around the country, and with the city\u2019s reduced reliance on revenue from its many casinos.The N.H.L. agreed last year to create a team in Las Vegas, the Golden Knights, that will begin play this year.The Raiders, known for a passionate fan base that delights in a rough-hewed image, are likely to begin playing in Las Vegas as soon as 2019, in temporary quarters, with the lease at their current stadium expiring after the 2018 season. In 2020, they are expected to move into a nearly $2 billion stadium, with $750 million in public financing, an arrangement that helped attract the league\u2019s interest. The rest of the money was expected to come from a $600 million loan from Bank of America to the team, $200 million from the league and revenue from naming rights and other deals.\u201cWe know that some fans will be disappointed and even angry,\u201d said Mark Davis, the Raiders\u2019 principal owner. \u201cBut we hope they do not direct that frustration to the players, coaches and staff.\u201dLibby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, said that losing the team would tear at the city\u2019s psyche and pride, and that the league would regret its decision.\u201cThe Raider nation is the last of the blue-collar, salt-of-the-earth fan bases, and it absolutely breaks my heart to lose this team,\u201d she said.The team will become the first to leave its home city, return and then leave again. The Raiders are also the third N.F.L. team to move, or announce a move, in a little more than a year, ending a period of turmoil in which the owners agreed to abandon longtime N.F.L. cities that were unable to appease the owners\u2019 desire for bigger markets and more public financing for new stadiums.Last year, the Rams left St. Louis for Los Angeles, and then the Chargers announced that they would leave San Diego to move in with the Rams, starting in the fall.Davis said repeatedly that he was frustrated with the efforts by lawmakers in California to replace the team\u2019s current home, Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, one of the oldest stadiums in the league.Unlike the Rams and the Chargers, who left immediately for their new homes, the Raiders will remain in Oakland for at least two more seasons while their new home is built, creating the specter of awkward lame-duck seasons. Davis said the team would continue to be called the Oakland Raiders during that time.Only Stephen M. Ross, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, voted against the deal. He said in a statement after the vote that not all the options to stay in Oakland had been exhausted. Other owners voted reluctantly for the move because, they said, the league would be leaving the sixth-biggest television market in the country for the 40th-largest. Oakland is also in the booming San Francisco Bay Area, home to some of the wealthiest fans and sponsors in the country.Las Vegas is recovering from one of the most brutal recessions in its history. Unemployment in Clark County, Nev., was 5.1 percent in January, compared with 14.1 percent in 2010.A region that was once the face of the foreclosure crisis is turning around, economists say. Las Vegas, which long led the nation in foreclosures, was ranked No. 22 in February, according to Attom Data Solutions, a housing tracker. The median price of a house in the Las Vegas region was $199,000 in January, a nearly 5 percent jump over the year before, still a far cry from the booming housing market in Oakland.And revenue from gambling \u2014 a key marker for tracking the health of the economy \u2014 increased 2.7 percent statewide compared with six months ago, according to the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.The league owners preferred the certainty of a substantial amount of tax dollars for a stadium over uncertain prospects for the team in Oakland, where Ms. Schaaf said often that her city could not afford to pay for the construction of a new stadium. She suggested it could provide the land and infrastructure improvements, and said she was working with Fortress Investments to secure construction financing. Yet in a letter he sent to the mayor last week, Commissioner Roger Goodell said that was not enough, all but sealing the team\u2019s fate.While the league\u2019s stance on Las Vegas has softened, it continues to uphold rules that prevent owners from holding stakes in gambling operations. That was a big reason that Davis ended his dalliance with Sheldon Adelson, the chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corp., who offered to pay for part of a new stadium in Las Vegas.The Raiders will be the second major team to go to Las Vegas, after the N.H.L. team, and there has been talk of Major League Baseball, M.L.S. and the N.B.A. moving to Las Vegas as well.The moves by the Rams, the Chargers and the Raiders ended a long period of relative stability. They were the first franchises to move in the league since the mid-1990s, when the Browns moved to Baltimore, the Rams to St. Louis and the Oilers to Tennessee.The decision to let the teams move has been wrenching and filled with vitriol. Lawmakers in St. Louis approved funding for a new stadium for the Rams, yet the N.F.L. owners rejected their efforts in favor of a proposal by the Rams\u2019 owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, to pay for a $2.6 billion stadium in Inglewood, Calif., south of downtown Los Angeles.After trying for years to get a new stadium in San Diego, the Chargers applied to move to Los Angeles in 2015. When the owners chose the Rams instead, the Chargers did an about-face and backed a referendum that would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars for a stadium in downtown San Diego. Voters soundly rejected the proposal.The Raiders, though, have a much wider following, in Oakland and across the nation. The team got its start as a charter member of the American Football League in 1960, then went to the N.F.L. when the leagues merged in 1970. After two Super Bowl victories in Oakland, the team owner Al Davis defied the other owners and moved to Los Angeles for the 1982 season, only to return to Oakland in 1995 after the city agreed to expand the Coliseum for him.The team\u2019s tough image delighted the port city\u2019s working-class fans, who earned a reputation for tormenting visiting players. Fans sitting in the \u201cBlack Hole,\u201d a cheering section near the field, perpetuated the team\u2019s menacing reputation.But as team after team moved into new stadiums over the last decade, and as the teams\u2019 valuations soared, Mark Davis, who took over ownership when Al Davis died in 2011, started to complain openly about his team\u2019s stadium.The team is the only one in the league that shares a building with a baseball team, the Oakland A\u2019s, and the Raiders are among the teams that generate the least amount of revenue from their home games, lacking the fancy suites and epicurean dining options that other stadiums have.Yet fans continue to flock to their games, including last season, when the team was 12-4 and, after 13 seasons without a playoff appearance, made the wild-card game, in which it lost to the Texans.Now it is Oakland that will be losing the Raiders. Again.Adam Nagourney and Michael Powell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The lakes are the source of drinking water for 45 million people \u2014 including 10 million in Ontario, about 90 percent of its population.

Since it was established in 2009 by President Barack Obama, over $2.2 billion has gone to fund more than 2,000 projects across eight states. The projects have been aimed at removing toxic waste, restoring wildlife habitats and girding against invasive species such as the Asian Carp in the vast freshwater bodies, which hold one-fifth of the world\u2019s fresh surface water. Canada contributes over $13 million in annual funding for Great Lakes restoration, government officials said.Although the budget cuts would target projects in the United States, Canadian towns and cities that rely on the lake system would also be affected, advocates say. These include five binational Areas of Concern, like the Detroit River, a long-polluted waterway between Ontario and Michigan, as well as nutrient management projects in Lake Erie that focus on preventing algae blooms triggered by industrial contaminants.Since word of the proposed cuts to the program leaked earlier this month, dozens of Canadian mayors and other officials have spoken out about the harm their cities and towns would suffer if the proposal were to go into effect.\u201cAs the largest city on Lake Huron, the cuts will undo decades of work by many to clean up the Great Lakes on both sides of the border,\u201d said Mayor Mike Bradley of Sarnia, Ontario. \u201cWhat good is it having lower taxes when you can\u2019t drink the water?\u201dSarnia, at the mouth of the St. Clair River, on the Michigan border, began working to remove water contamination in 1985, when the city discovered a 200-foot-long oily slick of pollution beneath the river that turned out to be 2,900 gallons of perchloroethylene, a chemical used for dry cleaning that had been spilled by a nearby Dow Chemical plant. Despite marked progress in cleaning up the river and surrounding habitats, the city remains designated as an Area of Concern by the Canadian government.Residents and politicians on both sides of the border say they are mystified by the proposed budget cuts, which they say would do massive damage to waters still reeling from decades of industrial contamination.A large amount of the program\u2019s funding has in past years gone toward preventing toxic algae blooms, like one in 2014 that forced the city of Toledo, Ohio, to temporarily shut off its water intake system after samples were found to contain microcystin, which can cause liver and kidney damage and respiratory failure. Earlier this month, the Ontario and Canadian governments released a draft action plan to reduce algae blooms in Lake Erie, part of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement with the United States.Mark Mattson, president of Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, an environmental advocacy group based in Toronto, said the proposed elimination of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative would threaten the region\u2019s $7 billion fishery. The cuts would end infrastructure plans to prevent the spread of the Asian carp, an invasive species brought to the United States 40 years ago to eat algae. It has destroyed numerous fisheries and is making its way toward the Great Lakes.\u201cWe\u2019re at a crossroads,\u201d Mr. Mattson said. \u201cCanada is going to have to lead by example and show the U.S. this isn\u2019t the right direction.\u201dAn article on Saturday about fears among Canadian environmental advocates that President Trump\u2019s budget will devastate the Great Lakes misspelled the surname of the president of Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, an advocacy group based in Toronto. He is Mark Mattson, not Mattsen.Advertisement"}

America is now governed by a president and party that fundamentally don\u2019t accept the idea that there are objective facts. Instead, they want everyone to accept that reality is whatever they say it is.So we\u2019re just supposed to believe the president if he says, falsely, that his inauguration crowd was the biggest ever; if he claims, ludicrously, that millions of votes were cast illegally for his opponent; if he insists, with no evidence, that his predecessor tapped his phones.And it\u2019s not just about serving one man\u2019s vanity. If you want to see how this attitude can hurt millions of people, consider the state of play on health care reform.And as for the likely impacts of Trumpcare \u2014 well, they literally don\u2019t want to know.But Republicans rammed Trumpcare through key committees, literally in the dead of night, without waiting for the C.B.O. score \u2014 and they have been pre-emptively denouncing the budget office, which is likely to find that the bill would cause millions to lose health coverage.But this isn\u2019t really about whose analyses of health policy are most likely to get it right.

{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s \u2018Merit-Based\u2019 Immigration System Might Work", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump\u2019s remarks in the speech focused instead on the merit-based system. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially, yet in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSwitching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.\u201dBut such a system is viewed with skepticism by some Republicans who fear it would harm the economy by shutting out less-educated immigrants who fill vital jobs, such as farm and kitchen workers.\u201cIt sounds great just to bring the total brainiac, most skilled people here, but when you look at the economy, it\u2019s not that simple \u2014 you need the brainiacs, but you need the low-skilled people as well,\u201d said Tamar Jacoby, the president of ImmigrationWorks USA, who advises Republicans on immigration issues.Democrats and those on the left have an even more sinister view of the idea, arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on choosing the most skilled immigrants is a backdoor way to re-engineer American laws to filter out certain ethnicities and nationalities.A vast majority of immigrants admitted to the United States are granted entry based on their family ties. Less than one-fifth are admitted through job-based preferences, and a similarly small number come in through refugee or asylum programs.United States citizens may sponsor immediate family members \u2014 spouses, minor children and parents \u2014 for visas that are not subject to any caps. Their siblings and adult children get preferences under a program that provides a limited number of visas each year to citizens\u2019 relatives. Legal permanent residents, those who have green cards, can also apply for visas for their spouses and children.In 2014, of more than one million legal permanent residents admitted, 64 percent were either immediate relatives of American citizens or had been sponsored by family members. Fifteen percent received an employment-based preference and 13 percent came with refugee or asylum status, according to data compiled by the Migration Policy Institute, an independent research organization. An additional 5 percent were admitted through the State Department\u2019s diversity lottery, a program that awards permanent residency to people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.A points system was a feature of the 2007 immigration proposal that died in the Senate. Under that measure, employment attributes like education and skills would have accounted for more points than family relationships. Immigrants with family members living legally in the United States, either as citizens or permanent residents, would have seen their visa preferences ended or strictly limited. But employment-based visas would have increased substantially.In that measure, temporary workers would have been barred from bringing family members to the United States unless they accepted a shorter-term visa and could show they would not become primarily dependent on government benefits. Mr. Trump\u2019s mention in his speech of financial self-sufficiency for immigrants seemed to suggest he would favor such a standard.Mr. Trump argued that the current immigration system is \u201cstraining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon,\u201d and made the case that one based on merit would provide an economic boost to American workers.\u201cIt will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s assertion is based on the view that because the current system allows people to immigrate to the United States without regard for their employability or skill level, it creates an oversupply of low-skilled workers, who in turn drive down job opportunities and wages for Americans with a high school diploma or less.Critics of the merit-based system say the reality is not so simple.The number of family-based immigrants who enter the United States each year is a tiny fraction of the total work force, and there is no guarantee that reducing the number of those immigrants or substituting people with better education and skills would increase either wages or employment opportunity.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a rationale for increasing the number of people who get permanent residency who employers want to hire for both lower-skilled jobs and higher-skilled jobs, but there\u2019s no reason that can\u2019t be accomplished without still allowing people to bring family members in,\u201d said Stuart Anderson, the executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan policy research organization, and a former senior immigration official under Mr. Bush.\u201cThis is more of a political rationalization for just cutting out family categories, rather than some belief that if we got more highly skilled people, it would genuinely help the economy,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Easing Emissions Rule, Vows to Expand Auto Jobs", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byYPSILANTI, Mich. \u2014 President Trump came to the heart of the auto industry on Wednesday with a manifesto for American manufacturing: to remove the shackles of regulation and restore an age of industrial glory.Granting the automakers their top wish, Mr. Trump halted an initiative by the Obama administration to impose stringent fuel-economy standards by 2025 \u2014 rules meant to cut carbon emissions and meet international commitments to address climate change.Instead, Mr. Trump vowed to keep cutting regulations as a means to accelerate economic growth and add new jobs.\u201cThe assault on the American auto industry is over,\u201d he declared.The move to reopen the government\u2019s review of the standards will allow automakers to argue for less stringent \u2014 and less costly \u2014 mileage standards than the target of 54.5 miles per gallon set in 2012 by President Barack Obama.But the Trump administration is expecting things from the automakers in return for its pro-industry stance: new American jobs, and less investment in foreign operations.And while Mr. Trump vowed to improve business conditions at home, he pledged again to stop the flow of automotive investment and jobs to Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he termed \u201ca total disaster.\u201d\u201cWe want to be the car capital of the world again,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd we will be.\u201dBut Mr. Trump had little to say about climate change or fuel prices on Wednesday, preferring to focus on his evolving economic doctrine, which he termed \u201cthe American model\u201d for stimulating growth and business expansion.\u201cUnder this system, we will reduce burdens on our companies and on our businesses,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut, in exchange, companies must hire and grow in America.\u201dHis policies will get their initial test with an auto industry that was was brought to its knees by the recession eight years ago and required an $80 billion taxpayer bailout, including the government-sponsored bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler.But now the industry is coming off two straight years of record sales in the United States, and automakers are flush with profits.By acceding to the automakers\u2019 plea for regulatory relief, Mr. Trump is challenging them to funnel more resources into their American manufacturing operations.One auto industry analyst said the decision to reopen fuel-economy negotiations appears to have been brokered during meetings between the president and the chief executives of the three big American automakers \u2014 G.M., Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler \u2014 shortly after he took office.\u201cWe believe an \u2018art of the deal\u2019 may have been struck trading jobs for regulatory relief,\u201d the analyst, Brian Johnson of Barclays, wrote in a letter to investors on Wednesday.Detroit auto executives have been tight-lipped about their give-and-take with the White House. All three companies have, however, already made promises to add or retain thousands of American jobs in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s previous criticisms of their investments in Mexico.And just hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Wednesday, G.M. said it would create 220 additional jobs in a Michigan transmission plant and retain 680 workers who were facing layoffs at another factory.Without mentioning the president\u2019s decision on fuel standards, G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the new and preserved jobs underscored the \u201coverall positive outlook for the auto industry and the U.S. economy.\u201dMr. Trump called G.M.\u2019s move \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of a new era of job growth in the industry. \u201cThat\u2019s peanuts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot more. They\u2019re going to be building new plants, expanding their plants.\u201dBut automakers may be hard-pressed to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s expectations.The financial collapse of the industry during the recession is still a fresh memory, and companies have streamlined their manufacturing operations to eliminate costly excess capacity.Adding new plants in a market at its peak could upset the industry\u2019s steady recovery and jeopardize the big profits earned in recent years on larger vehicles like pickups and sport utility vehicles.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.Automakers are also spending heavily on new technology for autonomous vehicles, yet they are not near the point of building plants to produce self-driving models.And despite the blooming partnership between the industry and the Trump administration, there are lingering worries among automakers about the potential for a border tax on imports from Mexico and elsewhere.A tax on imported models could raise prices on several vehicles in high demand by American consumers, including pickup trucks made in Mexico by G.M. and Fiat Chrysler.But Mr. Trump has an unlikely ally in Detroit for a tax on Mexican imports: the United Automobile Workers union, which supports his plan to renegotiate Nafta.The union\u2019s president, Dennis Williams, has praised Mr. Trump for his position on Mexican trade. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hollering about this for 20 years and he is the first president who has brought this up,\u201d Mr. Williams said last month in a meeting with reporters. He was less supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s move to cut back on fuel-economy rules, noting that consumers benefit directly from improved mileage on new cars and trucks.Despite reopening the review of the fuel standards, Mr. Trump notably did not initiate any action to revoke the waivers of states, in particular California, to set their own emissions rules. That leaves California with the ability, for now, to impose stricter standards than whatever is ultimately decided by federal regulators.The review of the fuel rules will now stretch into 2018, and environmental groups are preparing for a fierce debate on the need for strict standards to combat climate change.\u201cThe future of the U.S. auto industry is at stake, and Mr. Trump is being shortsighted,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign.Mr. Becker and other environmental activists argue that the auto companies have the technology necessary to meet the 2025 standards set by the Obama administration. Moreover, they contend that any increase in sticker prices from fuel-saving equipment would be more than offset by savings consumers get at the gas pump.Coral Davenport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Major League Soccer, Argentines Find a Home and Success", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byGuillermo Barros Schelotto was not the first Argentine player to set foot on a Major League Soccer field. Statistically speaking, he was the 28th when he made his debut for the Columbus Crew in 2007.But Schelotto\u2019s phone still rings to this day, more than six years after he left the league, with calls from fellow Argentines looking for advice. Though Schelotto, 43, is currently the coach of Boca Juniors, the most decorated team in Argentina, most of the players who call him want to talk about other teams, about other countries, about a soccer world away from the pressure-cooker environment of Buenos Aires.\u201cMost of them like to talk about the cities,\u201d Schelotto said. Many of them find a way to come.Argentines now make up the second-largest demographic in M.L.S., trailing only Americans. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, going into this season\u2019s openers, 98 Argentine players had been featured in an M.L.S. regular-season game since the league\u2019s inception. Sebastian Blanco, a new designated player for Portland, made his debut in an opener Friday and became No. 99.In a ranking by nationality, Argentines have the second-highest goal total, too. Twelve of the 22 teams in M.L.S. will start the season with at least one Argentine on their roster, a list that includes stars like Dallas\u2019s Mauro Diaz and Montreal\u2019s Ignacio Piatti and newcomers like Atlanta\u2019s Hector Villalba and New York City F.C.\u2019s Maxi Moralez.Why do they come? For some it\u2019s the money, or at least the promise that it will be paid regularly. Others come for the lifestyle, the chance to fade into a comparative anonymity unavailable to them at home, or to live the \u201cquiet, clean\u201d life that Schelotto describes as he reminisces about his days in Ohio.The Portland Timbers playmaker Diego Valeri was one such player who called Schelotto, his former manager, and he eventually heeded his advice. But he said it was for an entirely different reason.\u201cAfter that moment,\u201d Valeri said with considerable understatement, \u201cwe thought about opportunities to play outside and know different places in the world.\u201dWithin a year, Valeri, who had had loan spells in Portugal and Spain, was on his way to Portland. \u201cSituations like that are very hard for the Argentinian people to change,\u201d he said.The 30-year-old Valeri and his family are now settled in the Northwest, where he is playing arguably the best soccer of his career. He is a two-time All-Star, and in between was named the most valuable player when Portland won the 2015 M.L.S. Cup championship game.\u201cI think they like the anonymity and the tranquillity here,\u201d Caleb Porter, Valeri\u2019s coach with the Timbers, said of his star and his countrymen. \u201cThey really relish the opportunity to be here and to live a lifestyle that\u2019s different to how they lived in Argentina. They transition well into M.L.S.\u201dSince 2011, Portland has signed six Argentines, including its off-season acquisition of Blanco, 28. Valeri has been a good ambassador \u2014 he speaks English and urges newcomers to try to learn it as soon as possible, to ease the transition. But Porter and the Timbers\u2019 general manager and president of soccer, Gavin Wilkinson, believe there is another, more straightforward reason for Argentina\u2019s outsize presence in M.L.S.: It simply produces the kind of technical player that the league desires.\u201cCertain countries produce certain positions more,\u201d Porter said. \u201cMost teams are looking for that creative piece, and you know you can get one in Argentina.\u201dA large alumni directory and strong ties to agents and consultants in the region have made that kind of shopping easier for M.L.S. teams, and in the past the struggles of the Argentine economy also favored North American clubs, some said.But there also has been a change in the kind of individual looking to make the move north, and that has dovetailed with the league\u2019s overall transfer policy.\u201cThey know that M.L.S. is different to 10 years ago,\u201d said Schelotto, who was 34 when he moved to the league. \u201cThey can go, make good money, play with some pressure. They know they can make a career in the United States and then maybe move to Europe.\u201cTen years ago, it was impossible. Right now, you can.\u201dThere are currently 24 Argentines playing in the league. Atlanta United and its Argentine coach, Tata Martino, brought in three ahead of its first season, each of them 25 or younger (Villalba is just 22). Buying young is now seen as more of a benefit to clubs than a risk, as players who continue to develop retain a sell-on value if they move on to brighter prospects in Europe.\u201cPeople are coming here younger and younger, maybe to start their careers,\u201d Ignacio Piatti, a 32-year-old playmaker for the Montreal Impact, said through an interpreter. \u201cIt\u2019s what they are looking for at that age: being able to live a comfortable life off the field and focus on their games.\u201dPiatti, like Schelotto, has been happy to offer advice to the next wave of Argentine talents considering entering M.L.S., including players on both sides of the Hudson River. Gonzalo Veron, 27, of the Red Bulls, and Moralez, 30, who recently signed with New York City F.C., both acknowledged that they had turned to Piatti for advice before signing.At a community event in East Harlem last week, Moralez \u2014 who spent four years in Italy \u2014 reflected on his decision to move to the United States. He had never been to New York City before signing, he said, and after turning to the likes of Piatti and David Villa for advice about the league\u2019s standard of play, he said he also sought assurances for his family, who are set to join him in New York shortly.\u201cFirst off, I just want to enjoy football,\u201d Moralez said. \u201cBut also to get to know the beauty of the city and the country. Not everybody gets the opportunity to come here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iceland, Symbol of Financial Crisis, Finally Lifts Capital Controls", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byNine years after a giant banking crash made Iceland a symbol of the global financial crisis, the government on Tuesday effectively declared that financial stability had been restored as it ended longstanding restrictions on the flow of money into and out of the country.Iceland\u2019s growth surge \u2014 the economy expanded 7.2 percent last year \u2014 represents a remarkable comeback since 2008, when the country\u2019s three main banks failed and its currency and economy fell into a tailspin. To prevent an outright collapse, the government imposed capital controls on businesses, pensioners and individuals.\u201cWithout the capital controls, Iceland would have suffered a much more serious fate,\u201d said Yngvi Kristinsson, the chief economist for the Icelandic Financial Services Association, a consortium of banks and insurance companies.Although untested at the time, the capital controls played a pivotal role in stopping panicked foreign investors and others from taking money out of Iceland and decimating its economy even further.Initially designated for six months, they dragged on for nearly a decade as financial authorities restructured debts and sought to diversify the economy, which had thrived on fishing exports before pivoting to the lucrative, and ultimately perilous, realm of international finance. In that time, the government has been locked in a longstanding dispute with international investors, after freezing their assets amid the crash.Iceland, a Nordic island nation of 330,000, has gradually been easing the controls for more than a year now, and their full removal on Tuesday signifies the country\u2019s return to international financial markets.Countries generally try to avoid using capital controls except in desperate circumstances because restrictions on the free flow of funds can cripple businesses and cause hardship for households short of cash.The capital controls have hit companies by deterring investment and raising borrowing costs. Their removal should help Icelandic firms that had not been allowed to invest in new operations outside the country.\u201cGood riddance,\u201d said Georg Ludviksson, the chief executive and a founder of Meniga, a digital banking software vendor based in Reykjavik. The company, with 80 employees, almost could not get 3.5 million euros, or $3.7 million, in foreign venture capital when it was set up in 2009.\u201cIt was hard to convince foreign investors to bring money into a country with capital controls,\u201d Mr. Ludviksson said. The company had to apply to the central bank for an exception, which \u201cslowed us down,\u201d he added.The combined assets of Iceland\u2019s three biggest banks were 14 times the size of the nation\u2019s economic output when the 2008 crisis hit. When the industry collapsed under $85 billion in debt, foreigners owned such a huge chunk of that figure that allowing them to take assets out would risk severely devaluing Iceland\u2019s currency, the krona.The country\u2019s success in engineering a recovery stands in contrast to the efforts of Greece, which uses the euro and does not have its own currency to manage.Greece has continued to falter since Athens imposed capital controls in 2015 as the country seemed to be veering toward abandoning the euro. Some restrictions have been eased, but they are mostly expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future. As long as Greece, now in its third international financial rescue program in seven years, continues to labor under a huge debt, economists see little hope of a recovery.Iceland, by comparison, did not have a huge national debt overhang, although corporations and individuals owed large sums after the financial crash, which some are still working off.The government, working with the International Monetary Fund, took steps to ward off future crises, including strengthening regulatory oversight of banks and curbing foreign currency loans. The authorities also sought to tamp down the oversize presence of banks in the economy by encouraging growth in tourism, fisheries, tech start-ups and renewable energy.With the cheap krona, tourism took off much faster than other new ventures because visitors could see the northern lights and the rugged Icelandic landscape at a steep discount.Today, tourism has exploded into Iceland\u2019s biggest industry, overtaking fishing and banking. With the number of visitors approaching two million a year, tourism revenue topped $3 billion in 2015, a third of the country\u2019s export earnings. Tourism is also the single biggest employer, accounting for a tenth of jobs.Over all, the unemployment rate has fallen to a near record low of 2.6 percent. Double-digit wage increases are crimping productivity and may encourage inflation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Many Icelanders are pouring money into services and new construction, and cranes keep rising across the country.And that seems to be the rub \u2014 in a bid to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on finance, Icelanders are wondering if they may have planted the seeds of another bubble.The current boom is healthier than the growth in the years leading up to the 2008 crash, which was driven by the flow of foreign funds, said Asgeir Jonsson, an economics professor at the University of Iceland.Still, growth in the past six years \u201chas been led by mainly one sector of the economy,\u201d he noted.\u201cIceland has become a very expensive destination, but the tourism sector keeps heating the economy,\u201d Mr. Jonsson said. \u201cWhat can be done to slow it, ban more visitors? Hardly.\u201dA picture caption on March 15 with an article about the lifting of capital controls in Iceland, where the economy has been improving, misstated the type of construction equipment shown.

Trump has become the first president to formally propose eliminating federal programs for the arts and humanities, which have long been in the cross hairs of Republicans, and the threat is all the more real because the party also controls Congress.But even with one-party control in Washington, the fates of the arts endowment and the National Endowment for the Humanities are far from sealed.Several key Republican lawmakers are expressing support for the programs, which, since their near-death experiences during the culture wars of a generation ago, have taken pains to counter accusations of coastal elitism by making sure to distribute their grants widely across all 50 states.And the contours of the political battle itself have changed since those earlier fights in the 1980s and \u201990s. The arguments then were over ideology, taste, free speech and the size of government; today they are about economic investment, federal priorities and how people feel about Mr. Trump remaking America to his liking.Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who is the chairwoman of a crucial Senate appropriations panel that oversees the endowments, said in a statement, \u201cI believe we can find a way to commit to fiscal responsibility while continuing to support the important benefits that N.E.A. and N.E.H. provide.\u201dAnd there were warm words among some Republicans in the House as well. Representative Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican who is on the House appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the endowments budget, said in a statement, \u201cI support the present level of funding for these programs.\u201dBut the new paradigm also means that the money is spread so thin, with the awarding of many small grants, that it could bolster the arguments of opponents of the endowment who say the lost money could be made up elsewhere.Proponents of preserving endowment grants are increasingly speaking of them in terms that many Republicans can love \u2014 as investments that spur job creation; as public-private partnerships that award grants that are matched by private donations; and as programs that help returning veterans or people who live in rural communities.Representative Leonard Lance, a New Jersey Republican who is co-chairman of the Congressional Arts Caucus, said that as he tries to marshal support for the arts endowment among his colleagues, he is focusing on the jobs it supports not just in the arts sector but in tourism, restaurants and other fields as well.\u201cI will try to be persuasive that there is a tremendous multiplier effect \u2014 that this brings in revenue to the government,\u201d he said.Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s budget director, said at a news conference on Thursday that President Trump had \u201ccompletely defensible\u201d reasons for wanting to \u201cdefund\u201d the two endowments, along with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\u201cI put myself in the shoes of that steelworker in Ohio,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cThe coal miner \u2014 the coal-mining family in West Virginia. The mother of two in Detroit. And I\u2019m saying, \u2018O.K., I have to go ask these folks for money and I have to tell them where I\u2019m going to spend it.\u2019 Can I really go to those folks, look them in the eye, and say, \u2018Look, I want to take money from you and I want to give it to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting\u2019? \u201dMembers of Congress will hear next week from hundreds of activists who were already planning to gather in Washington on Monday and Tuesday to lobby for the arts. The announcement that the president is seeking to eliminate the endowments gave them a sense of added urgency, if not emergency. Robert L. Lynch, the president of Americans for the Arts, an arts advocacy group that has been a player in past battles to save the endowment, said, \u201cWe will hit every congressional office, every senatorial office, with our message.\u201dEven some opponents of the endowments concede that they have a fight on their hands. Mr. Buchanan \u2014 who once described the arts agency as \u201cthe upholstered playpen of the arts and crafts auxiliary of the Eastern liberal establishment\u201d \u2014 said that he gave President Trump credit for trying to eliminate it, but that its demise was far from assured.\u201cMy guess is \u2014 and it always happens \u2014 that you come out very strong on the opening day,\u201d he said, \u201cand the arts community and the others will get to the Republicans and others and try to at least preserve these and keep them alive through the Trump era.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In One Rocky Week, Trump\u2019s Self-Inflicted Chaos on Vivid Display", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byWhite House memoWASHINGTON \u2014 Minutes before President Trump was to take the stage in Nashville last week to make his case for the health care overhaul he had promised, he received some unwelcome news that shifted his script.A Federal District Court judge in Hawaii had just placed another stay on his ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries, dealing his order a second legal setback in two months. As a country music duo crooned in an auditorium still filling with adoring supporters of Mr. Trump, the president fumed backstage and huddled with his staff for a hasty redrafting of the speech.When Mr. Trump emerged, he decided to relegate the health care overhaul, which he has identified as a top domestic priority, to a brief mention more than halfway through the speech. He instead replaced its prime billing with an angry diatribe against the travel ban ruling and the judge who had issued it.\u201cI have to be nice, otherwise I\u2019ll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts,\u201d he said. But he could not help himself: The president soon suggested that the court that had just ruled against him should be destroyed. \u201cPeople are screaming, \u2018Break up the Ninth Circuit!\u2019 \u201dOnce again, Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda was subsumed by problems of his own making, his message undercut by a seemingly endless stream of controversy he cannot seem to stop himself from feeding.The health care measure appears on track for a House vote this week, and the president, who planned a weekend of relaxation at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach, Fla., club, is likely to receive a large measure of the credit. But it has also become clear that Mr. Trump, an agitator incapable of responding proportionately to any slight, appears hellbent on squandering his honeymoon.Instead, he has sowed chaos in his own West Wing, and talked or tweeted his way into trouble, over and over again.That was never more apparent than over the last week, when fresh questions about his refusal to release his tax returns and the blocking of his executive order sapped the spotlight from his efforts to build support for the health measure and even the unveiling of his first budget.Even more self-lacerating: his insistence that President Barack Obama had authorized surveillance on his 2016 campaign, a claim that continued unabated despite rebukes from Republicans, denials by the congressional intelligence committees and complaints from the British government after Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman suggested that one of its intelligence agencies had aided in the spying.\u201cIt\u2019s a pattern with him \u2014 he sometimes counterpunches so hard he hits himself,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary for George W. Bush.The public outbursts are mirrored by internal tensions. With the embers of the old rivalry extinguished between his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and chief of staff, Reince Priebus, a new realignment has emerged in a West Wing already rived by suspicion and intrigue.In the newness of the administration, the constant need to tend to internal dynamics has been a distraction. The aides have watched each other warily and tried tending to the president\u2019s base of supporters amid a sea of appointments of people who worked on Wall Street.Mr. Trump is not bothered by turf battles in his administration. He believes they foster competition and keep any one aide from accumulating too much power. He is even more enthusiastic about waging war publicly, believing that it fires up his white working-class base.Indeed, in Nashville on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump spoke to a rapturous crowd of almost 10,000 people and his embattled spokesman, Sean Spicer, was greeted as a star by awe-struck supporters, who spent several minutes crowding around him to take pictures and pat him on the back.But in Washington, some Republican lawmakers and officials have watched in dismay and frustration, they say privately, because the president they are looking to for cover and salesmanship of the health care overhaul keeps getting sidetracked.One of those diversions came after the judge\u2019s ruling on the travel ban. In Nashville, the president said he would prefer to go back to his first, more restrictive ban and pursue it to the Supreme Court. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to do in the first place,\u201d Mr. Trump said, a statement that seems destined to be used against his own lawyers in upcoming court cases on the executive order.For Mr. Trump, this was supposed to be a week of pivoting and message discipline. The president read from a script during public appearances and posted on Twitter less often. He invited lawmakers from both parties to the White House for strategy sessions on the health measure. He scheduled policy speeches, like one near Detroit, where he announced that he was halting fuel economy standards imposed by Mr. Obama, and the rally in Nashville, where he visited the grave of Andrew Jackson, the populist patron selected by his history-minded political impresario, Mr. Bannon, as Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential analog.But by Friday, as Mr. Trump worked to call attention to his powers of persuasion in securing commitments from a dozen wavering Republicans to back the health measure, the White House was left frantically trying to explain why Mr. Spicer had repeated allegations that the Government Communications Headquarters, the British spy agency, had helped to eavesdrop on the president during the campaign.Rather than expressing regret for a slight of one of the United States\u2019 strongest allies, Mr. Trump was unapologetic.That did not seem to be enough for the irate British, who had called the charge \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cutterly ridiculous.\u201d Shepard Smith, a Fox News anchor, later disavowed it as well, saying his network could not back up Mr. Napolitano\u2019s claims.The episode left little time for talk of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d budget released on Thursday, filled with domestic spending cuts so deep that even his budget director conceded they would be unpopular, or the health care measure that would affect more than 20 percent of the economy.\u201cThis White House is on two tracks,\u201d Mr. Fleischer said. \u201cThe legislative one, which has been surprisingly and pleasantly productive, and the other one full of self-induced error.\u201dThe problem for Mr. Trump, he added, is that the self-destructive behavior, if it continues, threatens to overshadow everything else.\u201cHe has a tremendous number of ingredients at his disposal to be a very successful president,\u201d Mr. Fleischer added, \u201cbut he might not even get credit for it if he is so red-hot controversial.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that the British government had asked for an apology after Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, erroneously suggested that Britain\u2019s intelligence agency had secretly eavesdropped on President Trump at the behest of President Barack Obama. British officials asked and received a promise from senior White House officials never to repeat the allegation, but did not ask for an apology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s New Travel Ban Blocks Migrants From Six Nations, Sparing Iraq", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations, even with changes intended to blunt legal and political opposition.The new order continued to impose a 90-day ban on travelers, but it removed Iraq, a redaction requested by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who feared it would hamper coordination to defeat the Islamic State, according to administration officials.It also exempts permanent residents and current visa holders, and drops language offering preferential status to persecuted religious minorities, a provision widely interpreted as favoring other religious groups over Muslims. In addition, it reversed an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria, replacing it with a 120-day freeze that requires review and renewal.But the heart of the sweeping executive action is still intact, reflecting Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d pledge to safeguard against what he has portrayed as a hidden influx of terrorists and criminals \u2014 a hard-line campaign promise that resonated deeply with white working-class voters.The new order retains central elements of the old one, cutting the number of refugees admitted to the United States each year to 50,000 from about 110,000. Mr. Trump is also leaving open the possibility of expanding the ban to other countries, or even putting Iraq back on the banned list if the country\u2019s leaders fail to comply with a requirement that they increase intelligence sharing, officials said.\u201cUnregulated, unvetted travel is not a universal privilege, especially when national security is at stake,\u201d said John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, appearing alongside Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building in Washington on Monday.Mr. Kelly said the order was now \u201cprospective\u201d and applied \u201conly to foreign nationals outside of the United States\u201d who do not have a valid visa. None of the men took questions.The Trump administration quickly tried to break the legal logjam, filing papers in United States District Court in Washington late on Monday seeking to lift an order blocking the fulfillment of the initial ban.But the president\u2019s revisions did little to halt criticism from Democrats and immigrant rights advocates, who predicted a renewed fight in the courts.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, described the new order as a \u201cwatered-down ban\u201d that was still \u201cmeanspirited and un-American.\u201dMargaret Huang, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement that the new order would \u201ccause extreme fear and uncertainty for thousands of families by, once again, putting anti-Muslim hatred into policy.\u201dThe president\u2019s second attempt at a ban was blocked by federal courts on Wednesday.Administration officials privately conceded that the initial version of the order was a political debacle that damaged Mr. Trump\u2019s nascent presidency. But they were much more sanguine about the second order, arguing that the new, multiagency review process could be used in the future to bend Mr. Trump\u2019s uncompromising messages toward Washington\u2019s bureaucratic realities.Mr. Trump signed the first ban with great fanfare, in front of reporters, at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Islamist terrorists. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country, and love deeply our people.\u201dThis time, the White House issued a photograph of the president signing the order alone at his desk in the Oval Office.Justice Department lawyers said the revisions rendered moot legal cases against the original travel ban. But opponents said the removal of a section that had granted preferential treatment to victims of religious persecution was a cosmetic change that did nothing to alter the order\u2019s prejudicial purpose. Immigrant rights lawyers had argued that the provision was intended to discriminate against Muslims, pointing to recent statements by Mr. Trump.\u201cThis is a retreat, but let\u2019s be clear \u2014 it\u2019s just another run at a Muslim ban,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that sued to stop the first order. \u201cThey can\u2019t unring the bell.\u201dAfter issuing the new travel ban on Monday, the Trump administration filed a notice of the new executive order to halt the legal challenge that is in place for the previous language.Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York and a plaintiff in a suit seeking to block the first order, said his office was reviewing the new ban, adding, \u201cI stand ready to litigate \u2014 again \u2014 in order to protect New York\u2019s families, institutions and economy.\u201dCongressional Republicans, who were split over the first travel ban, had a more muted reaction. But Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who backed the first order, issued a statement saying the revised order \u201cadvances our shared goal of protecting the homeland.\u201dCitizens of Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya will face a 90-day suspension of visa processing as the administration analyzes how to strengthen vetting procedures, according to a homeland security summary of the order.The removal of Iraq from the list came after talks with security officials in Baghdad and at the urging of Mr. Mattis and State Department officials, who have been in communication with Iraqi officials alarmed that the ban will turn public sentiment in their country against the United States.\u201cOn the basis of negotiations that have taken place between the government of Iraq and the U.S. Department of State in the last month, Iraq will increase cooperation with the U.S. government on the vetting of its citizens applying for a visa to travel to the United States,\u201d homeland security officials wrote in a fact sheet given to reporters.Critics say that Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to impose \u201cextreme vetting\u201d on migrants, especially those fleeing the war in Syria, disregards already stringent screening measures, and the fact that none of the recent terrorist attacks or mass shootings on American soil were perpetrated by people from the nations listed in the ban.Homeland security officials, speaking to reporters by telephone on Monday, pushed back against that news report, arguing that it was culled from public sources and excluded classified information that paints a more dangerous picture.An official speaking on the call said the Justice Department had identified 300 \u201crefugees\u201d who were being investigated for their links to Islamist terrorist groups or for holding pro-Islamic State positions. Some of those people already have permanent resident status, the official said.But homeland security and Justice Department officials declined to provide further details, and would not say how many of the 300 people being investigated came from the countries covered by the revised travel ban.Nicholas Kulish contributed reporting from New York, and Scott Shane from Washington.Advertisement"}

Brazilian meat export sales on March 21 fell to just $74,000, compared with a daily average for March of $63 million, commerce officials said.South Africa and Egypt banned imports from Brazilian meatpacking companies named in the scandal, the G1 news site reported, joining at least six other nations \u2014 including China, Japan and Mexico \u2014 and the European Union in announcing restrictions.\u201cThis is clearly a setback in the government\u2019s effort to turn Brazil around,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cIt just contributes to a general notion that things are a bit out of control, that Brazil is rudderless.\u201dBut in recent days there has been a backlash over the investigation as the government has cited what it calls mistakes and misunderstandings in the inquiry.On Sunday, Mr. Maggi said investigators had misunderstood one wiretap to mean cardboard was being put into meat when it referred to packaging.

{"Headline": "Trump Using Detroit as Stage for Loosening Obama\u2019s Fuel Economy Rules", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump traveled to Detroit on Wednesday to announce a rollback of stringent fuel economy standards for cars and trucks that were put in place by the Obama administration \u2014 a welcome message to American automakers but one that could slow the push for a new generation of efficient vehicles.The fuel-economy rules, aimed at cutting heat-trapping carbon dioxide, were one of the two main pillars of President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change legacy. Put forth in 2012, they would have required automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, forcing automakers to speed development of highly fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrid and electric cars.The rules have been widely praised by environmentalists and energy economists for reducing the nation\u2019s dependence on foreign oil and its greenhouse pollution. If put fully into effect, the fuel efficiency standards would have cut oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels and reduced carbon dioxide pollution by about six billion tons over the lifetime of all the cars affected by the regulations.That would have been a little more than the amount of oil consumed and carbon pollution produced by the United States in a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.But automakers said the fuel standards would be technologically hard to achieve and expensive to comply with. In their first Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump, executives from the three Detroit car companies \u2014 General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler \u2014 asked him to revisit and revise his predecessor\u2019s rules.Mr. Trump is using his Detroit trip to tell the executives that he will oblige their request \u2014 and to tell autoworkers that the loosened rules will stimulate the growth of manufacturing jobs.The president\u2019s announcement alone will not be enough to roll back the standards; that will take more than a year of legal and regulatory reviews by the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department. The Trump administration will then propose its replacement fuel-economy standards by April of next year, according to a senior White House official.\u201cThese announcements mean that Mr. Trump is going to live up to his campaign vows, reversing course on climate, destroying much of the Obama legacy in this realm, and increasing these levels of harmful emissions,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University.But automakers have complained for months that the fuel economy standards hurt their bottom lines.On Feb. 21, a coalition of the 17 largest companies that sell cars in the United States sent two letters to Mr. Pruitt, asking him to revisit the tailpipe rules. They said it may be \u201cthe single most important decision the E.P.A. has made in recent history.\u201dThey complained about the steep technical challenge posed by the standard, noting that only about 3.5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it. That even excludes some hybrid cars, plug-in electric cars and fuel cell vehicles, the automakers wrote, adding, \u201cEven today, no conventional vehicle today meets that target.\u201dThe automakers estimated their industry would have to spend a \u201cstaggering\u201d $200 billion between 2012 and 2025 to comply with the rules.They argued that the consumer auto market leans toward gas-guzzling trucks and sport utility vehicles.While automakers are legally locked in to meeting the increasing fuel economy standards through 2021, Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement is expected to signal that the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department will review and revise the standards for model years 2022 through 2025 \u2014 the years in which automakers would be required to most drastically increase vehicle fuel economy.Environmental groups have challenged the automakers\u2019 assertion that fuel-saving technology needed to meet the standards is too costly.The research group Consumers Union has found that the current standards for 2025 will allow consumers to save enough money on gasoline to more than offset any price increases for new technology. \u201cFuel efficiency technology pays for itself and is a boon to car and truck buyers that benefit from the savings greater efficiency offers,\u201d said Shannon Baker-Branstetter, policy counsel for Consumers Union.Meanwhile, economists say, rolling back the standards would increase, rather than decrease, the nation\u2019s oil dependence.The standards \u201caffect U.S. oil dependence by reducing our oil consumption,\u201d said Richard Newell, president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington focused on energy economics.Mr. Trump will not be granting the industry\u2019s request for a broad review of fuel rules free of cost: He is expected to press carmakers to increase investment and add jobs in their manufacturing operations in the United States.During the campaign and since the November election, Mr. Trump has been critical of companies, including G.M. and Ford, for building vehicles in Mexico for the United States market.In response, several automakers have announced plans to add jobs and ramp up investment in existing American factories. Ford went a step further and canceled a new $1.6-billion assembly plant in Mexico that had been repeatedly criticized by Mr. Trump.But relaxed fuel-economy standards may not provide enough incentive for automakers to risk adding significant numbers of jobs.Car companies are making big profits in the North American market, and their plants are running at near-capacity levels. Last year, auto companies set a second consecutive annual sales record in the United States with about 17.5 million new vehicles sold.The growth in sales, however, has begun to level off. And automakers are wary of expanding production beyond the current level of demand.An earlier version of an article on President Trump\u2019s decision to roll back fuel economy standards misidentified a Harvard University expert on climate change. He is Robert Stavins, not Richard Stavins.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Spider Network,\u2019 an Intriguing Tale of Complicity", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byBook EntryMention Libor \u2014 an acronym for the London interbank offered rate \u2014 and even bankers\u2019 eyes are likely to glaze over.Created just over 20 years ago by a lobbying group representing the British banking sector, Libor was supposed to reflect the interest rate at which member banks could borrow from one another at any given time. Few knew precisely how the rate was calculated. There was even widespread confusion as to its very definition. Yet despite its murky origins and meaning, Libor became the indispensable global benchmark used to price things like credit card debt, variable rate mortgages, complex derivatives and corporate loans.It was this combination of vast influence and obscure provenance that made Libor prone to widespread manipulation.Mr. Enrich effectively uses the unique access he secured to the mildly autistic UBS trader, Tom Hayes, who became the fall guy for the unfolding scandal, to produce a surprisingly human narrative. But as entertaining as the colorful character portraits are, what makes \u201cThe Spider Network\u201d truly memorable are the portraits of the various institutions that made the scandal not just possible but inevitable.At bottom, the Libor scandal was not very complicated at all. Libor was calculated daily based on submissions made by relatively low-level bank employees with modest oversight by the banks, the private association collecting the data and the regulators. The value of banks\u2019 trading positions in derivatives and other Libor-influenced securities could be tremendously affected by even relatively small changes in the financial benchmark. The result was a mad scramble by market participants to influence the submissions in the hope of moving Libor in a direction favorable to their holdings.In an ideal world, major institutions would feel an obligation to contribute to the long-term effective functioning of the financial markets. The institutions described in \u201cThe Spider Network\u201d cared exclusively about optimizing the current value of their securities portfolio. The impact of these Libor movements on millions of borrowers, much less on public confidence in the integrity of markets, does not seem to have crossed their minds.\u201cThe Spider Network\u201d is at its most compelling when describing the quotidian activities of the \u201cnetwork\u201d of traders and brokers who tirelessly concocted strategies to influence the benchmark rate \u2014 or at least convince an important client that they had. Using not just exhaustive interviews with Mr. Hayes and others, but reams of text messages and transcripts amassed during various investigations and lawsuits, Mr. Enrich reveals a culture in which success is defined by the outcome of the next trade and the only relationships that matter are among the network participants and their enablers higher up.And it is the behavior of these higher-ups \u2014 all of whom professed shock that there was gambling going on at their casinos once the authorities decided to investigate \u2014 that is the most eye-opening. Mr. Hayes may have been among the most aggressive in attempting to align Libor\u2019s direction to his trading strategies, but such practices were prevalent and encouraged in the industry. It seems clear that Mr. Hayes was recruited by every institution from Goldman Sachs to Citigroup, not in spite of his ferocity in manipulating Libor, but because of it.Mr. Enrich\u2019s intense sympathy for Mr. Hayes \u2014 his 14-year sentence is wildly disproportionate to his responsibility for the system\u2019s corruption \u2014 has positive and negative consequences for the book.On the positive side, Mr. Enrich is committed to revealing the perfidy and complicity of not just institutions and superiors but of the regulators who, for too long, turned a blind eye. Britain\u2019s authorities come in for particularly savage, but justified, treatment. In America, the former Goldman banker Gary Gensler, who during the Clinton administration had worked tirelessly to defang the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, would end up running the commission as the scandal unfolded during President Barack Obama\u2019s term. Mr. Enrich takes particular pleasure in pointing out the irony that Mr. Gensler falsely took credit for initiating the Libor investigation (it had been underway for a year before his installation at the agency) given his historic role in undermining the C.F.T.C.\u2019s authority.On the negative side, Mr. Enrich sometimes may go further than necessary to make the point that no one has clean hands. He tars even honorable government lawyers who played important roles in bringing the scandal to light for securing a \u201cfat payday\u201d in private practice later. More important, the narrative slows considerably after Mr. Hayes is fired and the focus is on his personal life and trial preparation rather than the insidious web of financial manipulation in which he had thrived.These are minor considerations in assessing the contribution Mr. Enrich has made in providing such a vivid depiction of the ethos of the core financial institutions upon which the global economy depends. The new administration has articulated a commitment to eliminating unduly burdensome regulatory requirements on the financial services sector. Hopefully \u201cThe Spider Network\u201d will be required reading for those designing the new system \u2014 to gain a deeper understanding of both the cultures of those being regulated and the downside of relying on the invisible hand of market forces to protect the public.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Repeal of Affordable Care Act Is Back on Agenda, Republicans Say", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Under extreme pressure from conservative activists, House Republican leaders and the White House have restarted negotiations on legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.But efforts to revive the legislation in the House could take weeks, lawmakers conceded, as Congress moves forward with a full plate of other time-consuming issues. And the renewed push did not meet with much enthusiasm from Senate Republicans, who said they had other priorities at the moment.Nonetheless, Speaker Paul D. Ryan vowed to renew efforts to repeal the law, despite last week\u2019s crushing setback when House Republicans tossed aside a repeal bill because they lacked the votes to pass it.Just days after President Trump said he was moving on to other issues, senior administration officials said they still hoped to score the kind of big legislative victory that has so far eluded the White House. Vice President Mike Pence was dispatched to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for lunchtime talks.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to retrench into our corners or put up dividing lines,\u201d Mr. Ryan said after a meeting of House Republicans was dominated by talk of how to restart health negotiations. \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake to get bogged down in all that,\u201d he added.Democrats had celebrated what they thought was the demise of the repeal bill on Friday. But the House Republican whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, said on Tuesday, \u201cTheir celebration is premature.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019re closer today to repealing Obamacare than we\u2019ve ever been before, and surely even closer than we were Friday,\u201d Mr. Scalise said.It is not clear what political dynamics might have changed since Friday, when a coalition of hard-line conservatives and more moderate Republicans torpedoed legislation to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.\u201cI don\u2019t know what has changed,\u2019\u2019 said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. \u201cThe bill went down because it was too bad for Republican moderates and not bad enough for their conservatives. I don\u2019t know how they reconcile the divides within their own conference, never mind find any Democratic votes.\u201dMr. Ryan declined to say what might be in the next version of the Republicans\u2019 repeal bill, nor would he sketch any schedule for action. But he said Congress needed to act because insurers were developing premiums and benefit packages for health plans to offer in 2018, with review by federal and state officials beginning soon.The new talks, which quietly began this week, involve Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, and members of two Republican factions that helped sink the bill last week, the hard-right Freedom Caucus and the more centrist Tuesday Group.Any deal would have to overcome significant differences about how to rework a law that affects about one-fifth of the American economy. Those differences were so sharp that they led Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan to pull the bill just before the House was to vote on it.Still, Republican members of Congress said they were hopeful.\u201cI think everyone wants to get to yes and support President Trump,\u201d said Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, a Freedom Caucus member. \u201cThere is a package in there that is a win-win.\u201dRepresentative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador of Idaho, also a Freedom Caucus member, said he hoped the discussions would yield a compromise after a divisive debate that revealed deep fissures within the party. \u201cI think we will have a better, stronger product that will unify the conference,\u201d Mr. Labrador said.But then Mr. Trump suggested that he could also cut a deal with Democrats, a move that would almost certainly make more conservative members of the House balk. \u201cDo not worry,\u201d he said on Twitter, \u201cwe are in very good shape!\u201dAt a White House reception for senators on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump called for Republicans and Democrats to work together as he predicted that \u201cwe are all going to make a deal on health care.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s such an easy one,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI have no doubt that that\u2019s going to happen very quickly.\u201dLawmakers who attended the meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday said it was a lively exchange at which members of the Freedom Caucus were put on the defensive.\u201cThere were a lot of unhappy people who got to vent, got to share their frustration,\u201d said Representative Randy Weber of Texas, a member of the Freedom Caucus. \u201cPeople said the Freedom Caucus owes us an explanation.\u201dIn the Senate, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, an inveterate foe of the 2010 health care law, said, \u201cWhere we are on Obamacare, regretfully, at the moment is where the Democrats wanted us to be, which is with the status quo.\u201dDemocrats \u201cought to be pretty happy about that, because we have the existing law in place, and I think we\u2019re just going to have to see how that works out,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cWe believe it will not work out well, but we\u2019ll see.\u201dSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said he believed the House would take up another repeal bill. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if, it\u2019s a question of when,\u2019\u2019 he said.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said: \u201cObamacare is imploding in my state. Something has to be done.\u201d Asked if he could vote for a bill that did not include a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, Mr. McCain said, \u201cI would be willing to examine all options to protect the citizens of my state.\u201dMr. Ryan said he hoped to foster a consensus through conversations like the one House Republicans had on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to become a factionalized majority,\u201d he said. \u201cI want us to become a unified majority, and that means we\u2019re going to sit down and talk things out until we get there, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201dSeizing a possible opportunity, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, asked members of her caucus to suggest ways of improving the Affordable Care Act.Blocking the repeal bill was a \u201cthrilling success,\u201d she said in a letter to House Democrats. She asked them to suggest ways to \u201cimprove and update\u201d the law, which she pushed through the House in 2010 without any Republican votes.Suggestions, she said, could be used in discussions with other members of Congress and \u201cperhaps even with the president.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beginning \u2018Brexit\u2019 and Bracing for Impact", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The world did not end. No recession unfolded. Nine months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, disregarding warnings of grim economic consequences, a nation famous for calmly carrying on has seemingly gone about its business.As Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday officially initiated Britain\u2019s exit from Europe \u2014 Brexit, in everyday talk \u2014 the lack of disaster was touted by those steering the departure as a sign of little trouble ahead.\u201cThere were predictions about what would happen to the economy if the United Kingdom voted to leave,\u201d Ms. May told Parliament on Wednesday. \u201cThose predictions have not proved to be correct. We see a strong economy.\u201dBut the reassuring talk did not reckon with one significant detail: Nothing has actually happened yet.Mrs. May has only set in motion the complex, politically fraught divorce proceedings through which Britain must settle its affairs with the 27 jilted members of the European Union. The outcome will almost certainly be costly: Britain has placed in jeopardy its trading relationship with Europe, its largest customer for exports, while imperiling London\u2019s status as banker to the planet.The markets essentially shrugged. The move was as expected as the next Super Bowl. The pound dipped a tad. So did shares on London\u2019s stock market.The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.The immediate impact of Mrs. May\u2019s action was to start negotiations on future dealings across the English Channel. Those talks have a two-year deadline. If no deal is struck before then, Britain and Europe would plunge into a state of chaotic uncertainty.Trade would revert to the rules of the World Trade Organization, making Britain\u2019s exports to Europe vulnerable to tariffs and other barriers to commerce, including health and safety rules.London\u2019s bankers would be effectively severed from Europe, with many transactions for clients based on the Continent rendered illegal.Until now, such issues were wrapped in layers of hypotheticals, with the details left for some indeterminate day when Britain\u2019s government would make it real. That day has come.Though the financial industry has been preparing to move jobs to other financial capitals in anticipation of a messy Brexit, other industries have waited for clarity. Now, they will feel pressure to act \u2014 shifting some lines of business to European capitals, perhaps shelving British expansions.Global banking giants like Citigroup, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase may soon carry out plans to shift thousands of jobs to financial centers in the European Union. Goldman Sachs recently confirmed that it is moving hundreds of jobs out of London while expanding offices in Frankfurt and Paris.Vodafone, the telecommunications giant, said after the referendum that it might shift its headquarters from London.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cThe fact of setting this clock ticking is significant, because two years for many businesses is enough time for them to adapt, but short enough that they have to start making decisions really quickly,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, an economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. \u201cYou will start to see very observable, concrete consequences of Brexit very soon.\u201dBritain has exploited its inclusion in Europe\u2019s vast single market to make itself a dominant hub for multinational companies as various as aviation, pharmaceuticals and finance. They have set up factories, marketing teams and trading floors in Britain while selling to clients from Ireland to Greece, as if this swath of geography \u2014 home to some 500 million people \u2014 were one country.So much for all that.European leaders have consistently reaffirmed that remaining in the single market requires that Britain accept the free movement of people. That collides with a primary aim of many Brexit supporters \u2014 restricting immigration.After months of pretending that a finesse could be found, Mrs. May in January declared her government\u2019s choice: enter immigration limits, goodbye single market.Long before this political reckoning with reality, executives at global banks were already mulling which jobs to move from London to other cities in the European Union \u2014 Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Luxembourg.\u201cPeople will have to move,\u201d said William Wright, founder and managing director of New Financial, a research institution in London. \u201cThere\u2019s no other option.\u201dBrexit supporters called the outcome a template for how a pragmatic British government would prevent businesses from abandoning its shores \u2014 with tax cuts, friendly regulation and deal making. But if Britain promised anything meaningful to Nissan, it probably violated World Trade Organization rules. Nissan has since said it continues to assess the uncertain economics of Britain. Ford and BMW are reassessing their British factories, too.For now, Britain has managed to avoid the most frightening economic forecasts.Before the referendum last June, the British Treasury predicted that a vote to exit could shrink the economy by as much 6 percent annually for the first two years.The economy expanded by 1.8 percent last year. British consumers continued to spend. British factories continued to churn out cars, medical devices and aircraft parts, many of them destined for Europe.This month, Toyota announced plans to sink an additional \u00a3240 million (about $297 million) into a factory in Derbyshire, though it qualified that it required reliable access to Europe. Snap, the parent company of social media darling Snapchat that raised $3.4 billion in an initial public offering, recently picked London as its international headquarters.But consumer spending has been increasingly paid for by debt. The British pound has surrendered 17 percent of its value against the dollar since the referendum, raising the cost of imported goods. Investment is flagging.A weaker pound helps exports, making British goods cheaper on world markets. But exports have also been aided by the very thing Britain is trying to ditch \u2014 inclusion in Europe.Proponents of Brexit tend to dismiss Europe as a land leading only in the numbers of unemployed men who are moving in with their parents. Britain\u2019s next era is supposed to be centered on trade with faster growing, innovative nations like the United States.Britain and Europe must negotiate a trade deal that will prevent a rupture to commerce. During the campaign, Brexit supporters argued that Europe would ultimately make it happen because its most powerful member, Germany, now sends a parade of BMWs, Audis and Volkswagens to Britain.But trade negotiations are vulnerable to the manipulations of politically protected industries. This one seems particularly prone to acrimony. European leaders confront existential threats to their union, with political parties across the Continent hostile to its powers. Many are intent on using Britain to illustrate what they contend happens when a member leaves \u2014 nothing good.\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d said Mr. V\u00e9ron, an economist. \u201cYou don\u2019t allow someone who leaves the club to have better terms than someone who\u2019s in the club, or otherwise the club doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201dWhatever the comparative rankings of unfortunate events, Britain\u2019s leaving Europe sans deal would be bad, as economists and people running businesses have said.It is often said that businesses fear uncertainty more than anything. Mrs. May just eliminated some of that. But she replaced it with an apparent certainty that presents its own troubles: Britain really is departing the largest consumer market on earth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, Caltrain Upgrade Is Imperiled as Trump Withholds Funds", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The engineers of Silicon Valley are fine-tuning driverless cars, building robots designed to replicate the human brain and shaving milliseconds off internet response times.Their trip to work, however, can be a throwback to the predigital age. The region\u2019s commuter rail line is saddled with aging, smoke-spewing, diesel-powered locomotives.For more than a decade, the managers of the Silicon Valley railway, known as Caltrain, have been planning to upgrade to faster and less polluting electric trains.But those plans are now imperiled by the Trump administration\u2019s decision in February to withhold a $647 million federal grant.In this impasse, some transportation experts see a foretaste of the political infighting and financial hurdles that could plague the nationwide infrastructure projects that President Trump is promising. Reviving America\u2019s rusted and sagging infrastructure is one of the few areas where it seemed Democrats and Republicans could agree. But making these projects a reality \u2014 the \u201cnew roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land\u201d that Mr. Trump enumerated to Congress last week \u2014 will require political cooperation and accommodations that are increasingly rare in ultrapartisan times.In the case of Caltrain, the decision to withhold the grant came after California\u2019s Republican congressional delegation asked the transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, to withdraw funding because the electrified system also would be used for the state\u2019s bigger high-speed rail project, a plan they vehemently oppose.The high-speed rail line connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles is the most ambitious rail plan in the country and has been in the works for more than two decades with a projected cost of $64 billion. The project calls for completion in 2029.Despite initial support, Republicans now regard the high-speed project as too costly.\u201cWe have said no more federal dollars will go to California high-speed rail,\u201d said Representative Jeff Denham, a Republican who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Railroads. \u201cWe\u2019re very strong on that position.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Denham said the project should immediately stop.There has long been tension in California between advocates of more freeways and those favoring public transport. But the high-speed rail project had bipartisan support in its early stages. It was formally started in 1996 by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and was supported by another Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.That consensus is long gone. The letter penned by the state\u2019s 14 Republican members of Congress, including Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, called the project a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and described the Caltrain grant as an \u201cirresponsible use of taxpayer dollars.\u201dCaltrain and the high-speed rail project are administratively separate, but a 2013 agreement to share tracks as a cost-saving measure raised Republican ire.Defunding the electrification of the Silicon Valley corridor has immediate consequences for the system\u2019s 65,000 daily commuters. Caltrain had hoped to switch to its electric system by 2021. The current trains are overcrowded and breakdowns are frequent; there are more than 19 mechanical failures per month, according to Caltrain engineers. Two-thirds of the fleet has \u201creached the end of its useful life,\u201d Caltrain says.At the rail line\u2019s maintenance depot, engineers say they have trouble finding parts for the locomotives, which were built in the 1980s. And new maintenance workers need lectures from veteran technicians because they have no experience working on such old equipment.\u201cYou change out parts here and there,\u201d said Joe Navarro, director of operations and maintenance at Caltrain. \u201cWe are putting Band-Aids on. It\u2019s very challenging.\u201d\u201cWe are lucky to live in a place where innovation is in the DNA, but we don\u2019t see that for public transport,\u201d said Sridhar Iyer, a software engineer for Twitter who rides the double-decker Caltrain that runs near the headquarters of Apple, Facebook and Google. \u201cThe whole thing is stuck in the past.\u201dIn recent weeks, more than a dozen leaders of Silicon Valley firms called lawmakers to urge that the federal money be released for the Caltrain electrification project, according to Carl Guardino, the president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents most of the region\u2019s large tech companies.Mr. Guardino called the Republican campaign to block funding \u201ca misinformed effort.\u201d\u201cThe most important asset of the innovation economy are our employees,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they are stuck and stalled in traffic they are not productively creating the future.\u201dThe specific objection by Republicans is that $600 million of state funds allocated to Caltrain\u2019s electrification were initially authorized by a 2008 referendum on high-speed rail, known as Proposition 1A.\u201cThey are stealing Prop 1A money and using it for something else,\u201d Mr. Denham said.Caltrain says that although the two trains will use the same tracks, the electrification project is \u201cindependent\u201d and high-speed rail\u2019s use of the corridor will require a separate environmental review.The bigger picture, proponents of the electrification project say, is that the commuter rail project deserves the support of the Trump administration because it meets the broad criteria of its infrastructure push \u2014 it will be made in America by American workers. Almost all of the materials for the new train system will be sourced from factories across 14 states. Caltrain estimates the project will create nearly 10,000 jobs.\u201cThis is the perfect project if you care about infrastructure, if you care about jobs and if you care about focusing on areas that are going to deliver long-term economic benefit,\u201d said Stuart Cohen, the executive director of TransForm, a nonprofit group that advocates public transportation.The state High-Speed Rail Authority is making a similar pitch. \u201cEvery ounce of the steel, every ounce of the concrete is domestic,\u201d Dan Richard, the authority\u2019s chairman, said. \u201cWe are reaching out to the Trump administration to make the case that this is entirely consistent with the president\u2019s vision.\u201dOutside Fresno, a city in California\u2019s Central Valley surrounded by almond and fruit orchards and racked by poverty, about 1,000 workers have been employed on the project to build viaducts and tunnels at 10 construction sites.The Finance Department of Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, decided on Friday that the project was ready to lay some track and approved $2.6 billion in spending. But there are lingering questions about how the later stages of the project will be financed, especially if Congress blocks more federal support.Although the authority was established more than two decades, ago it was only in 2013 that construction began on the first, 119-mile segment of the project.Mayor Lee Brand of Fresno, a Republican, supports the project, which would make Silicon Valley a 45-minute train ride away by 2025.\u201cI don\u2019t look at this ideologically,\u201d Mr. Brand said. \u201cI look at it practically. The city of Fresno can enjoy a major benefit from what\u2019s going on with high-speed rail. This is a poor city that needs all the help it can get.\u201dTom Richards, a real estate developer in Fresno who is on the authority\u2019s board, said the rail connection could encourage tech companies to set up in the city and workers to commute to well-paying jobs in Silicon Valley.\u201cThis is a whole story about connecting California together,\u201d he said.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Cuts Off All Trade With Separatist Regions", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Ukrainian authorities halted all trade with two Russian-controlled separatist enclaves in the country\u2019s east on Wednesday, using an economic weapon to strike at what has been a long-festering military problem.The decision to block all but humanitarian trade dealt another blow to the much-beleaguered Minsk peace process and raised tensions not just with the separatists but with their patrons in Moscow, who could be called upon to provide aid and markets to the breakaway regions.President Petro O. Poroshenko has been reluctant to isolate the breakaway areas, in a region known as the Donbas, fearing that would implicitly recognize their independence and be a first step toward the country\u2019s partition.They enjoyed strong public support, and their actions helped force the issue to the top of the nation\u2019s agenda. When, in retaliation, separatist leaders started nationalizing Ukrainian mines and factories, the president said he felt forced to act.In televised comments at a meeting of the Ukrainian Security Council, Mr. Poroshenko minimized the damage that halting trade would do to the separatist regions, saying that far greater economic harm would befall Ukraine, which was losing an important source of cheap fuel.Ukraine\u2019s Central Bank supports that assertion, estimating that blocking trade with rebel areas could trim 1.5 percent from projected growth of 3 percent this year.In the rebel areas, Mr. Poroshenko said, Russian companies could simply take over the economy. Since they share a border with the Rostov region of southern Russia, the separatists \u201ccan easily receive all that they need,\u201d he said.The government\u2019s decision to formalize the blockade bodes poorly for the Ukrainian peace process, the success of which is a pivotal first step for the Trump administration\u2019s effort to improve relations with Russia. President Trump has said he wants to ally with Russia to fight Islamic terrorism, but his envoy to the United Nations has also said that the United States will continue to back Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.The rail blockade has harmed the business interests of Ukraine\u2019s wealthiest oligarch, Rinat Akhmetov, who owns coal mines and steel mills in both separatist- and government-controlled territory. In a peculiarity of the war, coal trains had continued to rumble across the front line for years despite the often intense fighting.The statement cautioned the separatists from trying to sell coal from the seized mines on international markets, saying it would bring \u201cserious legal consequences for all buyers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping\u2019s Failed Promises Dim Hopes for Economic Change in 2nd Term", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 For years, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has talked the talk of economic reform. In January, he dazzled business executives in Davos, Switzerland, with a defense of international trade. Last month, he urged officials to \u201cseize hold of reform and make it an even bigger priority.\u201d And the annual meeting of China\u2019s legislature, starting Sunday, appears sure to echo that theme.The question now is whether he was ever really serious about taking the painful steps needed to repair the economy, or merely paying lip service to reform to justify his tightening grip on power.Mr. Xi\u2019s defenders argue that he had to consolidate his authority first, before he could make the potentially wrenching decisions needed to open markets and trim bloated state-owned industries. With weak growth in the rest of the world and demand for China\u2019s exports flagging, they contend, there was little margin for error and caution was warranted.The proof will be in the second term, they say, when Mr. Xi finally has the power to push through difficult economic adjustments.Mr. Xi is already China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades. He has repeatedly used his authority, though, to undercut reforms he says are necessary, ordering heavy-handed intervention in the stock market, for example, and restrictions on the movement of money abroad and property prices.The problem, critics say, is that Mr. Xi\u2019s demands for centralized control, stability and political conformity have often drowned out hesitant steps toward economic liberalization. And his second term is likely to bring more of the same, they say.Many economists, executives and policy advisers in Beijing do not disguise their disappointment about what has happened to Mr. Xi\u2019s promises of an audacious overhaul of the economy.\u201cPutting it relatively tactfully,\u201d he continued, \u201cit hasn\u2019t been vigorous enough.\u201dEconomists abroad have been less tactful.To be sure, the Xi years have not been static.China has loosened controls on its domestic bond market, allowing more foreign participation. The policy that limited most urban households to one child was abolished and replaced by a \u201ctwo child\u201d policy and even measures to encourage couples to have two children. Mr. Li, the premier, has made it his mission to cut down paperwork and regulations that weigh on small businesses.\u201cI feel that a lot of changes actually have happened,\u201d said Jianguang Shen, a China economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities. \u201cPeople expect faster, radical reform after the party congress\u201d late this year, when Mr. Xi starts a second term as party leader.Some experts argue that Mr. Xi will then be politically secure and more willing to let his new team push through contentious changes, including cutting more excess industry, shedding jobs in ailing state companies and giving private businesses a bigger share of bank loans.With the economy still growing at an impressive 6.7 percent last year, officials say the government has kept the right balance between change and stability.\u201cThe boat sails best when the winds and waves are steady,\u201d Liu Shiyu, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a news conference last Sunday. \u201cWithout stable market conditions, no reform can make progress, and there may even be reversal of the strides that we\u2019ve made.\u201dBut even many who accept China\u2019s model of gradual, government-guided reform say that under Mr. Xi, promised changes have stalled or been reversed. Mr. Xi, who dominates economic policy and much else besides, has flinched from the harder changes needed for long-term prosperity and has yet to find a way to keep the economy growing without administering ever larger injections of debt.And while many economists, including some of Mr. Xi\u2019s top advisers, continue to lobby openly for more market-oriented policies, the government has also become less tolerant of those who directly and publicly criticize it for not doing enough, including by censoring them on social media.The economy has been slowing steadily and has required larger and larger amounts of debt each year just to avoid a much steeper slowdown.It is Mr. Xi\u2019s own policies, though, that raise the biggest questions about his commitment to change. As more and more capital has left China, the government has restored restrictions on moving money abroad.While taxes have been increased on service industries, promises to introduce a property tax and other fiscal changes have made little headway. That logjam has left the finances of local governments in many manufacturing-dependent cities dangerously dependent on land sales for revenue.Mr. Xi also promised to make state corporations leaner and more focused on achieving financial health in their core businesses. But he also demanded that party committees have a bigger say in company decisions, leaving plenty of room for party officials to undercut corporate reorganization.\u201cOn the one hand, there\u2019s the talk of strengthening reform. On the other hand, all the agencies are stressing enhancing leadership by the party,\u201d Li Weisen, an economist at Fudan University in Shanghai who advocates market liberalization, said in a telephone interview.\u201cWe\u2019ve maybe issued over a hundred of these reform documents,\u201d he added, \u201cbut which ones have really been implemented, including fiscal reforms?\u201dBusiness leaders say more should be done to lighten their burdens. Liu Hanyuan, the chairman of Tongwei Group, a large manufacturer of solar panels based in Chengdu, in southwest China, used a Chinese aphorism to describe the burden of regulations, taxes and local fees on Chinese companies:\u201cWe should abandon the idea that as many fees and taxes should be collected as possible. We should keep enough water to raise fish.\u201dSome of the initial hopes that Mr. Xi would turn out to be a market liberalizer were probably never realistic. The Chinese government\u2019s idea of reform has never been the free-market bonanza that some economists advocate.Even Deng Xiaoping, who first injected elements of capitalism into the Chinese economy in the 1980s, stressed that the government must retain control. His approach has delivered decades of growth that has lifted living standards for hundreds of millions of people while creating hundreds of billionaires.During the 1990s, President Jiang Zemin pressed ahead with changes that shut down thousands of struggling state-owned factories, encouraged private entrepreneurs to join the party and prepared for China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in late 2001. Yet he, too, remained committed to state ownership, and his successor, Hu Jintao, proved even more committed to steering development through state planning.Most experts expect Mr. Xi will stay much the same leader he has been for five years, unless slowing growth and rising debt produce a shock. Yet the cost of inaction could be an increasingly debt-ridden, inefficient economy.\u201cIf the government keeps meddling in the markets to ensure growth, then this road will become impassable,\u201d said Mr. Li, the professor in Shanghai. \u201cThe problems won\u2019t be solved and will only get worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Case of \u2018Tonkin Gulfitis\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byVietnam '67On May 22, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson received alarming news from the Middle East. The government of Egypt had closed the Straits of Tiran, the narrow waterway linking the Red Sea to Israel, to Israeli shipping. The move dramatically escalated Arab-Israeli tensions and pushed the region to the brink of war.Johnson\u2019s instinct was to act boldly to defuse the crisis. He proposed assembling an American-led naval force to escort Israeli ships through the straits and push Egypt to back down. But L.B.J. soon discovered problems.For one, Congress, wary of new military commitments when nearly half a million Americans were fighting in Vietnam, seemed certain to oppose the idea. Congress had a bad case of \u201cTonkin Gulfitis,\u201d warned Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. Many legislators, in other words, believed the Senate had made a grievous mistake four years earlier by giving the president a blank check to wage war in Vietnam after American warships came under attack in the Gulf of Tonkin. The fighting in Southeast Asia had bogged down into a grueling stalemate, and the last thing the United States seemed to need was another difficult military challenge far from American shores.And there was another problem with Johnson\u2019s idea: Bold action seemed likely to provoke Egypt\u2019s Arab allies to retaliate by cutting off the flow of oil to the United States and its allies. An embargo would unquestionably imperil Western economies, but Johnson and his aides had a more specific reason to worry: Military operations in Vietnam depended on the flow of oil \u2014 as much as 200,000 barrels a day \u2014 from the Middle East.In the end, L.B.J.\u2019s plan came to nothing, killed in part by fallout from the American embroilment half a world away. A major war erupted between Israel and its Arab neighbors two weeks later.The episode neatly illustrates a dimension of the American experience in Vietnam that has drawn scant attention over the years but was alarmingly clear to policy makers by 1967: The huge drain of American power and resources in Vietnam meant that Washington had less political, diplomatic and military clout to shape events elsewhere in the world \u2014 no small problem at a time of rapidly mounting instability in the Middle East, Latin America and southern Africa, regions that Americans considered crucial to the pursuit of the Cold War.It requires little imagination to see that the Vietnam War had enormous effects in Southeast Asia, on the American home front, and even on the relationship between the United States and its European allies, most of which distanced themselves from America\u2019s war. Far less obvious was the damage to America\u2019s role in areas increasingly known as the Third World.The most obvious effect, as in the run-up to the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, was to diminish America\u2019s ability to exert military power. In part, the problem was the sheer scarcity of forces at a time when the United States was increasingly stretched between the escalation in Vietnam and standing commitments to defend Western Europe and South Korea. \u201cRich and powerful though we are,\u201d Stuart Symington, an influential Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asserted in May 1967, the United States had \u201clittle chance\u201d of maintaining adequate forces for existing commitments, much less to take on \u201cfurther trouble in some other parts of the world.\u201dJust as important was growing recognition in the White House and Congress that mounting controversy over the war in Vietnam made it inconceivable to contemplate bold new initiatives abroad, whether military or merely diplomatic. And then there was the problem of simply finding staff and expertise to devote to other parts of the world at a time when Vietnam consumed the administration\u2019s attention.Antiwar protesters contended that declining foreign activism might be a step in the right direction, and they surely had a point. By any measure, the United States, lulled into a false sense of confidence by the material and political power it wielded, had overstretched its monumental capabilities by the mid-1960s. As this reality set in, a turn away from John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1961 pledge to \u201cpay any price, bear any burden\u201d to uphold American principles everywhere in the world was perhaps inevitable, even if without a conflict in Vietnam.But with the benefit of hindsight, it\u2019s clear that the abrupt turn away from activism and idealism in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America amounts to one of the little-noticed tragedies of the Vietnam War.Most obviously, the war inhibited American leaders from taking the lead in addressing major problems that arose after 1965, including the dramatic acceleration of Arab-Israeli tensions. Absent the Vietnam War, might the Johnson administration have been able to head off the fighting, or helped to design a settlement that might have pointed the region in a more peaceful direction over the long term? Might the United States have dealt more effectively with southern Africa, where the Johnson administration was mostly passive in the face of soaring racial tensions that provided a seedbed for radicalism? In South Asia, might the Johnson administration have had more clout to ease tensions between India and Pakistan, which broke into open war in 1965 and simmered thereafter? It\u2019s impossible, of course, to answer such questions, but they tantalize nonetheless.What\u2019s more certain is that the Vietnam War undercut American influence throughout the developing world by leading governments and publics alike to lose confidence in the United States as an ambitious proponent of development and democracy. As American bombs rained down on North Vietnam, leaders in India, Egypt, Algeria and many other post-colonial nations denounced Washington for waging a brutal war against a people striving for independence, and moved closer to the Communist bloc. By the 1970s, much of the Afro-Asian world had shifted away from the relatively warm relationships of the early 1960s and grown vocally hostile to the United States. America\u2019s loss was the Soviet Union\u2019s gain.Washington sought to bolster its position in an increasingly hostile world by forming or, more often, tightening its partnerships with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa and other regional powers that could be counted on to serve its interests in return for American political support and military supplies. This approach made good sense to leaders increasingly attuned to the limits of American power, and in 1969 the Nixon administration codified its reliance on reliable regimes as the \u201cNixon Doctrine.\u201d The problem was that America\u2019s partners were usually right-wing, authoritarian regimes that used American aid to maintain their power and coerce their own populations.By the mid-1970s, these trends had converged in a perfect storm of problems for Washington. Anti-Americanism reached new heights in many places, and new social movements within the United States and around the world challenged America\u2019s reliance on unsavory partners such as the shah of Iran and Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile. Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba, the Palestine Liberation Organization and other radical movements were energized by the Communist victory in Vietnam and mounted insurgencies against Western interests. America would struggle with these developments for many years to come, and the country never recovered the influence it had wielded in much of the Third World during the early 1960s.Advertisement"}

As yet, residency rights for citizens of European Union countries who live in Britain have not been stipulated.\u201cThe whole basis of the debate was immigration,\u201d said Mr. Kapoor, an India-born Briton. \u201cArt is being part of a global conversation. Now we are going to think small.\u201dBritain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, is expected to have any number of as-yet-unknown ramifications.There are, however, plenty of people involved in the country\u2019s art economy who think \u201cBrexit\u201d is a good idea.\u201cThis is an opportunity we have to grasp to improve our global competitiveness,\u201d said Anthony Browne, chairman of the British Art Market Federation, an organization that lobbies the government on behalf of auction houses and dealers. \u201cWe are in a very strong global position already,\u201d Mr. Browne said, adding that the world\u2019s second-largest national art market last year was in Britain.Mr. Browne sees Brexit as an opportunity for the British art trade to free itself from the encumbrances of Europe-imposed tariffs and regulations, such as the value-added tax (5 percent in Britain) on artworks imported from outside the bloc. He said his organization would lobby for streamlining cross-border tax arrangements with Europe and for amending or abolishing a regulation that grants artists a royalty payment each time their work is resold.Art dealers in Britain said they also saw the advantages.\u201cBut this isn\u2019t going to be an easy divorce,\u201d Mr. Waterman added. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s about the deals we get from the E.U.\u201d\u201cBrexit\u201d might make it less expensive for British dealers to buy art in the United States or Japan, but a British departure from the European trade zone might make it more expensive for Europeans to buy in Britain. In Germany, for example, purchases of art and antiques have a value-added tax as high as 19 percent, unless they occurred within the European Union.Another factor is the currency market. Even before an official departure from the European Union, art sales in Britain have been cushioned from adverse effects by a fall in the value of the pound. Since the June 23 referendum, the pound has declined more than 15 percent against the dollar and other currencies, making Britain an attractive market for buyers from Asia and the United States.But Mr. Coles expressed concerns about how \u201cBrexit\u201d might affect London\u2019s real estate market. \u201cPossibly wealthy people won\u2019t buy as many big houses in London,\u201d he said. \u201cTo sell furniture, we benefit from an active property market.\u201dThe British government stopped the export of the painting, and Mr. Hill agreed to sell it to the National Gallery for the price he had paid, about \u00a330.6 million. Using grants from the British Treasury, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Art Fund, the gallery was able to match that price by last October. By then, however, the value of the pound had slumped, and the dollar price was $10 million below what Mr. Hill had paid in 2015. The gallery said in February that Mr. Hill had \u201cdecided not to accept\u201d its purchase offer.\u201cWe turned down the National Gallery offer because of the currency move,\u201d Mr. Hill said in a telephone interview.\u201cIt was sterling that had lost value,\u201d he added in an email. \u201cThe painting most certainly did not.\u201dThe National Gallery declined to comment.The Pontormo remains in storage in Britain.And what has become known in art circles as The Pontormo Affair is just one of the many unexpected consequences of \u201cBrexit.\u201d Over the next few years, we may see many more.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea Removes President Park Geun-hye", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byPark Geun-hye, the nation\u2019s first female president and the daughter of the Cold War military dictator Park Chung-hee, had been an icon of the conservative establishment that joined Washington in pressing for a hard line against North Korea\u2019s nuclear provocations.Now, her downfall is expected to shift South Korean politics to the opposition, whose leaders want more engagement with North Korea and are wary of a major confrontation in the region. They say they will re-examine the country\u2019s joint strategy on North Korea with the United States and defuse tensions with China, which has sounded alarms about the growing American military footprint in Asia.Eight justices of the Constitutional Court unanimously decided to unseat Ms. Park for committing \u201cacts that violated the Constitution and laws\u201d throughout her time in office, Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said in a ruling that was nationally broadcast.Ms. Park\u2019s acts \u201cbetrayed the trust of the people and were of the kind that cannot be tolerated for the sake of protecting the Constitution,\u201d Justice Lee said.As the verdict was announced, silence fell over thousands of Park supporters who rallied near the courthouse waving South Korean flags. Soon, they tried to march on the court and called for \u201cdestroying\u201d it. When the police blocked them, some of the mostly elderly protesters attacked the officers with flagpoles, hurling water bottles and pieces of the sidewalk pavement. Two pro-Park demonstrators, ages 60 and 72, died during the unrest.Ms. Park did not comment on the ruling, and remained in the presidential palace after her removal from power. But In Myung-jin, the leader of Ms. Park\u2019s conservative Liberty Korea Party, said he \u201chumbly respected\u201d the ruling.With the immunity conferred by her office now gone, Ms. Park, 65, faces prosecutors seeking to charge her with bribery, extortion and abuse of power in connection with allegations of conspiring with a confidante, her childhood friend Choi Soon-sil, to collect tens of millions of dollars in bribes from companies like Samsung.After the ruling, Mr. Hwang called key Cabinet ministers to put the nation on a heightened state of military readiness, saying the lack of a president represented a national \u201cemergency.\u201d He also warned North Korea against making \u201cadditional provocations.\u201dIn a sign of how far South Korea\u2019s young democracy has evolved, Ms. Park was removed without any violence, after large, peaceful protests in recent months demanding that she step down. In addition to the swell of popular anger, the legislature and the judiciary \u2014 two institutions that have been weaker than the presidency historically \u2014 were crucial to the outcome.\u201cThis is a miracle, a new milestone in the strengthening and institutionalizing of democracy in South Korea,\u201d said Kang Won-taek, a political scientist at Seoul National University.When crowds took to the streets, they were not just seeking to remove a leader who had one year left in office. They were also rebelling against a political order that had held South Korea together for decades but is now fracturing under pressures both at home and abroad, analysts said.Ms. Park\u2019s father ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979. He founded its economic growth model, which transformed the nation into an export powerhouse and allowed the emergence of family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol that benefited from tax cuts and anti-labor policies.But the nexus of industry and political power gave rise to collusive ties, highlighted by the scandal that led to Ms. Park\u2019s fall.Samsung, the nation\u2019s largest conglomerate, has been tainted by corruption before. But the company has been considered too important to the economy for any of its top leaders to spend time behind bars \u2014 until now. The jailing of Mr. Lee, who is facing trial, is another potent sign that the old order is not holding.In the wake of the Park scandal, all political parties have vowed to curtail presidential power to pardon chaebol tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes. They also promised to stop chaebol chairmen from helping their children amass fortunes through dubious means, like forcing their companies to do exclusive business with the children\u2019s businesses.With the conservatives discredited \u2014 and no leading conservative candidate to succeed Ms. Park \u2014 the left could take power for the first time in a decade. The dominant campaign issues will probably be North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program and South Korea\u2019s relations with the United States and China.If the opposition takes power, it may try to revive its old \u201csunshine policy\u201d of building ties with North Korea through aid and exchanges, an approach favored by China. That would complicate Washington\u2019s efforts to isolate the North at a time other Asian nations like the Philippines are gravitating toward Beijing.Conservative South Koreans see the deployment of the antimissile system not only as a guard against the North but also as a symbolic reaffirmation of the all-important alliance with the United States. Mr. Moon\u2019s party demands that the deployment, which began this week, be suspended immediately. If it takes power, it says it will review the deployment of the antimissile system to determine if it is in South Korea\u2019s best interest.As South Korea has learned, it cannot always keep Washington and Beijing happy at the same time, as in the case of the country\u2019s decision to accept the American missile defenses.Yet Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment was also a pushback against \u201cCold War conservatives\u201d like her father, who seized on Communist threats from North Korea to hide their corruption and silence political opponents, said Kim Dong-choon, a sociologist at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.\u201cHer removal means that the curtain is finally drawing on the authoritarian political and economic order that has dominated South Korea for decades,\u201d said Ahn Byong-jin, rector of the Global Academy for Future Civilizations at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.Analysts cautioned that political and economic change will come slowly.As Mr. Moon put it recently: \u201cWe need a national cleanup. We need to liquidate the old system and build a new South Korea. Only then can we complete the revolution started by the people who rallied with candlelight.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buffalo Meat Industry Facing Government Shutdowns in India", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byThough Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s governing party has long balanced its commitment to export-driven development against its embrace of right-wing Hindu causes, it has rarely made such a stark choice between them. The state\u2019s new leaders promise more meat factories will be shut in the coming days, and they say the blow to the economy is less important than the principle of protecting the cow.\u201cThe government should do it on moral grounds,\u201d said Karunesh Nandan Garg, 57, president of the Meerut division of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. He cited the example of prostitution in Thailand, which is largely tolerated by the authorities and \u201ca major revenue producer\u201d there. \u201cBut is that right? Money isn\u2019t everything.\u201dUttar Pradesh is India\u2019s largest meat-producing state, with 41 of the country\u2019s 75 licensed slaughterhouses and meat processing plants, according to the Commerce Ministry. Scores more operate without licenses, and an exhaustive list of laws govern the slaughter, transport and sale of meat, so the government can easily find a pretext to shut even licensed businesses.On Hapur Road, which is lined with slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants, economic activity had ground to a halt within days of Mr. Adityanath\u2019s swearing-in.District officials sealed seven factories in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday, citing irregularities in paperwork. The police were ordered to patrol the plants and search vehicles for cows, so frightening suppliers that they stopped delivering buffaloes. Workers, told to go home for the day, had instead gathered in tea stalls, nervously trading reports.\u201cWe are waiting to see what the government decides,\u201d said Muhammad Akhtar, a migrant from Bihar who has worked in the meat factories for 20 years, earning around 10,000 rupees, about $150, in a good month.\u201cModi has said he wants economic development for everyone,\u201d Mr. Akhtar said. \u201cThis job has allowed my children to eat and go to school. All we want is peace, to be allowed to work in peace.\u201dMr. Akhtar said he could afford to remain in Uttar Pradesh for two weeks without pay, and then he would have no choice but to return to his native village, along with thousands of other migrant workers who gravitated here for jobs. Other men clustered around him \u2014 peddlers, truck dispatchers, factory supervisors, cleaners, butchers. Some of them warned that further pressure on the industry would lead to violence.\u201cSuppose that there are five people in a single family working here, and they are all jobless,\u201d said Muhammad Majid, 21, who has been working at a slaughterhouse since he was 15. \u201cIf there are riots, they will be difficult to contain.\u201dThe industry\u2019s growth has gone unnoticed mainly because of religious sensitivities: Meatpacking, like leather, is a sector dominated by Muslims, who make up around 19 percent of this state\u2019s population. Though it is legal to slaughter buffalo when they are old and can no longer give milk, right-wing Hindu groups have long suggested that cows were being spirited into the facilities, and they have routinely intercepted supply vehicles for aggressive searches.\u201cLook at the numbers,\u201d said Nadeem Chauhan, a politician with the out-of-power Bahujan Samaj Party. \u201cWhy do you think the central government and the prime minister have not already shut down this business? It\u2019s the biggest cash generator for the government. It brings in foreign currency.\u201dThat optimism was not apparent on Hapur Road, where the face of the anti-slaughterhouse campaign was Sanjay Chaturvedi, a district veterinary officer.Mr. Chaturvedi was making rounds of the area\u2019s factories wearing a red tilak, the smudge of vermilion applied after Hindu prayers, and a Los Angeles Lakers cap. He said he had often tried to take action against slaughterhouses on environmental grounds but had never been free to do so because they had protectors in the previous, Muslim-friendly government.\u201cAs soon as I would approach a factory, I would get a call from some politician,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in government had their hands in the business.\u201dThat had changed almost as soon as the new chief minister was sworn in. His new orders were to be on \u201chigh alert,\u201d and Mr. Chaturvedi happily complied, cruising around surrounding factories with his new police escort.At midday, Mr. Chaturvedi passed a chicken feed factory called Universal India and caught a whiff from its tallow-rendering vats that he described as \u201cvery, very foul.\u201d\u201cThe smell seemed to indicate that there were cow parts there, inside the factory,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know it from the smell.\u201dHe proceeded to the gate and informed the factory\u2019s owner, Aas Muhammad, that his vehicles would be searched for illicit cow parts. Mr. Muhammad protested that his plant, which employs 150 people, does not slaughter animals at all, but instead uses byproducts discarded by government-approved slaughterhouses.When that proved unpersuasive, he charged out onto the roadway after Mr. Chaturvedi, his hands shaking with rage and anxiety. He shouted to a waiting camera crew that the inspector had for years solicited bribes, most recently of 200,000 rupees. Mr. Chaturvedi brushed the accusation aside, saying, \u201cOh, that is nothing, that is nothing.\u201d\u201cYou go and prove that this smell is coming from our factory,\u201d said the owner\u2019s brother, Wasim Qureshi.\u201cYou will see, you will see!\u201d Mr. Chaturvedi shouted as he drove away. His day was close to its end, and he was in a good mood. Of the 10 working meat factories on this road, he said, four would be shuttered by the summer. A detachment of police officers and state officials pulled up to Universal India on Wednesday morning and sealed the premises, by orders of the state government.Mr. Muhammad sent his workers home, asking them to be patient before seeking other jobs.\u201cThey will wait for the next week, maybe 10 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, some of them will end up pulling rickshaws.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make a Deal With North Korea", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSouth Koreans are partly to blame for being marginalized. The country has been preoccupied since last year by a political scandal that embroiled President Park Geun-hye and ultimately led to her removal from office on March 10. The place-holder government of Park appointees maintains her hard-line posture toward North Korea but without legitimacy in the eyes of the public.South Korea\u2019s political vacuum will come to an end when the country votes on May 9 for a new leader, who will take office immediately. The election will have far-reaching implications for the Korean Peninsula \u2014 and for Mr. Trump\u2019s North Korea policy.There is good reason to think that this more open approach to the North is the better way to handle its supreme leader, Kim Jong-un.The current strategy, after all, is a dead-end. Missile defense, military exercises and economic sanctions only feed the insatiable security dilemma. Even the acclaimed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, deployed in the South by the United States, does nothing to protect Seoul from an attack. And each marginal improvement in the South\u2019s defense prompts the North to develop new asymmetrical threats and can have costly side effects. For example, Seoul\u2019s relations with Beijing have tanked over the Thaad deployment, which China sees as a threat to its security.But the liberal approach takes advantage of Mr. Kim\u2019s ambitions. As soon as he took power in 2012, Mr. Kim promised his people that they would never again have to \u201ctighten their belts,\u201d and he put economic progress at the center of his strategy. Half of that strategy, known in Korean as \u201cbyungjin,\u201d or \u201csimultaneous progress,\u201d refers to improving the nuclear deterrent, which gets all the headlines. Yet nuclear deterrence only provides the security guarantee on which Mr. Kim can turn to the more ambitious half of byungjin: economic development.South Koreans would be relieved to see Mr. Trump pursuing prudent diplomacy instead of reckless warmongering, and a \u201ccap and freeze\u201d deal would give a new government in Seoul a better foundation for opening its broader effort to help Mr. Kim lead his country toward regional integration and economic growth.A new South Korean president would prefer to start opening up toward the North with a United States-North Korea nuclear deal in place. But barring that, the next leader in Seoul should move forward with improving inter-Korean relations, and hope that Washington will eventually see the wisdom in a more open approach.John Delury is an associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University Graduate School of International Studies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Madison Avenue Pitching Now? Cultural and Political Awareness", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingMadison Avenue exists to persuade. (Check out how stylish this car looks! Doesn\u2019t everyone seem to be having a great time while drinking this beer?) In a perilous political climate, however, some advertising agencies have decided to use their marketing acumen in service of advancing cultural and political causes, rather than selling products.It is not unusual for agencies to work with nonprofit groups or create public service announcements, pro bono, but this new activism entails a deeper level of involvement.The campaign included a 60-second video directed by Mr. Linklater \u2014 the tagline: \u201cI pee with L.G.B.T.\u201d \u2014 and 15-second versions, which are being disseminated through targeted Facebook advertising.\u201cOur goal with this, ultimately, is to get people to reach out to their legislators,\u201d said Duff Stewart, the chief executive of the agency, GSD&M, which is spearheading the campaign. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s an important issue for Texas.\u201dPointing to North Carolina as an example, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s also an economic-impact issue. It\u2019s going to have a detrimental effect to the economy in the state of Texas, and the ability to recruit and maintain talent.\u201dFor the agency, though, the impetus to get involved goes beyond that. \u201cFrom a cultural perspective, being open and kind and accepting of our fellow human beings is, I think, what we\u2019re about,\u201d Mr. Stewart said.Other advertising professionals who have taken on more issue- or cause-related projects also see the work as a kind of affirmation of their principles and beliefs in the Trump era.\u201cYou sort of have this feeling of being helpless when something goes off the tracks in the country, so it\u2019s nice to be able to do something,\u201d said Neil Kraft, president and creative director of KraftWorks, which last year developed a platform to support female entrepreneurs in collaboration with Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Day.KraftWorks created the concept for choosewomen.org, which helps impoverished women finance business ventures, and recruited corporate partners, like Sephora and Lilly Pulitzer, willing to donate a portion of sales made through the site. \u201cIt was a deeper involvement, and it was more personal,\u201d Mr. Kraft said.\u201cWe\u2019re storytellers, so if we\u2019re going to create a movement, we\u2019re going to do it through stories,\u201d Ms. Flanik said.These kinds of forays into social issues do carry some risk.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many people would make their decision about an ad firm based on this one way or another, but some people who are more involved in politics might be upset,\u201d said William Benoit, professor of communication studies at Ohio University. In today\u2019s social-media-driven culture, anything that carries even a whiff of political opinion carries the potential for opposition, he said, pointing to the ire that Nordstrom department stores faced over curtailing sales of Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories.The flip side, though, could be an increase in business from clients whose viewpoint aligns with that of the agency.\u201cI think there are some risks in the sense of potentially alienating a client or a potential client if the agency has decided to put a stake in the ground,\u201d said Jeremy Rosenberg, a managing director at the public relations firm Allison & Partners. He added that an ancillary risk could be alienating employees opposed to a particular cause. \u201cI think agency principals would have a good pulse on their employee base, but I think that is a potential concern as well.\u201dAgencies that have allocated resources to social projects say, however, that their employees are eager to participate.Mr. Kraft said his millennial employees were especially enthusiastic. \u201cThey\u2019re in a lot of ways more idealistic than I am and really like this and working on stuff like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it helps everyone feel good about selling other stuff all the time.\u201dUltimately, though, advertising executives say, the motivation is more about feeling compelled to use their industry\u2019s skills to draw attention to issues that matter in a divided culture.\u201cIf we don\u2019t speak up, somebody else will,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cThis last election is evidence that we cannot be complacent. We have to talk about and stand up for our beliefs. If you\u2019re not speaking up, you\u2019re not going to be heard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jim Rogers, Intrepid Investor, Finds Bumpy Road to North Korea", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China was an economic backwater when Jim Rogers began traveling its dusty byways more than three decades ago. Still, Mr. Rogers, a former partner of George Soros, saw its promise.Today, Mr. Rogers, 74, doles out advice to China\u2019s rising investor class at financial seminars, where he often draws a crowd. Part of his message involves another unloved market, where he sees promise despite authoritarian leadership and international sanctions: North Korea.\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. The kid has been opening up North Korea,\u201d Mr. Rogers said in an interview, referring to Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s ruler.But North Korea can be a murky place to tread \u2014 as Mr. Rogers\u2019s experience shows.A Hong Kong company called Unaforte that is involved in several North Korean businesses named Mr. Rogers as a shareholder a year ago, according to a corporate filing. Investing in a North Korean business like that would probably violate American sanctions if it happened now, though experts say it was legal at the time.Mr. Rogers said he gave Unaforte $100 as a token of good will but never expected that it would name him as a shareholder. Asked about his stake in the company in October, he interrupted an interview with The New York Times to call Unaforte and told the English-speaking sister of its founder that the company had agreed he could not be a shareholder.Speaking into his phone, Mr. Rogers said, \u201cI know I have told you, \u2018Never, never, never.\u2019\u201dUnaforte no longer lists Mr. Rogers as a shareholder in its filings but will not release shareholder records that might show more details about the shares given to Mr. Rogers. Officials at Hong Kong\u2019s corporate registry said they were investigating whether Unaforte is complying with the city\u2019s disclosure laws. Unaforte did not respond to emailed questions for comment.Investing in North Korea is not for the faint of heart. Many countries heavily restrict what foreign companies and investors can do there. With records in North Korea inaccessible to most outsiders, claims there cannot be easily verified. Intrepid overseas investors have little choice but to work through middle men, often based in China.\u201cA lot of times there are these very, very murky series of transactions that need to occur where you may not know who your partners are,\u201d said J. R. Mailey, a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins\u2019s U.S.-Korea Institute in Washington, who has studied fraudulent investment in North Korea.Still, for some, the attraction can be considerable. Asia\u2019s fast-growing economies are now well-trod ground, leaving fewer opportunities to get in early and make it big.\u201cThe country is like an El Dorado that lures people in,\u201d Mr. Mailey said. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to risk everything because the payout is so high.\u201dIn interviews, Mr. Rogers said his relationship with Unaforte was distant. He said he spoke at investor events held in mainland China by Unaforte and companies controlled by its founder, Zhao Chunhui, about North Korea, among many other subjects. \u201cI make speeches for hundreds of people,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. He declined to disclose the amount of his speaking fees.Mr. Zhao appeared to see his relationship with Mr. Rogers differently. In Chinese-language marketing materials and on social media, Mr. Zhao called himself \u201cJim Rogers\u2019s business partner in China.\u201d A fund promoted at speaking engagements organized by Mr. Zhao or his businesses referred to Mr. Rogers as a shareholder.The fund and Unaforte posted photos of Mr. Rogers signing and posing with a document titled \u201cshareholder contract\u201d online, announcing in Chinese that Mr. Rogers had become a shareholder. One advertising banner featuring Mr. Rogers reads, \u201cBe a shareholder along with Jim Rogers.\u201dChinese corporate records show no evidence that Mr. Rogers owns shares in the fund, called Gold Quantum.Then there was Unaforte\u2019s share allocation to Mr. Rogers. The American investor said he gave Unaforte $100 as a gesture of good will. \u201cIt was a token investment once upon a time,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.Unaforte then made Mr. Rogers a shareholder. According to a Hong Kong filing, it allocated Mr. Rogers shares representing a stake of more than 1 percent in Unaforte.The shares were allocated to Mr. Rogers in February 2016, one month before the American government tightened sanctions on North Korea, effectively barring its citizens from any business that might benefit the government there.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that anything Rogers did is illegal,\u201d said Joshua Stanton, a Washington-based lawyer who follows United States sanctions imposed on the country and has helped draft some of them. \u201cIt would be now.\u201dMr. Rogers said he sent a letter to Unaforte asking that it return his $100 and take back an unspecified number of shares. It was dated March 17, 2016, a day after President Obama signed an executive order imposing new sanctions on North Korea.A copy of the letter that Mr. Rogers shared with The New York Times was stamped by Hong Kong tax authorities on Sept. 29, the day after The Times first asked Unaforte about Mr. Rogers\u2019s stake in the company. Mr. Rogers said Unaforte told him it delayed getting the stamp because one was required only before the end of the company\u2019s fiscal year, which was Sept. 30.Mr. Rogers, who does not read Chinese, also said he asked Mr. Zhao to remove mentions of him as a shareholder, and said companies in China and elsewhere often claim falsely to be associated with him. \u201cWe have a never-ending battle with things like this all over the world, as do others,\u201d he said in an email.Its sole director is the 44-year-old Mr. Zhao, who also goes by Willam Zhao.Documents show Mr. Zhao is a Chinese national but also a citizen of the Dominican Republic. He has identified himself on one of his social media accounts as the chairman of First Eastern Bank, which is incorporated in the North Korean special economic zone of Rason and which Unaforte says it operates.Mr. Zhao also has an office in Guangzhou, for the mainland-registered Unaforte company. When visited by a Times reporter last fall, that office featured a poster of Mr. Zhao arm in arm with Mr. Rogers.In an interview, Mr. Rogers said he did not recall how he first met Mr. Zhao. \u201cHe seems to be doing a lot in North Korea,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cHe says it\u2019s profitable.\u201dCarlos Tejada in Hong Kong contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Speech to Congress: Video and Transcript", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump on Tuesday delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. The following is a transcript, as prepared by the Federal News Service. (APPLAUSE)... and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation\u2019s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.Recent threats ...(APPLAUSE)Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\u2019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.(APPLAUSE)Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter ...(APPLAUSE)... of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.(APPLAUSE)All the nations of the world \u2014 friend or foe \u2014 will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.For too long, we\u2019ve watched our middle class shrink as we\u2019ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We\u2019ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.(APPLAUSE)Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.(APPLAUSE)Thank you. It\u2019s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I\u2019ve made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.(APPLAUSE)The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. We\u2019ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic \u2014 and it is a fantastic \u2014 new F-35 jet fighter, and we\u2019ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials \u2014 and a lifetime ban ...(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency ...(APPLAUSE)... and we\u2019re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines ...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.(APPLAUSE)And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.(APPLAUSE)At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We want all Americans to succeed, but that can\u2019t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.(APPLAUSE)For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.(APPLAUSE)According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.(APPLAUSE)Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.(APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.(APPLAUSE)As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.(APPLAUSE)I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.(APPLAUSE)Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.(APPLAUSE)I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.(APPLAUSE)More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.(APPLAUSE)Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.(APPLAUSE)It will be a big, big cut.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers \u2014 have to do it.(APPLAUSE)Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.(APPLAUSE)And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d(LAUGHTER)At our meeting, I asked them, \u201cHow are you doing? How is business?\u201d They said that it\u2019s good. I asked them further, \u201cHow are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?\u201dThey told me \u2014 without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they\u2019ve become used to it \u2014 that it\u2019s very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.They weren\u2019t even asking for a change. But I am. I believe ...(APPLAUSE)I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It\u2019s been a long time since we had fair trade.The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that \u201cthe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201dLincoln was right, and it\u2019s time we heeded his advice and his words.(APPLAUSE)I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken \u2014 advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country no longer.(APPLAUSE)I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.(APPLAUSE)The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.(APPLAUSE)I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security and to restore respect for our laws.If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.(APPLAUSE)Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.(APPLAUSE)America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.(APPLAUSE)To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.(APPLAUSE)This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.(APPLAUSE)Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare ...(APPLAUSE)... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.(APPLAUSE)Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.(APPLAUSE)The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.(APPLAUSE)One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they\u2019re losing them fast, they are losing them so fast. They\u2019re leaving. And many Americans have no choice at all. There\u2019s no choice left.(APPLAUSE)Action is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.(APPLAUSE)Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.(APPLAUSE)Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.(APPLAUSE)Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.(APPLAUSE)And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines ...(APPLAUSE)... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?(APPLAUSE)On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.(APPLAUSE)My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave ...(APPLAUSE)... to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.(APPLAUSE)True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan ...(APPLAUSE)Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan\u2019s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\u2019s life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.(APPLAUSE)Megan\u2019s story is about the unbounded power of a father\u2019s love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need.If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.(APPLAUSE)In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \u2014 and the souls \u2014 of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time.(APPLAUSE)I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.(APPLAUSE)These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.(APPLAUSE)Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning \u2014 great learning center \u2014 with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will get her master\u2019s degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.(APPLAUSE)But to create this future, we must work with \u2014 not against \u2014 not against \u2014 the men and women of law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it\u2019s \u2014 really, it\u2019s what it is, division. It\u2019s pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They\u2019re friends and neighbors, they\u2019re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they\u2019ll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.(APPLAUSE)Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiel\u2019s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands \u2014 Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \u2014 were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.(APPLAUSE)To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.(APPLAUSE)Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war \u2014 if they must \u2014 they have to fight and they only have to win.(APPLAUSE)I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...(APPLAUSE)... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.(APPLAUSE)The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.(APPLAUSE)We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.(APPLAUSE)I just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \u201cRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.\u201dRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he\u2019s very happy, because I think he just broke a record.(APPLAUSE)For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.(APPLAUSE)To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism ...(APPLAUSE)... and a Cold War and defeated communism.(APPLAUSE)But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.(APPLAUSE)We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost \u2014 have to do that.We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.(APPLAUSE)Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world. All across the world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.(APPLAUSE)America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\u2019s centennial. At that celebration, the country\u2019s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America\u2019s 250th year.(APPLAUSE)Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear \u2014 schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow \u2014 are not too much to ask.(APPLAUSE)When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same God.(APPLAUSE)When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Roll Back the Vehicle Fuel Standards", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOne of the signal achievements of the Obama administration was reaching an agreement with the auto industry to dramatically increase fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, doubling them to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.The industry now wants to renege. At its behest, the Trump administration is expected to initiate a rollback.Weakening these standards would be a mistake for consumers, the environment and the auto industry itself. They are the most important action the United States has taken to address climate change and reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on oil.From 2022-25 alone, they are projected to reduce American oil consumption by 1.2 billion barrels, cut half a billion metric tons of carbon pollution and save consumers millions of dollars in fuel costs, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The net benefits to society are estimated at $100 billion. And these gains are on top of those achieved through 2016 and expected through 2021.The standards also provide badly needed uniformity and predictability for the auto industry. When we adopted our strategy, car companies were facing the prospect of three different and conflicting sets of standards.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had traditionally set fuel economy standards. But in 2007, the Supreme Court held that the E.P.A. could regulate greenhouse gas pollution from vehicles under the federal Clean Air Act, adding another regulator to the mix.Complicating matters, the Clean Air Act allowed California to set its own more stringent air pollution standards after it received a waiver to do so from the E.P.A. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia, representing 40 percent of the national car market, copied California\u2019s rules. We ended up with multiple regulators with different approaches.To fix this regulatory mess, we proposed a single national standard set jointly by the two federal agencies, which California agreed to support. To ease any burden on the auto companies, we would phase the standards in and provide plenty of compliance flexibility.I led the White House negotiations with the industry in 2009 that resulted in this historic agreement. We worked with the companies to set standards for each type of vehicle they planned to make, according to its size and attributes. Consumer choice would not be restricted. Our only demand was that all new cars and trucks had to steadily improve fuel efficiency for every type of vehicle over time.Nothing revolutionary was required. The companies can meet their targets by adopting technologies already available or well within reach, like advanced transmissions and turbocharging, or by improving vehicle aerodynamics. The standards don\u2019t require a dramatic shift to electric vehicles but depend overwhelmingly on improvements to traditional internal combustion engines.In exchange for this clarity, the auto companies signed formal commitment letters agreeing not to challenge the standards. Indeed, industry lawyers helped the government to successfully defend them in court.The Obama administration used the same template to set standards for medium and heavy-duty trucks, again with industry support. Other countries, like Canada, copied our approach, creating a consistent North American strategy.Unraveling the agreement now will undo this alliance, plunging the companies back into regulatory chaos, with all its uncertainty, acrimony and cost.And if the Trump administration tries to significantly weaken the rules, California will withdraw its consent and enforce its own higher standards using its waiver, which is valid to 2025. Should the E.P.A. try to revoke the waiver prematurely, California will, without question, sue.Even if the companies want to take that risk, a rollback is not warranted by the facts. Market conditions now favor tighter standards, even though automakers say the 2025 target is expensive and unrealistic for them to meet as consumers shift away from smaller vehicles to bigger, less fuel-efficient pickups and S.U.V.s.In reality, the standards for larger vehicles are markedly less stringent than for smaller cars, so the industry gets the benefit of a sliding scale. Manufacturers stoke the demand for larger vehicles by aggressively marketing them to reap bigger profits. Still, even the biggest trucks and S.U.V.s can become more efficient using off-the-shelf technologies.There is a real downside to selling a greater share of larger vehicles, however: The auto fleet produces less efficiency overall. With S.U.V.s flying off the lots, the original target of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 already has dropped to 51.4 m.p.g. in the E.P.A.\u2019s recent estimates. This will result in extra fuel costs and more pollution.If anything, we should be strengthening standards when gas prices are low, to prevent slippage in fuel efficiency actually achieved. But the Obama administration never suggested doing that, instead honoring the deal it had struck.Above all, we believed that cost-effective technologies were available to improve vehicle efficiency at a reasonable cost to consumers and that the domestic auto industry, stagnant in 2009, would benefit from being prodded to innovate.As it has turned out, the industry is now thriving, with record sales. And it has easily exceeded the fuel efficiency standards every year since 2012. There is no reason to think it cannot continue to do so.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Now Cleared, de Blasio Gets Out of His Own Way in Mayor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byIt was the moment the New York political world had been waiting for since last spring, when word of a flurry of state and federal investigations into Mayor Bill de Blasio first emerged: prosecutors had finished their work and no criminal charges would be brought against the mayor or his aides.But it also left lingering ethical questions about the mayor\u2019s behavior and even confirmed the existence of a culture at City Hall in which the mayor considered it normal to make the case for donors in front of city agencies that report to him and acceptable to seek \u201can end run around\u201d campaign finance limits.Mr. de Blasio, rather than seeming relieved that no criminal charges would be brought, appeared by turns dismissive, defensive and combative when faced with questions throughout the day about the investigations, eager to move on to other topics and permanently put the issue to rest.\u201cThe exhaustive investigation has come to a clear conclusion,\u201d he told reporters in the afternoon. \u201cLots of allegations, and no charges brought.\u201dHe defended his actions and refused to acknowledge that the prosecutors raised serious ethical questions about his activities, even as they said they did not have the legal grounds to accuse anyone of a crime.\u201cGuys, there\u2019s laws,\u201d he said, bombarded by questions from reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s laws.\u201dIn a royal blue suit and lately sporting long, pale gray sideburns, Mr. de Blasio said that he had only glancingly read the documents provided by prosecutors \u2014 even though the federal prosecutor\u2019s statement was only five sentences long \u2014 and at one point referred dismissively to the investigations by saying \u201caspersions were cast.\u201dThe end of the probes means that Mr. de Blasio, already facing an anemic slate of declared opponents, faces a road to re-election cleared of any major obstacles in the primary election in September. At the same time, his Republican opponents have been robbed of their most potent argument against him \u2014 that criminal corruption pervades his administration.It turned out that Mr. de Blasio was in gym clothes when news that he would not be charged broke on Thursday morning. He made his first public comments in a radio interview minutes later and sought to put the whole episode behind him.\u201cWe gotta get back to work,\u201d he told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer during the mayor\u2019s regular weekly radio session.But Mr. de Blasio and his administration did not emerge unscathed. Federal prosecutors and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office made a point of highlighting conduct by the mayor and those acting on his behalf that, while not criminal, appeared to breach an ethical line. He acted on behalf of donors, federal prosecutors said; he attempted to evade \u201cthe spirit\u201d of state campaign contribution limits, according to the state prosecutors.\u201cIt shows that while the line was not legally crossed, it was ethically blurred,\u201d said Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, a good government group. \u201cHarm was still caused because a pay-to-play culture was created in that New Yorkers felt that they needed to support the mayor\u2019s fund-raising in order to be considered for positive action by City Hall.\u201dThe mayor deflected questions about those findings at a news conference in City Hall on proposed federal budget cuts. Flanked by his top aides, Mr. de Blasio refused to detail cases where, in the characterization of prosecutors, he had acted on behalf of donors seeking favors, and said he would not change how his administration dealt with such requests in the future.\u201cWhat matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year and no charges have been brought and this is the end of the matter,\u201d he said.Even before the prosecutors\u2019 announcement, Mr. de Blasio appeared to be in a strong political position heading into the re-election campaign. Crime is low, the city\u2019s economy has been strong and he has policy achievements to point to, such as universal prekindergarten. His poll numbers have improved slightly and challengers preferred to let the investigations play out before jumping into the race.That analysis appeared to be correct, according to conversations with those mulling a run or their aides on Thursday. It all but ended speculation of a run by the city\u2019s public advocate, Letitia James; Ruben Diaz Jr., the borough president of the Bronx; and Scott M. Stringer, the city\u2019s comptroller.\u201cIt\u2019s behind us now,\u201d said Ms. James. \u201cI look forward to working on intractable issues such as affordable housing and homelessness.\u201dBradley Tusk, a former Bloomberg adviser who had been openly seeking a Democratic challenger to Mr. de Blasio, said Thursday that he would stop. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in tilting at windmills,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all came down to indictments and there were no indictments, so there\u2019s not much else to do.\u201dOn the Republican side, undeclared potential challengers such as Eric Ulrich, a city councilman, or the billionaire supermarket magnate, John Catsimatidis, now appeared less likely to enter the race.\u201cI was definitely willing to run if he was not going to be around,\u201d Mr. Catsimatidis said. But he added, \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at it.\u201dMr. Sheinkopf said there were still issues that a challenger could press the mayor on.\u201cThe issue now switches from corruption to management and performance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not as sexy, more subject to argument and always gives the incumbent an advantage except when crime rises.\u201dHe added: \u201cIs there an attack on him that works? Yes. Are the ethics issues gone as of today? No. But will it be tougher to beat him? The answer is yes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Rare Books and Artifacts From a 1906 Library ", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byNovelists have always known, maybe because their lives are so bound up in books.Vladimir Nabokov wrote: \u201cNothing revives the past so completely as a smell that was once associated with it.\u201dFor many people, the smell of books, in particular, is one of memory\u2019s most powerful messengers, especially as the printed page gives way to the digital. Over the last year, he and seven graduate students have been conducting a project in collaboration with the Morgan, with the help of Christine Nelson,\u00a0curator of literary and\u00a0historical manuscripts at the library.Their goal is perhaps someday to be able to convey a sense of the building\u2019s history beyond just its look and feel. Their primary tool is a sampling device that looks like a contraption out of Jules Verne: a crystalline dome with plastic tubing snaking from its side.The sampler is placed gently on objects \u2014 rare books, furniture, carpets \u2014 to capture the escaping molecules that create a distinct smell.\u201cUnder normal circumstances, we would have been kicked out of any museum if we were behaving the way we behaved: We were on all fours, putting our heads under Morgan\u2019s desk, smelling his cigar box, the aromas inside his personal book vault, which were still very strong,\u201d said Mr. Otero-Pailos, who has been exploring the role of smell in preservation for almost a decade.He grew interested in the Morgan not only because of its role as one of the premier repositories in the world for rare books and manuscripts, but also, he said, because \u201cit\u2019s such an important building for the history of America, and yet there are really a very small group of people who know about that significance.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one of the places where the shape of the American economy was decided, through the power of Morgan,\u201d he added.Ms. Nelson, who has worked at the Morgan for 26 years, said: \u201cOne of the reasons I was very drawn to working with this project was that for years people have come to me and said: \u2018Oh God, it must smell so great where you work! I remember that old book smell from my favorite library so well.\u2019 Everybody has some sort of olfactory memory of a library that probably had an effect on their lives.\u201dShe added: \u201cFor me as a librarian, I\u2019ve always thought about the question: Is there really a single old-book smell? I feel very strongly that there\u2019s not, and now I\u2019m going to get to see the proof.\u201dThat proof is being percolated over the next few months in a Manhattan lab at International Flavor and Fragrances, a company that produces smells and tastes for everything from colognes to detergents and candies. Carlos Benaim, a master perfumer with the company who has been involved in the Morgan project, said that the thousands of molecules that were trapped in the glass-bell sampler would be categorized to determine which of them constitutes the smell profile of objects and surfaces from the Morgan.\u201cIt\u2019s a lengthy process that will take several months of in-depth work, especially for this many objects,\u201d Mr. Benaim said.Besides books like a 16th-century calfskin-bound volume of Jacobus de Voragine\u2019s \u201cThe Golden Legend,\u201d what does a shelf of Circassian walnut that Morgan undoubtedly drew volumes from smell like? Or a box of his cigars, Havanas by Pedro Murias, circa 1910? Or a 1905 Otis elevator?For that matter, what might these things have smelled like during Morgan\u2019s time or, for the rare volumes, centuries ago when they were new from the printer and binder? And could there be some Gilded-Age perspiration still lingering somewhere in the mix? During the 1907 financial panic, Morgan famously locked a group of bankers in the library overnight to force them to come to an agreement to save the economy.\u201cWhen we started this, we didn\u2019t really know where this would go, and we still don\u2019t, quite; it\u2019s still an experiment,\u201d she said.Describing the project as \u201ca scientifically informed art,\u201d Mr. Otero-Pailos added: \u201cOne thing we\u2019re not doing is trying to create old-book perfume. That\u2019s not the end goal. In the end, we\u2019re after meaning, historical meaning, cultural meaning and how to do that is something we hope to figure out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For I.P.O., Saudi Oil Company May Have to Give Up Some of Its Secrets", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byAs investment bankers and Saudi officials plan the trading debut, there are more questions than answers: Is the company worth $2 trillion, as the Saudis insist, or a small fraction of that, as argued by bankers and international oil experts? Will members of the royal family, with their secret oil payments, allow the kind of transparency that investors are demanding? Can the Saudis pull this off by late next year, as promised, especially if oil prices decline again or tensions heighten around the Persian Gulf?Khalid A. al-Falih, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister and chairman of Saudi Aramco, brushed aside many of those concerns before global energy executives here on Tuesday, seeking to build confidence that the Saudi Aramco offering would be the richest ever.But not all energy experts are so sure the offering will go smoothly, although investment bankers and Saudi officials alike have plenty of incentives to make it a success.\u201cTalk is cheap, implementation is difficult,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \u201cThey will have to recreate books that never existed.\u201dAs a prize, there are fewer bigger than Saudi Aramco. The Saudis plan to offer 5 percent of the company, which could raise $20 billion to $100 billion, depending on a company valuation still to be determined.The Saudis insist on the higher values based on the country\u2019s 266 billion barrels of oil reserves, roughly 15 percent of total global supplies, which they say provide the company with a total valuation of $2 trillion. The bankers, however, are relying on other calculations, based on various analyses of operations, costs and projections of future commodity prices. The consultants at Wood Mackenzie reportedly have estimated a valuation of roughly $400 billion. The firm would not confirm that figure for this article.The biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC, are positioning themselves by advising the Saudis on how to structure the offering.But investment bankers say the value of the company can be determined only after the Saudi government outlines the minority protections that investors will have, what taxes they will have to pay, and what Saudi Aramco\u2019s cost structure will be. Complex assumptions must be made involving projections of oil prices and demand over the next 30 to 50 years in a world increasingly worried about climate change and susceptible to technological disruption.Under a privatization, some combination of the government, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund and members of the royal family would have to share the profits with foreign investors. Since the government depends on the company for most of its revenue, that is a delicate issue.Separating Saudi Aramco from the government could be as complicated as separating conjoined twins. Not only is the company\u2019s governance tied to the management of the state\u2019s most valuable assets \u2014 its oil, refineries, production equipment and pipelines \u2014 but it is called on to do things far removed from energy, like building hospitals and schools and financing homeownership. The company sells a substantial amount of its production domestically at sizable discounts to world prices.The state company now pays an 85 percent tax on its profits. That rate would probably be reduced considerably to make the stock offering attractive, but that could complicate state finances at a time when the government is struggling with higher debts and lower revenue.\u201cYou can imagine a lot of things going wrong,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, a Middle East energy expert at the University of California, Davis. \u201cMaybe they are going to get a lot less money than they thought they were going to get, and that is going to be a budget problem and a failure.\u201dSaudi Aramco has never released the kind of financial statements that Western companies do routinely. That could be a problem if the company pushes for a New York Stock Exchange listing, as expected, since the Securities and Exchange Commission would insist on precise disclosure of proven undeveloped reserves, which must be developed within five years to remain on the books. Such decisions have been kept strictly secret by the Saudis.Bankers say they are enthusiastic about the potential of the deal to produce a bountiful and secure dividend stream, but only as long as Saudi officials make the pragmatic decisions to structure Saudi Aramco like other public companies. They praise the company for its professional management and productivity.\u201cAssuming a market-related governance and tax structure,\u201d said Osmar Abib, global co-head of oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, \u201cSaudi Aramco should produce strong cash flows given its low-cost crude production profile and substantial reserve position.\u201dIn his talk on Tuesday, Mr. Falih acknowledged that there was still resistance to change in the kingdom and that his company still needed to work on its accounting practices to meet international stock exchange standards.\u201cIt\u2019s not simple, it\u2019s really complex,\u201d he said.\u201cEverything is changing,\u201d said Samer S. al-Ashgar, president of the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, based in Riyadh. \u201cThere is no better way to describe it than as a business culture revolution.\u201dStanley Reed contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

Indeed, the Chinese government\u2019s plan says Chinese industries that benefit should own as much as 80 percent of their home market in just eight years.\u201cThe Chinese make it clear that they want to be the global champion\u201d and are trying to carve out market share now, said Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, which wrote the report.The plan\u2019s mechanism is simple: It would provide large, low-interest loans from state-owned investment funds and development banks; assistance in buying foreign competitors; and extensive research subsidies, all with the goal of making China largely self-sufficient in the targeted industries.Although European and American government officials have expressed misgivings about the plan, the Chinese government has made clear in recent days that it plans to press on.In addition to the sectors Mr. Li cited, the plan also covers the manufacturing of aircraft, robots, electric cars, rail equipment, ships and agricultural machinery. China seeks to wean itself off imports from companies like Boeing, Airbus, General Electric, Siemens, Nissan, Renault, Samsung and Intel.The Chinese government has long worried that the country\u2019s economy is still too concentrated in fairly low-end manufacturing. Making and assembling Apple iPhone components, for instance, is done by hundreds of thousands of workers in China, while the better-paid, value-added design and marketing work is done in the United States, although by many fewer employees.Although a large-scale shift of factories from the West to China has created tens of millions of Chinese jobs, the country\u2019s leaders worry that an increasingly well-educated younger generation is rejecting factory work for higher-paid office jobs.But the report by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China was lengthy and critical. The United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington plans to issue a similar report next week.The Chinese Communist Party has long relied on five-year plans to guide national economic growth. But \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d sets out broader targets.\u201cIt feels like a five-year plan, but this time not only domestic but international,\u201d Mr. Wuttke said.The timing is delicate. President Trump had campaigned about confronting China on trade and currency issues. He has not yet done so, but his advisers have been considering a revision to corporate taxes that would effectively impose a 20 percent tariff on all imports, not just from China.China is also laying the legal groundwork for challenging at the World Trade Organization a refusal by the United States to accept that China is a market economy for purposes of anti-dumping trade cases. It will make a similar challenge to European Union rules.China\u2019s top Commerce Ministry officials will hold their annual media briefing Saturday and may outline China\u2019s trade policy goals for this year.Along with subsidies at home, the Chinese plan calls for a shopping spree overseas.\u201cChinese high-tech investments need to be interpreted as building blocks of an overarching political program. It aims to systematically acquire cutting-edge technology and generate large-scale technology transfer. In the long run, China wants to obtain control over the most profitable segments of the global supply chains and production networks,\u201d according to a report on \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d released in December by the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank.For all of its funding and targets, analysts are divided about how effective the policies will be. Critics point out that its structure could lead to overspending by local governments and inefficient investment.Still, the Mercator report said that the policy is likely to bolster a \u201csmall vanguard\u201d of leading Chinese companies, adding, \u201cThese front-runners are likely to dominate their sectors on the Chinese market and become fierce competitors in international markets.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Beijing and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

It falls when investors think a growth-damaging \u201chard Brexit\u201d is more likely, and rises when they expect a more benign outcome.When the former occurs, the pound typically weakens and the domestically focused FTSE 250 index of midcap companies is apt to underperform the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies, which tend to be more global.Investors also tend to push up the cost of insuring against a British debt default relative to Germany, and compress the gap between the yields of two- and 10-year British government notes.As a result, the Breakingviews index fell sharply in the months after the referendum in June 2016, in which Britons voted to leave the European Union. The index has since clawed back some ground, though, not least because growth has proved far more resilient than most investors and policy makers expected.Yet the chances are that the gauge will fall in the months ahead.Mrs. May wants to clamp down on immigration from other countries in the European Union, but has so far been able to avoid tricky questions about what sort of trade restrictions others will want to impose. The economic price that Britain may pay will become increasingly clear now that negotiations can start.And even before any trade barriers are erected, growth could slow. Rising inflation is eroding the spending power of households. And jobs and business investment may be more vulnerable if talks start to look rancorous.Indeed, investors may be underestimating how closely political divorces can match real ones for bitterness and damage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Huda Kattan the Most Influential Beauty Blogger in the World?", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported bySkin DeepEvery month there seems to be a newly minted beauty star \u2014 someone whose social media feed highlights trends, how-tos, product reviews and more to her plentiful followers.That there is a resemblance to Ms. Kardashian West in looks (dark and curvaceous), style (glamorous and sexy) and family (Ms. Kattan\u2019s business partner is her sister Mona Kattan; her sister Alya is her social media manager) only fuels the comparisons. Based in Dubai, Ms. Kattan was in New York recently for a Women\u2019s Wear Daily beauty event \u2014 last year the publication anointed her the Digital Innovator of the Year in the \u201cprestige\u201d beauty category.\u201cI can understand getting compared to the Kardashians,\u201d she said, reclining on a plush seat at the Park Hyatt in Midtown. \u201cWe\u2019re 2017 women who are ultimately going out there, pursuing something out of passion and making a business out of it. I just can\u2019t wait for the comparisons to stop.\u201dWith what she has in store this year, Ms. Kattan, 33, may just step out from the Kardashian shadow. Her makeup line, Huda Beauty, which she introduced in 2013 with a false lashes collection, successfully expanded last year with the addition of hit lip liners, liquid matte lipsticks and an eye shadow palette.Sephora, for one, was surprised at how well her lip liners (called Lip Contours because Ms. Kattan uses them to make her lips look bigger, she said) sold. As a category, lip liners are often an afterthought because they were created to support lipsticks. Yet Ms. Kattan\u2019s Lip Contour release last May was \u201cone of the biggest launches in years,\u201d said Artemis Patrick, the senior vice president for merchandising at the retailer.Certainly Sephora is no stranger to makeup lines driven by social media. Anastasia Beverly Hills, Kat Von D and Natasha Denona all wield social media might. But Ms. Kattan is unique for a global reach that spans the United States, the Middle East and beyond.\u201cIt\u2019s rare for one person to be relatable across so many countries and cultures,\u201d Ms. Patrick said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s the power of the internet, but it\u2019s a testament to her business acumen that she can translate and harness the power of her followers.\u201dIndeed, Huda Beauty continues to be a top makeup brand at Sephora Middle East.And at Harrods in London, there have been lines for Huda Beauty ever since the company set up a counter in August. It\u2019s \u201cone of our fastest growing color makeup brands,\u201d said Annalise Fard, the beauty and home director at the store.Though social media fame can seem immediate, it didn\u2019t come overnight for Ms. Kattan. An Iraqi-American who was raised in Cookeville, Tenn., and Boston, she was, like many teenagers, obsessed with beauty products.\u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up superwealthy,\u201d Ms. Kattan said, noting that her father was an engineering professor, while her mother stayed home to raise her and four siblings. \u201cD.I.Y. was supercool because it was affordable and you could do it really easily.\u201d (Ms. Kattan is known for some of her zanier D.I.Y. experiments on YouTube, including trying alternative makeup primers \u2014 in one video, she found Vagisil superior to KY Jelly and Milk of Magnesia. \u201cI honestly thought the lube was going to be the best primer, but it didn\u2019t work at all,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cPeople in the Middle East did not necessarily like it. Ha! Sometimes I get a little chastised.\u201d)As for her renowned brow-defining skills, they were cultivated early. \u201cI\u2019m hairy,\u201d she said girlishly. \u201cIf you\u2019re hairy, you have to figure out how to do them at a young age.\u201d Her lighthearted approach to beauty later translated to a WordPress blog she started in 2010 at her sister Mona\u2019s urging. Ms. Kattan had taken a makeup course in California and was hoping to build a makeup clientele in Dubai, where she moved after her father took a job teaching at the American University of Sharjah.Ms. Kattan was particularly inspired by \u201coriginals, like Michelle Phan,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHer YouTube videos were like watching a movie.\u201d But her favorite was Kandee Johnson, because, she said, \u201cshe did really good transformations.\u201dEventually, Ms. Kattan would eclipse them all. Though she dabbled in YouTube, she never felt comfortable on the platform. \u201cI fell in love with Instagram,\u201d she said, even rattling off the exact month (October 2012) and phone model (iPhone 4) she had when she started her account. A couple of years later, she reached a million followers.Asked about her social media strategy, she shared the usual: Be true to yourself, share other users\u2019 posts to gain a community and be \u201csuperinvolved\u201d with both followers and customers by engaging in conversations. There is also the fact that she rarely accepts paid posts.\u201cEveryone is up in arms about paid posts,\u201d said the beauty publicist Alison Brod, who likens them to commercials or print ads. But by not taking money for her content, Ms. Brod said, Ms. Kattan appears more credible to her followers. That has translated to both social media currency and actual dollars. Ms. Brod\u2019s client Alterna Haircare saw its Instagram following jump up by 5,000 after Ms. Kattan featured its products in a post.For all that, Ms. Kattan will need to distinguish Huda Beauty from other social-media-driven brands that rely on a similar product assortment: liquid lipsticks, highlighters and eye shadow palettes. (See: Kylie Jenner\u2019s lip kits, highlighters and, yes, eye shadow palettes.) Ms. Patrick, of Sephora, said it would come down to innovation and telling the product story well.Ms. Kattan said, \u201cI think my fun is work.\u201dYet as her star rises, she has begun to draw a line between her work and personal life. She said she had not fully embraced Snapchat because it had \u201cno virality because you can\u2019t track,\u201d and because the platform was more personal than Instagram.\u201cMy day is boring,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people want to see me in meetings all the time.\u201d Even her favorite weekend activities include \u201cSWOT-ing\u201d \u2014 that is, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats \u2014 and practicing the kaizen productivity philosophy (a Japanese practice of continuous improvement). Self-confessed \u201cnerd\u201d she may be, but one with \u201cPinky and the Brain\u201d ambitions. Her ultimate goal is \u201cglobal domination,\u201d she said unwaveringly.\u201cThat probably sounds weird, but why not?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gina Raimondo then stepped up to the microphones and shot him a mischievous glance.\u201cA lot of these guys, they come for the tax incentive,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cBut really, they don\u2019t want to have to deal with me if they make the wrong decision. So I\u2019m glad you did the right thing.\u201dAt a time when states are fiercely competing to lure businesses, Ms. Raimondo, a Democrat, is scoring a string of successes. Over the past 15 months, 15 companies, including Fortune 500 firms, have announced plans to locate or expand in Rhode Island, and 19 real estate projects, including hotels and apartments, have been approved.Midway through her first term, Ms. Raimondo\u2019s frenzy of economic and job development is striking because Rhode Island has long been in a slump. It was the last state to emerge from the recession that began in 2007. As recently as 2014, it bore the nation\u2019s highest unemployment rate for seven months in a row.Moreover, she says, Rhode Island, long eclipsed by the economic powerhouses of Boston and New York, has a lot more to offer than tax incentives. She boasts of its easy access to Boston and New York, as well as to the ocean, while offering a lower cost of living, more affordable real estate and an emerging pool of young talent.Since then, Ms. Raimondo\u2019s efforts have stimulated not only the economy, but also political interest in her as her party, knocked on its heels in November, desperately seeks a way forward.Ms. Raimondo, 45, a Harvard-educated, Yale-trained lawyer who was a Rhodes Scholar and venture capitalist, was the first Democrat to be elected governor here since 1992. She is the first woman to hold the job, and one of only 16 Democratic governors nationwide.The combination of her aggressive recruitment of businesses, her ambition and her growing national profile has fueled speculation that she might someday run for national office \u2014 speculation she dismisses, at least for now.\u201cI am lockdown focused on my job,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to focus on anything politically, it would be my own re-election, which itself is 20 months away.\u201dIt is just such national attention that her critics bemoan.\u201cThere is a real disconnect between how she is portrayed in the national media and how she\u2019s truly received in Rhode Island,\u201d said Allan Fung, the Republican mayor of Cranston, the state\u2019s second-largest city. He lost to Ms. Raimondo, 41 to 36 percent, in a three-way race for governor in 2014, and is considering challenging her next year.Mr. Fung said Ms. Raimondo\u2019s problems extended far beyond the tax incentives.And Ms. Raimondo is still getting the cold shoulder from the state\u2019s public unions. In restructuring the pension system in 2011, when she was state treasurer, she raised the retirement age and suspended cost-of-living increases for retirees.Maureen Moakley, a political scientist at the University of Rhode Island, said Ms. Raimondo also faced \u201clatent resentment\u201d rooted in sexism in this culturally conservative state.

{"Headline": "Video Review: Mini Countryman Takes On the Big Boys", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byDrivenGoing by name alone, Jamba Juice is not the kind of place with steak on the menu. Men\u2019s wear at Dress Barn? Nope. Nor will you find big sport utility vehicles and crossovers, so popular with Americans, in a Mini showroom. That\u2019s not to say the brand isn\u2019t trying.Nearly half a foot shorter than a Subaru Impreza, the Countryman is the largest Mini made. The 2017 version is so all-new, the sole carry-over part is a wheel hub cover, and that\u2019s only on some designs. It rides on the same architecture as BMW\u2019s X1 (the German company owns the individualistic British brand) but is six inches shorter. It can\u2019t be too big. It\u2019s a Mini.Stretching the Countryman by eight inches has increased interior room to comfortably accommodate four adults. A panoramic glass roof is standard. So is a backup camera, a feature BMW should copy.I drove the new Countryman at a press event in Portland, Ore., a city as individualistic as Mini itself. Remarkably beardless, the staff on hand pointed at the Audi Q3, Porsche Macan, Lexus NX, Land Rover Discovery Sport and Mercedes GLA 250 as competitors. These can be about three to 11 inches longer than the Countryman, but many have the same or even less head- or legroom. So don\u2019t be discouraged by the Mini name if the bulldog design is up your alley.Still, running with the premium brands doesn\u2019t come cheap. Starting at $26,950 with a 1.5-liter 3-cylinder turbocharged engine under the clamshell bonnet, a Cooper S model with ALL4 all-wheel drive can be optioned up past $40,000. Surely, the John Cooper Works performance model and plug-in hybrid due out this spring will cost even more.The well-equipped Cooper S ALL4 I drove has a sticker price of $37,750 with seats draped not in leather, but rather in a tweedlike cloth. Who else but Mini does tweed?And here are some specifications: That 3-cylinder engine produces 137 horsepower. The Cooper S gets bumped to a 2-liter turbo 4-cylinder making 189 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque. In most cases, both engines can be had with a six-speed manual. Front-drive 3-cylinder cars get an optional six-speed automatic gearbox. The rest are outfitted with 8-speed automatics that can be had in a sport version that adds steering wheel paddle shifters. The sport\u2019s launch control feature provides maximum acceleration off the line should you drag-race a Jeep Renegade.Dialing up different drive modes causes a dashboard LED ring the size of a dinner plate to change color. It encircles an improved user interface \u2014 clearly based on BMW\u2019s iDrive \u2014 that uses both a knob and a touch screen for simplicity.The 3,600-pound Cooper S ALL4 goes from a standstill to 60 miles per hour in seven seconds. Not to criticize Oregon\u2019s roads, but the Countryman\u2019s suspension absorbed some hefty potholes with proper English resolve. The ride is now more comfortable and quiet; seating position in the Countryman is a significant five inches higher than in the Clubman, which rides on the same architecture. Despite the higher center of gravity, it confidently holds corners with a small amount of the expected body roll.The Environmental Protection Agency rates Countryman\u2019s fuel economy average from 28 miles per gallon (3-cylinder automatic transmission) to 24 (4-cylinder S with ALL4 and manual transmission). The vehicle prefers premium gasoline. The much roomier Honda CR-V averages three miles per gallon better on standard-grade gas.The most challenging terrain the Mini crew had in mind on the drive route was a short section of gravel road. With 6.5 inches of ground clearance, the Countryman should be kept on the moderate side of off-roading.Fortunately, a late-winter storm blew through the Mount Hood section of our drive. The new ALL4 system is quicker to engage, more efficient and smaller, taking up less interior space. It chugged through a foot of snow without issue. I\u2019ll argue that doing doughnuts in an empty parking lot is research.The cabin is pure Mini, with toggle switches and ambient LED strips that change to any color of the rainbow (including an actual rainbow setting for the dashboard arc). There are quality materials to touch and admire. A heated steering wheel, not available, would appeal to Britons and Americans alike. Siri Eyes Free is along for the ride. Apple CarPlay isn\u2019t.The back seat slides fore and aft and easily takes on two full-size adults. It splits 40/20/40 for cargo flexibility. Heated seats and a power port are not offered for rear passengers.Unlike the Clubman\u2019s dual swing-out doors, the Countryman\u2019s upward-swinging hatch protects from squalls. I was able to cram my suitcase and photography gear into the cargo hold with the back seats upright. That includes a large broadcast video camera and hefty tripod. More than anything, the experience proves I need smaller gear.Despite its growth spurt, the Countryman looks much the same in the brand\u2019s inimitable way. Eagle-eyed spotters will first notice new side scuttles (the adornment on the front quarter panels). The ability to customize Countryman is second to none. The Mini staff claims that about two-thirds of the cars are unique when it comes to trim.There are more efficient and less expensive choices than the Countryman. Size is a personal thing, but there\u2019s a strong argument for snaking through dense urban traffic in something far smaller than a Suburban. Buyers wanting the brand\u2019s attitude and engaging driving dynamics will find little to argue with in Mini\u2019s biggest offering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Challenge, After Raising Rates, May Be Existential", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIs the Fed at risk for real this time?Throughout American history, few institutions have inspired such persistent mistrust among voters and their elected officials as the mysterious authority that determines the value of their money.Since its inception in 1913, the Federal Reserve has been alternately accused of either making money too scarce and expensive or making it too plentiful and cheap.On Wednesday, a Federal Reserve led by Janet L. Yellen \u2014 confirmed three years ago in the Senate by the tightest margin in at least 35 years \u2014 is likely to get a taste of this vitriol.The pressing question for this era of populist policy making and popular anger is whether the Federal Reserve as we know it \u2014 arcane and academic, with the autonomy to set monetary policy as it sees fit \u2014 will survive the tension this time.Given the ferocious discontent with the \u201cestablishment\u201d stoked by Mr. Trump among his angry electoral base, the threat against the Fed this time seems of a higher order. As Adam S. Posen, an American economist who has served on the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, told me, \u201cThe sense that the Fed\u2019s independence could be taken away by a simple act of Congress is very real.\u201dThe pressure is already on. Mr. Posen, who now heads the Peterson Institute for International Economics, points out that the Fed already lost powers it deployed to counter the recession spawned by the financial crisis a decade ago: The Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation stripped it of its authority to lend freely to nonbanks, which it used to keep money market funds, insurance companies and others that had bet on the wrong side of the housing bubble from imploding and taking the economy with them.Alan S. Blinder, a vice chairman of the Fed during the Clinton administration, recalls the damage caused in the 1970s by Arthur F. Burns, who Mr. Blinder said juiced up the economy as Fed chairman to help President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s re-election bid and cracked down hard afterward.\u201cI\u2019m worried about the people Donald Trump will send over there,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf he sends over toadies beholden to Donald Trump, it would be a very serious threat to the Fed\u2019s independence.\u201dSo what is Ms. Yellen\u2019s Fed to do?Still, not all the criticism is mendacious. The popular mistrust of central bankers should not be ignored. After all, central bankers failed to prevent the most devastating financial crisis in generations \u2014 looking on idly, at best, while financial institutions peddled shady bonds to fuel a housing bubble of gargantuan proportions.And central banks have emerged, at least implicitly, with a bigger job than before, adding the preservation of financial stability to their duty to ensure low inflation and, in the Fed\u2019s case, full employment. Some central banks \u2014 though not the Fed \u2014 have been given new tools for this new job.Given this power, it is inevitable that the enormous discretion central bankers have in executing their mandate will inspire popular mistrust.\u201cThe financial crisis was very difficult to digest, costly, and had redistributional consequences,\u201d said Lucrezia Reichlin, former head of research at the European Central Bank and now a professor at the London Business School. \u201cCentral banks were at the center of the response, so the demand to open up this discussion is natural. We should not be afraid of talking about accountability.\u201dPerhaps. Perhaps there is a discussion to be had over whether the Fed should keep its role as supervisor of financial institutions, or whether the job should be placed with another agency. Maybe financial supervision should be made more rule-based, less subject to regulators\u2019 discretion.Maybe there is a better way for Fed officials to communicate with Congress and explain the thinking behind their decisions. Maybe the Fed needs extra tools \u2014 to impose limits on indebtedness, for instance, or to adjust monetary policy to serve measures of financial stability. Maybe it could benefit from a tweak in its mandate, to ensure a better balance between its goals of fostering employment and curbing inflation.And yet the populist streak driving through American politics seems unlikely to yield such measured outcomes. The Federal Reserve was designed to be insulated from the full force of democracy in order to protect its mandate from political opportunism, to ensure that policy hewed to technical expertise. It was designed \u2014 precisely \u2014 to protect it from a moment like this. One can only hope that the protections hold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renegotiate Nafta? Mexicans Say Get On With It", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 For more than two decades, free trade has been at the heart of Mexico\u2019s relationship with America, responsible for pumping a stream of vehicles, audio components and avocados north and cheap corn, cattle and software south.To the nation\u2019s leaders, it was central, vital, nonnegotiable. At least until President Trump came along, promising to upend nearly $500 billion in annual trade between the two countries if it could not be re-engineered more in America\u2019s favor.Now, the Mexico\u2019s leaders have a new priority: urging their American counterparts to hurry up and get on with it.While free trade has long been an article of faith in Mexico, uncertainty over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement is hitting the country hard.There has been an abrupt slowdown in foreign investment, pinching off much-needed capital as investors wait to see how things shake out. Last year, such investment fell by 6 percent, a prelude to what analysts have predicted will be a 21 percent drop in 2017. Add to that a fluttering peso, lowered growth expectations, rising interest rates and looming political headwinds, and the urgency becomes clear.Mexico, and its investors, need certainty.The delay has irked the Mexicans, who didn\u2019t want to renegotiate the pact in the first place.\u201cFrom the Trump and American perspective, this is purely an optional problem,\u201d said Michael Camu\u00f1ez, the president of ManattJones Global Strategies and an assistant secretary of commerce in the Obama administration. \u201cThey have taken one of the most productive trade relationships in the world and amazingly have turned it into a problem.\u201dDriving the pressure is an especially delicate political environment in Mexico. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s approval ratings are near single digits, and further delays in clarifying the future of Nafta could imperil not only growth, but also employment at a time when the government can least afford to lose support.Adding to the uncertainty are midterm elections in the State of Mexico, the country\u2019s most populous, from which the president hails. The state, a longtime center of power for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his party, will hold elections on June 4, and it is far from clear that his party will win. A loss would be a devastating blow to the party, which has never lost there before, and would spell trouble in the 2018 presidential elections.Which presents yet another paradox: The longer the Americans wait on Nafta negotiations, the more political pressure it places on Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, reducing the flexibility he has to accommodate demands, or surprises, from Mr. Trump\u2019s team.For instance, if job losses begin to mount within the next six months, as some economists predict, the public pressure on the president may be so immense he could have a much harder time selling a revised agreement to Congress and Mexicans at large.\u201cThe longer we wait, the harder it is going to be for Trump to get what he wants because the nationalist pressure on Pe\u00f1a Nieto will be cumulative,\u201d said Pamela Starr, an associate professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. \u201cThe longer he is in the presidency, from today forward, the more of a lame duck he is.\u201dAll of this means that the leverage Mr. Trump is looking for could start to diminish.Already, the Mexican government has grown more stridently critical of the Trump administration\u2019s stance on Nafta. The Mexican economic minister has said the nation will walk away from any deal that does not suit the country\u2019s needs, and even proffered a list of deal-breakers: any sort of discussion of paying for a border wall, taxing remittances or carrying out a so-called border adjustment tax.At the same time, there is a growing awareness that dealing with Nafta, a campaign priority for Mr. Trump, has suddenly taken a back seat to more pressing battles. And Mexicans have taken note.\u201cIt is clear that Trump\u2019s priority right now in terms of his agenda is to try to pass Trumpcare, and we know how long that takes,\u201d said Carlos Elizondo, a professor at the School of Government at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. \u201cThe outcome of that debate and process in the U.S. Congress will undoubtedly affect every other item on his list, including, of course, Nafta.\u201dThat could be a saving grace. Those reading the tea leaves of an eventual negotiation are hopeful that with Mr. Trump distracted, administration officials, including Mr. Ross, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and others will take control of the talks. Both men have run global businesses in complex industries, and many here hope that will give them a more nuanced view of trade.An evolving belief in the realm of business people, academics and even officials is that members of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet will understand the importance of Nafta, and move to preserve and expand it \u2014 not tear it apart.\u201cWhen you know the kind of value chain that we have, you understand that it is a very difficult world to destroy, almost impossible,\u201d said Juan Pablo del Valle Perochena, the chief executive of Mexichem, a Mexican chemical and building materials manufacturer. \u201cThere is so much at stake, of course, more for Mexico than the U.S., but there is a lot of value already in place. And when people understand that, they don\u2019t worry so much.\u201dStill, the uncertainty has had a clear impact on the Mexican economy. The peso dropped by double-digit percentages after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, forcing the central bank of Mexico to raise interest rates in February to an eight-year high to anchor inflation and bolster the currency, which has since rebounded.Expecting further pressure from the tense relationship with the United States, economists from an array of institutions have revised downward the expected 2017 growth for Mexico. Bancomer, a Mexican bank, for instance, revised its growth expectations for the Mexican economy to 1.0 percent for the year.Delays that might bleed into 2018 will place negotiations in the middle of a presidential election year in Mexico. Indeed, some analysts suggest that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto could kick the decision to his successor if negotiations go on too long. That, according to some, could be disastrous for those hoping to preserve Nafta.The leading candidate, for now, is Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a populist whose candidacy has been given a major boost by the election of Mr. Trump. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, a two-time candidate who nearly won the election in 2006, has promised to end a relationship of \u201csubordination\u201d to the United States, while focusing on domestic issues.It is unlikely that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will take as conciliatory a line in negotiations as the current administration.\u201cThe temptation to simply delay the negotiation until it becomes the next president\u2019s problem is real,\u201d Mr. Elizondo said.An article on Sunday about Mexico\u2019s eagerness to see the North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated referred incompletely to the current status of the peso. While the currency did in fact fall by double-digit percentages against the dollar after President Trump was elected, it rebounded in February and March and is now about 3 percent below its level of Nov. 8.Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the World Economy Has to Be Carbon Free by 2050", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTo reduce the risk of a global environmental catastrophe, and to avoid reversing the course of human progress, the world must urgently bend the curve of global emissions away from fossil fuels. Global warming must be kept below an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit); beyond that we will face major social and economic consequences.The math to keep the increase below that critical level doesn\u2019t get much simpler. Emissions must peak no later than 2020, and we must reach a fossil-fuel-free world economy by 2050.The vast divide between what is necessary and what politicians are willing to do leaves many scientists nervous that we could blow our last chance to reduce the grave risk to our environment and world stability.Still, there are good reasons for cautious optimism. Despite the halting progress made by politicians, history shows that the modern world has been shaped by major moments of disruption. Think about the recent United States election, Brexit, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the rapid advances made in the technology sector in recent decades.We emit about 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year. Assuming emissions start falling by 2020, and using the carbon law as our guide, we should halve carbon dioxide emissions to 20 gigatons by 2030. We then should reach 10 gigatons by 2040, and leave a small residual of five gigatons by 2050.To make this happen, we must ramp up technology to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, protect the oceans and land that absorb half of our emissions already, and transform the world\u2019s food system from a major carbon emitter into a major carbon store.A carbon law of halving emissions every decade can be adopted at all levels: for individuals, families, communities, companies, cities and nations. Those with the biggest carbon footprint need to do the most.The global economy is on the right trajectory.Installation of renewables in the energy sector is doubling every five to six years and has been on this course for a decade. If we keep doubling at this pace, renewables will reach 100 percent before 2050.We can say good riddance to coal by around 2030, saving millions of lives as air quality improves. And bye-bye to oil by 2040. At this pace and scale, we can be close to carbon-free by 2050.Johan Rockstrom is the director of Stockholm Resilience Center and professor of global sustainability at Stockholm University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Troubling Appeal of Education at For-Profit Schools", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the revelatory \u201cLower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy,\u201d the sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom introduces us to London, a 48-year-old widow and single mother of three children. London lives in rural North Carolina, and has watched as decent working-class jobs in the textile industry disappeared from her region. She hopes to land an office job with benefits, and knows she needs additional training. But she fears she would be turned away from the oversubscribed local community college because of her lack of academic preparation.So London has gone deep into debt enrolling in five for-profit college programs, only one of which she has completed. At various times she trained to be a child care provider, a medical biller, a computer technician and, most recently, a medical assistant. Cottom asked London what she would do if she could not find the middle-class health care administration job she desired \u2014 a type of position that often requires training in a medical specialty like cardiology. London\u2019s program at a branch of for-profit Everest College does not provide such specialized training. She smiled and told Cottom, \u201cJesus is my backup plan.\u201dSome two million Americans are enrolled in for-profit colleges, up from 400,000 in 2000. Those students, most of them working adults getting short-term certificates, are disproportionately nonwhite and female. They graduate with more debt than students who have attended public and nonprofit institutions, and are more likely to default on their loans. It is taxpayers who are financing the expensive and often academically inferior education that for-profit colleges provide. Ninety-four percent of for-profit students pay tuition with federal student loans.The Obama administration worked doggedly to regulate this sector. Its \u201cgainful employment\u201d rule led to the collapse of hundreds of for-profit colleges whose graduates performed poorly on the job market. In response, the industry complained that it was being punished for attempting to educate so-called low-status students: single mothers on welfare, high school dropouts with G.E.D.s and graduates of underperforming public schools who lack basic math and reading skills. Now for-profit colleges may find an ally in President Donald Trump, founder of Trump University. The incoming Department of Education could easily overturn Obama\u2019s regulations.There are other books, like \u201cDegrees of Inequality,\u201d by the political scientist Suzanne Mettler, that better explain the lobbying and legislating that empowered this industry and allowed it to expand far beyond its humble roots as a provider of certificates in fields like hairdressing and auto mechanics. But Cottom has written the best book yet on the complex lives and choices of for-profit students, who, she shows, are often quite savvy about the trade-off they\u2019re making by attending a low-prestige, high-cost institution. Unlike many traditional colleges, for-profits seek to accommodate the needs of busy working parents like London. Enrollment officers are available by phone and in person virtually around the clock. Classes begin throughout the year and meet at night.Part of Cottom\u2019s wisdom comes from personal experience. Before she earned her Ph.D., she worked for two for-profit colleges. Some of the most disturbing parts of \u201cLower Ed\u201d concern her training to become an enrollment officer at a technical school, where she was taught how to \u201cclose\u201d students, meaning sign them up at any cost. Officers were encouraged to isolate potential students from loved ones, like parents, who might urge caution before taking on debt. They presented recruits with misleading data on the number of jobs available in fields like cosmetology or tech support.Cottom also conducted fascinating field research. She interviewed for-profit college executives and over 100 students who enrolled in degree programs. She argues persuasively that the growth of the for-profit sector is a rational response to a service economy in which there are fewer living-wage jobs, and employers invest less and less in training their work forces. Panicked workers, having absorbed America\u2019s \u201ceducational gospel,\u201d believe the only way to ascend into the middle class is to engage in \u201ccredentialing,\u201d returning again and again to school in an often fruitless quest to find stable work.What these students really need, Cottom believes, are public supports like affordable child care. She writes, \u201cgiven the character of the new economy, one that by definition is risky and highly variable,\u201d for millions of people there simply isn\u2019t a good educational choice to be made. Even President Obama\u2019s efforts to rein in the industry amounted to little more than regulatory theater, she argues. \u201cWhat is interesting to me is how much disdain is spread among students and schools and how little disdain there is for labor markets.\u201d With great compassion and analytical rigor, Cottom questions the fundamental narrative of American education policy: that a postsecondary degree always guarantees a better life.Dana Goldstein, a national correspondent for The Times, is the author of \u201cThe Teacher Wars: A History of America\u2019s Most Embattled Profession.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Trump\u2019s Time Interview Shows About His Thinking", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Presidents usually choose their words carefully, the result of personal discipline and careful vetting by White House staff.Here are several passages from the interview, and analysis on what they show about how Mr. Trump thinks.If there\u2019s one thing that Mr. Trump hates, it is being laughed at. That is clear from this response in the Time magazine interview, when the president dismissed the critics who found humor in his pursuit of the White House.It is also worth remembering how flustered and angry Mr. Trump appeared to be when President Barack Obama made fun of him \u2014 and made a roomful of people laugh \u2014 during the 2011 White House correspondent\u2019s dinner. Mr. Trump has said he will not attend this year\u2019s dinner.No matter if the facts currently contradict him, Mr. Trump appears to have convinced himself that he will be proved correct \u2014 always \u2014 in the future.Among Mr. Trump\u2019s more bizarre assertions in recent days \u2014 and repeated in the Time interview \u2014 is the idea that he should not be held accountable for merely quoting someone who makes a controversial, even unproven, claim or allegation.That idea flies in the face of the longstanding expectation that everything a president says matters. Previous presidents have been careful, for example, not to say anything that could move financial markets. Mr. Trump (along with Sean Spicer, his spokesman, who similarly quoted Andrew Napolitano during a briefing) appears to believe that quoting someone else shields him from that expectation.Mr. Trump uses this tactic a lot. But he may find it more difficult now that he is in the White House, since by tradition just about every word a president utters is transcribed.Central to Mr. Trump\u2019s self-image is his belief that he is smarter than the people around him. Throughout his campaign, he often bragged that he knew better than the doubters, who he predicted eventually would be proven wrong.In addition to contradicting some of his previous assertions (in which he acknowledged that he had not known whether he would win), this passage in the interview underscores the extent to which Mr. Trump rarely allows any self-doubt to creep into his thinking.All presidents want to know how they are doing after moving into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And many denigrate the job of their predecessor; Mr. Obama often criticized the economy and the foreign policy he inherited from President George W. Bush.Mr. Trump is no exception, and this passage shows his willingness to rely on the same positive jobs numbers that he frequently dismissed as a candidate.But his response at the end of this interview also shows how Mr. Trump\u2019s mind works: His victory in November is the last word in the success of his administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Preet Bharara: \u2018Sheriff of Wall Street\u2019 or Pragmatic Showman?", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byDealBookWhen it comes to policing Wall Street, there are two distinct narratives about Preet Bharara\u2019s tenure as the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.If you think back to the immediate years following the financial crisis of 2008, Mr. Bharara, who took office in 2009, was pilloried for coming down far too lightly on bankers. He was accused of letting Wall Street off the hook for misdeeds that helped lead to the crisis, and he was frequently forced to defend the fact that no senior banker of note was prosecuted, let alone convicted, for the actions they took that brought the economy to its knees.Several years later, another story line emerged: Mr. Bharara had turned into the \u201cSheriff of Wall Street\u201d by aggressively prosecuting hedge fund managers for insider trading. The New Yorker magazine called him \u201cThe Man Who Terrifies Wall Street.\u201d But critics contended that this reputation was, in part, the result of overreaching: As evidence, they pointed to a federal appeals court that overturned two of Mr. Bharara\u2019s most prominent insider trading convictions.Both narratives, which are at odds with each other, misunderstand Mr. Bharara.He is, at his core, a pragmatist \u2014 one with a proclivity for publicity.\u201cIf we\u2019re not bringing a certain kind of case, it\u2019s because the evidence is not there \u2014 pure and simple,\u201d Mr. Bharara said in 2014 in a wide-ranging interview with Worth magazine about why he never prosecuted a bank C.E.O.\u201cI would suggest that some of these critics should go to law school and apply themselves and become prosecutors, and make the case that they think we should be making,\u201d Mr. Bharara said. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s frustration, because the things that have happened don\u2019t rise to the level of criminal conduct. People are being jerks and stupid and greedy and negligent, but you can\u2019t pin a criminal case on them.\u201dHis line of thinking was not popular then, nor is it now. A New York Times/CBS News poll in 2013 showed that nearly eight in 10 Americans felt that \u201cnot enough bankers and employees of financial institutions were prosecuted in their roles in the financial crisis.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that Mr. Bharara did not want to be popular or seek out publicity. He very much did \u2014 as evidenced by the firestorm he created over the weekend by announcing on Twitter that he had been fired.A subsequent tweet he posted \u2014 \u201cNow I know what the Moreland Commission must have felt like\u201d \u2014 was a reference to the New York State anticorruption commission that was disbanded when it focused on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. That tweet raised questions about whether Mr. Bharara was hinting that he had an investigation underway into President Trump. Or, to some who read it, perhaps it related to Mr. Cuomo.Others speculated that Mr. Bharara, once accused in a court filing of being a \u201cpetulant rooster,\u201d might be making provocative statements to test the waters for a run for governor of New York.On Monday, Mr. Bharara left his office in what seemed like a staged procession with staff members and others applauding him, as television cameras captured it all.Whatever the case, Mr. Bharara\u2019s publicity efforts have always seemed to be part of a larger strategy.In the many insider trading cases he brought, which were often heralded with news releases, his goal wasn\u2019t just to win in court, but to scare Wall Street.\u201cOur efforts are bound to have a substantial deterrent effect on insider trading specifically, and perhaps on corporate corruption generally,\u201d he said in a speech in 2011.Indeed, much of the trading community has lived in fear of Mr. Bharara and his office. While it is hard to quantify the effect of his campaign, anecdotally, many firms have tightened up their compliance programs.Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire hedge fund manager at the center of many of Mr. Bharara\u2019s investigations, was never prosecuted, but did pay a record $1.2 billion penalty.Still, some said Mr. Bharara went too far with the cases he brought. An appeals court overturned two insider trading cases, forcing him to seek the dismissals of seven similar convictions, and said his office was using a \u201cdoctrinal novelty\u201d to prosecute the cases.David Ganek, a hedge fund manager whose firm closed after an F.B.I. raid, took the unprecedented step of suing the Justice Department and naming Mr. Bharara as a defendant, saying the warrant used \u201cfalsely represented\u201d that Mr. Ganek was involved in insider trading. The case is still being heard.Whatever dent his reputation took for the reversal of the insider trading cases, Mr. Bharara seemed to make up for it by pursuing public corruption cases against Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic State Assembly speaker, and an investigation of Mayor Bill de Blasio.Maybe Mr. Bharara was just being pragmatic, with his deep understanding and appreciation for what would make news. In the Worth interview, he said: \u201cI have never said that insider trading is the crime of the century. It has not been my personal focus. It\u2019s the focus of the press because there are a lot of wealthy people that like the reporting of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Omaha\u2019s Answer to Costly Potholes? Go Back to Gravel Roads", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byOMAHA \u2014 After living more than 40 years along a road plagued by potholes, Jo Anne Amoura was excited to see city crews shred her block of Leavenworth Street into gravel.\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, this is great. We\u2019re going to get a new street,\u2019\u201d Ms. Amoura recalled. \u201cAnd then we waited and waited and waited.\u201dFresh pavement never arrived. Only after the asphalt had been ripped out almost three years ago did Ms. Amoura and her neighbors learn that their street had been \u201creclaimed,\u201d Omaha City Hall\u2019s euphemism for unpaving a road.\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of like living in the country in the city,\u201d said Ms. Amoura, 74. Her neighbors sometimes hauled wheelbarrows full of scattered gravel back up the hill after big rainstorms. And her house, she says, is regularly smudged with dirt blowing in from the street.As in many big cities, the infrastructure here is crumbling, a problem exacerbated by decades of neglect and a network of residential roads, including Ms. Amoura\u2019s, that have never met code. But Omaha\u2019s solution is extreme: grinding paved streets into gravel as a way to cut upkeep costs.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t like it and neither do the residents that live on those streets,\u201d said Mayor Jean Stothert, a Republican who is nearing the end of her first term. \u201cWe are about 50 years behind where we should be as far as resurfacing and repair. I can\u2019t catch up on 50 years of neglect in three or four years.\u201dBut infrastructure is also decaying at the most local levels \u2014 on cul-de-sacs and in neighborhood playlots unlikely ever to see federal funding. So cities like Omaha have resorted to unusual solutions.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that happened over one year or two years,\u201d said Brooks Rainwater, a senior executive and the director of the Center for City Solutions at the National League of Cities. \u201cThis has been decades of not investing in our infrastructure.\u201dOmaha\u2019s most problematic streets were mostly built by developers decades ago who skimped on costs by paving with asphalt instead of concrete, and by forgoing sidewalks and sewers. In other cases, Omaha annexed suburban-looking neighborhoods with roads not built to city standards.For years, an uneasy truce persisted: Public works crews would fill potholes and perform other maintenance work on those roads, but insisted that residents pay if they wanted repaving. Those streets, labeled \u201cunimproved\u201d by the city, account for about 6 percent of Omaha\u2019s roads.Then repair costs escalated, and potholes started going unfilled. On particularly troubled blocks, the city converted the asphalt surface into a gravelly dirt, a peculiar sight in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods in the center of a city. Only a small fraction of them, less than 10 miles, have been reclaimed.\u201cI can\u2019t even open my windows on that side of the house,\u201d said Sharon Thonen, a retiree who lives on what is now a dirt road a block from a busy Starbucks. Children stopped riding their bikes on her street after the asphalt was ripped out, Ms. Thonen said. \u201cDuring the summer, it\u2019s just a dust bowl.\u201dResidents have responded with angry phone calls, neighborhood meetings and at least one lawsuit. But Todd Pfitzer, the city\u2019s assistant director of public works, said Omaha\u2019s policy on unimproved roads is a matter of equity. When the houses were built two generations ago with subpar streets, he said, the builder and homeowner saved money.Still, for many homeowners, tearing up roads defies logic and sets back the stature of a city that by many metrics is thriving. Omaha, which has more residents than Miami or Minneapolis, has a growing population, a stable economy and a busy downtown with new developments and a glimmering baseball stadium that hosts the College World Series.\u201cIn grinding up streets and putting gravel roads in the middle of the core of your city, that damages the reputation, that damages the image and brand of a city,\u201d said Heath Mello, a Democrat and former state lawmaker trying to unseat Ms. Stothert this spring. For her part, the mayor said that along with turning some roads to gravel, her administration also has increased annual funding for resurfacing by about $4 million.Public works experts say turning pavement to gravel can be a defensible strategy when it comes to old infrastructure and limited money.\u201cIn areas where there\u2019s lower traffic, less use, perhaps the terrain is flat, it can totally make sense,\u201d said Rick Brader, a road engineer for King County, Wash., who manages streets outside Seattle.Given the complaints, Omaha has put in place a moratorium on \u201creclaiming\u201d additional streets while a committee studies the issue. And the city has compromised with some homeowners by splitting the costs of repaving streets.Bruce Simon, the president of Omaha Steaks, a major employer here, sued the mayor and the city last year after finding out that the asphalt road in front of his $2.3 million house was scheduled to be pulverized into gravel. He dropped the lawsuit after Ms. Stothert helped negotiate the 50-50 payment deal.\u201cI got a road,\u201d said Mr. Simon, who paid $5,200 to cover his share of the smooth new asphalt surface. \u201cDid I like chucking out the five grand? No. Did I like spending the money with an attorney to deal with it? No.\u201dAbout a mile away, on Leavenworth Street, Ms. Amoura and her neighbors are waiting to hear from City Hall about whether they will get a deal similar to Mr. Simon\u2019s. But on other reclaimed streets, residents have scoffed at the notion that they should have to choose between living on gravel and paying for new pavement.\u201cI\u2019d like it to be the way it was,\u201d said Ms. Thonen, who has lived in her home for more than 30 years and has no interest in splitting the cost of repaving with the city. \u201cI pay my taxes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Since then, Mrs. May has rejected calls from Ms. Sturgeon for a so-called soft Brexit that would keep Scotland, at least, inside the European Union\u2019s single market and its tariff-free customs union.With opinion polls showing Scots almost equally divided over the merits of independence, the threat of another referendum that could break the United Kingdom apart complicates what was already a highly complex Brexit negotiation for Mrs. May.Speaking in Edinburgh on Monday morning, Ms. Sturgeon said she would seek permission from the Scottish Parliament to hold a second referendum, which she said should be staged between fall 2018 and spring 2019 \u2014 before Britain quits the European Union.While that should be straightforward, given the dominance of her pro-independence Scottish National Party in the Edinburgh Parliament, the approval of Mrs. May could prove more complicated. Politically, it may be hard for Mrs. May to refuse, though she may try to delay any new vote in Scotland until after the withdrawal, calculating that this would make it harder for the independence campaign to prevail.Ms. Sturgeon said that unless Mrs. May made further concessions, Scots should be able to choose whether to follow other Britons into \u201ca hard Brexit, or to become an independent country able to secure a real partnership of equals with the rest of the U.K. and our own relationship with Europe.\u201dShe also argued that, in its current, weakened state, and trailing in opinion polls, Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party stands little chance of winning a general election, and that independence was the only way for Scots to prevent themselves from being governed \u2014 possibly for a decade \u2014 by Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, which has limited support in Scotland.In response, Mrs. May said a referendum would set Scotland on course for \u201cuncertainty and division,\u201d arguing that most Scottish voters did not want another vote on independence.During the previous referendum, the economic case against Scottish independence seemed to prove decisive \u2014 and that argument may have gotten stronger since, because of the global decline in the price of oil, a bulwark of the Scottish economy. In 2014, however, opponents of independence argued that an independent Scotland would lose its membership of the European Union.Advertisement"}

But amid the celebrations, protests were brewing.Demonstrations were scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in dozens of cities across France. In Paris, protesters planned to march from the Place de la R\u00e9publique to the Op\u00e9ra Garnier.Unions, student organizations and feminist associations were calling for women to start striking at 3:40 p.m. \u2014 symbolically the time of day when Frenchwomen stop being paid, they argue, because of an average 26 percent pay gap with men.With the coming presidential election, the protest organizers unveiled a list of 20 demands, including salary increases, less temporary work and better enforcement of penalties for companies that discriminate against women, including when they are pregnant.In Buenos Aires, small groups of women began taking to the street at noon in preparation for a march later in the afternoon. Tens of thousands of people were expected to attend.Laura De Marinis, a 30-year-old lawyer, clapped and blocked a road alongside other protesters. \u201cI left my kid at home with my husband,\u201d she said, emphasizing one of the key points of the demonstration: Domestic work continues to fall disproportionately on women.Many of those present said they had witnessed a change in attitudes. \u201cWomen are starting to stand up for themselves more, and we are realizing that we don\u2019t have to put up with a culture that oppresses us just for being women,\u201d said Luc\u00eda D\u2019Agostino, 48, a psychologist.In Tbilisi, Georgia, women demonstrated under a symbolic \u201cglass ceiling\u201d to illustrate limitations on women\u2019s empowerment.Thousands marched in Rome on Wednesday evening, in what was the largest of dozens of demonstrations in various Italian cities. Wearing pink boas, waving placards with figures of matryoshka dolls in various guises and chanting slogans from the 1970s, women of all ages, as well as some men, took to the streets to protest discrimination, wage inequality and violence against women.\u201cThere are so many young women, it\u2019s transgenerational. That\u2019s bellissimo,\u201d said Maria Brighi of Rome\u2019s International House of Women, and one of the organizers of the march.Organizers said that some 20,000 people had participated in the protests, which started from the Colosseum and wove through parts of downtown Rome, blocking traffic and shutting down public transportation.To mark the deaths of women killed by ex-husbands and former partners, flags were flown at half-staff in front of Italy\u2019s lower house, Montecitorio.\u201cEven today, on International Women\u2019s Day, you are still caught up in your routine, working tirelessly, always on time. We often ask ourselves: How do they manage it all?\u201dIn Yogyakarta, Indonesia, women danced during a celebration.In Colombo, Sri Lanka, traditional dancers performed.Outside a Roman Catholic church in Manila, women wore masks smudged with fake blood to call for an end to violence against women. At a rally near the United States Embassy, female police officers holding shields stood guard as a women\u2019s group, Gabriela, held a rally.The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has made inflammatory remarks about sexual assault, gave a speech praising women \u2014 though he also lashed out at the country\u2019s highest-ranking female elected official, Vice President Leni Robredo, and at a political rival, Senator Leila de Lima.Another senator, Risa Hontiveros, accused Mr. Duterte of allowing a \u201cpervasive culture of sexism, misogyny and gender bias.\u201dOne of the most unusual events occurred in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over a ceremony in honor of 10 \u201cclean warriors,\u201d all women who had campaigned to improve rural sanitation. They included Sushila Khurkute, 30, who recently gained prominence when, seven months into her third pregnancy, she spent three solitary days chipping away at the rocky ground with a stick to make her family a toilet.A group of Unicef volunteers touring the area began documenting her efforts and her story. The toilet, she told them, was crucial to the welfare of her child. Because women defecating in open fields are vulnerable to sexual assault, she said, she had starved herself during her two previous pregnancies, weakening her babies.The images rippled across India, where around 300 million women still defecate in the open.As Ms. Khurkute\u2019s story was widely shared online, news outlets joined the discussion, nominating women like Kajal Roy, who mortgaged her jewelry and used the money to build 100 toilets, and Kunwar Bai, whose age was reported as 105 and who had sold two goats to build herself a toilet, despite never having used one. In a constellation of villages in the northern part of the country, elders recently voted to impose a new regulation \u2014 no daughters would be given away in marriage to a household that did not have a toilet.In Guinea-Bissau, the United Nations sponsored a bicycle race and ceremony as part of a workshop on women in the workplace. Far fewer than half of all workers in the nation are women. Many work in the informal economy, with low pay and no social protection.In six African countries, however, legal protection for women against domestic violence does not exist. In 2013, African women and girls accounted for 62 percent of all deaths around the globe from preventable illnesses tied to pregnancy and childbirth.If current trends continue, the report said, almost half of the world\u2019s child brides in 2050 will be African.Elsewhere in the world:\u25a0 Marches for reproductive rights took place in Dublin, Warsaw and other cities.One Facebook user asked, according to the BBC: \u201cWhy do we have to celebrate men on International Women\u2019s Day?\u201d Others were supportive of her post, with one user writing: \u201cMa\u2019am, despite the backlash you\u2019re taking over this, I\u2019d like to say thank you for the spirit of inclusion it was clearly meant in.\u201dOthers commemorated the day on Twitter:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Solar Experiment Lets Neighbors Trade Energy Among Themselves", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byBrooklyn is known the world over for things small-batch and local, like designer clogs, craft bourbon and artisanal sauerkraut.Now, it is trying to add electricity to the list.In a promising experiment in an affluent swath of the borough, dozens of solar-panel arrays spread across rowhouse rooftops are wired into a growing network. Called the Brooklyn Microgrid, the project is signing up residents and businesses to a virtual trading platform that will allow solar-energy producers to sell excess-electricity credits from their systems to buyers in the group, who may live as close as next door.The ability to complete secure transactions and create a business based on energy sharing would allow participants to bypass the electric company energy supply and ultimately build a microgrid with energy generation and storage components that could function on their own, even during broad power failures.\u201cCommunity members can work both individually and collectively to help meet demand in an efficient way,\u201d said Audrey Zibelman, who recently resigned as chairwoman of the New York State Public Service Commission, which regulates the state\u2019s utilities.\u201cIt takes a central procurer \u2014 in this case, historically, the utility \u2014 out of the mix,\u201d she continued, \u201cand really sets the market where they\u2019re not buying and selling to the utility but they\u2019re identifying each other\u2019s need and willingness to buy and sell.\u201dThe project is but one example of how rapidly spreading technologies like rooftop solar and blockchain are upending the traditional relationships between electric companies and consumers, putting ever more control in the hands of customers. Across the globe, upstart companies like LO3 Energy, which is designing the Brooklyn experiment with the industrial giant Siemens, are building digital networks that offer the promise of user-driven, decentralized energy systems that can work in tandem with the traditional large-scale grid or, especially in emerging economies, avoid the need for a grid at all.In Australia, where Ms. Zibelman will soon run the nation\u2019s energy markets, a company called Power Ledger announced the start of a residential electricity trading market based in blockchain last year at a housing development in Perth.And in Germany, Sonnen, a leading supplier of home batteries and smart energy products and services, has created a web of about 8,000 customers, both with and without solar on their roofs, who are trading their stored energy among one another.\u201cPeer-to-peer is slowly but surely becoming a reality,\u201d said Olaf Lohr, Sonnen\u2019s head of United States business development. \u201cThis really is a very disruptive technology. The customers are also the owners \u2014 they are the producers of the energy. There is no centralized feed-in from one big power plant.\u201dThe ideal power system, said Richard L. Kauffman, who as the governor\u2019s chairman of energy and finance is leading that effort, is one that combines large power plants and transmission lines with clusters of smaller-scale producer-consumers, \u201cwhere electrons can flow in more than one direction and supply and demand of electricity is dynamic \u2014 and that\u2019s different than the grid is today.\u201dPeer-to-peer power sharing is consistent with that vision, he said, though a number of regulatory changes are necessary for it to take off.The State Public Service Commission has already taken a few of them, including last week approving new ways to determine pricing for electricity from renewable energy projects that more accurately reflect the value to the grid based on geographic location, timing and other factors yet to be determined. But Lawrence Orsini, LO3\u2019s chief executive, said the state still needed to determine how to define his company and its network of participants before it could get its market up and running, a move he anticipates by June.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing technically infeasible about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order for transactive energy to take off as a whole, regulators have to be comfortable that markets can actually work this way and, more importantly, that people want markets like this.\u201dOver the past year, LO3 has been working to find those people, using Google Earth to identify homes with rooftop solar installations and then knocking on doors to enlist participants, with some success throughout Park Slope and Gowanus.On a block of President Street last year, the company carried out two sales of green electricity credits generated by one homeowner\u2019s solar system to a neighbor across the street \u2014 tiny transactions, but important in proving the concept\u2019s viability.Those sales involved test versions of renewable-energy credits \u2014 numbered certificates that are used to track electricity exported from a renewable system to the grid. Utilities, corporations and other customers can buy the credits to claim green energy use.In the Brooklyn case, LO3 used the credit sales, conducted over PayPal, to test its approach; it cannot legally buy and sell electricity until regulators determine its market status. Once that occurs, Mr. Orsini said, the company will be able to facilitate the trading of energy among its participants \u2014 though they would still pay the utility, Con Edison, for infrastructure fees and services, as customers now do when they choose to use a green energy supplier through the utility.Mr. Orsini\u2019s team is busy collecting data from meters installed in prosumer homes, measuring production, use and export of the solar electricity to help model the market. They are also testing a smartphone app that customers will be able to use to manage their electricity purchases, setting parameters to control the source \u2014 selecting from a range of conventional, renewable, local and bulk options \u2014 as well as how much they are willing to spend.Mr. Orsini said he expected that most users would want to make their choices and then let the system take over.\u201cNo one wants to day-trade energy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re giving something to people that they haven\u2019t ever had before, and that\u2019s really a way to personalize their energy consumption.\u201dThat is the aspect that appeals to a number of the participants, including Garry Golden of Windsor Terrace, a futurist who consults for a variety of businesses, including electric utilities and infrastructure companies. Mr. Golden installed solar as part of a group purchase that proved so popular with his neighbors that almost a dozen systems are within view of his roof, forming an attractive cluster for the microgrid experiment.\u201cWe need to make energy a product and a service that people can purchase on their own and not rely on a large centralized entity,\u201d Mr. Golden said. He added that it was important to build out infrastructure that would be able to better withstand disasters, both natural and man-made.Other participants echoed that concern.\u201cThe long-term goal is to be at least partially independent of the grid in emergencies, which was a reasonable argument to join,\u201d said Patrick Schnell, whose Gowanus basement flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, though he did not lose power. \u201cHopefully it will expand and more people will join and it will be more worthwhile.\u201dThe project includes plans to create a roughly five-square-block area \u2014 either around a collection of public housing projects or near a hospital \u2014 that could disconnect from the grid and operate independently in case of a power failure.\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of energy needs beyond your own,\u201d Mr. Golden said. \u201cThere\u2019s a microgrid of our community, and that\u2019s great, but the hospitals, the clinics, the schools, large housing complexes \u2014 you can feed the energy where it needs to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Shift, Trump Will Move Egypt\u2019s Rights Record to the Sidelines", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byA White House statement released Friday praised Mr. Sisi for waging a vigorous war against terrorists and making efforts to strengthen Egypt\u2019s economy, while making no mention of his crackdown on domestic opponents. \u201cPresident Al Sisi has taken a number of bold steps since becoming president in 2014, including calling for the reform and moderation of Islamic discourse and initiating courageous and historic economic reforms,\u201d it said.\u201cA blank check from President Trump on human rights concerns in Egypt isn\u2019t surprising but it does mean Congress will have to step in and continue using its authorities to limit U.S. support given how serious the scale of repression and abuse is under President Sisi,\u201d said Sarah Margon, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch.Tom Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state in charge of human rights issues under Mr. Obama, said American aid to Egypt had never translated into the expected support for American policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve given Egypt $70 billion over the years, and last I checked there are no Egyptian F-16s helping us fight ISIS over Raqqa or Mosul,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we get from the Egyptians is political repression that radicalizes its youth and gives terrorist groups new life.\u201dFive senators announced that they would introduce a resolution urging Egypt to ease its suppression of dissent. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, urged Mr. Trump to \u201cpress for the release of political prisoners in Egypt, including jailed Americans, and encourage Egypt to allow greater space for civil society and freedom of expression for all.\u201dSeveral American citizens figure among the tens of thousands of people jailed under Mr. Sisi, most notably Aya Hjazi, a humanitarian worker arrested in May 2014 on what have been widely viewed as trumped-up charges of trafficking and child abuse.Human rights groups say the charges are part of a wider crackdown on foreign-funded aid groups in Egypt that has drawn sharp criticism from some quarters in Congress. In December, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans, said they would support new restrictions on aid to Egypt if a proposed new law there restricting aid groups is approved \u2014 a measure of the possible limits of Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Mr. Sisi.After deciding to make the promotion of democracy a major theme of his presidency, Mr. Bush kept Mr. Mubarak at a distance and pushed him to release opponents and hold elections, although he made only halting progress and eased up later in his tenure.At a briefing on Friday, White House officials said Mr. Trump did not consider it constructive to air disputes over human rights publicly. His approach, they said, would be to handle such issues in a more discreet way. In the case of Ms. Hjazi, they said, Mr. Trump\u2019s team aims to address her captivity in a way that would maximize the chances of its being resolved. The officials were not allowed to be identified under ground rules set by the White House.At the same time, the officials said the White House could not commit to maintaining Egypt\u2019s aid package at current levels, citing a budget review. Mr. Trump has proposed deep cuts in the State Department budget, and while officials have said military assistance to Israel will remain untouched, reductions in aid to Egypt are under consideration.Also on the table is aid to another crucial regional ally, Jordan, whose King Abdullah II will visit the White House on Wednesday. Like Egypt, Jordan has a peace treaty with Israel and has been a vital intelligence partner to the United States. Aid to Jordan has been increased substantially in recent years as it has absorbed hundreds of thousands of refugees from the civil war in Syria.At their briefing on Friday, the White House officials indicated that no decision had been made to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, but they anticipated Mr. Sisi would raise the matter.The White House written statement said terrorism posed a major threat to Egypt\u2019s stability. \u201cThe United States is fully committed to helping Egypt take the necessary steps to defeat Sinai-based terrorist groups,\u201d it said.The Washington trip has been keenly anticipated in Egypt, where Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters see a public handshake in the White House as a symbolic validation of a leader long spurned for his human rights record. A trade delegation is expected to accompany Mr. Sisi, hoping to attract urgently needed foreign investment.But privately, Egyptian officials have been alarmed at talk of a cut in American aid, Western officials say, and have sought to temper expectations over what the trip can produce in concrete terms.Declan Walsh contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Workers Who Regret Trump\u2019s Scrapping of a Trade Deal", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byHO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam \u2014 Do Thi Minh Hanh, a labor activist, had grown accustomed to being beaten, hospitalized and jailed for her work in a country where independent trade unions are banned.So it gave her hope for a reprieve when Vietnam reached a trade deal with the United States and other countries that called for its members to bolster workers\u2019 rights and protect independent unions.\u201cThe Vietnamese government will use this as an excuse to suppress the labor movement,\u201d Ms. Hanh said. \u201cThey never wanted to have independent unions in Vietnam.\u201dCritics of the labor and environmental protections in the T.P.P. and other trade agreements consider them a political sop that amount to unenforceable window dressing. Still, America\u2019s new trade retreat could allow countries like China to set the terms of global commerce \u2014 countries that are unlikely to use their economic heft for moral persuasion.For example, America\u2019s withdrawal from T.P.P. paves the way for China to advance its own Asian free-trade deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. The China-led deal, said Rajiv Biswas, the Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Global Insight, \u201cis less ambitious in its scope of coverage, and does not include major reforms to labor protection standards.\u201dOn his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.Those agreements had \u201creal teeth in terms of trade sanctions\u201d said David A. Gantz, a law professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson who is an expert on international trade agreements. \u201cThey might have made a real difference had T.P.P. gone forward.\u201dHe added, \u201cThese provisions in U.S. free-trade agreements can be more than fig leaves, but with an important caveat: The U.S. government in particular has to be willing to be active in enforcing them.\u201dThat can be tough, given that the country on the other end of the treaty may have to pass new laws to comply, labor groups say.\u201cAny trade agreement must have strong labor provisions to mitigate a race to the bottom,\u201d said Sharon Waxman, the president of the Fair Labor Association. \u201cBut what we find is that trade agreements are often wrongly viewed as a substitute for national laws that protect workers\u2019 rights and ensure they are compensated fairly.\u201dIn a 10-page side agreement, the T.P.P. would have required Vietnam to criminalize the use of forced labor and broaden enforcement to apply to cases of debt bondage. On labor unions, workers would be allowed to form their own grass-roots unions that could bargain collectively and lead strikes. Vietnam has started drafting some of these changes but timing on their execution is uncertain, said Oliver Massmann, a partner at the law firm Duane Morris Vietnam. A separate trade agreement between Vietnam and the European Union will also target labor conditions when it takes effect in January, but it lacks the stronger enforcement measures of the T.P.P.One veteran seamstress from the factory said the situation had generally been improving as the factory added cooling units. Sometimes workers faint because they are sick, she adds, complaining that it is often difficult to get sick leave from managers. She requested to speak without using her name because of worries about losing her job. Another veteran worker, who asked to be identified only by his surname, Nguyen, said that overseas buyers might stipulate improvements that needed to be made, but factory management did not always follow through.Nike, which once accounted for 9 percent of the factory\u2019s output, has imposed penalties and cut its purchases to 3 percent. It continues to discuss conditions with Hansae, a spokeswoman said via email, \u201crecognizing that the issues at Hansae are complex, systemic and require sustained diligence to correct.\u201dHansae \u2014 which has acknowledged some problems but called others \u201crumors\u201d \u2014 hired Gare Smith, a lawyer with the Foley Hoag law firm in Washington, to work with its Vietnam plant to improve its worker complaint system. The work culture is also an issue, he said: \u201cAre managers buying it and running with it, or are they rolling their eyes and ticking boxes?\u201dCurrently worker groups are controlled by the government, which generally forbids strikes and other labor actions to avoid political or social instability. Ms. Hanh, the labor activist, said she had been cautiously hopeful that the T.P.P. could help. \u201cThe T.P.P. had a part about labor unions,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would have given me a legal base and made it easier to convince workers to join.\u201dA diminutive 32-year-old who discusses jail stints, beatings and labor slogans in the same matter-of-fact tone, Ms. Hanh first awakened to Vietnam\u2019s labor problems as a young teenager, when she took a bus to the country\u2019s interior and sat next to a woman who worked at a cashew factory. The woman told her that workers at the plant were paid so little they had to steal nuts for food.In Vietnam, organizing is done quietly. To pave the way for one strike at a shoe factory, a colleague spent weeks in the area talking to workers and building contacts. Ms. Hanh wrote fliers and taught a core group of workers how to organize and strike. She counts the resulting January 2010 strike of 10,000 workers as a victory because it resulted in big pay raises for workers, even though she and two of her colleagues were thrown in prison.Released four years later, Ms. Hanh found grass-roots organizing had become much harder. She said she was often followed now, making it difficult to meet with timid workers. One of the last times she went to a worker protest, in late 2015, she was beaten by police. Now, she said, she devotes most of her time to campaigning on social media and raising concerns with big Western companies.She was skeptical that local authorities would have complied with the toughest labor protections in T.P.P., adding that chances were good they would have sought out loopholes. Still, she says, the pact could have given her a tool to use when pushing labor issues with lawmakers and factory bosses alike.\u201cI would have used the clause of T.P.P. about the right to form independent unions \u2014 unions that are not controlled by the company and the government,\u201d she said.\u201cMaybe now because of Trump, our dream about independent unions in Vietnam has yet to come true,\u201d she added. \u201cBut we will still try to help the workers, because if they fight alone they will not succeed.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting from Ho Chi Minh City, and Su-hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul.Advertisement"}

He encapsulated his mission this way: \u201cSave the economy, stop the violence, have the elections and ride into the sunset.\u201dBut after an election campaign in which fending off far-right candidates was at least as demanding as subduing leftist insurgents, Mr. Hinton gave a more modest goal: \u201cWe were not going to let it become a Marxist totalitarian state.\u201dIn a speech in El Salvador in October 1982, he also delivered an ultimatum, saying El Salvador must make progress \u201cin advancing human rights and in controlling the abuses of some elements of the security forces,\u201d or it would lose American military and economic aid.He denounced El Salvador\u2019s legal system and far right, which he blamed for thousands of murders.The speech had been cleared by the State Department but not, apparently, by the White House. Presidential aides were quoted as saying afterward that \u201cthe decibel level had risen higher than our policy has allowed in the past.\u201d The administration was particularly uncomfortable with Mr. Hinton\u2019s use of the term \u201cdeath squads.\u201d He was told to refrain from any further public criticism of rights abuses.In his official reports, Mr. Hinton accused Salvadoran soldiers of being responsible for unexplained killings, including that of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero in 1980, in which the right-wing leader Roberto d\u2019Aubuisson was said to be complicit. Reagan nevertheless certified that the Salvadoran government had made significant progress in reducing human rights violations and that it therefore qualified for American aid.In her 1983 book \u201cSalvador,\u201d Joan Didion wrote that during a lunch with Mr. Hinton, \u201cit occurred to me that we were talking exclusively about the appearance of things, about how the situation might be made to look better, about trying to get the Salvadoran government to \u2018appear\u2019 to do what the American government needed done in order to make it \u2018appear\u2019 that the American aid was justified.\u201dAt the same time, Reagan replaced Thomas O. Enders as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs. Mr. Enders was believed to have been open to a negotiated settlement of the Salvadoran civil war, while the administration preferred a military victory.A peace treaty signed in 1992 ended the war in El Salvador, and the guerrillas morphed into a political party.Deane Roesch Hinton was born on March 12, 1923, in Missoula, Mont., to Col. Joe Hinton, who served in both World Wars, and the former Doris Roesch. He attended Elgin Academy, a prep school in Illinois, and served in World War II as a second lieutenant in the Army Signal Corps in Italy.He completed his bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of Chicago, did graduate work in economics and attended the National War College, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and Harvard University.He was married three times, to the former Angela Peyraud, Miren de Aretxabala and Patricia Lopez.He is survived by Ms. Lopez and 12 children: Christopher, Jeffrey, Deborah Ann Hinton, Joanna Peyraud Hinton and Veronica Jean Hinton from his first marriage; Pedro Arrivillaga, Guillermo Arrivillaga, Miren Arrivillaga de Aretxabala, Maria Louisa Arrivillaga Reglemann and Juan Jose Arrivillaga from an earlier marriage by his second wife; and Sebastian Asturias Hinton and Deane Patrick Hinton from his third marriage, as well as 13 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.Mr. Hinton joined the Foreign Service in 1946 and served in Syria, Kenya, France, Belgium and Guatemala. He was designated a career ambassador, retired in 1994 and wrote a memoir, \u201cEconomics and Diplomacy: A Life in the Foreign Service\u201d (2015).Besides his stint in El Salvador, he served in Zaire under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford; in Pakistan under Reagan; in Costa Rica under Reagan and President George Bush; and in Panama under Mr. Bush.As an ambassador, Mr. Hinton, a cigar-smoking poker player, gave advice bluntly but insisted that he avoided meddling in the affairs of foreign governments.This made it all the more surprising when he was deported from Zaire in 1975 because of what was supposedly an American plot to murder President Mobutu Sese Seko. Mr. Hinton offered a rebuttal.\u201cTotal nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cMy defense always was that if I\u2019d have been out to get him, he\u2019d have been dead.\u201dAn obituary on Friday about the diplomat Deane R. Hinton misstated the name of the city in Costa Rica where he died. It is San Jose, not San Juan. The obituary, using information from a family member, also misstated the middle name of one of Mr. Hinton\u2019s sons. He is Sebastian Asturias Hinton, not Sebastian Lopez Hinton.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Is Facing 4 Existential Tests. Can It Hold Together?", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterThe risk of European disintegration looks significantly more real this week. Multiple crises, each a symptom and cause of the continent\u2019s deepest problems, are converging simultaneously.Alone, these are not enough to break apart Europe, which has endured worse. But they represent larger forces that, given enough such crises, could do just that. This week\u2019s events, then, pose something of a test of whether Europe can overcome or at least manage its problems \u2014 or whether those problems are enough to unravel the post-World War II order.Here is an overview of those crises and why they matter.The Netherlands will hold a national election on Wednesday in which the far-right Party for Freedom is expected to do well. It currently holds 15 of 150 seats in Parliament. Polls suggest that it will gain five to 15 additional seats, making it the country\u2019s largest or second-largest party.It appears highly unlikely that Mr. Wilders or his party will end up leading the Netherlands. He would need 76 seats to form a governing majority, and the country\u2019s multiparty system means that mainstream parties can easily form a coalition without him.Still, the election is a test case for whether Europe, which will also see major elections in France and Germany this year, can manage its rising populist movements.Far-right parties, even if they cannot secure enough seats to govern, can exert pressure. Mainstream parties could feel compelled to co-opt populist positions, much as Britain\u2019s Conservative Party adopted leaving the European Union, or Brexit. And keeping the far right out of power risks exacerbating populist backlashes, as voters increasingly believe that establishment parties are conspiring to undermine popular will.In this way, the real test is not Election Day, but how the mainstream handles the next few years with a smaller majority and an emboldened far right. In Germany and France as well, the far right is currently polled to win a larger slice of votes but not enough to take power.Turkish officials are touring Europe to hold rallies encouraging the Turkish diaspora to vote in support of a referendum next month that would give the country a new constitution that would greatly expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has invested significant political capital in the measure.But Germany and the Netherlands have blocked the rallies. The Netherlands prevented Turkey\u2019s foreign minister from landing in the country and deported the Turkish family minister, in both cases to prevent them from attending pro-referendum rallies.The feud serves the political interests of both Turkish and Dutch leaders. For Mr. Erdogan, it allows him to make a show of standing up to Europe, rallying nationalists at home. Polls have shown a tight vote for the referendum, so he needs every vote.Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, also stands to gain votes among those skeptical of Mr. Erdogan. But so does Mr. Rutte\u2019s primary challenger, Mr. Wilders, who has seized the crisis to portray the country\u2019s Turkish minority as alien and hostile.Because governments on both sides are driven largely by domestic electoral politics, they may decide, after their respective votes, that it is in their interest to smooth things over.Or they may not. The Dutch government is likely to emerge under pressure from a larger far right. And Mr. Erdogan, if his referendum passes and he consolidates power away from democratic institutions, may still feel insecure. Both could respond by indulging more such disputes. With each round, they could whip up more public outrage against the other, making it harder for either to back down.The episode, then, is less a danger in itself than a test of whether Europe and Turkey can still get along.That is a question of values as Europe swings toward populism and Turkey toward authoritarianism. But it is also a practical matter: Europe needs Turkey to stem the arrival of refugees, which it has been doing under a year-old deal.Mr. Erdogan, if pushed, could cancel the deal and allow or send millions into Europe. A rapid influx could deeply destabilize European politics and fuel the far right at a delicate moment.This legislation is mostly procedural. The debate has largely focused on how to carry out Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union \u2014 what role Parliament has in negotiations, for instance, and whether European Union citizens should retain certain rights \u2014 rather than over whether the exit will occur. British leaders are still set on leaving.The larger significance is that it brings Ms. May a step closer to triggering Article 50, which she had pledged to do by the end of this month and which would officially begin the process of leaving the European Union.Once Article 50 is invoked, Britain will be effectively locked in to leaving the European Union. It will have two years to negotiate the terms of exiting, over things like trade agreements and migration rules.If there is no agreement within that time \u2014 which seems possible given how much there is to hammer out \u2014 then the country will be ejected with no agreement. No one knows for sure what that would mean. Britain is desperate for this to go smoothly, but the European Union has every incentive to make this process painful so as to deter other European states from following.Ms. Sturgeon\u2019s statement is not binding, and there are many steps to go. She cannot hold a referendum without permission from the British government, and it is unclear whether she will get it.Scottish voters defeated a 2014 referendum 55 percent to 45 percent. But Brexit could tilt the politics. Most Scots voted to stay in the European Union, and Brexit feels, to many, like proof that Scottish and English voters do not share a common vision for the country and that the more populous English will continue to impose their conservative politics on Scotland.Economic conditions, though, are less favorable to independence. An independent Scotland would rely heavily on exports of oil, the price of which has plummeted since 2014.Brexit has brought tremendous uncertainty to the Northern Ireland peace agreements, which rely on relaxed Irish border rules that may no longer be possible after Brexit. Sinn Fein still lacks a majority, but its gains indicate Northern Irish skepticism about following Britain out of the European Union.Advertisement"}

The accusations against him center on the employment, at public expense, of his wife and two of his five children as parliamentary aides.Since then, although Mr. Fillon, 63, has stabilized his standing in the polls, new revelations in the news media of possible financial shenanigans have kept him down. Pundits have repeatedly declared his candidacy dead, but he has hung on grimly, beating back challenges from within his party.Mr. Fillon, who had sold himself as the image of rectitude, promised after the scandal first broke that he would withdraw from the race if he were criminally charged. But he later reneged on that pledge, prompting many supporters in his party and his campaign staff to desert him.\u201cMy wife\u2019s job as parliamentary aide was not fictitious, and it is not up to the judicial authority to assess the quality or content of this work,\u201d Mr. Fillon was reported to have said in the statement. \u201cI am asking neither for exemption nor favor, only for respect of the law.\u201dThough his standing has plummeted, Mr. Fillon has vowed to press on with his campaign. His party, the Republicans, has few good alternatives.Ms. Le Pen and the National Front are also targets of several investigations, but that has not seemed to affect her poll standing.Some of Mr. Fillon\u2019s supporters who had dropped out of his campaign or expressed doubts about his chances have since returned to the fold, including the Union of Democrats and Independents, a centrist party.Mr. Fillon had been trying to steer the news media\u2019s attention away from the corruption allegations and toward his platform of pro-business policies, including lengthening the standard 35-hour workweek and raising the retirement age to 65 from 62.Still, French journalists seem to find new examples of suspected wrongdoing nearly every day.A lawyer for Mr. Fillon\u2019s daughter said she was merely repaying money her father had spent on her wedding. Mr. Fillon\u2019s lawyer said the son was repaying rent and \u201cpocket money.\u201dMr. Fillon\u2019s opponents have been frustrated that the scandal has dominated coverage of the campaign, drowning out all but the best-known candidates, and that Mr. Fillon did not keep his promise to drop out.Adam Nossiter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Caves of Ancient Humans, Stories Told Dot by Dot", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byTrilobitesThese pointillist creations of early modern humans were recently discovered when scientists revisited Abri Cellier, a cave site in France\u2019s V\u00e9z\u00e8re Valley. There, they found 16 limestone tablets left behind by a previous excavation. Images of what appear to be animals, including a woolly mammoth, were formed by a series of punctured dots and, in some cases, carved connecting lines. Combined with previous images from nearby caves in France and Spain, the tablets suggest an early form of pointillism, and a very early point on art history\u2019s timeline.Step back, 38,000 years to what are now the forests of southwestern France. There lived the Aurignacians, Europe\u2019s earliest known modern humans, a hunter-gatherer society. In the steppe grasslands, they stalked reindeer, mostly. Horses, aurochs (ancient bison), woolly mammoths and rhinoceroses were also around.During winters much colder than the ones in France now, one group of Aurignacians lived beneath a rock shelter, about 20 feet deep and 67 feet long. Across its open mouth, suspended animal skins trapped the heat from a fire. Someone butchered a reindeer. Another person made ornamental beads of ivory and animal teeth. Their bodies, which were probably painted with ochre, were covered in animal skins, which were painted, too. Someone also decorated the ceiling, walls and tablets with images of vulvas and animals.\u201cIn circumstances where we\u2019d probably have a tendency to sit in a corner by the fire and shiver,\u201d Dr. White said, the Aurignacians \u201care engraving, and painting and making ornaments.\u201dAbout 10,000 years later, the ceiling of this cave collapsed in such a perfect way that it preserved all the stuff they left behind. Some archaeologists found it in 1927, and put some of what they excavated in museums. But they left behind 16 tablets that appeared to have been turned over just after they were made, for some unknown reason. Nearly a century later Dr. White returned with an international team of 21 scientists and even more student volunteers to find them. When the undersurface of the first tablet was revealed, Dr. White got chills.There was no paint, but someone had taken the dull tip of a flint stone just half the size of a person\u2019s palm and punctured the surface. Dots formed in the shape of an animal. In other tablets, the dots were connected.Their subject matter was something more abstract and meaningful than simply dinner, Dr. White said. Dinner was reindeer, primarily, but no reindeer art has been found. The animals used for their body art were also depicted in their wall art. \u201cThey\u2019re painting what\u2019s good to think, not eat,\u201d Dr. White said.Dr. White does not think the art in these caves is the root of Western art, because modern Europeans are not genetic descendants of these cave dwellers. This cave art outlived its creators, who did not hand down their pointillist techniques to European artists tens of thousands of years later.\u201cAll of this stuff got invented, but it\u2019s not continuous,\u201d Dr. White said. \u201cIt may well have just disappeared or transformed into something else.\u201d The Aurignacians\u2019 techniques probably developed independently, and the pointillist style employed by Seurat later emerged.\u201cOne of the most interesting things I\u2019ve learnt through my work is how history has a way of repeating itself, despite the change in social and material circumstances,\u201d Vhils wrote in an email. \u201cAnd these findings seem to reinforce this view.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Edge or Liability? White House Ties May Cut Two Ways for Goldman", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byDuring a recent meeting with stock analysts to discuss a huge loss, the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland sought to inject some levity.\u201cI have a question online from the White House \u2014 sorry, sorry, Goldman Sachs,\u201d said Howard Davies, to the sound of guffaws from the audience. The chairman, who was fielding a variety of questions that day from analysts from Goldman and other financial firms, then read out the Goldman inquiry about returns on capital.Jokes like that are commonplace in these first 100 days of the Trump administration. Stacked with former Goldman employees and embracing business-friendly policies, President Trump\u2019s White House would appear to give Goldman a unique and influential edge.Already, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to cut corporate taxes and reduce regulation \u2014 which would benefit Wall Street broadly \u2014 have lifted the stock prices of Goldman and other banks. Shares of Goldman are up more than 36 percent since the election.Yet the Trump connection may actually be more of a liability, people close to the firm contend.That\u2019s because of differences over both style and substance, as well as the constant scrutiny a company naturally falls under when five of its former executives are named to prominent government positions.Other big financial institutions, including the money manager Fidelity and the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, can claim only one former executive apiece among those put forward for major staff or secretary roles in the Trump administration.Despite its numbers in Washington, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, is taking issue with the perception of coziness between his company and the White House.Mr. Cohn has recused himself from Goldman matters on the job, the White House has said. Goldman officials who are close to Mr. Cohn and other former colleagues now in government have said they are restricting their communications largely to social conversations.If there is a mind meld between Goldman and the Trump administration, it has been fractured at times.Some of the White House\u2019s early policies, including the Jan. 27 travel and immigration ban and moves to roll back lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, have sat poorly with senior Goldman executives, whose thinking on social issues has proved to be more liberal than Mr. Trump\u2019s.Conversations between Goldman employees and their former colleagues in Washington, meanwhile, have come under scrutiny. Two Democratic senators recently demanded records of any communications between Goldman and its alumni in the Trump administration that involved discussions of certain economic policies. Goldman\u2019s lawyer denied involvement by the firm.And being intimately linked to a president whose incoming approval ratings were at a historic low may not burnish the firm\u2019s image as ties to past administrations did.\u201cMy guess is that whatever benefit Goldman would have from its senior executives leaving to go to the Trump administration, the reputational effects may well be more severe,\u201d said Peter Conti-Brown, a financial historian who teaches at the Wharton School.Among other things, he added, Mr. Trump\u2019s more polarizing policies on issues that a younger generation of workers hold dear could create recruitment problems for the bank. For instance, Mr. Conti-Brown said, most of the business school students he encounters at Wharton espouse a more globalist view than the \u201cAmerica First\u201d brand of economic nationalism championed by Mr. Trump and his chief strategist, the onetime Goldman investment banker Stephen K. Bannon. And they expect to work in places that value diversity of gender and sexual orientation.\u201cIf the best and brightest look at Goldman Sachs as an appendage of the Trump administration and react with horror,\u201d Mr. Conti-Brown said, \u201cthey\u2019ll be looking more closely at jobs with Morgan Stanley\u201d \u2014 one of Goldman\u2019s closest competitors on Wall Street.The ties between Goldman Sachs and the Trump administration are extensive. In addition to Mr. Cohn, Mr. Bannon and Ms. Powell, the new Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, served on Goldman\u2019s management committee. And James Donovan, who has been named Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s deputy, was a longtime wealth-management and banking executive at Goldman.There are less-obvious examples as well: the Goldman board secretary who worked on the secretary of state\u2019s transition, and the private-practice lawyer who counts Goldman as a major client and was nominated to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Goldman\u2019s generous pay and burnout-inducing hours have created an environment where retiring in one\u2019s late 40s or early 50s is not unusual. At that stage, with their health still intact and their earnings not an object, Goldman alumni often seek out a second, more mission-oriented career.Serving in high-ranking government positions has been a long tradition among Goldman\u2019s departed executives, who are prominent in both parties. Nonetheless, that could change after the Trump administration.The first attempt by the president to block travelers from predominantly Muslim countries, in January, illustrated how the White House and Goldman could be at odds.Two days after the order was issued, Mr. Blankfein \u2014 who was concerned about the impact on employees and their families as well as about recruiting efforts \u2014 leveled a very public objection.\u201cThis is not a policy we support,\u201d he said in a voice mail message that was dispatched to 34,000 company employees, \u201cand I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court.\u201dAround that time, a draft of an executive order to roll back lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workplace protections, put in place during the Obama administration, was circulating around the White House. The plan clashed head-on with the more liberal workplace policies on Wall Street, especially at Goldman, where Marty Chavez, the incoming chief financial officer, is gay.The details of policies that stand to benefit Goldman, including the defanging of the Dodd-Frank Act, corporate-tax cuts and a promised $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, have yet to emerge.Even so, Goldman\u2019s critics on the left, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has said Mr. Cohn\u2019s role as the president\u2019s most senior economic adviser \u201cturns my stomach,\u201d seem emboldened.For Mr. Blankfein and other Goldman executives who worked closely with Mr. Cohn and Ms. Powell, the limits on contact may be the most awkward new development.When Goldman employees run into their former colleagues now working at the White House, \u201ceveryone just needs to learn to talk weather and sports,\u201d said a Goldman spokesman, Jake Siewert, who left a job at the aluminum company Alcoa for a Treasury post in 2009 and faced similar issues.\u201cFor better or worse\u201d at Goldman Sachs, he added, \u201cwe have learned to run our business under intense public scrutiny.\u201dThe spotlight on Mr. Trump\u2019s favored bank is unlikely to grow dim any time soon.The Royal Bank of Scotland chairman\u2019s quip, delivered on Feb. 24, was one clue.\u201cIt was just a joke,\u201d Mr. Davies said in an interview. The Royal Bank of Scotland was reporting a 7 billion pound loss that day, \u201cwhich was not exactly anything to celebrate in a conventional way.\u201dStill, \u201cif you look around, the head of the Bank of England was at Goldman, the head of the E.C.B. was at Goldman,\u201d Mr. Davies added, referring to the European Central Bank. \u201cThis is not just an American phenomenon. Goldman alumni are everywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A former Inhofe chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, will be Mr. Pruitt\u2019s chief of staff. Another former Inhofe staff member, Byron Brown, will serve as Mr. Jackson\u2019s deputy. Andrew Wheeler, a fossil fuel lobbyist and a former Inhofe chief of staff, is a finalist to be Mr. Pruitt\u2019s deputy, although he requires confirmation to the position by the Senate.To friends and critics, Mr. Pruitt seems intent on building an E.P.A. leadership that is fundamentally at odds with the career officials, scientists and employees who carry out the agency\u2019s missions. That might be a recipe for strife and gridlock at the federal agency tasked to keep safe the nation\u2019s clean air and water while safeguarding the planet\u2019s future.\u201cHe\u2019s the most different kind of E.P.A. administrator that\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Steve J. Milloy, a member of the E.P.A. transition team who runs the website JunkScience.com, which aims to debunk climate change. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming in thinking E.P.A. is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Quite the opposite.\u201dGina McCarthy, who headed the E.P.A. under former President Barack Obama, said she too saw Mr. Pruitt as unique. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to have differing opinions on how to meet the mission of the agency. Many Republican administrators have had that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut here, for the first time, I see someone who has no commitment to the mission of the agency.\u201dA pair of Trump campaigners from Washington State are also heading into senior positions at the E.P.A. Don Benton, a former Washington state senator who headed President Trump\u2019s state campaign, will be the agency\u2019s senior liaison with the White House. Douglas Ericksen, a current Washington state senator, is being considered as the regional administrator of the E.P.A.\u2019s Pacific Northwest office.As a state senator, Mr. Ericksen has been active in opposing efforts to pass a state-level climate change law taxing carbon pollution. Last month, he invited Tony Heller, a climate denialist who blogs under the pseudonym Steven Goddard, to address a Washington State Senate committee on the costs of climate change policy. Mr. Heller\u2019s blog says \u201cglobal warming is the biggest fraud in science history.\u201d\u201cI think the reason both of these guys are being considered for this stuff is they were the only prominent elected officials in the state of Washington that were early supporters and organizers for Trump,\u201d said Todd Donovan, a political scientist at Western Washington University. \u201cNo other state legislators were putting their necks out for Trump.\u201dAnother transition official under consideration by Mr. Pruitt for a permanent position is David Kreutzer, a senior research fellow in energy economics and climate change at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has publicly praised the benefits of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That view stands in opposition to the broad scientific consensus that increased carbon dioxide traps heat and contributes to the dangerous warming of the planet.The agency\u2019s policy agenda is snapping into focus: Last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of dismantling a major Obama-era regulation aimed at increasing the federal government\u2019s authority over rivers, streams and wetlands in order to prevent water pollution. Also last week, Mr. Pruitt ordered the agency to walk back a program on collecting data on methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells.This week, Mr. Trump is expected to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama\u2019s E.P.A. regulations aimed at curbing planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants, and Mr. Pruitt is expected to announce plans to begin to weaken an Obama-era rule mandating higher fuel economy standards.A draft White House budget blueprint proposes to slash the E.P.A. budget by about 24 percent, or $2 billion from its current level of $8.1 billion, and cut employee numbers by about 20 percent from its current staff of about 15,000.Agency employees say morale has already been damaged. After working for years to draft climate change regulations under the Obama administration, many of those same career scientists and lawyers will be ordered to go back and undo them.Ms. McCarthy, who oversaw the writing and execution of those major water and climate change regulations, said it would be difficult and time-consuming to reverse them, especially if Mr. Trump succeeds in greatly downsizing the agency.\u201cIf you want to do these executive orders that require a whole rewrite of the rule, you have to get that right, legally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took years to do those rules. To now ask for those things to be undone with less staff and low morale \u2014 how are they going to do it?\u201dThere is one area in which Mr. Pruitt has vowed to continue the traditional work of the E.P.A.: a longstanding program for sending funds to states to clean up \u201cbrownfields\u201d \u2014 former industrial sites that have been contaminated by pollution. Although Mr. Trump\u2019s budget blueprint would slash funds for that program, Mr. Pruitt pledged to a gathering of mayors in Washington last week that he would fight to save the program.\u201cWith the White House and Congress I am communicating a message about brownfields,\u201d he told mayors. \u201cI want to hear from you about successes and communicate them.\u201dJ. Christian Bollwage, the Democratic mayor of Elizabeth, N.J., a city that has been plagued with industrial pollution, said he was heartened to hear the pledge.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard such a vociferous defense of providing brownfields grants,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was explicit. He said he was going to take the defense of brownfields to the White House. I was impressed and hopeful.\u201dBut, Mr. Bollwage added, \u201cComing from New Jersey, climate change is also a big issue. And I\u2019m still worried about an administration that seems to think climate change is a hoax.\u201dConcern over Mr. Pruitt\u2019s stewardship may not be long-lived.

{"Headline": "How Reagan and the New Right Resuscitated the G.O.P.", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Forty years ago, the Republican Party was at a nadir. Gerald Ford had lost the presidency to a Democratic outsider named Jimmy Carter. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. The stench of Watergate hung over the G.O.P. establishment. (It didn\u2019t help that the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee operated out of a converted men\u2019s room in the Russell Senate Office Building.) The party\u2019s most popular national figure, Ronald Reagan, later said he was open to changing the party\u2019s name. An analysis in The New York Times pronounced the Republicans \u201ccloser to extinction than ever before.\u201dThey only looked dead. Within four years, the G.O.P. picked up 49 seats in the House of Representatives and gained a majority in the Senate for the first time since 1955. In the 1980 presidential election, Reagan defeated Carter by 440 electoral votes, the worst loss ever for a sitting president.What happened? In \u201cReagan Rising: The Decisive Years, 1976-1980,\u201d Craig Shirley chronicles the Republicans\u2019 emergence from the wilderness. The story goes like this: After Ford\u2019s defeat, a guerrilla movement of conservative operatives staged an assault on the traditional economic orthodoxy of the G.O.P. Their goal was to \u201cget rid of excessive regulations, tear down trade barriers, get government out of the business of managing the economy and most important, slash taxes to the bone.\u201d Republican leaders soon grasped the political appeal of the insurgents\u2019 agenda, particularly to middle-class suburban voters. The party became \u201cmore pluralistic, less interested in rank and more interested in new ideas.\u201dAn assortment of long-forgotten figures receive credit for this transformation, notably Bill Brock, the former Tennessee senator who took over the Republican National Committee in 1977 and ignited its fund-raising machine. Reagan\u2019s role was less direct. When he announced his candidacy in 1979, Reagan was the prohibitive favorite for the Republican nomination, but he had done little to cultivate the grass roots, spending more time giving speeches to trade associations and business groups. To conserve Reagan\u2019s energy, John Sears, Reagan\u2019s campaign manager, insisted on keeping the 68-year-old former governor on ice, which fueled concerns about Reagan\u2019s age and keyed George H.W. Bush\u2019s upset victory in the Iowa caucuses.Reagan quickly recovered in New Hampshire (\u201cI\u2019m paying for this microphone, Mr. Green!\u201d), fired Sears and coasted to the Republican nomination. Reagan\u2019s genius was to sell supply-side economics in a gauzy package of optimism, nostalgia and patriotic renewal. \u201cOur country is a living, breathing presence, unimpressed by what others say is impossible,\u201d he said. Reagan didn\u2019t start the conservative revolution. But it\u2019s hard to see how it would have triumphed without him.Shirley, the author of books on Reagan\u2019s 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns, is a sure-footed and entertaining observer of the hurly-burly of national politics. He has a weakness for poll numbers, horse-race punditry and clich\u00e9s: \u201cThe Democratic Party was to make even more headlines. And not in a good way.\u201d Shirley doesn\u2019t hide his contempt for Carter or the \u201970s, which he depicts as a time of near-unimaginable lassitude. The Washington establishment was \u201cintertwined, inbred, crossbred\u201d; the American people \u201chad not only been mugged, but also shot, beaten, raped and left for dead by their own government.\u201d\u201cReagan Rising\u201d doesn\u2019t deal with the negative impact of supply-side economics on the federal budget deficit and on the poor. But that\u2019s for another book. It\u2019s all too easy to forget that the 1980 election took place against the backdrop of recession, double-digit inflation, gasoline shortages, an intensifying arms race with the Soviets and the hostage crisis in Tehran. The country really was in trouble. A small-minded and demagogic politician might have exploited Americans\u2019 anxieties and appealed to their worst instincts. Accepting the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Detroit, Reagan said, \u201cCan we doubt that only a divine providence placed this land, this island of freedom, here as a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe freely: Jews and Christians enduring persecution behind the Iron Curtain, the boat people of Southeast Asia, of Cuba and Haiti, the victims of drought and famine in Africa, the freedom fighters of Afghanistan and our own countrymen held in savage captivity.\u201dIt\u2019s enough to make you weep.

Washington Convention Center.\u201cA lot of people come to Washington to do business with the government,\u201d said Howard Riker, a managing director at Hines, the developer of CityCenterDC. \u201cWe have taken advantage of that. I think we\u2019ll see more and more of that with the new administration, which has a pretty ambitious agenda, so I think there will be people coming into town to participate.\u201dMs. Bennett thinks it is entirely possible CityCenterDC will have its moment. \u201cA lot of people, whether they\u2019re supportive of the Trump administration or not, are getting engaged in life in Washington in a way they haven\u2019t before,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s more activity, which will improve the economy, which hopefully will trickle into the fashion and retail space.\u201dThe next big events on Washington\u2019s social calendar are the 30th annual Leukemia Ball on Saturday at the convention center (three blocks from CityCenterDC), and the Easter egg roll at the White House on April 17.

{"Headline": "The L.P.G.A. Tour and Donald Trump: It\u2019s Complicated", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byOn GolfLydia Ko could win her second consecutive ANA Inspiration title this week, or be eclipsed by Michelle Wie winning her first in her 13th career start, and it would still be lose-lose for the women in one respect.As the top golfers on the L.P.G.A. Tour compete in their first major tournament of the year, they will be hard-pressed to ignore the storm clouds gathering in advance of their third, the United States Women\u2019s Open, to be held in July at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.Before Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States, he was the Daddy Warbucks of women\u2019s golf, hosting the top players every year at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., during the L.P.G.A.\u2019s season-ending ADT Championship at Trump International Golf Club. In 2006, the tournament\u2019s first-place prize was $1 million, a milestone that the men had reached seven years earlier.In his prepolitics life as a real estate mogul, Trump dispensed business advice to the L.P.G.A. players and invited them to his courses for informal rounds of golf. The women generally accepted his invitations for the same reason they play pro-am events every year with dozens of other golfers, including those who harbor different political and personal beliefs: These people, usually men, sustain the Tour with their support.\u201cHaving played in the ADT Championship when it was held at his course in West Palm Beach, I have experienced nothing but good things from him and his golf course,\u201d said Karen Stupples, a reporter for the Golf Channel and NBC who competed in the event in 2004 and 2008. \u201cAnd I think the L.P.G.A. in general feels that same way, that he was very respectful to the L.P.G.A., to the tournament.\u201dSince Trump became the putative leader of the free world, he has often been seen on the golf course, and for some of those outings, he has reached out to some of the best players in the game to accompany him. The top men and women have accepted invitations to play with him with their eyes wide open. They know that what they see as a social outing will be spun as a political statement \u2014 and they seem largely not to care.How would the best women, whose ranks cut across more cultures than the men\u2019s, respond? At the Founders Cup in mid-March, the first L.P.G.A. event of the year held in the United States, I conducted an anonymous survey of 40 players. Twenty-four (or 60 percent) said they would play with Trump, nine said they would not and seven declined to comment. A non-American joked, \u201cI want to stay in the country so I\u2019ll say yes.\u201dThe women, who ranged in age from under 20 to over 50, represented 12 countries and make their homes in 11 states, including four that voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in last year\u2019s presidential election. One player, Natalie Gulbis, spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention. Another, the Floridian Lexi Thompson, has played golf with Trump since the election. Ko, the women\u2019s No. 1 from New Zealand, has not played a round with Trump \u2014 but only because she hasn\u2019t received an invitation.\u201cHe\u2019s the leader of one of the biggest countries in the whole entire world,\u201d Ko said, \u201cand it would be an honor if I got that call.\u201dRyann O\u2019Toole, an American who was raised in California, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him and I\u2019ll still play with him.\u201dKo is 19. Thompson is 22. O\u2019Toole is 30. Stupples is 43 and the mother of a 9-year-old son. It is unfair, Stupples said, to expect a consensus on any political issue from a tour membership that includes women under 20 and over 40 and Americans and foreigners.\u201cLydia and Lexi have both led a very sheltered life,\u201d Stupples said. \u201cThey\u2019ve played golf and that\u2019s it. They probably haven\u2019t seen much of what goes on outside of the golf course and a hotel.\u201dShe added: \u201cWould I play golf with him? Probably not. But then that\u2019s me. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve been around the block a few times and seen a few other things. But it\u2019s only because of my life experience that I feel like I can make a good judgment on what I want to do personally.\u201dThe United States Golf Association awarded its flagship women\u2019s event to Trump\u2019s Bedminster course in 2012, when his reputation as an opportunistic outsider came from supporting golf when the economy was cratering and other benefactors were bailing.\u201cHe was such a huge fan of the L.P.G.A. and of golf in general,\u201d said Gulbis, who has known Trump since she qualified for her first ADT Championship in 2005.Throughout the years, she said, he has counseled her to fight for the same pay as PGA Tour members for public appearances or sponsorships.\u201cThese were constant conversations that I saw him have not just with me, but with lots of people in our organization,\u201d Gulbis said.\u201cI\u2019ve been playing golf all my life, I\u2019m very familiar with how deeply ingrained sexism is in the game,\u201d Thomas said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting. People who aren\u2019t fans think it\u2019s such an easy decision for the U.S.G.A. and the L.P.G.A. to make to avoid controversy.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe question really is, do the U.S.G.A. and L.P.G.A. want to be on the right side of history? If the U.S.G.A. wants to stay relevant to a younger generation of golfers, they\u2019re going to have to take a look at their decision. This is an opportunity to send a clear signal to women, people of color and people with disabilities that they stand on the side of inclusiveness.\u201dUltraViolet staged a protest on the third day of the Founders Cup, calling for the Women\u2019s Open to be moved from Bedminster or, barring that, for the players to boycott the event. Roughly a dozen people gathered outside the public entrance to Wildfire Golf Club, the tournament site on a Marriott property in Phoenix, and handed out items including \u201cDump Trump\u201d golf balls before being escorted away by hotel security.The organization also commissioned a plane to fly over the tournament grounds with a banner that read: \u201cLPGA: Take a Mulligan. Dump Sexist Trump.\u201dThe organization added that the U.S.G.A. owns and operates the United States Women\u2019s Open and \u201cwe respect and support the decisions made by the U.S.G.A. on this matter.\u201dThe statement did not sit well with Thomas, who grew up in Los Angeles and played golf with her father at Rolling Hills Country Club and Riviera Country Club. Many of the courses she frequented were about as integrated as Trump\u2019s cabinet, which has a smaller percentage of women and minorities than the first cabinets of his four immediate predecessors.\u201cThe ladies that play golf shouldn\u2019t be forced to build up the Trump brand in any way,\u201d she said.Judy Rankin, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, is discomfited by the notion that the players should allow politics to play through in the most prestigious women\u2019s tournament in the United States.\u201cBack in the dark ages, I did not agree with everything Gerald Ford did,\u201d said Rankin, whose most successful season, 1976, coincided with Ford\u2019s last full year as president.She won six tournaments that year and became the first L.P.G.A. player to surpass $100,000 in yearly earnings.\u201cI found him to be the most wonderful man, and I certainly played golf with him,\u201d Rankin added. \u201cBecause you play golf with them does not necessarily mean you support every single thing they do. But they hold the highest office in the land. And I\u2019m not sure that an invitation to play golf should be answered with a political statement.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Little Sign of a \u2018Trump Bump\u2019 in the Economic Forecast", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byConsumers are more confident. Stocks are up 5 percent since the start of the year. And from the president on down, there\u2019s talk of a Trump bump.The only problem: The boom is apparent everywhere except in the economic data.It\u2019s not that the economy is stalling \u2014 far from it. But with the first quarter ending Friday, growth in the first three months of the Trump administration is looking much the way it did under President Barack Obama.In fact, experts see the gross domestic product in the quarter coming in at only about 1 percent, on an annualized basis \u2014 less than half the pace in the second half of 2016, and a far cry from President Trump\u2019s own 4 percent target.\u201cThere is a temporal disconnect,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere has been an incredible rise in sentiment, but the proof is in the pudding later.\u201dMs. Zentner expects growth of 1 percent this quarter, and considers recent data \u201csolid,\u201d but added that the big gap between expectations and reality \u201ccreates discomfort for economists and monetary policy makers.\u201d\u201cThe divergence is stunning,\u201d she added, drawing a distinction between \u201csoft data\u201d like consumer confidence and \u201chard data\u201d like retail sales.The pattern continued this week, when the Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence in March rose to its highest since December 2000. More hard data is expected Friday, when the Commerce Department releases new figures on personal income and spending in February.Wall Street, which surged in the months after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory on hopes of tax cuts and deregulation, is coming to grips with the fact that at least in the short term, the outlook remains restrained. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped on nine out of the last 10 trading days, the longest stretch of losses since 2011, albeit for a total decline of only 1.4 percent.One quarter is only a snapshot, and official government data on the gross domestic product for the period will not be out for another month. What is more, the American economy is expected to pick up some speed later in the year, especially if the White House and Congress can agree on a package of promised tax cuts and new infrastructure spending.Still, for all of 2017, the economy is expected to expand by roughly 2 percent, the rate of the recovery under Mr. Obama. The identical figures illustrate how much easier it is for a president to lift economic spirits, as opposed to actual growth rates.If tax reform and other legislation in Washington suffer the same fate as the bid to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s health care overhaul did last week, Ms. Zentner said, the Trump bump \u201ccould be built like a house of cards that comes crumbling down.\u201dPart of the problem is that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s Oval Office sessions with chief executives and the return of what the economist John Maynard Keynes termed \u201canimal spirits,\u201d corporate America is not investing heavily, at least so far, in new plants and equipment.At the same time, demand in many industries is growing only modestly, while a few sectors like retail chains are having to make painful adaptations to a rapidly evolving consumer landscape.Retail stores are top customers for Valdese Weavers, a century-old maker of high-end fabrics nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, but Michael Shelton isn\u2019t complaining.\u201cBusiness is better for us than it should be, because growth has been relatively flat for many of our customers,\u201d said Mr. Shelton, Valdese\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to find a few pockets of new business, so growth is in the low single digits. It\u2019s nothing robust but at least we\u2019re up for the year and we\u2019re happy about that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think politics or the election has affected our outlook,\u201d Mr. Shelton said. \u201cWhile many of our customers have seen a Trump bump in terms of their stock price, the industry hasn\u2019t seen an effect on retail traffic.\u201dOne additional factor holding back economic growth nationally \u2014 and in Burke County, N.C., where Valdese is based \u2014 is the proportion of Americans now in the labor force.Although unemployment in Burke County is half a percentage point higher than the national average, Mr. Shelton says finding workers with the technical skills Valdese needs is difficult.\u201cWe could train an undereducated person in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the textile industry has changed, and we need a higher level of competence in computers and math for specific skills.\u201d\u201cThe difference is larger than usual and is being driven by the fact that the New York Fed incorporates soft data into its tracking,\u201d said Ms. Zentner of Morgan Stanley.The government\u2019s estimate of gross domestic product is based on specific data points for economic factors like monthly retail sales, inventories, trade and other hard data, which also count more heavily in the Atlanta Fed\u2019s model.Whoever is right, most longer-term forecasts estimate growth for all of this year and 2018 to be in a range of 2 to 2.5 percent \u2014 again, largely in line with the pattern of the last eight years.\u201cSentiment has gotten stronger but business investment hasn\u2019t accelerated,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays. \u201cTo get it to translate to hard data, you\u2019d need new policies like tax cuts, tax reform, and a major increase in infrastructure spending.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rethinking Our Immigration System", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byLettersTO THE EDITOR:I have seen this issue from both sides. I served as an Immigration and Naturalization Service prosecutor during the 1980s and have specialized in immigration law for the past 30 years.There are many ways that our legal immigration system could be improved. First, since legal immigration to the United States is approximately one-third of 1 percent of our population and the baby boom is long over, there is no need to reduce immigration. If anything, it should be increased.Second, most immigrants today are chosen by whether they have close family members in the United States. This system is good for families, but it does not necessarily serve the interests of our country. Let\u2019s get rid of the brother-sister category. Let\u2019s also press \u201cdelete\u201d on the program that allows 50,000 people to immigrate to the United States annually based on a lottery!Third, let\u2019s get rid of \u201cper-country quotas\u201d for talented immigrants, which makes it take way longer for highly educated people to immigrate to the United States from countries like India, China and the Philippines than for people from other countries.Let\u2019s give the green cards that are now reserved for the visa lottery and the sibling category to highly skilled immigrants who are doctors, nurses, cancer researchers and entrepreneurs.That would be in our best interest.CARL SHUSTERMAN, LOS ANGELESTO THE EDITOR:George Borjas contributes to a thoughtful debate on immigration, but he ignores, it seems, some major trends.The historical link between rising productivity and increasing wages has been severed. That more than anything may be the cause of wage stagnation for less skilled, non-college-degreed workers. Immigration did not cause or exacerbate that trend. Restricting immigration will not fix it.Because of the baby boomers, the nonimmigrant work force is aging and shrinking. Immigration ameliorates that. Without robust immigration, there may not be enough wage earners in a decade or so to support retirement benefits for those who have retired.Despite the so-called \u201cethnic enclaves,\u201d most second-generation immigrants and first-generation immigrants who arrived as children (the \u201cDreamers\u201d) are fully assimilated, well educated and integrated into the economic life of the nation. That helps avoid the retirement crunch down the road and decline in economic activity that results from a shrinking work force.Immigration, even of undocumented immigrants, is not what ails the American economy, and constricting it may do more long-term harm than short-term good. Pointing to immigration as a significant economic harm diverts attention from the real source of economic distress for working Americans, which is income inequality. The causes and fixes for that have little if anything to do with immigration, legal or otherwise.MICHAEL STARR, NEW YORKAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Got Nearly $1 Million in Energy-Efficiency Subsidies in 2012", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byBut in 2012, Donald J. Trump, the businessman, played a different tune.That year, Mr. Trump finished securing almost $1 million in energy-efficiency incentives and low-interest loans from New York State to fit a Trump-branded residential tower in Westchester County with eco-friendly fixtures, state records show.Changes in federal policies by the Trump administration would not necessarily alter energy-efficiency subsidies in New York State. But Mr. Trump\u2019s acceptance of them highlights the seeming dissonance between his use of environmental subsidies and incentives while at the helm of his sprawling business, and his administration\u2019s public hostility toward financial support for clean energy and energy efficiency.In the past, Mr. Trump has said he has tried to take every advantage of laws to help himself and his business. Amanda Miller, a Trump Organization spokeswoman, did not respond to questions about the clean-energy incentives. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.As a candidate and as president, though, Mr. Trump has advocated reducing environmental regulations. And there are concerns about the future of federal tax credits for energy-efficient buildings under Mr. Trump\u2019s promised tax overhaul.\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s own properties benefited from energy-efficiency upgrades, courtesy of successful clean-energy and climate change policies,\u201d said Dave Anderson, a policy analyst at the Energy and Policy Institute, an organization that supports renewable energy and that has been tracking Mr. Trump\u2019s use of energy-efficiency incentives.\u201cHowever, his incoming administration appears to be heading in a very different direction on clean energy and climate change,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.In documents filed in New York State, the Trump Organization is listed as the managing agency for the buildings that received the incentives. In the case of the Trump Tower at City Center, the real estate itself is owned by the developer, LC White Plains Residential II.The retrofits that the Trump Organization made to the Trump Tower at City Center are especially advanced.The building\u2019s new power system, called a cogeneration system, traps thermal energy from two generators and uses it for the heating of air and water, said Larry Gomez, the property\u2019s resident manager.It installed energy-efficient hallway lights that are controlled by motion sensors and a cover on its rooftop swimming pool to minimize evaporation and to reduce pool-heating costs.\u201cIt\u2019s saved the building a fortune in energy costs,\u201d Mr. Gomez said \u2014 about $300,000 a year.Alan Neiditch, who has lived at Trump Tower at City Center for 11 years and heads the building\u2019s board, said that each of the 200-odd units saved about $100 a month in utility costs during the spring and fall thanks to the retrofits, and more in the summer and winter.He said some of the measures at the building, like the lighting controlled by motion sensors, felt like obvious steps for the building to take.\u201cIn our opinion, it was way overlit,\u201d Mr. Neiditch said.For the installations, the Trump Organization received more than $280,000 in incentive money from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. A low-interest loan from the agency covered the rest of the approximately $1 million cost.A 2013 case study by the agency estimated that the Trump property had reduced its energy use by 21 percent and that the project had paid for itself in just three years.The agency declined to comment specifically on the incentives the Trump Organization had received. But Kate Muller, a spokeswoman, said the incentives played a \u201clarge role in New York\u2019s aggressive, nation-leading energy goals, which look to build an energy system that is resilient, cleaner, and affordable for all New Yorkers.\u201dMr. Gomez, a self-proclaimed student of the latest energy-efficiency technology, said he was not done trying to bring down the energy use at his Trump property.\u201cWe\u2019re wondering whether we have enough wind up here to put small wind turbines up on the roof area,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might at some point look at doing something like that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The principle of the Chevron case says that a federal court will defer to a federal agency\u2019s views. One rationale for this doctrine is that an agency, with its expertise, is better positioned than a judge to know a statute\u2019s meaning.It may sound rather innocuous and bland, but it speaks to separation-of-power issues, as well as to how much power we want to give the administrative state, the array of federal agencies that administer and promulgate regulations.The Washington of today is not the government of the founders. In the time of George Washington, there were only three cabinet departments. Today, there are 15 cabinet-level departments, more than 430 agencies and other entities, and about 1.4 million civilian employees.This big bureaucracy is not necessarily a bad thing. The economy is much bigger and more complex than it was 200 years ago. A large and diverse economy needs regulation. And while the Trump administration has promised to reduce the bureaucracy as many presidents have before, it is hard to see the modern economy running without some degree of regulation, whether it concerns the security of banks or the safety of food and drugs.The doctrine is now in the spotlight because one of its most prominent critics is none other than Judge Gorsuch.Judge Gorsuch, however, came out swinging against the doctrine in an opinion last year on the grounds that it gave too much power to federal agencies.The odd thing about this is that the Chevron doctrine was a creation of conservative government.In the case where the doctrine emerged, the National Resources Defense Council had challenged an Environmental Protection Agency rule during the Reagan administration, which had reversed a rule under the Carter administration that required all new plants at a single site to get a new permit under the Clean Air Act even if the plant did not increase overall emissions. The Reagan administration decision was made by no other than Judge Gorsuch\u2019s mother, Anne M. Gorsuch, who then headed the E.P.A.The argument relied on the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. A deputy solicitor general at the time, Paul Bator, argued that the court should defer to the administration, which favored a lighter regulatory touch. And the unanimous opinion by John Paul Stevens agreed \u2014 deregulation was off to the races.Chevron deference became legend in legal circles \u2014 it has now been cited more than 81,000 times. In 1986, as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kenneth W. Starr called Chevron a \u201cMagna Carta\u201d for agency deregulation.Time passed, and the tables turned. President Ronald Reagan ran against big government, but the number of federal employees grew during his terms in office. And when Democrats were in the White House, a tool that had been used by agencies on behalf of deregulation was now used for more vigorous oversight and regulation.That is what Judge Gorsuch\u2019s view on Chevron comes down to: a conservative attempt to turn back the tide that conservatives created.Yet while Chevron deference is likely to come up at his confirmation hearing, it\u2019s unclear what exactly the power of the doctrine actually is. What would happen if there was no such principle?With or without Chevron, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has lately had a field day overturning Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Indeed, judges often find a way to put forth their view of the law and overrule administrative agencies without citing Chevron or similar doctrines.More important, some who oppose the principle of Chevron seem to think it is a magical elixir that will tame what they see as too vast a bureaucracy. That seems silly \u2014 at its heart such a doctrine is merely a judicial tool. Whether the bureaucracy shrinks or grows depends on what Congress and the president do.And it seems fanciful to think we can live in such a complex world without regulators empowered to interpret regulation. Can you really have a financial economy today without rules and regulators who understand them?Chevron deference is all about who decides the law: agencies or judges. That\u2019s an important question about the law and separation of powers. But it won\u2019t end the federal administrative state or tame regulation by any means.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Should Trump Get Credit for Good Jobs Numbers?", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsAnd it comes on the heels of mostly good data across a range of indicators, including retail sales, industrial output and the number of people filing for jobless benefits.So how much of the economic gains evident in the data does the Trump administration actually deserve credit for? The answer is more ambiguous than you might think \u2014 and boils down to your philosophy of how the economy works.There is a straightforward case for President Trump\u2019s having virtually nothing to do with the most recent economic statistics. While the newest jobs numbers reflect conditions from mid-February, roughly three weeks into the Trump presidency, at that point he had not yet taken concrete actions that would have a direct impact on the economy.President Trump has snagged good headlines out of things like negotiating for Carrier to keep some jobs in the United States, but those deals are trivial in the scheme of a nation with 146 million jobs.Even when changes to fiscal and regulatory policies are enacted, it takes time for those changes to wend their way through the economy. Consider one example that has been a Trump hobby horse. If you believe, as the president does, that the Dodd-Frank Act regulating the financial sector has held back growth, consider all the steps that need to happen to change that.You have to devise and pass legislation to undo the law, and appoint new regulators with a more hands-off stance. They then have to put the revised regulations through an elaborate comment process, which then might free banks to make more business loans, which in turn might lead businesses to hire and invest more.It is a matter of years before an intended policy shift might affect the jobs numbers for good or ill, not weeks.And it\u2019s worth a reminder that the recent numbers are entirely consistent with the economy\u2019s growth pattern for years. The 235,000 extra jobs that have Drudge and Mr. Trump so enthused are actually fewer than those in four of the 12 months of 2016. The unemployment rate has hovered between 4.6 percent and 5 percent for 18 consecutive months, since September 2015.So if you look only at the direct ways the president affects the economy, there is not much of a case for giving President Trump the credit.At the same time, we can\u2019t completely rule out some positive Trump effects on the economy, even as his policies have yet to take hold.That observation is backed by both the buoyant stock market, which seems to be pricing in higher corporate earnings in the years ahead, and surveys of both consumers and C.E.O.s.There\u2019s not a lot of solid evidence that general confidence is a major driver of economic results; surveys of consumer sentiment and executives\u2019 confidence tend to reflect current economic conditions rather than offer some good predictive information.But it\u2019s hard to prove that this confidence doesn\u2019t matter either. It\u2019s entirely plausible that Mr. Trump\u2019s election in November and the ensuing market rally made business leaders a bit more inclined to move forward with hiring plans in January and February.Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, essentially conceded in a television interview Friday that warm February weather and the long-term trajectory of the economy were factors in the latest jobs numbers, while promising that bigger job gains were down the road, owing to the White House\u2019s embrace of C.E.O.s.\u201cClearly a good February is part of the number,\u201d he said on CNBC. \u201cWhen you look at what\u2019s ahead of us, what\u2019s built into the system, we have a huge backlog of hiring that we already know about. We\u2019re very excited about what\u2019s ahead of us.\u201dSo does Mr. Trump deserve any credit for solid economic results? If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no. If you think that what really matters is the mood in the executive suite, then just maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Lowers Growth Target as Lawmakers Meet", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byAt the meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, China addressed issues such as pollution, debt and foreign policy.Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier, called on Sunday for economic growth this year of \u201caround 6.5 percent or higher, if possible,\u201d slightly more modest than last year\u2019s target of 6.5 to 7 percent. Actual growth last year, according to official data, was 6.7 percent.Even with the slight drop in projected growth, many economists argue that China\u2019s annual target remains too ambitious and is adding to its long-term problems. But Mr. Li defended the target.\u201cThe projected target for this year\u2019s growth is realistic,\u201d Mr. Li said in a report issued on Sunday before lawmakers convened. \u201cAn important reason to stress the need for stable growth is to ensure employment and improve people\u2019s lives.\u201dIn a separate report issued to the legislature, the National Development and Reform Commission \u2014 which helps steer the economy \u2014 said the growth target was meant to reassure the public at an anxious time. Later this year, the Chinese Communist Party will undergo a leadership shake-up, and officials have said that stability is essential.\u201cThis rate of growth is conducive to fostering healthy public expectations,\u201d the commission report said. China, it added, was \u201cfacing complex and volatile\u201d conditions this year.Since the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, China has rapidly expanded debt to stimulate the economy and to make sure that it hit fairly ambitious targets for economic growth. Reformers have called for lower targets that would not require so much debt to achieve.Mr. Li also tried to reassure a public that has grown increasingly angry about noxious air, water and soil left by decades of feverish industrial growth, and burning coal is a main culprit.\u201cWe will work faster to address pollution caused by coal burning,\u201d Mr. Li said. Those steps would include trying to cut the amount of coal used for winter furnaces and heaters. \u201cAll key sources of industrial pollution will be placed under round-the-clock online monitoring,\u201d he said.But China\u2019s appetite for coal remains enormous. Mr. Li said that China would keep cutting excess coal production this year, but more slowly than previously. He said that this year the government aimed to shut down at least 150 million metric tons of coal production. Last year, he said, the government cut 290 million tons.In terms of other pollutants, Mr. Li said that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions would be cut 3 percent this year and that fine particles of pollution in the air, which are of particular threat to health, would decrease \u201cmarkedly\u201d in \u201ckey areas.\u201d He also said that energy consumption would decline by 3.4 percent per unit of economic output \u2014 a calculation that will still allow increases in emissions of global warming gases.Mr. Li did not mention President Trump, whose campaign language suggested a tougher stance against China on trade and regional issues. These annual reports by China\u2019s prime minister are traditionally used for laying out generalities, not specific policies. But Mr. Li built on an effort by the president, Xi Jinping, to promote China as a reassuringly stable and mature power in uncertain times.\u201cIn the face of profound changes in the international political and economic landscape, China will always be on the side of peace and stability,\u201d he said.On trade, Mr. Li said China will continue to oppose protectionism. \u201cEconomic globalization is in the fundamental interests of all countries,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cChina will not shift in its commitment to promoting global economic cooperation.\u201dBut Chinese officials were circumspect about the government\u2019s latest increase in military spending.Mr. Li said that the government was looking to lower debt loads in the economy from a splurge of bank lending, but he suggested it would be done a \u201cprudent\u201d way that would not risk an economic shock.But the Ministry of Finance budget report, issued alongside Mr. Li\u2019s report, outlined a tougher approach to local governments that have collected debt to pay for infrastructure. \u201cHigher priority will be given to preventing and controlling local government debt,\u201d the budget report said. Provincial governments would develop \u201clocal contingency plans\u201d to deal with debt risks, it said.Foreign companies have become increasingly vocal about business barriers, intellectual property theft and other problems in the Chinese market. Some are turning elsewhere to establish a base for production.Mr. Li held out an olive branch, promising to \u201cmake big moves to improve the environment for foreign investors.\u201d He said that service industries, manufacturing and mining would become more open to these investors.He also promised that, contrary to most expectations and previous experience, foreign companies would not be discriminated against on license applications, setting standards or government procurement. The country has laid out plans \u2014 called the Made in China 2025 initiative \u2014 for it to seize a global lead in a long list of key high-tech and manufacturing industries in the next eight years.Legislators gave polite applause to most of Mr. Li\u2019s plans. But one new policy drew vigorous clapping in a country where a national grid of bullet-train routes has quickly made long-distance travel commonplace: Mr. Li said the government would end roaming charges on cellphones used outside the province in which the phone numbers were initially registered.Sui-Lee Wee contributed reporting, and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}

On the campaign trail, his diagnosis of the raw anger and disillusionment among white working-class Americans bested the most sophisticated analyses from the professional political class.But something must have happened between then and now.The president\u2019s plan would make deep cuts in most areas to pay for increased military spending.\u201cDeaths of despair,\u201d Professors Case and Deaton call them. From 1998 through 2015, the mortality rate of white non-Hispanic men and women with no more than a high school diploma increased in every five-year age group, from 25-to-29 to 60-to-64, they found.Others soldiered on. But the changes nonetheless took their toll. Marriage declined and families weakened. The prospects of working-class children deteriorated. And successive governments, Republican and Democratic, avoided looking too hard at the plight of modernity\u2019s losers.These economic changes affected all workers with scant education, of course. But whites suffered a deeper blow: In 1999 mortality rates of whites with no college were around 30 percent lower than those of blacks as a whole, Professors Deaton and Case found. By 2015 they were 30 percent higher. It seems that blacks and Latinos, whose memories of the halcyon days of manufacturing in the early 1970s are colored by the stain of discrimination, suffered less of a loss.These include: \u201can increase in the rate of male mortality from risky and unhealthful behaviors; a reduction in the net availability of marriage-age males in affected labor markets; a reduction in the fraction of young adults entering marriage; a fall in fertility accompanied by a rise in the fraction of births to teen and unmarried mothers; and a sharp jump in the fraction of children living in impoverished and, to a lesser degree, single-headed households.\u201dCan Mr. Trump do anything for these people? A lot of them voted for him.Mr. Trump\u2019s most prominent campaign proposals \u2014 which promised to restore the jobs and the demographics of the 1950s and 1960s by blocking imports and kicking out millions of immigrants \u2014 are, of course, unrealistic. A more ethnically diverse America is here to stay. The labor-intensive manufacturing sector will not return to the United States no matter what the president does.\u201cThe trouble with protectionism is that it is not going to bring those jobs back,\u201d Professor Deaton told me. \u201cWe can spend a huge amount of money inflicting pain on ourselves, not to mention Chinese and Indian and other people much poorer than we are, and not get anything back.\u201dBut there are more productive ideas around. It is too early for Mr. Trump to simply fold on his promises of a better future for the white working class. Republicans\u2019 failure to approve the plan to end the Affordable Care Act \u2014 devised by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and endorsed by the president \u2014 offers an opportunity to correct course.Why not extend the social safety net to cover his distressed voters, offering a lifeline of stability to help them hang on to their lives? This could include training programs to help less-educated workers find new careers in an unstable economy, extended unemployment benefits, or wage subsidies for workers knocked down into jobs with low pay. Even, perhaps, something more generous: truly universal health insurance.The party the president represents may not like these sorts of proposals. But the relationship is fractious anyway. He was elected to fix the carnage.Advertisement"}

Our digital crude is a rich brew of mundane, everyday activities \u2014 our searches, texts and tweets \u2014 along with the GPS coordinates from our phones, the biometric information we share with fitness devices, even the IP addresses of our connected refrigerators. To the average person, this raw material is undetectable noise. But for organizations that know how to identify signals, there\u2019s immense value in refining what has become an unlimited supply.Understanding what data we create, and how others exploit it, is vitally important. Soon, powerful machine-learning algorithms and artificially intelligent systems will analyze our data to reach decisions about and for us: whether we qualify for a bank loan, whether we\u2019re likely to commit a crime, whether we deserve an organ transplant. And unlike us, machines aren\u2019t burdened with an emotional attachment to privacy.The popular old data-as-oil idea opens Andreas Weigend\u2019s new book, \u201cData for the People,\u201d an exhaustive and insightful look at how data is collected and used, often without our knowledge and almost always without our input. Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon, details the \u201csocial data\u201d that emanates from billions of cameras, sensors and other devices, as well as social networks, online retailers and dating apps. Data refineries \u2014 those companies and people who turn our digital crude into profitable information \u2014 hunt for patterns, then sort us into buckets based on our behavior: what we might buy, what we\u2019ll watch, whom we might fall in love with. As Weigend points out, this exchange benefits everyone: If we let ourselves be mined, we receive personalized recommendations, connections and deals. Yet there\u2019s an imbalance of power. Companies make a lot of money from our data, and we have very little say in how it\u2019s used.Weigend argues persuasively that in this \u201cpost-privacy\u201d world, we should give our data freely, but that we should expect certain protections in return. He advocates a set of rights to increase data refineries\u2019 transparency and to increase our own agency in how information is used. Companies like OkCupid, WeChat and Spotify should perform data safety audits, submit to privacy ratings and calculate a score based on the benefits they provide \u2014 a sort of credit score for the companies that mine our data. Meanwhile, we should have the right to amend, blur and import or export our own data into any system we please.Not everyone believes that our information should be freely available as long as we agree to the terms of use. In \u201cThe Art of Invisibility,\u201d the internet security expert Kevin Mitnick advocates the opposite. Mitnick notes various reasons we may want to hide our data: We\u2019re wary of the government; we don\u2019t want businesses intruding into our lives; we have a mistress; we are the mistress; we\u2019re a criminal. Mitnick, who served five years in prison for hacking into corporate networks and stealing software, offers a sobering reminder of how our raw data \u2014 from email, cars, home Wi-Fi networks and so on \u2014 makes us vulnerable. He describes basic privacy protections (using a strong password, avoiding public computers) along with more advanced techniques (encrypting files on a hard drive, using a VPN and Bitcoin for online purchases). Most will seem familiar and perhaps rudimentary to those with any technical savvy. For everyone else, he offers an uncomfortable view of how data can be exploited.Both books are meant to scare us, and the central theme is privacy: Without intervention, they suggest, we\u2019ll come to regret today\u2019s inaction. I agree, but the authors miss the real horror show on the horizon. The future\u2019s fundamental infrastructure is being built by computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and security experts just like Weigend and Mitnick, who do not recognize their own biases. This encodes an urgent flaw in the foundation itself. The next layer will be just a little off, along with the next one and the one after that, as the problems compound.Right now, humans and machines engage in \u201csupervised learning.\u201d Experts \u201cteach\u201d the system by labeling an initial data set; once the computer reaches basic proficiency, they let it try sorting data on its own. If the system makes an error, the experts correct it. Eventually, this process yields highly sophisticated algorithms capable of refining and using our personal data for a variety of purposes: automatically sorting spam out of your inbox, say, or recommending a show you\u2019ll like on Netflix. Then, building on this foundation of data and algorithms, more teaching and learning takes place.But human bias creeps into computerized algorithms in disconcerting ways. In 2015, Google\u2019s photo app mistook a black software developer for a gorilla in photos he uploaded. In 2016, the Microsoft chatbot Tay went on a homophobic, anti-Semitic rampage after just one day of interactions on Twitter. Months later, reporters at ProPublica uncovered how algorithms in police software discriminate against black people while mislabeling white criminals as \u201clow risk.\u201d Recently when I searched \u201cC.E.O.\u201d on Google Images, the first woman listed was C.E.O. Barbie.Data scientists aren\u2019t inherently racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. But they are human, and they harbor unconscious biases just as we all do. This comes through in both books. In Mitnick\u2019s, women appear primarily in anecdotes and always as unwitting, jealous or angry. Near the end, Mitnick describes trying to enter Canada from Michigan, and wonders if he\u2019s stopped \u201cbecause a Middle Eastern guy with only a green card was driving.\u201d (He might be right, but he doesn\u2019t allow for the possibility that his own criminal record could also be responsible.)Weigend\u2019s book is meticulously researched, yet nearly all the experts he quotes are men. Early on he tells the story of Latanya Sweeney, who in the 1990s produced a now famous study of anonymized public health data in Massachusetts. She proved that the data could be traced back to individuals, including the governor himself. But Sweeney is far better known for something Weigend never mentions: She\u2019s the Harvard professor who discovered that \u2014 because of her black-sounding name \u2014 she was appearing in Google ads for criminal records and background checks. Weigend could have cited her to address bias in the second of his six rights, involving the integrity of a refinery\u2019s social data ecosystem. But he neglects to discuss the well-documented sexism, racism, xenophobia and homophobia in the machine-learning infrastructure.The omission of women and people of color from something as benign as book research illustrates the real challenge of unconscious bias in data and algorithms. Weigend and Mitnick rely only on what\u2019s immediate and familiar \u2014 an unfortunately common practice in the data community. University computer science, math and physics departments lack diversity in staff and coursework. Corporate data science is homogeneous. So are professional and academic conferences, where the future of data is discussed. If the people mining and processing our data are nothing like us, and if the machines learn only from them, our data can yield only warped caricatures, like the zombies you see on TV.As a futurist, I try to figure out how your data will someday power things like artificially intelligent cars, computer-assisted doctors and robot security agents. That\u2019s why I found both books concerning. Think of all the characteristics that make up who you are: how much coffee you drink, how fast you drive, how often you open your refrigerator, your respiratory rate, what slang you use, the random strangers you\u2019ve friended on Facebook. You may look like Weigend and Mitnick and therefore may not have experienced algorithmic discrimination yet. You, too, should be afraid.

{"Headline": "2018 Dilemma for Republicans: Which Way Now on Obamacare?", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As they come to terms with their humiliating failure to undo the Affordable Care Act, Republicans eyeing next year\u2019s congressional campaign are grappling with a new dilemma: Do they risk depressing their conservative base by abandoning the repeal effort or anger a broader set of voters by reviving a deeply unpopular bill even closer to the midterm elections?The question is particularly acute in the House, where the Republican majority could be at risk in 2018 if the party\u2019s voters are demoralized, and Democratic activists, energized by the chance to send a message to President Trump, stream to the polls.Sifting through the wreckage of a disastrous week, Republican strategists and elected officials were divided over the best way forward. Some House Republicans pressed to move on to other issues and notch some victories that could delight their own loyalists while not turning off swing voters.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of time to do real things on infrastructure, to do real things on tax reform, on red tape reform, and really get the American economy moving,\u201d said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House campaign arm. \u201cWe do those things and we still have a lot of time to recover.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to fumble the ball,\u201d he added, \u201cbetter to do so in the first quarter of a football game.\u201dDevising health care legislation that could appeal to both wings of the House Republican Conference \u2014 the hard-line conservatives and more moderate members \u2014 would require a nearly superhuman feat, added Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri.\u201cNot unless Harry Houdini wins a special election to help us,\u201d Mr. Long said about the prospects of cobbling together a coalition that could agree on how to repeal and replace the health care law.But other longtime Republicans warned that if the party did not address what they have derided as Obamacare, an issue that has been central to their campaigns for the last seven years, they would incur a heavy political price in the midterm elections.Midterm campaigns have increasingly become akin to parliamentary elections \u2014 referendums on the party in power rather than on individual candidates, where turnout by dependable partisan voters is the deciding factor.\u201cIf they fall on their sword on this, they\u2019re going to get slaughtered,\u201d said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican who himself was once at the helm of the House campaign committee.\u201cWhere parties get hurt in midterms is when their base collapses,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cDemocrats are going to show up regardless of what you do. If our voters don\u2019t see us fulfilling what we said we were going to do, they\u2019ll get dispirited.\u201dWhat troubles many Republican strategists is the specter of the party\u2019s most reliable voters being bombarded by reminders of their leaders\u2019 failure to address the health law. They fear a recurring story line sure to pop up every time insurance premiums increase, providers leave local networks, or, most worrisome, Republicans fund President Barack Obama\u2019s signature achievement.Conservatives, many of whom opposed the House repeal bill, now warn that it is untenable to stand pat on the issue \u2014 and that lawmakers will face retribution if they do not return to the repeal-and-replace effort.\u201cIf people are looking at a situation where there\u2019s no action on this, there are going to be conversations about primaries,\u201d warned Michael A. Needham, the chief executive of Heritage Action for America, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s political arm, which worked to scuttle the Republican health bill last week.That Republicans even find themselves in such a quandary just over two months after Mr. Trump was sworn in is at once extraordinary and not altogether surprising. Republicans who were then in office opposed the Affordable Care Act when it was enacted in 2010, yet they were paralyzed in efforts to undo it.The paradox is predictable for a party that has been at war with itself since the final years of President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Mr. Trump transcended those divisions last year in his campaign, but congressional Republicans remain riven between their hard-liners and mainstream conservatives.Perhaps it was inevitable that these factions would clash over an issue as sensitive as remaking the American health care system. The purists \u2014 often from politically safe districts \u2014 believe the government should play almost no role in providing health insurance to its citizens. Placating them without endangering more pragmatic lawmakers worried about depriving constituents of their health coverage may be an impossible task.\u201cI think we need to start negotiating with Democrats instead of the Freedom Caucus,\u201d said a frustrated Mr. Stivers, referring to the most conservative bloc of House Republicans. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to get to yes.\u201dDemocrats, though, have no appetite for conciliation: They see the Republican disarray over health care, and the broader tensions on display in the clash over the health care law, as a path back to the House majority.Seizing on the Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act, which according to a Quinnipiac University survey last week was supported by only 17 percent of Americans, Democrats have started digital advertising against the 14 potentially vulnerable House Republicans who supported the legislation in committee votes.Some of these lawmakers represent districts that Hillary Clinton carried last year. They are as concerned about the consequences of casting a vote for the bill as they are about inviting a backlash from their bases for not addressing the issue at all.Indeed, though much of the frustration from mainline Republicans has been directed at the Freedom Caucus, Republican lawmakers from pro-Clinton districts played just as big a role in torpedoing the American Health Care Act.\u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for a bill that has no chance of passing the Senate,\u201d explained Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, one such lawmaker who invoked the haunting tradition of House members\u2019 casting risky and, in some cases, career-ending votes, only to see their Senate colleagues sit on the proposals.Mr. Lance, whose district Mrs. Clinton carried, and other Republicans insisted after the bill\u2019s collapse last week that they still wanted to wrestle with the Affordable Care Act in this Congress.But former Representative Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota, a Democrat who lost his seat in 2010 in part because of his vote for the Affordable Care Act, said he thought Republicans like Mr. Lance were actually \u201cbreathing a sigh of relief\u201d for averting a floor vote.\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very tough vote for somebody in a competitive race,\u201d Mr. Pomeroy said. \u201cThey may alienate their base by voting against it, but if they support a bill resulting in people losing their coverage, there will be electoral hell to pay.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Life of Her London Parties, Now Out to Save Them All", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileLONDON \u2014 In the 25 years since she moved to London from her native New Jersey, Amy Lam\u00e9 has staged a late-night manifesto on protected sex in one of the city\u2019s most notorious gay cruising zones, and created and hosted a sex and sexuality-themed TV game show. She has also emceed a cabaret night whose guests have included a flame dancer, a hula hoop artist and a stripping dwarf.Next up for Ms. Lam\u00e9: one of the most visible positions in London\u2019s city government.Now, the mayor\u2019s office is instituting measures \u2014 including the one-year appointment of Ms. Lam\u00e9 \u2014 to ensure that London maintains its edge even as Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union threatens the city\u2019s status as Europe\u2019s de facto capital of things like night life, tourism and banking.\u201cSadiq could see night life disappearing before his eyes,\u201d Ms. Lam\u00e9 said at a recent dinner at a chic late-night restaurant in the Soho district. She had finished her martini \u2014 a passion fruit-flavored vodka, with a pour-over shot of champagne, served compliments of the house \u2014 and moved on to red wine. \u201cMy job is to stem that flow.\u201dMs. Lam\u00e9, 46 and a self-described \u201cchubby white American lesbian,\u201d moved to London in 1992, looking for an adventure and a place to stretch her wings. She had just come out of the closet, and had graduated from Washington College on the Eastern Shore of Maryland with a degree in French and humanities with a specialty in medieval studies. (\u201cLots of jobs for French-speaking medievalists, by the way,\u201d she said over dinner.)New York seemed too close to home for a place to take the next step and, she said, like a place full of people from back home pretending they came from the city. So Ms. Lam\u00e9 decamped to London and started working at First Out, a cafe-bar in Soho, which was then the city\u2019s center of gay life.Ms. Lam\u00e9 said she had never expected her far-ranging gigs to add up to a day job, let alone one sanctioned by the city government.\u201cIt\u2019s not a job that you can say: \u2018When I grow up, I want to be a Night Czar, so I\u2019m going to follow this path. I\u2019m going to go into a degree in Night Czardom,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lam\u00e9 said, breaking into a deep cackle.Since then, Mr. Khan has come out in support of an \u201cagent of change\u201d principle that requires new developers who move in next to a music venue to take responsibility for soundproofing their buildings. The mayor has also started to lobby against soaring fees that venues have to pay to operate commercially.Solving the problem has become an even bigger priority as the potential of a hard exit from the European Union looms and London\u2019s young professionals and creatives \u2014 especially Continental natives \u2014 weigh the possibility of leaving for other capitals, where they can live without facing visa issues.In her four months in the role, Ms. Lam\u00e9 has taken on a variety of tasks largely centered on public appearances and media events. She holds nightlong meet-and-greets where she chats with night workers and night crawlers at pubs, homeless shelters, emergency care centers and other venues in some of the city\u2019s less-trammeled districts. She lauds the benefits of London\u2019s nighttime economy at events catering to club staff and night life mavens.Two city publicists accompanied her throughout our dinner, keeping an ear out from across the table to ensure that the interview didn\u2019t fly off the rails. But Ms. Lam\u00e9\u2019s off-kilter personality bubbled up throughout.Conversation teetered from subjects like President Trump\u2019s mental health to her infatuation with Benjamin Franklin. (\u201cHe was a creative genius, but he had the common touch, you know? He was a diplomat, but an inventor. He took risks.\u201d) At one point on the way to dinner, Ms. Lam\u00e9 slipped into a doorway of a building to, she joked, smoke crack.Ms. Lam\u00e9 does get clipped when the conversation turns to certain subjects, like the potential conflicts between her activist background and her political present; why she stayed in Britain; and the chance that London, a diffuse and relatively leafy capital dotted with neighborhood pubs that often shut by midnight, may never compete with night life hubs like Berlin and New York. She is a deep and abiding fan of the city, which she calls the best in the world.And New York, Ms. Lam\u00e9 said, \u201cis resting on its laurels.\u201d\u201cIt needs to get its act together,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause we\u2019re nipping at your heels.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Auto Prices Rise, Used Cars Are Looking Shinier", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byWheelsDennis McNabb had just started thinking about buying a roomier car last year when he suddenly had no choice. A heavy storm rolled across Texas and dropped golf-ball-size hail that pummeled his 2013 Hyundai Genesis and punched holes in the sedan\u2019s windows.Another shock came when Mr. McNabb, a firefighter from San Antonio, saw the sticker prices of new cars. The Toyota 4Runner sport utility vehicle had caught his eye, but 2016 models were more than $40,000 when loaded up with the heated seats, touch screen and other options that he wanted.Mr. McNabb quickly found a solution: a used 2014 4Runner with 38,000 miles that cost him just $29,750 and came with a one-year warranty.\u201cThe new ones are fairly expensive, and you lose about a third of the value as soon as you drive it off the lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 2014 is pretty much fully loaded, and it\u2019s practically the same car as the 2016, but way less. Kind of a no-brainer.\u201dThat\u2019s also more than many consumers can or want to pay. The result is that used cars, especially the nearly new models that were leased or turned in by their original buyers, represent increasingly enticing deals.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to beat the value of a late-model used car,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com. Depreciation is one of the biggest costs of owning a car, she noted. \u201cIf you buy a used car with low mileage, someone else has already taken the depreciation hit, so it\u2019s a very smart way to get a car.\u201dNew-car prices are rising as automakers add more technology. Features like rear cameras, radar sensors, collision-preventing automatic braking systems and Bluetooth are now standard in most new cars and trucks. Americans\u2019 preference for S.U.V.s and other larger vehicles is also pushing prices higher compared with the days when less expensive small cars were more in vogue.Consumers aren\u2019t the only ones seeing opportunities in used vehicles. In Jackson, Mich., 80 miles west of Detroit, Wes Lutz has just built a 5,000-square-foot addition to his Chrysler Dodge Jeep franchise to accommodate his expanding used-car sales.\u201cWe\u2019ve hired salespeople and managers because there\u2019s a lot of demand for used cars,\u201d Mr. Lutz said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a $33,000 price for new, you can get a similar car for half the price. That\u2019s a great deal, especially for people who don\u2019t drive that much, or first-time car buyers.\u201dMr. Lutz estimates that he\u2019ll soon be selling 200 or more used cars a month, up from the 130 he typically sold per month last year.\u201cMore people will look at used if they\u2019ve got peace of mind that you\u2019re getting a fair price,\u201d said Marc Cannon, AutoNation\u2019s vice president of marketing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential in the used business, and we think this is what consumers want.\u201dSales of certified pre-owned cars rose 4 percent from 2015, to a record 2.6 million vehicles in 2016, according to Edmunds.com. Those are cars that are less than three years old, generally have under 50,000 miles, and have been inspected and serviced by a franchise dealer. They usually come with an extension to the original warranty. That\u2019s the type of deal Mr. McNabb got on his 4Runner.Like new-car prices, used prices have also been rising, to an average of $19,189 in 2016, according to Edmunds.com. But analysts think used prices will ease because inventories are rising. This year, about 3.5 million cars that were leased for two or three years will be returned and sold as gently used cars, Ms. Caldwell, the Edmunds.com analyst, said.One caveat about buying pre-owned cars is that they are usually not subject to the rebates and discounts manufacturers typically offer on new cars. Also, even cars that are only a year or two old may not have the latest technology. So it pays to shop carefully.Joe Codiroli, a Defense Department consultant in Richmond, Va., discovered that last month when he looked for a bargain on a slightly used Subaru Forester. He wanted to get a model with EyeSight, Subaru\u2019s safety electronics system, which includes advanced cruise control with automatic braking and blind-spot warning technology. The used Foresters he found didn\u2019t have those features.On top of that, he found that Subaru was offering zero-percent financing on the 2017 Forester. He picked out a reddish one \u2014 a color Subaru calls \u201cVenetian pearl.\u201d\u201cIt came down to a few thousand dollars\u2019 difference between new and used,\u201d Mr. Codiroli said. \u201cSo the value for the extra features and the zero-percent swayed me to go with new.\u201dAnd he\u2019s glad he opted for the latest safety electronics. \u201cIf a car cuts in front of me on the highway, it just slows down nice and easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal. It\u2019s easier to drive, and I feel a lot safer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May\u2019s Letter Invoking Article 50", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byDear President Tusk,On 23 June last year, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. As I have said before, that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans. Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states. On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper. Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe \u2014 and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.Earlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March.Today, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom\u2019s intention to withdraw from the European Union. In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom\u2019s intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community.This letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty\u2019s Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy \u2014 as your closest friend and neighbour \u2014 with the European Union once we leave. We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too.It is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side. We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union.The Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union \u2014 and indeed from third countries around the world \u2014 as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.I would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom.As I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament \u2014 the European Communities Act 1972 \u2014 that gives effect to EU law in our country. This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the \u201cacquis\u201d) into UK law. This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom. The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation, and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow. We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union, also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty, in particular for businesses. We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union, and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave.From the start and throughout the discussions, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so. When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.The United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation. To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.If, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms. In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.It is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats. And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent.Looking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible.As I have said, the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation. At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens. Likewise, Europe\u2019s security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake. The United Kingdom\u2019s objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February.We recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions \u2014 close regulatory alignment, trust in one another\u2019s institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades. It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty.The task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us. After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy. Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK\u2019s rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent.Advertisement"}

But nothing really cut it in the repertory program, which ended with one of Mr. Wheeldon\u2019s weaker efforts, \u201cFool\u2019s Paradise\u201d \u2014 essentially, a constellation of sculptural couplings with shimmering confetti and fog. The evening felt like one long beige dance with a workout in between. How was this a gala show?\u201cRomeo\u201d lacks heart, but it\u2019s still the main event of the Joffrey\u2019s New York season. It\u2019s not a promising sign when Romeo and Juliet lock eyes across a crowded ballroom and their expressions read as, \u201cHey.\u201dBut that\u2019s what happened when Christine Rocas, as Juliet, and Rory Hohenstein, as Romeo, took each other in.Mr. Pastor\u2019s three-act production, choreographed in 2008 for the Scottish Ballet and set to Prokofiev, takes place over three time periods in Italy: Mussolini\u2019s reign in the 1930s, the Vespa-happy 1950s and the corruption-ridden Berlusconi \u201990s. The implication may be that while political climates change, the choices of older generations still shape the lives of the younger; love and its troubles remain the same.In each act the stage was altered with projections of Italian scenes and changing sets. But the shifts felt like a trick, as if replacing the scenery would distract us from noticing not only how ridiculous the era-shifting premise was, but also how lacking much of the cast was in charisma. Yoshihisa Arai did deliver an intermittently vibrant Mercutio.Unfortunately, the ballet was confusing as well, especially when Juliet in the third act, or the 1990s, was still at war with her father over an arranged marriage. And there was the rigidly cartoonish Capulet, played by the towering Fabrice Calmels. For a solid chunk of time, I thought he was Tybalt \u2014 and then maybe Paris? In the balcony scene, an assault of dreamy embraces, Juliet\u2019s staircase was replaced by a glass elevator; as she gazed into the moonlight and descended, she looked like a tourist at the Marriott Marquis.Mr. Pastor\u2019s \u201cRomeo\u201d had a good deal of \u201cWest Side Story\u201d in it, especially in group dances that called for a jazzy use of the hips and off-balance extensions. Here, the Capulets were hard-liners battering the stage with militaristic fury and raised fists. The Montagues, against dictatorship, at least in the 1930s, were more peaceful and lush in their movement. After a fight between the feuding camps, the dancers collectively fell to the floor. Juliet, in a white dress, walked slowly across the stage littered with bodies.The story of Romeo and Juliet has been told in different ways, but in ballet its success or failure always comes down to the leading dancers. Even when a production of \u201cRomeo\u201d is cluttered with gimmicks, a persuasive lead couple can overcome the excess. This tepid pairing gave us a serviceable Juliet in Ms. Rocas and a wooden, mechanical Romeo in Mr. Hohenstein. Where was the urgency?Now the Joffrey\u2019s vision is decidedly ordinary: It seems to have turned into just another repertory company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peugeot Maker\u2019s Deal for G.M.\u2019s Opel Faces Political Headwinds", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Turning a French carmaker and its German rival into a global auto giant would be tough under any circumstances. But the deal by PSA Group of France on Monday to buy General Motors\u2019 Opel and Vauxhall brands has the added complexity of politics.Politicians have become acutely aware of how corporate decisions can create the resentments toward immigration and globalization that fed Donald J. Trump\u2019s rise in the United States, contributed to Britain\u2019s vote last year to leave the European Union, and nourished far-right politicians in France and Germany.To make the deal work, PSA will have to navigate elected officials and labor leaders in three countries where it has big plants \u2014 Britain, France and Germany. The focus of the deal has already been centered on saving jobs. In a conversation on Sunday with Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, the British prime minister emphasized the need to protect the plants and the homegrown brand, Vauxhall.Car companies provide particularly fertile ground for nationalist appeals. The closing of a car factory is often devastating for the surrounding community, and it can fall hardest on less-educated, lower-income workers who feel neglected by elites and victimized by global finance.\u201cWhat better industry to express a view of \u2018France first\u2019 than the auto industry?\u201d said David J. Herman, who was chief executive of Opel in the 1990s. Making the acquisition work, he said, \u201cis going to be excruciatingly difficult.\u201dAt a time when European unity is under threat, the sale of Opel to PSA could strain relations among Britain, France and Germany as they try to ensure that any pain is imposed in someone else\u2019s backyard. PSA\u2019s Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn factories are concentrated in France, while the biggest Opel and Vauxhall factories are in Germany and Britain.It is difficult to see how PSA\u2019s takeover of Opel, which would create the second-largest carmaker in Europe after Volkswagen, could succeed without major job cuts and, probably, shutting some factories. Opel has not been profitable since the 1990s, and both companies have more factories than they need. Unused factory space is deadly to a car company\u2019s bottom line because it requires expensive upkeep without producing revenue.\u201cThe idea is that this deal makes a strong second to VW,\u201d Mr. Herman said, \u201cbut they\u2019ve got to make money.\u201dThe two British plants, with the Opel and Vauxhall brands, could be particularly vulnerable to political and economic forces. Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union means that cars exported to the Continent could face substantial tariffs.\u201cTavares is talking about saving $2 billion,\u201d said Peter Wells, an automotive expert at Cardiff University in Wales, referring to the chairman of the managing board of PSA, Carlos Tavares. \u201cIt has to come from somewhere.\u201dThe pressure on automakers had made the industry a point of contention in the discussion over a so-called Brexit.\u201cThe uncertainty caused by Brexit is harming the U.K. auto sector,\u201d said Len McCluskey, general secretary of the union Unite, which represents many British autoworkers. \u201cWe need assistance from the government to give this sector a fighting chance.\u201dSuch cases have prompted Mrs. May to speak of an industrial policy, repudiating years of Conservative Party free-market doctrine.In January, the prime minister announced \u201ca modern industrial strategy\u201d as part of her plan to prepare Britain for a future outside the European Union. The government will no longer be laissez-faire, she said, but will be \u201cstepping up to a new, active role that backs business.\u201dThe French government has backed PSA\u2019s acquisition of Opel, a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy economy. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande commended the alliance on Monday as the \u201cbirth of a European champion of the automotive industry.\u201dThe deal represents a remarkable turnaround for PSA, which had a record loss just four years ago. Freed of constraints imposed by G.M., Opel may be able to establish a stronger presence in Asia and South America, potentially allowing the company to reduce its heavy reliance on the slow-growing European market.But Opel will require work. In a reflection of the troubles, G.M. is selling its European operations for just $2.3 billion, and it is taking a charge of up to $4.5 billion as it books a paper loss from the deal. (PSA is spending about $1.85 billion, with BNP Paribas kicking in the rest in exchange for part of the financial group.)\u201cWe think, with humility, but with a certain trust, that we can help Opel to accelerate its economic reconstruction,\u201d Mr. Tavares told reporters at a news conference on Monday. \u201cWe see that there\u2019s a similarity between the difficulties Opel is going through today and PSA\u2019s situation three, four years ago.\u201dThe French government has already demonstrated that, at least during an election year, it will intervene to protect jobs. The Hollande administration threatened several years ago to nationalize an ailing steel plant run by ArcelorMittal to stem possible job losses, and it prevented Yahoo from taking a majority stake in a French company, Dailymotion.When Alstom tried to shut down a train factory in the working-class city of Belfort in the autumn, Mr. Hollande, who had come under fire for France\u2019s high unemployment rate, reacted with fury. Although the company vowed that the factory\u2019s 400 jobs would be relocated to a larger site in northern France, the government insisted that the site remain open, and it then placed a multibillion-euro order for trains to keep the operation running.Mr. Tavares of PSA emphasized several times on Monday that the Opel deal was not based on job cuts. \u201cShutting down a plant is rather simplistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that protects us is performance.\u201dBut politics cannot defy economics forever. Without growth, PSA will have no choice but to cut costs.Stanley Reed contributed reporting from London and Liz Alderman and Beno\u00eet Morenne from Paris.Advertisement"}

Bush and Barack Obama years, with the collusion of congressional leaders, they shut down everyone else\u2019s attempts to fix it.Together they are pushing an old nativists\u2019 dream: a \u201cself-deportation\u201d strategy, also called \u201cattrition through enforcement,\u201d which envisions making America whiter by making life intolerable for unauthorized immigrants. Their crackdown is hurting not only those here illegally but also refugees, asylum seekers, even students and guest workers.Nobody, actually. But that\u2019s what he said. Mr. Trump has made his ignorance, or cynicism, quite clear. He doesn\u2019t know or care how immigration works. He doesn\u2019t understand the damage his wall and deportation surge will do to the economy and the American character, or maybe he just cares more about harnessing bigotry.That is why Mr. King \u2014 and his journey from the fringe \u2014 matters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico, Mired in Debt, Has a New Rescue Plan", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byPuerto Rico, reeling from a debt crisis lasting more than a year, reached an agreement Monday that should set the stage for meaningful talks with its creditors, who hold more than $70 billion of defaulted debt.Under the agreement, new taxes will be imposed but public workers will be spared from furloughs for now, a measure that had been on the table.The island\u2019s federally appointed oversight board voted unanimously to approve an amended plan, submitted by Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, for restoring fiscal solvency over the next 10 years. Approving the governor\u2019s plan spared the seven-member board from having to impose an austerity plan that probably would have caused an outcry on the island.\u201cIt\u2019s essentially the same plan I submitted, except for the economic baseline numbers,\u201d Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said in a telephone interview after the meeting. \u201cThe board approved our plan, conditioned on us meeting some milestones.\u201dThose \u201cmilestones\u201d remain significant hurdles for the island\u2019s government. But while the government works to meet them, it can now show creditors a board-certified document explaining how much cash is available to repay the large debt, and where the cash is going to come from.As the island\u2019s financial troubles have worsened in recent years, its audited financial statements and cash flow reports became unavailable, making meaningful restructuring talks impossible. And time was running out. Under a special federal law for insolvent United States territories, Puerto Rico has court protection from its creditors until May 1. Some have already tried to sue to recover their money.The governor\u2019s fiscal plan includes enough belt-tightening to cause an annual economic contraction of 2 to 3 percent \u2014 a bite that residents of the island will almost certainly resent. But that is nothing like the 17 percent economic contraction the board had warned about earlier this year, in a document describing a worst-case scenario.To get the board\u2019s provisional approval, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said he had to find ways to come up with $160 million more in government revenue than he had in a previous version of the plan, which was rejected by the board Thursday. The oversight board warned him then that his original version was \u201cunrealistic,\u201d leading to marathon discussions over the weekend.The governor\u2019s new measures include higher traffic fines, an increase in an excise tax on tobacco products, a tax on insurance, and the extension of an existing tax break for manufacturers on the island.But the governor remained unwilling to bend in three contentious areas: how much to cut pensions for retired government workers; whether to constrain the current public work force to two- and four-day workweeks to save money; and whether to stop paying all public workers a Christmas bonus, in light of the fact that bondholders are not being paid.Mr. Rossell\u00f3 had especially opposed any furlough, saying it would hurt the economy too much.\u201cA reduction of 30 percent of the work force represents 45,000 people in Puerto Rico,\u201d he said. Reducing the work force by that much could cause a 9 percent economic contraction, he said.The board agreed to avoid furloughs for six months to give Mr. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s revenue measures a chance to start working. If the measures are not considered effective enough by October, the board will consider carrying out some type of furlough.The governor also opposed the board\u2019s recommendation that retired public workers\u2019 pensions be cut by about 10 percent to make the retirement system sustainable. He had called for 3 percent cuts.In the board\u2019s meeting in New York on Monday, it amended the governor\u2019s plan so work could begin immediately on converting the existing pension system to a pay-as-you-go system, in which the retirees\u2019 benefits will be paid directly out of the government\u2019s general fund. The size of the cuts was not specified, but board members said no retirees would be pushed below the poverty line.The governor\u2019s plan would end that practice. In addition, it calls for newly hired public workers to be enrolled in Social Security, and for current public workers younger than 40 to enroll \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201dThe board was established by an act of Congress last year to guide Puerto Rico through a restructuring of its more than $70 billion of debt. Puerto Rico amassed the debt by borrowing year after year to give the appearance of having balanced its budget.Before any restructuring can start, Puerto Rico was legally required to produce a credible plan for bringing its budget back into balance. Mr. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s government had already requested the maximum allowable time extensions, and if no credible plan had been submitted by Saturday, the board was required to impose one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In New York, Bringing Broadband to Everyone by 2018", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byHALCOTT, N.Y. \u2014 It\u2019s about 15 miles from here to a dairy testing facility in Roxbury, or about one hour and 20 minutes round trip if you know these dusty mountain back roads like Chris DiBenedetto, a dairy farmer. He has been going back and forth for years, ferrying a sample of fresh milk for a federally mandated drug test before he can start processing each batch.But what stressed him the most were the valuable daylight farming hours lost to the journey, while he was stuck in his car or waiting for the results.Now, Mr. DiBenedetto gives a sample to a driver heading that way to do the drop-off, letting the new fiber wiring hanging over his old route do the simple document delivery for him via email.The dairy farmer in this speck of a town about 140 miles north of New York City was one of the first beneficiaries of an ambitious initiative to extend broadband to every household in the state by 2018 \u2014 no matter how rural or far-flung the address \u2014 which would make New York the first state to reach that high-speed internet milestone.For years, this town was like many isolated spots in New York and across the country, left sitting on the shoulders of the digital highway unable to access the broadband speeds that so many businesses and households count on. But now under a state-led program, towns like Halcott, with fewer than 300 residents, are getting wired, giving residents faster access to the internet and opening new opportunities for businesses.Two Stones Farm, a small goat farm here, has created an online store to offer more products, including artisanal cheese. \u201cI look at it this way: It\u2019s very much like electricity was at one time,\u201d said Alan White, 54, who owns Two Stones Farm with his wife. \u201cElectricity would have never come to our valley if it was based strictly on population. It\u2019s not a luxury. It\u2019s a necessity that we need to operate.\u201dThe problem is worse in poorer and rural areas: At least 30 percent of people in Mississippi and Arkansas do not have access to broadband, and sparsely populated states like Montana have similar access rates.The challenge in the United States is that it has vast tracts of sparsely populated regions where the cost of laying new fiber and cable wiring for broadband significantly outweighs the profits \u2014 39 percent of Americans living in rural areas lack broadband access, compared with 4 percent of those living in cities, according to the F.C.C.Under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s \u201cBroadband for All\u201d initiative, New York\u2019s program is one of the most aggressive broadband expansions in the country, and is designed to help stem any losses a private company incurs through what is known as a reverse auction process.Using data from the Federal Communications Commission to identify both unserved and underserved areas, the program divides the state into census blocks. The state then auctions off grant money for each census block, awarding the financing to the private company that seeks the lowest state subsidy.The system has attracted different providers, including major telecommunication companies like Fairpoint and Frontier, as well as smaller utilities like Middleburgh Telephone Company, known as Midtel, and Margaretville Telephone Company.Along the two-lane roads winding through Delaware County in the Catskills, Midtel trucks are following a path similar to one they took years ago, threading fiber optic cables for broadband across the valley.\u201cAll the served, underserved and unserved areas don\u2019t end up in a nice row,\u201d said Jim Becker, the president of the company, which has existed for more than a century and is still overseen by his 94-year-old grandmother, Marge Becker. \u201cSometimes you have to build through somewhat of a served area to get to an unserved, and vice versa.\u201dTurning on broadband can transform lives in rural places.Here in Halcott, a hamlet in the Catskills, the broadband has allowed Mr. DiBenedetto to broaden his business online \u2014 a yogurt company in Brooklyn recently contacted him about a single source contract. His daughter, Elena, was able to help out on the farm while getting a master\u2019s degree online.\u201cIn today\u2019s technology-driven world, access to high-speed internet is essential to building strong communities, growing the economy and supporting our everyday lives,\u201d Governor Cuomo said. \u201cNew York is leading the nation with the largest state broadband investment program in history \u2014 ensuring high-speed internet access for all residents, especially those in rural areas, and empowering students, entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive in our global economy.\u201dUnder New York\u2019s program, providers must offer 100 mbps speed \u2014 fast enough to download a movie in high definition in 90 seconds \u2014 for $60 a month. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the F.C.C., acknowledging that it was a reasonable price given that prices elsewhere could be much higher. \u201cBut if you\u2019re really poor, can you afford it? I don\u2019t know. If you are a poor rural person living in Appalachia, that\u2019s a big bite out of your budget.\u201dBut many rural businesses in New York have jumped at the chance for faster internet.About an hour from Halcott lies the Beaverkill Valley Inn, a historic hotel sitting on the banks of the Beaver Kill river, a world-famous fly-fishing spot in Lew Beach, N.Y. There\u2019s no cellphone service, so for years the inn and its guests shared a satellite internet connection.\u201cWe were competing with our guests\u2019 need and our own need to do business,\u201d said Kathy Bryant, one of the inn\u2019s managers. She noted that despite a sprawling property well suited for corporate retreats and meetings, the inn was unable to attract such business because of its limited internet.After years of pleading with local officials and telecommunications providers for a broadband connection, the inn was connected to high-speed internet by the Margaretville Telephone Company last August. Today, flush with retreats, weddings and guests spending an extra day or so \u201cworking from home,\u201d the inn just had the most successful year in its 120-year history.\u201cNow, we just reassure them that they can still unplug while they\u2019re up here,\u201d Ms. Bryant said with a laugh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Fed Raises Rates, Credit Card Holders Feel It First", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byGet ready to pay more to borrow.The typical credit card holder who is carrying a balance will quickly see annual interest charges rise to 16.75 percent from 16.5 percent. Rates on auto loans and home equity loans will also creep higher, as will mortgage rates, albeit over a longer period of time.\u201cIt will be a direct pass-through to credit card holders,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst with Bankrate.com. \u201cThis is a rising tide that lifts all boats, and you\u2019re going to feel it in equal magnitude wherever you sit on the credit spectrum.\u201dStill, rather than focusing on the the Fed\u2019s increase, experts have been warning that the long-term trajectory for borrowing costs will steadily move higher, especially if the central bank follows through on signals that it will raise rates twice more this year.But although almost all borrowers will be affected, some will feel it much more than others. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s likely to play out.According to Mr. McBride, credit card costs are directly tied to the prime rate, which in turn is linked to the federal funds rate. The latter is what the Fed increased Wednesday. As both these rates move higher, so will the adjustable annual interest rate on credit cards.Over all, the Fed\u2019s increase \u2014 a quarter point \u2014 is small, and it still leaves short-term borrowing costs near historical lows.The extra quarter-point\u2019s impact is small for now, equaling about $42 per year on that typical balance. But if the Fed moves two more times this year, that will add another $85 annually for the typical family that carries a balance on its cards.The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third consecutive quarter.Unlike credit card terms, which move according to short-term interest rates, mortgage rates generally follow the trajectory of the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds. Bond yields have been moving higher, partly because of the Fed\u2019s intention to tighten monetary policy, but mostly because of indicators that the economy is getting stronger and the possibility that government borrowing will soar under President Trump.Mortgage rates have already run up sharply since the election \u2014 rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage now stand at about 4.25 percent, up from 4 percent late last year and 3.75 percent in early November, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.Guy Cecala, the company\u2019s chief executive and publisher, said that investors had expected the Fed to raise rates, which meant to a degree that the increase was already built into the market and mortgage rates. \u201cBut it\u2019s not lock step, and the Fed is a relatively minor factor in determining mortgage rates,\u201d he said.On the other hand, homeowners who have borrowed against properties using a home equity line of credit will feel a pinch much sooner. These rates are variable and will most likely rise by a quarter-point after a Fed move. With a typical balance equaling $30,000, that adds about $6.25 in monthly interest payments.Still, even if home buyers won\u2019t really be put out by a single Fed move in March, tighter monetary policy and rising bond yields will gradually make mortgages significantly more expensive in the months ahead.And because the outstanding balances of mortgages are so much larger than they are for credit cards or home-equity loans, the ultimate impact of higher mortgage rates is much more noticeable. For example, a rise of one percentage point on a mortgage of $500,000 will lift interest payments by nearly $5,000 in the first year of the loan.As a result, more borrowers are looking at adjustable-rate mortgages, which lock in rates initially, but then let them float after five, seven or 10 years. Rates on five-year adjustable rate mortgage are about a full percentage point below what a 30-year fixed mortgage costs.\u201cWe\u2019ve been spoiled,\u201d said Mr. Cecala, noting that during the housing boom before the recession, 30-year mortgage rates stood at 6 percent. He doesn\u2019t expect a return to that level anytime soon, but he does expect rates on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage to hit 5 percent in 2018.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that mortgage rates are heading to 5 percent or higher,\u201d Mr. Cecala said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of when.\u201dAlthough car loans will also get slightly more expensive, the quarter-point rise in financing costs comes on top of relatively low borrowing rates to begin with. Currently, consumers pay about 4.3 percent annually for a loan on a new car, while the rate on loans for used cars stands at 5 percent, according to Bankrate.com.\u201cThe good news is that there is still intense competition in the auto lending landscape,\u201d Mr. McBride of Bankrate said. \u201cEven with rates moving up, plenty of people are finding loans for 3 percent a year or lower.\u201dWhat is more, as car loans are nowhere near the size of mortgages, the impact of the quarter-point increase is slight. The cost of a $25,000 auto loan looks to rise by just $3 a month.Returns for savers, unlike those for stock market investors, have never recovered from the financial crisis of 2008 and the recession, when overall interest rates plunged. Short-term rates have crept higher since the Federal Reserve embarked on its path to normalize monetary policy in December 2015, but savers wouldn\u2019t know that: The typical savings account currently pays 0.1 percent per year.\u201cIf it goes from 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent, who cares?\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting at your existing bank for better yields to land in your lap, you\u2019re going to be disappointed.\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t mean yield-starved savers have to settle for next to nothing. Mr. McBride notes that a handful of banks pay more \u2014 much more \u2014 on savings and money-market accounts. For example, PurePoint Financial offers a 1.25 percent yield on savings accounts with a minimum of $10,000 in assets, while Popular Direct pays 1.15 percent on savings accounts with at least $5,000.PurePoint is a unit of MUFG Union Bank, whose Japanese parent is among the largest financial institutions in the world, and Popular Direct is an affiliate of the Puerto Rico-based Banco Popular. Both institutions get high ratings for safety and soundness from Bankrate.com.In addition to earning more now, savers at these institutions will also see yields rise more quickly if the Fed continues to nudge rates higher in the months ahead.\u201cTo see an improvement, you have to have your money at one of the banks that\u2019s paying the best yields,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to play in the right sandbox.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Briefly Tumble After Health Care Overhaul Falters", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byFor a time on Monday, one question appeared to haunt stock market investors from Tokyo to Manhattan: Will President Trump be able to live up to his promises to reduce taxes and cut regulation?Belief in such business-friendly, pro-growth measures has been driving a rally in stocks since the November election. But a weekend\u2019s worth of second-guessing over Washington\u2019s failure to move forward on health care legislation has injected some skepticism into the market.\u201cFriday\u2019s health care outcome was a reality check for investors,\u201d Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer at the Bessemer Trust, a $63 billion private investment company, said in an email.The market had seemed almost immune to political turmoil. For months, declines of 1 percent or more were unknown. Stocks sagged last week, however, amid signs of political obstacles to the replacement of the Affordable Care Act, and they opened sharply lower on Monday. The market recovered to end the day little changed.The health care legislation by itself had not been seen as of huge significance to the markets. But traders and longer-term investors said Monday that the bill\u2019s failure was worrisome. Corporate and individual tax changes, a $1 trillion infrastructure investment and other items on the Trump agenda that have goosed the markets may now prove illusory, they added.\u201cThe inability for him to pass health care reform casts doubt upon his ability to get large-scale tax reform passed,\u201d said Erin Browne, head of macro-investing for the O\u2019Connor hedge fund division of the Swiss bank UBS.Because the health care legislation was needed to help make tax cuts work within the current budget, the market is \u201cnow looking at either a much more modest tax reform or at tax cuts, which are certainly not going to be as economically beneficial,\u201d Ms. Browne said.Other markets suggested that many were unsettled by Mr. Trump\u2019s crash course in political science.The United States dollar, as measured by a Bloomberg index that tracks it against other major world currencies, fell to a level unseen since days after the president\u2019s upset victory in the election. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 which falls when more people buy the notes, often as they gravitate toward lower-risk investments \u2014 sank to its lowest levels in a month.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which fell as much as 1 percent on Monday, ended the day down just 0.1 percent. Since Election Day, the S.&P. 500 is up more than 9 percent.The narrower Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.2 percent lower for its first eight-session losing streak since 2011 and only the third such streak since 1990, the Bespoke Investment Group said.The Nasdaq composite index closed up 0.2 percent.Overseas markets were generally lower, with Tokyo down 1.4 percent and London off 0.6 percent.The truth, Ms. Patterson of Bessemer said in her email, is that \u201clegislation is a tricky, messy process.\u201dIn some corners of the market, that acknowledgment has had a particularly sobering effect. Certain sectors that had reached stratospheric levels of late on hopes of promised regulatory rollbacks and other propulsive policy measures are now tumbling to earth.Shares of Wall Street banks and other financial companies, which have benefited from Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to reconsider the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and are now down sharply since early March, are one example. Energy stocks, which have been harmed by the lack of detail on Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans and by falling oil prices, have also slid.One beneficiary of the failed health care bill? Hospital operators like HCA. Its shares surged more than 5 percent Monday.Some investors, of course, have simply decided to pocket the gains they have already earned in stocks. Others are liquidating positions to diminish their exposure to risk during a period many expect will remain volatile.Ms. Browne, for one, said she had sold out of certain positions in the last week and would keep the proceeds out of the markets for now.\u201cOver the shorter term, I\u2019m more cautious because I think the market needs to adjust to a potentially lower speed of the economy,\u201d she said.She added, however, that it was important not to overstate the meaning of the recent policy hiccups, saying, \u201cThe outlook over the medium to longer term is still quite strong.\u201dThe postelection rise in stock prices itself may have been the outlier event \u2014 not the recent retreat.Many traders have spent recent weeks watching for signs of market weakness, waiting for a trigger event that would cause an expected downturn of 1 to 2 percent. Some placed wagers in the market intended to pay off if stocks began a substantial slide. To them, the question was when, not if.Jason Ader, the chief executive and chief investment officer of the activist stock investment firm Spring Owl Asset Management, is taking the last week in stride.This pullback \u201cis warranted, healthy and normal,\u201d Mr. Ader said by email.\u201cIf the Trump administration\u2019s pro-business, pro-growth agenda hits a bump, the alternative isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d he added, given that the stock market has also been \u201cfavorably disposed\u201d at times of political gridlock as long as interest rates remain relatively low.Even with more interest rate increases expected this year, the cost of borrowing remains within a historically low range. Corporate earnings have been solid. Growth indicators in Asia and Europe, and in the United States, have been encouraging, all of which argues for continued optimism in the market.It may even be a good window in which to buy.\u201cAs long as the broader economic trends are intact, which we think they are, these sell-offs are usually a great opportunity for investors looking to put cash to work,\u201d Ms. Patterson said.An earlier version of a graphic with this article misstated the years represented. They are 2016 and 2017, not 2006 and 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Equal Pay for Men and Women? Iceland Wants Employers to Prove It", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byThe rally was part of a groundswell for income equality that galvanized tens of thousands of women across this tiny island nation, where protests often produce change.The government wants to change that dynamic. Iceland on Tuesday became the first country to introduce legislation requiring employers to prove they are paying men and women equally.Iceland has had equal pay laws for half a century, pushing companies and the government to gradually reduce the pay gap. But the thinking behind the new legislation is that unless the laws are applied more forcefully, the imbalance may never really close.\u201cWe want to break down the last of the gender barriers in the workplace,\u201d said Thorsteinn Viglundsson, Iceland\u2019s social affairs and equality minister. \u201cHistory has shown that if you want progress, you need to enforce it.\u201dMs. Valdimarsdottir, the women\u2019s rights advocate, quit her home-care job for the municipality of Reykjavik.She had discovered that an accountant for the municipality was paid four times as much as Ms. Valdimarsdottir was for her management role overseeing a 10-person team providing home care services, comprising mostly women. Later, the city adjusted the salary for her former position to be nearly equal with the accountant\u2019s, and raised salaries for the other workers.\u201cCompanies should do this for their own benefit and the benefit of their employees,\u201d said Halldor Thorbergsson, the director general for the Confederation of Icelandic Employers. \u201cBut it should not be legalized.\u201dIcelandic women have long argued that equality needs a national push.The new rules would require the biggest companies and government agencies to undergo audits, starting in 2018, and to obtain a certification of compliance with equal pay rules. Businesses with over 25 employees must comply by 2022.Employers must assess every job, from cleaner to senior executive, to identify and fix wage gaps of more than 5 percent.Although the process requires time and money, Arni Kristinsson, the managing director of BSI Iceland, a standards auditor that performs some of the fair pay reviews, said those costs were not insurmountable.\u201cThe question is, are companies committed?\u201d he said. \u201cAt firms that are, we are already seeing the pay gap narrow\u201d to as little as 3 percent.The audits revealed other workplace inequalities linked to pay. At the Icelandic Customs agency, which participated in the pilot program, officials found that salaries were lower when women were employed as a large group.About 80 percent of Iceland\u2019s uniformed customs agents are men, a group paid 30 percent more than customs tax collectors, who are mostly women. The agents work longer hours and face challenges like inspecting cargo for drugs, so the review found the pay system was justified, said Snorri Olsen, Iceland\u2019s Customs director. But the review also spurred a reassessment of the gender balance in each group.The agency is now trying to recruit more men for office work and more women into the higher-paid agent jobs, partly by shortening shifts to accommodate women who have child care demands, Mr. Olsen said.\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to look at work usually done by men as more valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is technically a discussion of equal pay, but it\u2019s really a question about equality in our society.\u201dThe audits help promote self-reflection, even among female managers, about the potential for unconscious bias anywhere.\u201cYou\u2019d be sitting there doing the interview, and they\u2019d ask for less,\u201d Ms. Kristjansdottir said. \u201cThe audit showed this was a flaw in our recruitment, that we were allowing this to happen and didn\u2019t quite realize it.\u201dFor Mr. Viglundsson, the government official, the fact that larger equality issues surface in the debate over equal pay is justification enough for the legislative proposal.\u201cWhen it comes to the workplace, men have enjoyed a certain level of privilege for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you look at the vested interests for society of eliminating discrimination against women, that far outweighs any regulatory burden.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gunman Is Killed in Orly Airport in France After Attacking a Soldier", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 An attack on a soldier at Orly Airport near here on Saturday is being treated as a possible act of terrorism, according to the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office. The assailant, the prosecutor said, had carried out a burst of violence over a period of two hours before being fatally shot.The Paris prosecutor, Fran\u00e7ois Molins, said the motives of the assailant \u2014 identified as 39-year-old Ziyed Ben Belgacem \u2014 were unknown. But the prosecutor added that Mr. Belgacem had a lengthy police record, including arrests for robbery and drug-related offenses, and had served time in prison. He was known to the authorities, Mr. Molins said, but primarily as a criminal.The shooting at Orly prompted a partial evacuation of the airport, the diversion of all flights and a security sweep to determine whether the assailant had left any explosives at the airport\u2019s two terminals, officials said. Incoming flights were diverted to nearby Charles de Gaulle Airport.The chain of events began when Mr. Belgacem was stopped by the police at 6:55 a.m. in the Paris suburb of Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, after he was spotted driving at a high speed with his headlights off, Mr. Molins said at a news conference on Saturday evening.After he pulled over, Mr. Belgacem fired a pistol loaded with birdshot and fled. One police officer was slightly injured.Mr. Belgacem then drove to a bar in Vitry-sur-Seine, where he fired his gun again but did not injure anyone. When he exited the bar, he left his cellphone there.He fled in his car, but abandoned it a few miles away. He then carjacked another vehicle and drove about eight miles to the airport.There he spotted a three-soldier unit patrolling the airport, Mr. Molins said. At 8:22 a.m., Mr. Belgacem, carrying his pistol, tossed a container of gasoline on the floor. He grabbed one of the soldiers and held his gun to her head.Mr. Molins said the soldiers reported that he yelled: \u201cI\u2019m here to die in the name of Allah. Whatever happens, people are going to die.\u201dAs Mr. Belgacem grappled with the soldier, he wrested her rifle from her. At that instant, the two other soldiers fired three bursts from their weapons, killing him.Mr. Molins said the antiterrorism unit of the prosecutor\u2019s office and the French Intelligence Service had opened an investigation.Mr. Belgacem was carrying cigarettes, 750 euros in cash, or about $800, a lighter and a Quran at the time of the attack, Mr. Molins said. Cocaine, a machete and some foreign currency were later found at his home.Mr. Belgacem\u2019s brother, father and cousin were questioned by the police, Mr. Molins said.While in prison during 2011 and 2012, Mr. Belgacem was identified by intelligence officials as someone who had become radicalized. After his release, he remained on the authorities\u2019 radar, and his house was searched in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Mr. Molins said, although no action was taken against him.Any terrorist attack so close to the election, political analysts suggest, could be an opportunity by the candidates of the far right, Marine Le Pen, and the center right, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, to berate the current Socialist government and by association Emmanuel Macron, the center-left candidate, who was previously the economy minister, for failing to protect the French people.While both Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Fillon posted Twitter messages about Saturday\u2019s attack, they used the episode primarily as an opportunity to praise French soldiers and, in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s case, to underscore some of her campaign themes. She said in her post: \u201cViolence has overwhelmed France, a consequence of the laxity of successive governments. But there is the courage of our soldiers.\u201dMr. Fillon limited his Twitter message to praise the \u201cwomen and men\u201d of what is known as Operation Sentinel, the soldiers who \u201cwork for our security and have once again proved their courage and efficiency.\u201dThe unit attacked at the airport was part of Operation Sentinel, whose 7,000 soldiers patrol public areas, including airports, tourist attractions and train stations.The west terminal at Orly reopened by 1 p.m., the Paris airport authority said. Flights gradually resumed at the south terminal, where the attack took place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Romania, Faith in Globalization Survives", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 A month ago, images of hundreds of thousands of Romanians protesting in front of the government building in Bucharest and in other Romanian cities started to spread around the world. It may have seemed just another popular turn toward right-wing demagogy in a time of receding faith in democracy. But that is not the case.This protest movement is, in fact, a signal to the world that in this corner of Europe, democracy and its ideals are alive and well \u2014 that the civic fabric destroyed during decades of Communist oppression has healed, and the people want to perfect their democracy, not to weaken it.The protests are aimed at an emergency ordinance from the government that would have reversed a national campaign against corruption, in which Romania has achieved significant but incomplete victories in recent years. Graft and nepotism still exist, and are blamed for high levels of poverty, polarization, social and economic injustice; those, in turn, have sent millions of young Romanians fleeing to other parts of the European Union, the United States or Canada. Still, enough young Romanians remained to take over the streets in freezing cold, and ultimately they forced the government to abandon the infamous ordinance.These are not the first spontaneous protests here in the name of popular power. Those began three years ago with the end of the discredited presidency of Traian Basescu. They continued in opposition to attempts by foreign corporations to extract gold from Roman-era historic sites in the mountains of Transylvania. And they resumed against the government of the prime minister at the time, Victor Ponta, after a terrible fire in a Bucharest nightclub.What Romania has been experiencing is an anti-elite political outpouring with a fury that resembles what we see in Europe and America, but whose origins and goals are 180 degrees opposite. These Romanian \u201cindignados,\u201d as the protesters are called, are not the blue-collar, rural, anti-globalization disgruntled who voted for Brexit or helped Donald Trump\u2019s ascent to the White House. They are mainly young, urban, college-educated people with well-paid jobs at multinational corporations and banks, the main employers of local talent. So they are not protesting against globalization or the European Union. The solution they seek would be more globalization, a more solid Europe, more American and NATO involvement in our region. They are instinctively against any walls \u2014 physical or invisible \u2014 that may be erected in a vain effort to stop the free movement of people, ideas, capital or technology.Here, the tide of angry opinion rushes not toward fear of outsiders and tolerance for kleptocratic strongmen. It seeks instead to continue cleansing a political establishment still tied at many points to economic barons who divert public funding from desperately needed investments in health care, education and infrastructure. Such graft and cronyism are the very essence of their grievances.This attitude has historical, cultural and political roots. Romania sits on the fracture lines of Europe, where any shift in the geopolitical balance has an immediate effect on our interests. We have developed, during our tormented history, a collective early warning system that detects danger when the \u201cgrand game\u201d among great powers is afoot. This is such a moment, when NATO and the European Union \u2014 the pillars of our escape from our post-Communist drama to liberal democracy, rule of law and freedom \u2014 seem threatened at their cores. Unfortunately, in Central and Eastern Europe, illiberal and autocratic impulses have never quite died; indeed, they now feed some of our neighbors\u2019 strategic hedging and flirtations with Russia or China.But one thought unites the young urban protesters, many expatriates in our large diaspora, and all of our political parties: A strong Romania starts from within, with good governance and faith that our future lies with a strong, united West. So beyond the social, economic and moral drivers of discontent in our streets lies an understanding that for Romania to truly join the West, it must become stronger as a democracy, an economy and as a state \u2014 a goal for which corruption is a lethal virus.Nevertheless, this is a region where demagogues in Budapest and Warsaw have been making negative headlines, so it would be na\u00efve to think there is no echo at all of economic nationalism and authoritarianism among Romanians, particularly those in the less affluent, poverty-stricken small cities and the country\u2019s vast underdeveloped rural side. If President Trump would like to see real \u201ccarnage,\u201d he should visit the destitute former one-industry cities of Romania. Some of these people \u2014 and politicians \u2014 even believe that the huge demonstrations in Bucharest, Cluj, Timisoara and Iasi were orchestrated by George Soros, foreign corporations or the domestic intelligence service.But the multitudes with smartphones and torches who have packed Victoria Square in front of the government building know better. For them, the single impetus for their rebellion was the government\u2019s initial mistaken attempt to go easier on corruption. It was a spark, a challenge to their profound belief that Romania\u2019s vast potential is still being shortchanged by a corrupt and incompetent political elite. The protesters don\u2019t have a unifying ideology beyond the shared view that Romania\u2019s social and economic contract needs more work \u2014 and that the fish rots from the head. So there is one way and one way only for their country: more democracy, more transparency, more Westernization.This is the real accomplishment of those freezing and confusing days, far more important than the political issue at hand: A huge and influential part of Romania declared \u2014 at last \u2014 that we are an integral part of the democratic West. We should all cherish that.Mircea Geoana, a former Romanian foreign minister and ambassador to the United States, ran for president in 2009.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Renting Your Home Out, By the Hour", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported by360 ViewFor New Yorkers who want to make money off their apartments, but are reluctant to skip town to do it, these companies offer a viable alternative to vacation rentals. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wash your bedsheets, you don\u2019t have to find another place to sleep,\u201d said Yashar Nejati, 31, the founder of Thisopenspace, a company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that opened in New York last year. \u201cYou can rent out your space while you go run errands.\u201dSplacer, which started in Tel Aviv, has attracted 700 New York City listings since it entered the marketplace in 2014. A third of the spaces are residential, and the rest are commercial, like restaurants, galleries and warehouses. Peerspace, a San Francisco-based company, arrived in New York in November 2015 and now has 600 listings in this market, about 150 of which are residential. And about a third of Thisopenspace\u2019s 300 listings in the city are residential.The sites operate much like Airbnb. Hosts list their property online, uploading photographs, a description of the space and the rental price. All three companies charge hosts a commission. Peerspace and Thisopenspace charge the guests a fee, too. These companies are tapping into a trend that has become a hallmark of the so-called sharing economy: With a clever app and a smartphone, everyday objects in our lives can become viable revenue streams.\u201cYour apartment is standing vacant 14 hours a day,\u201d said Adi Biran, 45, who started Splacer in 2014 with Lihi Gerstner, 41. \u201cWhy not use it?\u201dUltimately, the debate about the merits of short-term rentals is not really about legal statutes, but about how people want their apartments, buildings and neighborhoods used. While supporters see short-term rentals as a relatively painless way to help pay the rent in an expensive city, critics argue that the trend turns homes into hotels. People who live next door to an apartment that is used for short-term rentals often complain about a rotating cast of endless guests diminishing their quality of life.So, as far as the neighbors are concerned, is a site like Peerspace really all that different from Airbnb? If your neighbor turns her living room into a venue for corporate retreats, the guests may leave at nightfall, but the vibe is still altered. \u201cIt used to be that you had a group of people, and this was going to be their homes, and they had a common interest in preserving it,\u201d Ms. Weisberg said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s gone.\u201dNot all parties go as planned. About a year ago, Ms. Story walked in the door of her townhouse at midnight to find that a party that was supposed to end at 10 p.m. was still going strong. Added to that, about 70 people were in her home, well over the 30-guest limit. \u201cI was like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Ms. Story recalled. \u201cThey were supposed to be in the cleanup phase. The guy gave me an attitude.\u201d The bathroom was flooded. Ms. Story insisted that the group pay for a maid service.All three companies provide liability insurance, and hosts can request that their guests leave a security deposit. While many hosts have renters or homeowners insurance, a residential policy may not cover damage from a commercial use. Corporate guests generally have insurance, too.She lists the space, with a hammock and a rope swing hanging in the living room, on all three sites for around $100 an hour. As for the potential for mishaps, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that you have to take when you do this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Is Turning 60 and Searching for Something to Celebrate", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Sixty years after the treaty that led to its founding, the European Union is under fundamental stress \u2014 divided and divergent, anxious that it no longer represents the future but the past, and that it may be incapable of handling the serious challenges of this already-turbulent century.Born 60 years ago in optimism that cooperation in trade would benefit all, the principle binding a union that has expanded from six nations to 28 has been solidarity \u2014 that difficulties would be faced together, that cooperation would bring the convergence of politics and economics and \u201can ever closer union.\u201dBut much of that conviction has turned out to be magical thinking. Somewhere along the line, the European Union lost its way.Many place the pivotal moment at the crossroads it encountered when the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet empire collapsed. Shortly after, the conversations were all about how to \u201cbroaden\u201d by adding new members, as Washington and London wanted, and also \u201cdeepen\u201d cooperation through new institutions. The bloc stumbled into trying both, imperiling growth and unity, even as it antagonized Russia.\u201cWhat was at the heart of European values and principles was this simple idea of solidarity, that we would help those countries with difficulties and stick together through challenging times,\u201d said Pierre Vimont, a former French ambassador and senior European Union official.\u201cIt seems to have gotten lost when we enlarged to the new states of Central and Eastern Europe, and we saw it in our treatment of Greece, too. There is a sense of harshness and division, a lack of solidarity. And if that simple idea is not there anymore, then we\u2019re in big trouble. If we don\u2019t have that, what\u2019s the use of going forward?\u201dThe main question facing the European Union, 60 years later, is one of reinvigoration. How can it recapture the optimism, restore the solidarity and reassure its core members while delivering economic opportunity to its poorer members and to its youth?That will not be easy. Today the enlarged European Union is poorer, more diverse and less united than ever. Its troubles are so numerous and structural that they threaten to undo the bloc.Britain, its second-largest economy and one of two nuclear powers, has voted to leave. The countries of Central Europe are flirting with authoritarianism and Russia. Candidate countries like Turkey and Serbia have lost enthusiasm. Even core countries, like France, Germany and the Netherlands, are dealing with strong populist movements that are fiercely anti-European Union.For many, the European Union no longer stands for democracy and a better future, but instead a hindrance to national identity and economic opportunity. It has created a powerful transnational bureaucracy that by its nature becomes enamored of bureaucratic solutions, creating an ethos of faceless clerks and late-night crisis meetings of national leaders, most of whom worry more about perceptions at home than solving the problems of their neighbors.Not all the problems the bloc faces are of its own making, but they need to be faced nonetheless. Mr. Vimont, now a visiting fellow at Carnegie Europe, sees the new strains as reflective of a more individualistic society, which has also become selfish and nationalistic.With the crises of migration, Greece and the British exit, which has been a body blow to the union, and the antagonism of the Polish and Hungarian governments toward migrants and basic freedoms, he said, \u201cthere is animosity and a lack of generosity, and a loss of the willingness among countries to find a way out when there is disagreement.\u201d\u201cWe overestimated the transformational effect of the European Union, both in new states but also in the old ones,\u201d Mr. Lehne said in an interview. \u201cAnd for the euro, too \u2014 the economic convergence assumption underlying the euro was flawed. It\u2019s not happening.\u201dThe strains from enlargement have inevitably changed the bloc, but are unlikely to destroy it, Mr. Lehne said. But the assumption that democracy can be gradually transferred to the European level has also proved to be illusory.The democratic deficit and underestimation of the power of identity may be \u201cthe biggest flaws in the enterprise,\u201d Mr. Lehne said, especially with the bureaucratization of Brussels. But those are not the only problems, the others being logical tributaries.Assumptions about the inevitability of a single market, which is a kind of religion for the bloc, as well as a common currency, the euro, were similarly flawed. Commitments to open borders have been outpaced by security challenges in an age of terrorism. The promises of prosperity for all have been undone as globalization sank cherished local industries while buoying bankers on oceans of wealth that flowed across borders. So people cling ever more tightly to sovereignty.Hubert V\u00e9drine, the former French foreign minister, sees Brexit as merely a symptom of these larger problems \u2014 the false promises of ever-increasing wealth and quality of life for all of \u201csocial Europe, which will never happen.\u201dOverregulation of everyday life from unelected bureaucrats, whether it\u2019s bananas or electric vacuum cleaners or light bulbs, is its own problem, too, Mr. V\u00e9drine noted, and not something the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s bureaucracy, was intended to do.Now there is \u201can electoral insurrection\u201d against globalism, in both Europe and the United States, and unhappiness with \u201ca European system that wishes to continue endlessly, that does not listen, that does not wish to correct anything, that takes no vote into consideration, and if there is a referendum that does not give the desired result, there is a new one presented,\u201d Mr. V\u00e9drine said.\u201cIf we do not manage to correct the system,\u201d he added, \u201cthe European project will end.\u201dMr. V\u00e9drine cautions not to overly focus on the far right. \u201cThere are a lot of people who disagree with what Europe has become, and they are not for Marine Le Pen and the National Front,\u201d he said.The European project is troubled by uncertainty, with the disruption of Brexit underestimated, Russia poking at democratic unity and \u201cthis huge question mark\u201d from Washington, said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian ambassador who is a consultant in Brussels.\u201cThe West is fighting among itself while competitors like China, Russia and Turkey are rising,\u201d he said.Both Mr. Stefanini and Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform, are struck by the complacency in Brussels, with rhetoric about the possibility of a multitier Europe lagging far behind the reality of division and competition.\u201cIn Brussels, they see a couple of quarters of economic growth as a sign that everything is well,\u201d Mr. Tilford said. \u201cThe first sign of relative improvement is an excuse to sound defensive and complacent.\u201d\u201cBut can you return some powers to member states without abandoning the core project?\u201d Mr. Tilford asked. \u201cCan European identity be reconciled with large amounts of migration?\u201dRosy as the declarations on Saturday in Rome are likely to be, they will not provide those answers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to See at New York\u2019s Art Fairs This Week", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byThey\u2019ve all come to town, the dealers and the collectors and the curators and the freeloaders: It\u2019s Armory Week in New York, a saturnalia of art and air kissing. So dive in! Art fairs are, at their core, commercial enterprises \u2014 and, as the market undergoes a violent course correction after years of helium-inflated prices, revenues from fairs constitute a growing fraction of galleries\u2019 yearly takes. But fairs, even for those of us who don\u2019t collect, have their uses. They condense the sprawling art world to just about manageable size, and bring to Manhattan dealers from locales as distant as Tokyo, Cape Town, S\u00e3o Paulo \u2026 and Brooklyn. They\u2019re prime people-watching territory, too, and increasingly good places to snag a drink.A dozen art fairs take place this weekend, but we\u2019ve decided to focus on four. The Armory Show, held on two cruise-ship piers jutting into the Hudson River, is the largest and loudest; uptown, at the Park Avenue Armory, is the statelier Art Show, mounted by an art dealers\u2019 professional association; and downtown are NADA and the Independent, trendier fairs with parallel but distinct approaches to young art. My colleagues and I spent the last few days traipsing through their aisles, gorging in their snack bars, scoping out the collectors\u2019 tote bags and wishing we\u2019d worn more sensible shoes. What follows is an opinionated guide to New York\u2019s busiest art week: what to see, what to skip and how to master an overload of cultural stimulation. JASON FARAGOThis is the smallest, oldest and most exclusive of the fairs. It\u2019s on the Upper East Side and proud of it. Only galleries admitted to the A.D.A.A. exhibit here, and it is sometimes noticeably slow to invite dealers it considers too flashy. Gala night, which raises lots of cash for the Henry Street Settlement, is a major event with a finely gradated social hierarchy: How early you get in is determined by your charitable contribution, or your hunger to buy. Since many of the galleries are from New York, the fair increasingly presents single artists, which makes it more interesting for those not buying: Think of the goods as mini-exhibitions. What the dealers wear: fox stoles, Chanel pantsuits, kitten heels (high enough to look formal but comfortable enough to be on your feet for a while).The Armory Show, founded by young art dealers, started out scruffy and small. Now it\u2019s a behemoth \u2014 the largest art fair in New York \u2014 and often not too picky, so you may see the widest range of credible to semi-credible art here. Rest areas have been added to ease the slog to the end of the piers and back. Pier 92 is principally early- to mid-20th-century work, and interesting for the marginal, overlooked artists; Pier 94 is contemporary. It is still a bit of a zoo; lots of the blue-chip dealers retreated to The Art Show or just wait until Frieze rolls around in May. The Armory attracts American collectors ready to spend. (Think museum board members from Chicago or Dallas making an annual New York trip.) What the dealers wear: art-world standard, tight blue suits, discreetly expensive A-line dresses.The Independent, a little younger than NADA, has matured the most while still maintaining an inscrutable hipness. It\u2019s lost some of its punk edge since moving from the old Dia building to a fashion-shoot location. Once for young galleries only, increasingly the fair has pulled established names who prefer the cooler-than-thou vibe (Paula Cooper, Gavin Brown). The fair has always tried to avoid the traditional booth layout, with designs by different architects. This was interesting and stylish, but also irritating because everything tended to blend together. The dealers are from New York, Europe and Central and South America. You tend to see a lot of interesting, sometimes great stuff that is not yet widely known in New York. What the dealers wear: Many, many people will be in black, which makes those who don\u2019t look, well, independent.The British artist David Shrigley is hardly unknown in New York, but his installation at Anton Kern reprises an unfinished musical project he created recently in Toulouse, France, in which he made instruments and treated the gallery as a rehearsal studio. Lee Ranaldo, from the band Sonic Youth, performed on Mr. Shrigley\u2019s instruments on Wednesday evening. You can see Mr. Shrigley\u2019s drawings on kick drum heads and his instruments scattered around as soundless sculptures in Kern\u2019s booth. MARTHA SCHWENDENERFounded by young dealers in the 2000s, this nonprofit fair has matured into a going concern. It\u2019s medium-size, with small to very small enterprises, sometimes in closet-size spaces. It is a great place to get a sense of the new and the now. The fair is heavy on painting. It does a nice job bringing galleries from outside the art-world capitals (Richmond, Va.; San Juan, P.R.; upstate New York; Brooklyn) and still has the let\u2019s-put-on-a-show ethos of its youth. Where the kids go. What the dealers wear: obscure Japanese denim and white sneakers.While other art fairs look abroad, promoting it\u2019s-a-small-world ideas of global art, NADA feels focused on the current American political landscape (as much as an art fair can be, perhaps). Half of NADA\u2019s ticket sales this year are being donated to the American Civil Liberties Union, and several of the fair\u2019s projects are picking up the slack in government arts funding.Every art lover has to chart a singular path through the madness of this week. You can\u2019t see it all, and alongside the fairs are gallery openings, new public art installations and parties, to boot. But if you want to hit the superfecta of the week\u2019s principal art fairs, here\u2019s a weekend itinerary.A brief review on Friday of one of four art fairs underway in New York misstated the name of the young galleries\u2019 section at the Armory Show. It is Presents, not Projects. And a review of another of the fairs, NADA, referred incorrectly to its exhibit of \u201cMy Kid Could Do That.\u201d The drawings by young artists in that exhibition are on loan for the show; they are not for sale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Caution Signals Are Blinking for the Trump Bull Market", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewDespite an eight-day losing streak that ended on Tuesday, the stock market has generally been buoyant in the opening weeks of the Trump administration. The bullish mood could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and lead to continuing gains for a while.Yet important measurements \u2014 some of which I developed \u2014 tell us that the market is quite expensive and that investor optimism is tinged with plenty of worry. None of this tells us where the market is going tomorrow, but it suggests that some caution is advisable, and that returns over the next decade or so are likely to be constrained.Consider first the evidence from what is often called the Shiller CAPE ratio.We found back then that averaging earnings over 10 years smoothed short-run or cyclical fluctuations, providing a better indicator of fundamental value. The CAPE ratio has successfully explained about a third of the variation in real 10-year stock market returns in United States history since 1881.This is the important point: In 1988, we found that CAPE had averaged about 15 since 1881. In years when CAPE was lower than that, subsequent 10-year returns for the stock market tended to be good. In years when it was higher, the 10-year returns tended to be bad.That\u2019s why today\u2019s CAPE is sending a troubling message. The ratio is now almost 30. Using monthly data, it has been higher only in 1929, when it reached 33, and in the few years around 2000, when it reached 44. In both instances, sharp market declines followed those very high readings. The current level of CAPE suggests a dim outlook for the American stock market over the next 10 years or so, but it does not tell us for sure nor does it say when to expect a decline. As I said, CAPE is useful, but it does not provide a clear guide to the future.Investor sentiment is another factor, and current readings also give us cause for concern.Valuation confidence in February was quite low. The only time it has been lower was in the years surrounding the market peak of 2000. In February, crash confidence was quite low too, though it has been slightly lower on a number of occasions since 1989. These two indicators might seem to confirm the apparent signal of the CAPE ratio: trouble ahead. They are certainly saying that investors aren\u2019t confident that current prices are reasonable or that the market is stable.But one metric went the opposite direction. One-year confidence is at a record high for institutional investors, and it is at the highest level since 2007 for individual investors. (That means, by the way, that in 2007, the eve of the Great Recession and financial crisis, most people had no clue that big problems were imminent.)It is hard to reconcile these results. One possible interpretation might be that respondents perceive a stock market bubble: They think valuations are high and there is a non-negligible probability of a crash. At the same time, they are hanging in because they think the Trump boom will probably last for at least another year.That doesn\u2019t provide much reassurance. The high fraction of our survey respondents who think that the stock market is unlikely to fall in the next year may simply reflect a failure of imagination about how a Trump bull market could suddenly end. There are scores of ways, of course. Just because people can\u2019t picture a big decline doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t react very badly if the market comes under real stress.Many people appear to believe that a business-oriented president will preside over a long stock market boom. At a glance, there appears to be some precedent for this, first with the 1920 election that brought in President Warren G. Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge (who took over when Harding died in 1923) and then with the 1980 victory of Ronald Reagan. These elections were followed by the Roaring Twenties of 1921 to 1929 and the Millennium Boom market of 1982 to 2000.But in both cases, during the initial election campaigns the economy was in recession and the CAPE ratio was extremely low \u2014 around 5 in 1920 and 9 in 1980.We are in a very different situation now. The economy has largely recovered from the last recession, and CAPE shows us that stocks are now relatively expensive.There is no clear message from all of this. Long-term investors shouldn\u2019t be alarmed and shouldn\u2019t avoid stocks altogether. But my bottom line is that the high pricing of the market \u2014 and the public perception that the market is indeed highly priced \u2014 are the most important factors for the current market outlook. And those factors are negative.We don\u2019t know where the market will go this month or this year. It could well rise a lot. But investors should not let themselves be tempted to bet aggressively on the Trump bull market.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Take on Corporate Tax Rate Could Look Very Much Like Obama\u2019s", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byDealBookHe repeated the 15 percent figure over and over again.However, when Mr. Trump spoke to the C.E.O.s that morning, he shifted the goal post slightly: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get it down to anywhere from 15 to 20 percent.\u201dInside the White House, until last Friday, according to people involved in the conversations, the target rate had been bumped up again, to a minimum of 20 percent and very likely a bit more.And now, given that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is off the table \u2014 and with it the $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years that the administration needed to help make its tax plan deficit neutral \u2014 there is a good chance that any tax package would include a corporate rate that is even further from Mr. Trump\u2019s initial pledge, perhaps as high as 28 percent.Now, Republicans may end up negotiating a tax package with a corporate tax rate that looks a lot like the one they rejected out of hand for the last five years.Why is the rate so important?Because almost all those on Wall Street \u2014 and in corner offices throughout corporate America \u2014 have been baking into their models a tax reform plan that they say will jump-start additional investments, leading to higher growth in the economy.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who oversaw the effort to repeal Obamacare, acknowledged that the bill\u2019s failure would \u201cmake tax reform more difficult.\u201dHe has yet to publish a new set of corporate tax rates, but his original plan called for a rate of 20 percent. That plan depended not only on Obamacare\u2019s repeal, to save $1 trillion, but also on another plan that seems increasingly unlikely to gain support: a so-called border adjustment tax \u2014 a euphemism for an import tax on all goods \u2014 that was expected to raise another $1 trillion over 10 years.The border adjustment tax, an obsession of Mr. Ryan\u2019s, has divided Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. Stephen K. Bannon has been a proponent, seeing it as an incentive for more companies to make goods here in the United States. Others, like Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin, have been more ambivalent, people involved in the discussions say, in part because other countries could retaliate, making it harder for United States manufacturers to export goods.Many American retailers, like Walmart, and even some manufacturers \u2014 including Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which make some car models in Mexico and Canada and import them into this country \u2014 have expressed their anxiety about how a border adjustment tax would affect their business.Given the squabbling within the Republican Party over the repeal of Obamacare, it\u2019s hard to imagine that a congressman with constituents including big retailers \u2014 retail jobs outnumber manufacturing jobs in the United States by about four to one \u2014 would vote in favor of a border adjustment tax.\u201cThe border adjustment tax, the most controversial piece of current tax-reform discussions, is less likely to pass,\u201d Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale wrote in a note to clients over the weekend. \u201cIf Congress fails to approve tax reform ahead of August, confidence is likely to slip. Congress could still pass a bill by the end of the calendar year, but even that could slip.\u201dWithout the $2 trillion in revenue and tax savings that the border adjustment tax and Obamacare repeal would generate, it is virtually impossible to see how the Trump administration could find a path to a corporate tax rate anywhere near what it originally promised. (Of course, the administration could pull back on its pledge to lower taxes for the middle class, but that seems unlikely.)The trillion-dollar question is whether lowering corporate taxes would ultimately have the desired effect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philip Hammond, U.K. Finance Official, Cautiously Upbeat on Budget", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The British economy has outperformed expectations since last year\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. In his annual budget presentation delivered Wednesday, the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, predicted the economy would continue to do so, giving him the flexibility to guard against the uncertainties that lie ahead as Britain leaves the European Union.Mr. Hammond\u2019s primary task is to manage the possible economic fallout from Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit. Its impact will depend largely on what sort of trade deal the government can negotiate with the remaining members of the bloc.Mr. Hammond said the government would raise the amount that about 1.6 million self-employed Britons have to pay into social security, breaking an election promise but helping to build an economic defense against possible economic shock brought on by the British exit.Prime Minister Theresa May has said that Britain is likely to leave the bloc\u2019s single market and \u2014 almost certainly \u2014 its customs union, which taken together dispense with customs checks at borders and allow for tariff-free trade in goods and many services.Mr. Hammond, who announced money for driverless vehicles, noted dryly that this was \u201ca technology that I believe the Labour Party knows something about.\u201dBut he has a less showy style than his predecessor, George Osborne, who was fired when Mrs. May came to power after last year\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s future.A sober approach may be more appropriate now, given the uncertainty of the economic situation Britain faces, however. Britain is currently a full member of the European Union, but the government is expected to start exit negotiations later this month, setting the clock running on a two-year period to arrange an orderly withdrawal from the bloc.Under the plans outlined on Wednesday, Mr. Hammond created $31 billion of \u201cheadroom\u201d that will give him the resources to stimulate the economy, should the exit negotiations founder, dragging down growth.\u201cBeyond the next couple of years, the long-term economic and fiscal outlook will be heavily influenced by the post-Brexit relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.,\u201d Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, wrote in an analysis.\u201cThe chancellor continues to take a low-risk approach to fiscal policy, setting generous fiscal targets with sufficient headroom in case growth slows by more than expected,\u201d he added.Though Mr. Hammond pledged an additional $2.4 billion in spending over three years for social services, he balanced that commitment by increasing the rate of national insurance contributions \u2014 the name for the taxes that fund welfare programs and the state pension \u2014 paid by self-employed workers.Currently, their contributions are levied at a lower rate. Mr. Hammond said that this was \u201cnot fair to the 85 percent of workers\u201d who were not self-employed.However, the increase in national insurance appeared to be a breach of the manifesto of Mr. Hammond\u2019s Conservative Party, which promised before the 2015 election that it would not increase the value-added tax, the income tax or the national insurance payments.The budget also included tax increases affecting some company owners and investors, as well as aid for some businesses, including all but the largest pubs.The spending plan was criticized by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor from the opposition Labour Party, who described the national insurance changes as an \u201cunfair\u201d attack \u201con the self-employed low- and middle-earners.\u201d\u201cInstead of equipping our country for Brexit, he is building our economy on sand,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said in a statement.Mr. Pickering argued that, despite the positive economic news so far, Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union would still impose significant costs on the economy and could reduce the country\u2019s long-term potential growth rate to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent. \u201cAn increase in spending on projects designed to boost productivity and raise trend growth would be well timed,\u201d he added.Overall, when compared with forecasts made last year \u2014 before the referendum \u2014 by Britain\u2019s independent Office for Budget Responsibility, \u201cBrexit looks still set to cost the taxpayer at least $120 billion,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

Instead of a plan, Mr. Trump on Tuesday articulated a general principle: \u201cWe must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Trump once again proposed a $1 trillion investment in rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure. He described this effort in grand terms. \u201cCrumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land,\u201d he said.But here, too, details were in short supply. Mr. Trump said only that the effort would be financed from a mix of private and public sources, and that it \u201cwill be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and hire American.\u201d He also offered one specific example: a requirement that American pipelines be made with American steel.Mr. Trump\u2019s wide-ranging speech touched on many of the problems in American life and promised solutions \u2014 but details were in short supply.He promised to \u201crestart the engine of the American economy.\u201d The American economy is in the midst of one of the longest periods of continuous growth in the nation\u2019s history, though the pace of growth has been tepid.Reporters from The New York Times fact checked President Trump\u2019s first address to Congress.He promised to stop drugs \u201cfrom pouring into our country.\u201dHe described the low quality of public education as \u201cthe civil rights issue of our time,\u201d and he called for legislation to fund \u201cschool choice for disadvantaged youth,\u201d meaning that some students would receive vouchers they could use to pay tuition at private schools. But he did not define which students should get such vouchers, nor what would be done for the students left in public schools.Mr. Trump did offer specific examples of his commitment to reduce regulation.He said that he had stopped one of the regulations \u201cthat threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners,\u201d referring to a rule that restricted the dumping of mining debris in streams. He also noted his executive order requiring federal agencies to offset the cost of each new regulation by eliminating at least two existing rules.And Mr. Trump called for changes to expedite the approval of new medications, addressing what he described as a \u201cslow and burdensome approval process\u201d that prevents potentially lifesaving drugs from reaching people who are dying.If regulations are reduced, he said, \u201cour children will grow up in a nation of miracles.\u201dThere is an inherent trade-off between speed and safety in the drug approval process, and the proper balance is the subject of a long-running debate. The government wants to prevent harmful drugs from entering the marketplace, so it sometimes delays the availability of helpful drugs.

{"Headline": "The President Changed. So Has Small Businesses\u2019 Confidence.", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byTOLEDO, Ohio \u2014 The cream of the small-business community here tucked into their lunch on a top floor of a bank building and pondered the question put to them by their local lender\u2019s economist.More than any other president since Ronald Reagan, President Trump is moving to strip away regulations and slash taxes, said Jeffrey Korzenik, an investment strategist with Fifth Third, a large regional bank in the Midwest and Southeast. In meetings with clients, Mr. Korzenik has been making the case that these policies will rouse the slumbering animal spirits in businesses across America.\u201cAnd now we have seen this huge spike in small-business confidence since the election,\u201d Mr. Korzenik said, pointing to a chart. \u201cSo I have to ask you: Do you feel more confident now?\u201dThere was a moment of silence, broken only by a howling northwestern Ohio wind that rattled the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bank\u2019s boardroom.Then, with rapid-fire speed, came the responses.While much has been made about the stock market\u2019s nearly 14 percent rally since the election, economists say that when it comes to assessing the genuine potential for the United States economy, confidence among small-business owners is a more grounded and forward-looking indicator.Companies that employ several to a few hundred workers make up 99 percent of business in the United States and account for half of private sector employment. So for all that General Electric, Caterpillar or Ford Motor talks about building factories and hiring workers, the $18 trillion United States economy will not truly move until the burghers in Toledo and other parts of the country start to invest and add jobs.The exuberance of small-city executives in Toledo, of course, represents just a small slice of the national economy \u2014 an economy whose recovery had already been showing signs of gaining momentum. And their euphoria is being fed by promises, like a tax overhaul, that have not yet been kept.Billed as a C.E.O. round table, the event felt more like a boisterous group therapy session as one businessman interrupted another with competing tales of Obama-era regulatory woes.But all 11 executives agreed: Never in recent years had they been so bullish about their businesses as they were now under a president (and fellow small-business owner, albeit a very rich one) whom they see as one of their own.Which is why Mr. Korzenik was so excited about the recent surge in the small-business confidence index, as measured by the National Federation of Independent Business, the industry\u2019s trade group.In the month after Mr. Trump was elected, the gauge showed the largest monthly increase since 1986. And it has continued to reflect consistent gains as the president pushes for lower taxes, fewer regulations and a repeal of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care initiative.Of course, the jump came off low levels. Since 2009, the index had been either on a downward trend or barely moving up as small businesses struggled to recover from the financial crisis. A heavier regulatory burden and uncertainty born of a weak economic recovery have kept small-business owners from making big bets in investments or hiring.But in Toledo, this reluctance is changing \u2014 and quickly.Louis M. Soltis owns a small company that manufactures control panels for large factories and machines. After four years of not adding to his work force of 22, he has seen orders for panels jump in the last two months and is looking to take on as many as six new workers.There may not be a direct correlation between his surging order book and the new president, but there is no doubting the psychological boost.\u201cThat guy is a junkyard dog, doing his tweets at 3 a.m. and taking on the news media \u2014 I just get strength from him,\u201d Mr. Soltis said over a wine-soaked dinner with a large group of his small-business friends and peers from around town. \u201cAnd I have to say, it makes you feel gutsy \u2014 ready to step up and start investing again.\u201dThe restaurant sits on the eastern bank of the Maumee River, offering up a view of the modest Toledo skyline. For years, many of the taller buildings have stood empty as this largely industrial city, a bit more than an hour\u2019s drive south of Detroit, suffered from the automotive industry\u2019s decline.Mr. Soltis is not the only small-business leader to report a sharp pickup in activity.Barton S. Kulish, the president of MTS Seating, which makes seats and tables for restaurants and offices, said that his sales were up 38 percent after the election. Since the beginning of the year, he said he has had to bring on eight more workers (and plans to hire an additional 12) to his 418-employee company.Bryan Keller, the chief executive of Keller Logistics, said a sharp rise in trucking orders since the election prompted him to recently increase his shipping rates.And the local real estate market is still buzzing with news of a 300,000-square-foot industrial space, which, after drawing little interest for the better part of a year, suddenly became the target of a frantic bidding war among three local parties before finding a buyer.Yet there is a downside to animal spirits that persist too long, especially in labor markets, like Toledo\u2019s, that are operating on the tight side.And that is a sharp uptick in inflation.In his presentation to Fifth Third\u2019s banking clients, Mr. Korzenik raised this issue, suggesting that the broader economy was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of what has been a pretty long business cycle.He also noted how the opioid epidemic in the Midwest had made it harder for companies to find qualified young people ready to work \u2014 a comment that elicited nods from around the table.Still, no one in the room seemed overly concerned. As the group saw it, the party was just beginning.\u201cMost businesses I know are just taking a deep breath, happy that there is finally someone in the White House who understands what they do,\u201d said Mr. Fleisher, the owner of the Lincoln car dealership. \u201cSo you say we are in the seventh inning \u2014 well, I am not sure we are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Top Tech Investor Is Betting Big on Trump", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe world\u2019s largest technology investor is preparing to ramp up his bet on the Trump economy.Masayoshi Son, the billionaire technology entrepreneur from Japan, promised President Trump late last year that he would create 50,000 new jobs in the United States through a $100 billion technology fund.Now, Mr. Son and his financial advisers are weighing several major possible deals for Sprint, the struggling American wireless operator controlled by Mr. Son\u2019s SoftBank.Be it a tie-up with T-Mobile U.S., Sprint\u2019s closest competitor, or a more ambitious marriage with the cable colossus Comcast, a transaction would allow Mr. Son to fulfill a long-held ambition to invest aggressively in wireless networks in the United States and enable next-generation mobile technology.Last month, several executives from SoftBank spent a day in Washington talking to senior members of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team, according to bankers briefed on these meetings.The talks and the rush to assess potential deals for Sprint, the country\u2019s fourth-largest mobile operator, highlight how the Trump administration\u2019s push for lighter regulation and lower taxes has been a powerful lure for cash-rich investors the world over.In their presentations, the SoftBank executives said that because of a lack of advanced digital investments, the competitiveness of the United States economy was at risk. And the executives made the case, quite strongly, that Mr. Son was committed to playing a major role in addressing this issue through a spate of job-creating investments.The discussions were purposely broad in nature, according to investment bankers who were briefed on the discussions. Until the latest government-sponsored auction for spectrum bands finishes in late April, wireless companies are prohibited, owing to concerns about collusion, from pursuing various tie-ups.A Sprint hookup with T-Mobile U.S., Comcast, or any large wireless or cable operator is no slam dunk. For years, federal regulators have opposed such transactions for fear of hurting consumers.Nevertheless, SoftBank seems to be seizing the opportunity of the moment \u2014 one highlighted by numerous analyst reports arguing for Sprint and T-Mobile U.S. to come together.Through a spokesman, SoftBank declined to comment on its plans for Sprint.This emphasis on big technology investments as a selling point for the merger rides in part on a wave of hope that the Trump administration will push for a sharp increase in infrastructure investing as a way to kick-start higher levels of United States growth.Analysts, however, note that in the past six years when Washington frowned upon wireless mergers \u2014 first between AT&T and T-Mobile U.S., and then Sprint and T-Mobile U.S. \u2014 consumers benefited from the ruthless price war among the four major carriers.Moreover, this cutthroat environment has forced the two smaller players, Sprint and T-Mobile U.S., to become more innovative and efficient.\u201cThe Federal Communications Commission looks very smart for blocking the AT&T T-Mobile deal,\u201d said Philip Cusick, a telecommunications expert with JPMorgan Chase. \u201cFive years ago, Sprint and T-Mobile were irrelevant. Now we are seeing them drive down prices. Why would you want to change that?\u201dThat would mean pushing the companies to invest aggressively in the type of fiber technology that will support the next generation of wireless investments before it is too late.\u201cYou want these companies to invest and compete,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, a telecommunications expert at New Street Research who has argued in recent research reports for a Sprint merger with T-Mobile U.S. \u201cThis infrastructure will underlie the entire digital economy, and if it remains weak, compared to Japan and China, then the competitiveness of our economy is at risk.\u201dThis, more or less to a T, sums up the view of Mr. Son and his top SoftBank executives. And while for regulatory reasons they have been extremely careful to not \u2014 publicly or privately \u2014 advocate for a merger, they have not been shy in warning about what might happen to the United States economy if it continues to fall behind in the race for global digital supremacy.Those in favor of a Sprint deal have also pointed out that the two giants, AT&T and Verizon Communications, while making their own digital investment bets, have been diversifying by pursuing media deals, like Verizon\u2019s acquisition of Yahoo and AT&T\u2019s purchase of DirectTV.So, the argument goes, with the two leading players focused on their media ambitions and with T-Mobile U.S. and Sprint not generating enough cash to invest at the needed scale, a Sprint hookup with its slightly larger peer has never been more critical.Of course, a deal could happen only if Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile U.S., agreed to merge. Bankers also do not discount the possibility of a cable deal titan like John C. Malone swooping in to buy T-Mobile U.S.At a bit over $70 billion in combined revenue, a merged company would still trail far behind Verizon and AT&T, which generate about $125 billion and $163 billion in sales respectively.Yet a larger third operator could immediately increase investments from the current $5 billion (for the two smaller companies combined) as Mr. Son pulls out the stops to make his network the class of the competition, as he has done in Japan.Bankers who have spoken to SoftBank executives say a merged company could easily double its annual outlay to more than $10 billion.While SoftBank and Mr. Son have pitched a merger as a boon for investment-starved digital America, it is also true that Sprint, as the smallest, most financially challenged of the four companies, needs to do some kind of deal to stay relevant.Thanks to the financial engineering talents of Rajeev Misra, the former Deutsche Bank executive who has emerged as one of Mr. Son\u2019s more influential advisers, Sprint has been able to reduce punitive financing by issuing cheaper bonds secured by the company\u2019s access to spectrum airwaves.These types of flashy innovations are not a long-term strategy, however. And as the company continues its policy of slashing prices to keep pressure on its larger competitors, its financial position will remain precarious, with a debt pile of $33 billion.Sprint, under Mr. Son, has become more profitable, and the quality of its network has improved sharply. But analysts and investors remain divided as to how long Sprint can remain a stand-alone company.\u201cIt is completely binary,\u201d said Mr. Chaplin, the analyst from New Street. \u201cThere are those who believe in Masa\u2019s vision and those who believe the company is a house of cards.\u201dWhat is more, with phone prices still falling, regulators need not be in a hurry to sign off on a merger.\u201cFor Sprint,\u201d Mr. Chaplin said, \u201cthe waiting is more complicated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In China, \u2018Disney\u2019 Deals Turn Out to Be Fantasy", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 In 2013, Meng Dekai, a Disney executive in China, signed a deal with the mayor of Hefei to build a $1.3 billion \u201cDisney cultural and industrial park.\u201dIt was one of several agreements with multiple cities in China that Mr. Meng apparently signed.The only problem: He was not allowed to do so.The Walt Disney Company said on Wednesday that it had parted ways with Mr. Meng \u2014 it did not say whether he resigned or was fired \u2014 after opening an investigation into allegations that he had signed deals with local governments for Disney-related projects.A Disney spokeswoman said the company was \u201cinvestigating,\u201d when asked whether it would push for a criminal inquiry. Mr. Meng could not be reached for comment.\u201cThis is the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever heard of when it comes to fraud against a foreign business,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s so big and it\u2019s so public, it\u2019s such a big name company. What was he thinking?\u201dAlong with the Hefei deal, Mr. Meng, who was employed by Disney as a director of special projects, signed agreements in the cities of Ningbo, on the eastern Chinese coast, and Zhengzhou, in the center of the country.The Henan Daily said on its public account on WeChat, an instant-messaging app in China, that Walt Disney Company (China) Limited had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Henan government to build a site in Zhengzhou, which could include \u201ceven the Disneyland parks that everyone knows so well.\u201d\u201cDisney is here! Disney has really come to Zhengzhou!\u201d the paper said.And the Hefei Network, a news website, said in 2013 that the \u201cDisney project\u201d that Mr. Meng signed with the city\u2019s mayor, Zhang Qingjun \u2014 who has since been dismissed for corruption \u2014 would stretch across 1,300 acres and be built over three years.In January of this year, the state-run Jianghuai Morning News reported that a Disney project in the same province would consist of a theme park based around the mobile video game Angry Birds (which is not produced by Disney, but the Finnish company Rovio), film special effects production offices, and other offerings. It is unclear whether the 2013 deal announced in Hefei, in one of China\u2019s poorest provinces, is the same one.In February, The Hangzhou Daily reported that a building in Ningbo was emblazoned with a Disney logo.A search on Tianyancha, a corporate database in China, showed that Mr. Meng\u2019s name was linked to 21 companies in the country, with him listed either as the legal representative or executive director. Most of the companies\u2019 names start with the same Chinese character for Disney, \u201cDee Magic,\u201d and contain \u201cAmerica\u201d in them. Mr. Meng had also registered two companies in Hong Kong, a search on the city\u2019s database found.The Disney spokeswoman said that neither Dee Magic nor any of its affiliates had been authorized by Disney to promote projects or sign deals on behalf of the company, and that they had been told \u201cto immediately cease any unauthorized activity.\u201dShe added that while Disney had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Henan government for a \u201cvery limited consumer products license agreement,\u201d it appeared that \u201cthey\u2019ve maybe gone beyond the bounds of the licensing agreement.\u201dMr. Meng, 43, is from the eastern city of Jinan and obtained a doctorate from Shandong University, where he is also a part-time professor, according to The Paper. It said Mr. Meng co-founded a heavy-industry company with the chairman of Yiyi Group. Yiyi started several real estate projects with names that sound similar to the word Disney such as \u201cDi Qu Happy Town\u201d and \u201cDimo Starworld.\u201dYiyi\u2019s website said \u201cDi Qu Happy Town\u201d had obtained \u201cintellectual property authorization\u201d from Disney.Disney said that Yiyi had only a limited license with its China unit to install temporary movie-themed promotional displays in shopping malls, subject to approval from Disney, and that \u201cYiyi has absolutely no authority for any work\u201d with Disney beyond that.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

In fact, you\u2019re all in with the biggest lies, the baseless claims that three million people voted illegally, that Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower, and on, and on. The lying is disruptive. Yay for disruption!You don\u2019t mind the flip-flops. Last year, Trump said the unemployment rate was \u201cone of the biggest hoaxes in American history.\u201d This year, because he\u2019s president, it\u2019s very real. Last year, Wall Street was a puppeteer for the Democrats. Now your man has brought in Goldman Sachs puppeteers to run the economy. Last year, a golfing president was lazy. Now your guy has paid 14 presidential visits to a golf course.You\u2019re not bothered by the foreign policy incompetence, the siding up to gangster regimes and human rights violators, the snub of the rest of the world in the name of America First. You don\u2019t mind unleashing polluters. If the job creators want filthy air and foul water, give it to them.You shrug at all of this hypocrisy and craziness, because you still think he\u2019s going to help you. But you\u2019ve been played, sucker-punched, duped. You can continue to believe Trump has your back, but the evidence is already overwhelming that the people his presidency will hurt most are those at the bottom who gave him their trust.Trump acknowledged as much when told that the health care plan he pushed would significantly harm his base. \u201cOh, I know,\u201d he said, and then promised to fix it later. Later was changed to let the whole thing die, and damn the consequences.Given that Trump\u2019s approval rating, 35 percent, hit a historic low this week in Gallup\u2019s survey, given that a majority of Americans believe that Trump is not honest and does not care about average people, it\u2019s easy to think Democrats can abandon the voters who abandoned them last year.In a New York magazine piece titled \u201cNo Sympathy for the Hillbilly,\u201d Frank Rich wrote that white voters without a college degree, who went for Trump by 39 points, are never going to come around \u2014 no matter how much this president turns his back on them. An earlier piece, from the right, made some of the same points. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s speeches make them feel good,\u201d Kevin Williamson wrote in National Review. \u201cSo does OxyContin.\u201dThe condescension, like the opioids, may feel good as well, but it won\u2019t do anything to help the forces of reason and progress. The way to bring around the forgotten men and women is to remind them, every day, that Trump has forgotten them. And to give them something \u2014 say, Medicare for all, being pushed by the energized Bernie Sanders base \u2014 to back words with action.Trump is banking on the ignorance of voters who took a chance with him. His budget proposal \u2014 a cruel, Dickensian document \u2014 offers nothing but pain for these people. An Appalachian economic partnership that helps workers in 420 of the nation\u2019s poorest counties would be abolished. Seniors who need Meals on Wheels for food and social contact would lose the service. Cancer victims, waiting for something miraculous to come from the extraordinary work of the National Institutes of Health, will have to wait longer, as Trump cuts cancer research to fund his Mexican wall.If you\u2019re a poor kid in Kentucky looking for that college break that will get you somewhere, his budget slashes tuition grants for you. If you\u2019re a single mom trying to hold onto a job, he could force you onto welfare by eliminating the after-school program that enabled you to work full time.He promised \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d and then supported the ill-fated Republican plan that would have added 24 million Americans to the uninsured. Those in their 50s and early 60s, and the working poor, would have been hit hardest. And Medicaid recipients, many of whom didn\u2019t realize they had coverage for the first time in their lives thanks to Obamacare, would have been left out.Oh, but Trump is bringing back jobs \u2014 that\u2019s why you put him in office. About those jobs: The coal mining initiative is a hoax. We have half the coal industry jobs today that we had in 1990 \u2014 down to 64,000 from 131,000. This is because of the free market, turning to cheaper natural gas for power, and energy alternatives because they are the future. It\u2019s as if Herbert Hoover ordered the federal government to bring back manure sweepers and horseshoers to the cities.\u201cHe can\u2019t bring them back,\u201d said Robert Murray, founder of the largest private coal company in the United States. Give the coal man credit for being honest. It\u2019s more than some Trump supporters are being with themselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For China\u2019s Factories, a Weaker Currency Is a Double-Edged Sword", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byFor the past three years, China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to weaken in value compared with the American dollar. On paper, that should bolster Chigo\u2019s profits. Half of its $1.2 billion in annual sales come from abroad, mostly in dollars, and a weaker renminbi gives Chinese companies an advantage when they sell their products in other countries.Yet the renminbi\u2019s slide has provided only a marginal benefit, said Li Xinghao, the company\u2019s founder and chairman. Big Western department store chains have learned to pit manufacturers against one another \u2014 and China is full of air-conditioner manufacturers. When the renminbi weakens, the chains simply tell factory bosses to cut their prices or lose the business to another Chinese factory.\u201cIt only brings benefits for the first month,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cFor the next month, clients are recalculating what they\u2019ll pay. The supply is much greater than demand, so profits can\u2019t go up.\u201dThe renminbi is likely to be a major topic behind closed doors as Chinese lawmakers gather beginning on Sunday for the annual meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, the top lawmaking body in the country. President Trump had heavily criticized China during the campaign, saying that Beijing for many years used an artificially weak currency to unfairly help its businesses and steal American jobs.Investors and economists widely expect market forces to push the renminbi to weaken even more. And that leaves China with some tough choices. If Beijing lets its currency slide, it will risk worsening relations with Washington.On the other hand, a weaker currency would help its factories. But economists and business executives are increasingly throwing cold water on that thinking, saying the dynamic has changed: These days, they say, a weaker currency may hurt China and its companies more than it helps.Chinese officials, who keep a tight grip on the currency\u2019s value, appear to be aware of that. In recent months, they have kept the value from falling to 7 renminbi to the dollar, a level the currency has not seen since May 2008. Currently, it is hovering at about 6.9 renminbi to the dollar. That support is expensive \u2014 China has drawn nearly $1 trillion from its huge stash of foreign money to hold its currency steady.The currency is under pressure to depreciate for a number of reasons. Among them: Families and companies are sending their money out of China, looking for safer places to store it as the country\u2019s growth cools.China keeps a tight rein on the amount of money that flows over its borders. But between the semiautonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, which has a separate currency and legal system, and its neighbor on the mainland, Shenzhen, \u201cthere are thousands and thousands of smugglers, and they just bring billions of dollars\u201d out of China, said Kevin Lai, the chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets. A weaker currency could push more Chinese people and companies to send their money abroad, for fear of further losses if they continue to hold renminbi.That isn\u2019t all. The weaker currency makes it harder for many of China\u2019s heavily indebted companies to pay off what they owe overseas or to raise more money. A weaker currency also does not pack the same competitive punch because so much of the world\u2019s manufacturing base is now in China; four-fifths of the world\u2019s window-mounted air-conditioners are made in the country, for example. Basically, a weaker currency is not as much help if a company\u2019s competitors all use the same currency.Today\u2019s dynamic signals a big shift from a decade ago. Back then, Beijing kept the currency artificially weak compared with the dollar \u2014 and Chinese businesses benefited. A cheap and stable currency was one of a number of reasons that companies like General Electric, Mattel and Samsonite shifted production there. The shift gave China tens of millions of manufacturing jobs, stoked its economy and helped create a world power.\u201cHowever much the U.S. dollar rises, our profits rise the same,\u201d said Wu Zheng, general manager of Broad\u2019s international operations.But for most companies, other issues dwarf the currency. Wages have risen to the point where global manufacturers of low-cost items like shoes and clothing are shifting work outside China. Economic growth is slowing. Global trade has weakened. And in many industries, like window-mounted air-conditioners, a surplus of Chinese factories has undermined pricing and wiped out profits.Chigo \u2014 which is headquartered in Foshan, on the outskirts of the city of Guangzhou \u2014 lost money from operations in 2014 and 2015. In the first half of last year, Chigo eked out a tiny profit as the renminbi began to tumble. It was briefly able to capture some gains from the currency\u2019s depreciation before foreign retailers demanded price discounts.Chigo sells air-conditioners in 180 countries, including outlets in the United States like Menards, a Midwest chain of home-improvement centers.Three years ago, Chigo experimented with its own shift overseas. With wages rising at home, it chose two countries with even lower wages as well as steep barriers to imports: Nigeria and India.Chigo found that in both countries, worker productivity was much lower while government corruption was a problem. In Africa, security was also an issue. A car carrying Chigo sales managers in Ghana was approached in broad daylight by two armed robbers who demanded the managers\u2019 wallets and pistol-whipped their driver. Now its Indian and Nigerian operations have nearly shut down.\u201cIn China, companies feel a sense of safety, which is already a huge support\u201d for business, said Jackie Cheng, the vice president of Chigo and general manager for its overseas marketing. China\u2019s high-speed rail network and its world-class network of new expressways also make it easy to do business, he added.Persuading Chinese managers to live overseas is also difficult, Chigo found. \u201cThat\u2019s serious,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get used to the food outside, and many Chinese can\u2019t really speak English.\u201dThe factory in Foshan ran only four days a week late last year because of weak orders and overcapacity in the Chinese air-conditioning manufacturing sector. In interviews, some Chigo workers expressed irritation that this meant they earned less money.But Mr. Cheng said that the company\u2019s sprawling, 23-year-old factory had become busier in recent weeks as orders have risen. He attributed this mainly to an acceleration in the American and Chinese economies but also to the fall of the renminbi, which makes air-conditioners slightly cheaper and more affordable around the world and results in slightly greater demand.Yet if the renminbi weakens further this year, as many economists expect, Mr. Cheng expects further demands from overseas retailers for discounts, coupled with threats to move orders to other Chinese air-conditioning manufacturers if Chigo does not comply. Frowning, he added, \u201cOur clients have already told me, \u2018The renminbi will reach 7.1. Please reduce your prices.\u2019\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Will Hurt My Border Town", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorEL PASO \u2014 In 2000, George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, was elected to the presidency on a pro-border, pro-trade platform that included support for comprehensive immigration reform. Although I didn\u2019t vote for him, I was impressed by his respect for Mexico \u2014 and I know many Latinos here in El Paso who felt the same.In 2016, though, many of those same voters fled the Republican Party and its candidate, Donald Trump. Despite his occasional nod toward moderation, like his comment on Tuesday that he is open to a bill to grant legal status to some undocumented immigrants, voters in El Paso remain skeptical \u2014 not just because of his frequent pandering to anti-immigrant xenophobia, or his nonsensical wall, but because we know, close up, the impact that the Trump agenda could have on our economy, in El Paso and nationwide.In the national imagination, visits to the border are like visiting a war zone, and politicians swarm to it for photo ops. Odd, then, that they don\u2019t come to a place like El Paso. If they did, they\u2019d get a much different story.Politicians from both sides also like to harp on the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and cross-border trade generally, on our economy. And there\u2019s no denying that the advent of Nafta cost Americans jobs and brought with it a host of economic and social challenges.But again, they\u2019d get a different story if they came to El Paso. We felt the blow swiftly and severely when manufacturing jobs left for Mexico. But El Paso adapted to make our location on the border work to our advantage \u2014 for example by building state-of-the-art shipment and distribution centers.In El Paso alone, $90 billion in goods travels through our ports of entry annually (nationally, the value of cross-border trade is $400 billion). The El Paso-Santa Teresa, N.M., region has become the 11th-largest exporter of goods in the nation, and Mexico is Texas\u2019 No. 1 trading partner.Unfortunately, too few Americans understand that cross-border trade creates jobs, not just in our region and state but in the rest of the country. In fact, trade with Mexico supports nearly five million American jobs \u2014 so it\u2019s not just the border that will lose if Mr. Trump fulfills his promises.El Pasoans also know the cost that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric will have in terms of human capital. There\u2019s a moral case for humane immigration reform, but there\u2019s an economic one as well. Mr. Trump has said that whatever his position on undocumented immigrants, he will preserve protections for so-called Dreamers \u2014 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. But his blunt talk, and the stepped-up arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, say otherwise.These young people have pursued an education in the United States, and they\u2019ve helped us increase our local tax base. We\u2019ve invested in them, and they are investing in our country. Over the next decade, if Dreamers are allowed to legally work in jobs that reflect their skill level, they will raise government revenues by $2.3 billion. El Paso stands to benefit enormously, but so does every state with a large Dreamer population.While the wall may never be built, and while many undocumented immigrants will remain \u2014 a lot depends on Mr. Trump\u2019s wild, daily policy swings and congressional purse strings \u2014 his words are already having unmistakable economic consequences. The Mexican peso, for example, was dealt a heavy blow on election night, and its value has continued to plummet. That means that Mexicans will spend less money in El Paso and other border regions, in turn decreasing revenues and jobs in border states. Investments and the flow of commerce have also slowed significantly.The question for many of us during the presidential election was whether communities like mine would hold 2016 general election candidates accountable. Would Hispanics in border communities reject the harmful anti-border and anti-Mexico rhetoric?I can proudly say that El Paso did. Voter turnout in El Paso broke records \u2014 early voting and Election Day numbers soared, with a 32 percent increase in turnout, handily breaking the 2008 record locally. Hillary Clinton carried El Paso by a wider margin than Barack Obama did in 2008.El Pasoans may have finally had enough of the misrepresentation of our people and communities and decided to create our own \u201cborder surge.\u201d That surge helped Mrs. Clinton close the gap in Texas. In 2012, there was a 19-point spread between Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney in our state. In 2016, thanks to border communities like El Paso, it was shaved down to nine points between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump \u2014 closer than Iowa.While many of us have grown wearily accustomed to politicians\u2019 talk of \u201csecuring\u201d the border, for many, this election became more about securing our identity. In the coming years, those of us who live on the border must rise above the bad policies that will hurt our communities \u2014 but more important, we must sustain and expand that sense of identity, and show our neighbors the impact their votes can have. We need to do it for El Paso, and for the country.Veronica Escobar, a Democrat, is the El Paso County judge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paula Fox, Novelist Who Chronicled Dislocation, Dies at 93", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byPaula Fox, a distinguished writer for children and adults whose work illuminated lives filled with loss, dislocation and abandonment, conditions she knew firsthand from a very early age, died on Wednesday in Brooklyn. She was 93.Her death, at a hospital near her home, was confirmed by her daughter, Linda Carroll-Barraud.Ms. Fox wrote a half-dozen novels for adults and more than 20 books for young people. What united her output was a cool, elegant style that was haunting in its pared-down economy; minute observation; masterly control of tone and pacing; and an abiding concern with dissolution \u2014 of family, of home, of health, of trust.Her characters are complex, self-contained and often withdrawn, but their ruminative interior states lend the narratives a quiet luminosity.Ms. Fox\u2019s best-known novel for adults is \u201cDesperate Characters\u201d (1970), about the disintegration of a marriage. It was made into a film of the same title, released the next year and starring Shirley MacLaine and Kenneth Mars.She was awarded the Newbery Medal, considered the Pulitzer Prize of children\u2019s literature, in 1974 for \u201cThe Slave Dancer,\u201d a controversial novel centered on the Atlantic slave trade in the mid-19th century.Her work also includes two memoirs: \u201cBorrowed Finery\u201d (2001), about her peripatetic childhood, and \u201cThe Coldest Winter: A Stringer in Liberated Europe\u201d (2005), about her young womanhood.Ms. Fox\u2019s bibliography took readers from cradle to grave, something few other writers have done. It includes picture books for young children, like \u201cTraces\u201d (2008), a poem, illustrated by Karla Kuskin, about the evanescent signs \u2014 think of footprints and vapor trails \u2014 left by unseen visitors. It also includes many titles for middle-grade readers and teenagers, among them \u201cBlowfish Live in the Sea\u201d (1970), about a child\u2019s journey to visit the father he has never met; \u201cOne-Eyed Cat\u201d (1984), about the painful consequences of a boy\u2019s casual shot with an air rifle; and \u201cThe Eagle Kite\u201d (1995), about a boy whose father has AIDS.Because so much of Ms. Fox\u2019s work was for young people, her fiction for adults was sometimes overlooked. In 1984, The Nation described her as \u201cone of our most intelligent (and least appreciated) contemporary novelists.\u201dIn later years, however, her adult books enjoyed something of a renaissance, thanks largely to the efforts of the novelist Jonathan Franzen, who became an ardent champion after devouring an out-of-print copy of \u201cDesperate Characters\u201d he had come across by chance.A new edition of \u201cDesperate Characters,\u201d with an introduction by Mr. Franzen, was published by W. W. Norton & Company in 1999. Ms. Fox\u2019s other adult novels \u2014 among them \u201cThe Widow\u2019s Children,\u201d \u201cA Servant\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cThe God of Nightmares\u201d \u2014 have also been re-released by Norton, with introductions by writers including Frederick Busch, Andrea Barrett and Rosellen Brown.\u201cMrs. and Mrs. Otto Bentwood drew out their chairs simultaneously. As he sat down, Otto regarded the straw basket which held slices of French bread, an earthenware casserole filled with saut\u00e9ed chicken livers, peeled and sliced tomatoes on an oval willowware platter Sophie had found in a Brooklyn Heights antique shop, and risotto Milanese in a green ceramic bowl. A strong light, somewhat softened by the stained glass of a Tiffany shade, fell upon this repast.\u201dIn the pages that follow, Sophie is bitten by a stray cat, an event that sets in motion the dissolution of her marriage to Otto. The great risk of being alive, nearly all of Ms. Fox\u2019s work seemed to say, is that anything can happen to anyone at any time.Paul and Elsie floated through the 1920s and \u201930s in a sea of alcohol, Hollywood parties and European travel, none of which, they made plain, was best experienced with a child in tow. When Paula was a few days old, she was left, at her mother\u2019s insistence, in a foundling hospital. From there, she embarked on her itinerant young life, bouncing among a series of friends, relatives and strangers across the country and in Cuba, where she lived for a time on a sugar plantation with her grandmother.Periodically, her parents would turn up, and Paula would be returned to their dubious care. By the time she was 16, she was more or less on her own.There was one happy interlude. When Paula was 5 months old, she was taken in by a stranger, the Rev. Elwood Amos Corning, in a small Hudson Valley town aptly named Balmville, N.Y. A kind, scholarly man who lived with his mother, Mr. Corning taught Paula about books and nature and history. She lived with him till she was 6, when her parents swooped down and parceled her out somewhere else.Ms. Fox studied piano briefly at the Juilliard School in Manhattan and later attended Columbia University. She held a series of odd jobs, including modeling, reporting on the postwar reconstruction of Poland for a British news service and teaching emotionally disturbed children.As a teenager, Ms. Fox had what she referred to as a \u201cbrief, disastrous marriage\u201d; her second marriage, to Richard Sigerson, ended in divorce. In 1962, she married Martin Greenberg, a brother of the art critic Clement Greenberg. They had met when Martin, then an editor at Commentary magazine, rejected a story Ms. Fox had submitted.Critical response to Ms. Fox\u2019s work over the years was largely favorable, though there was sometimes dissent. Her Newbery Medal for \u201cThe Slave Dancer\u201d inspired a protest at the awards ceremony that year: The novel, which tells the story of a white New Orleans youth conscripted to play the fife on a slave ship in the 1840s, had been condemned by some reviewers for portraying the captured African slaves as a passive, undifferentiated group.At the end of \u201cBorrowed Finery,\u201d Ms. Fox tells of being reunited with the daughter she had borne at 20, the offspring of a brief liaison after her first marriage had ended. She gave the infant up for adoption, a decision, she wrote, that pained her the rest of her life. In middle age, the daughter, Ms. Carroll-Barraud, found Ms. Fox. (One of Ms. Carroll-Barraud\u2019s children, it transpired, is the rock singer Courtney Love.)Besides Ms. Carroll-Barraud, Ms. Fox is survived by her husband, Mr. Greenberg; a son, Adam Sigerson, from her second marriage; a half sister, Louise Fox; three half brothers, Keith, Bruce and James; eight grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.Ms. Fox\u2019s other honors include the Hans Christian Andersen Award, which she received in 1978 for her body of children\u2019s work.Given the subject matter of Ms. Fox\u2019s books, it is not surprising that some reviewers called them depressing. This did not sit well with her.\u201cChildren know about pain and fear and unhappiness and betrayal,\u201d she said in an interview quoted in the reference work Contemporary Authors. \u201cAnd we do them a disservice by trying to sugarcoat dark truths. There is an odd kind of debauchery I\u2019ve noticed, particularly in societies that consider themselves \u2018democratic\u2019 or \u2018liberal\u2019: They display the gory details but hide meaning, especially if it is ambiguous or disturbing.\u201dDaniel E.

Indeed, Trump\u2019s crisis has best been described as a \u201cslow-motion Cuban missile crisis\u201d \u2014 only the crisis-driver is not Fidel Castro, but North Korea\u2019s bizarre despot, Kim Jong-un.If this crisis is not keeping you up at night, you\u2019re not paying attention.Let\u2019s see, we have an untested, macho, Twitter-happy U.S. president facing off against the leader of a dynastic North Korean political cult who\u2019s building a long-range nuclear missile that could hit Los Angeles and who \u2014 allegedly \u2014 just had his half brother, Kim Jong-nam, knocked off by two women who wiped his face with a lethal nerve agent while he was transiting a Malaysian airport.Hey, what could go wrong?This Korean missile crisis has dragged on far longer than the famous \u201c13 days\u201d of the Cuban missile crisis, but don\u2019t let that fool you: \u201cWe\u2019re at an important inflection point,\u201d explains Robert Litwak, from the Wilson Center, one of the premier experts on rogue states. \u201cNorth Korea is on the verge of a strategic breakout that would enable its leadership to strike the United States with a nuclear-armed ICBM,\u201d or intercontinental ballistic missile.Have a nice day!While all eyes here have been focused on Trump, North Korea has been focused on perfecting the miniaturization of its nuclear stockpile into warheads that could fit on long-range ballistic missiles and on methodically testing those missiles, with mixed success, so far.Trump did not create this problem \u2014 it\u2019s been passed down to him from Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama \u2014 but he will have to fix it. And it has reached a point where the U.S. has only three options: awful, bad and worse. Or as Litwak describes them: \u201cbomb, acquiesce or negotiate.\u201dBombing North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile sites runs the risk of escalating into a second (possibly nuclear) Korean war with over a million casualties. North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities are \u201chot,\u201d and bombing them could have untold consequences in terms of radioactivity. Alternatively, acquiescing to a breakout means this failed state could \u2014 incredibly \u2014 become a major nuclear power with a global reach. \u201cSo that just leaves negotiating,\u201d says Litwak.Donald Trump negotiating with Kim Jong-un does have a certain pay-per-view quality about it, but it\u2019s the least bad option. And to make it more interesting, the model that Trump should follow, argues Litwak, is the nuclear deal that Obama struck with Iran, which Trump once described as \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated.\u201dThink again.Obama had the same three choices on Iran: bomb, acquiesce or negotiate. He did not want to bomb Iranian nuclear installations, because of the uncontrollable events bombing could unleash, and he did not want to acquiesce. So Obama negotiated what Litwak calls a \u201cpurely transactional\u201d deal \u2014 Iran agreed to a 15-year halt on processing weapons-usable fissile material in return for significant sanctions relief, and no other behaviors were covered.Obama\u2019s bet? Something will happen in these 15 years that will be \u201ctransformational,\u201d says Litwak, and provide the only true security \u2014 a change in the character of Iran\u2019s regime.Trump should follow that path, argues Litwak: Get North Korea to freeze its nuclear warheads at present levels \u2014 around 15 \u2014 freeze all production of weapons-usable fissile material and freeze all ballistic missile testing \u2014 so it cannot hit the U.S. \u2014 in return for an easing of economic sanctions and some economic aid.\u201cIt would be a transactional deal that constrains North Korea\u2019s capabilities and buys time for a transformation, just like the Iran deal did,\u201d says Litwak. The Kim cult should go for it, because it keeps them in power with a minimum deterrence against a U.S. invasion. And China might finally be willing to help with this deal, because freezing North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability would likely forestall China\u2019s rivals \u2014 Japan and South Korea \u2014 from getting nukes of their own. But Trump will need China, so he\u2019d better think twice about starting a trade war with Beijing.Trump will soon discover that in foreign policy, everything is like Obamacare \u2014 easy to criticize, more transactional than transformational, but all the other options are worse. And there are no pure wins to boast about. Those only happen on TV shows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of England Official Resigns After Critical Parliament Report", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 A senior Bank of England official who had been named a deputy governor at the central bank has resigned after a Parliament committee found that her failure to disclose a potential conflict of interest showed she lacked the competence to take on a new role overseeing banks and financial markets.The official, Charlotte Hogg, offered her resignation on Monday and it was accepted on Tuesday morning, the central bank said.Ms. Hogg, whose family has deep roots in British politics, had been named the bank\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking. But she faced opposition after admitting she did not disclose that her brother held a senior position at Barclays during her time at the central bank, despite her having a role in drafting a code of conduct policy that required a disclosure of such conflicts.Her resignation is the latest controversy to face Bank of England as some politicians have questioned whether it had become politicized under the bank\u2019s governor, Mark J. Carney, in the run-up to Britain\u2019s referendum last June on whether to leave the European Union.Ms. Hogg, 46, was part of a team brought in by Mr. Carney to modernize the central bank\u2019s operations. She began her career at the Bank of England before returning as its chief operating officer in July 2013. In the interim, she worked at a variety of companies, including the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, the banks Morgan Stanley and Santander, and the credit reporting company Experian.Her resignation is the latest in a set of controversies that have dogged the Bank of England under Mr. Carney, particularly since the so-called Brexit referendum.Britain\u2019s economy has performed better than expected since the June vote despite dire warnings by the central bank about the potential impact of Britain\u2019s leaving the 28-country bloc.In the case of Ms. Hogg, the Treasury Committee said that she did not deliberately conceal her brother\u2019s role as director in group strategy at Barclays or that any prior conflict had arisen.But it said that her conduct was \u201cmore serious\u201d than a simple omission given the length of time before it was disclosed, her role in helping to draft the central bank\u2019s code of conduct and her \u201cfailure to appreciate the seriousness of that history of noncompliance.\u201dIn her new role, she would have been a member of the Prudential Regulation Committee, which discusses \u201cfirm-specific information and reaches supervisory judgments, both of which the bank describes as \u2018highly commercially-sensitive,\u2019\u201d the Treasury Committee noted.While praising improvements in the central bank\u2019s transparency, accountability and governance, the Treasury Committee said that the incident involving Ms. Hogg raised \u201cwider concerns\u201d about the bank\u2019s governance and that further reform may be needed.On Tuesday, the Bank of England said it would reconfigure its reporting lines and internal structures in order to better safeguard the governance of its code of conduct, compliance and disciplinary procedures.It also said its nonexecutive directors would conduct a review to ensure compliance at the most senior levels of the bank.Ms. Hogg\u2019s family has close ties to Britain\u2019s Conservative Party.She is the daughter of Douglas and Sarah Hogg, who both served in former Prime Minister John Major\u2019s government. Her mother, an economist, a former journalist and now a baroness, was the first chairwoman of a listed company in the FTSE 100, an index of the biggest companies traded in London. Her paternal grandfather, Quintin Hogg, was also a long-serving member of Parliament.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Putin Under Pressure", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe anti-government demonstrations were the largest in more than five years, drawing tens of thousands of people into the streets in scores of cities despite a sweeping ban on unsanctioned rallies. The protests called for the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev; their proximate cause was a 50-minute video produced by Aleksei Navalny and other opposition allies and viewed more than 13 million times on social media. The video alleged that Mr. Medvedev had received bribes from prominent oligarchs that enabled him to maintain fancy estates, vineyards and yachts in Russia and overseas. The protests also reflected broader public discontents, including unhappiness with the economy and the government\u2019s suppression of peaceful demonstrations.Without directly attacking Mr. Putin, whose public approval rating remains high, Mr. Navalny has focused on corruption, which is endemic in Russia, and some believe it could be Mr. Putin\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. Nevertheless, the obstacles to unseating Mr. Putin are formidable; indeed, a previous trumped-up conviction may make it difficult for Mr. Navalny to run for office.Mr. Putin remains firmly in the driver\u2019s seat, but Sunday\u2019s events should give him pause. Many protesters were young people who reportedly get their news from more independent sources, not state-run media, and apparently are not cowed by the man in the Kremlin. Given Russia\u2019s economic, demographic and other challenges, Mr. Putin cannot be certain he can control the future even if he controls the present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: A Pickup Truck That\u2019s Both Primal and Pampering", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byDrivenPickup trucks are about superlatives. Best towing capability. Highest payload. Longest lasting. Most machismo \u2014 though I\u2019m not sure how to measure that last one.The guy framing the house down the street isn\u2019t the only one with a pickup. I know lawyers, politicians, photographers and a school principal who drive them. The Ram 1500 Night Edition crew cab in my keep for a week is better equipped than some luxury sedans. With a heated steering wheel, excellent touch-screen interface, stitching on the instrument panel and a punchy Alpine sound system, it\u2019s priced like one, too, at $55,850. But just try towing a boat with an Audi A4.The Ram 1500, like its truck brethren, comes in many different configurations. There are three cab sizes and three bed lengths that range from 5 feet 7 inches to eight feet. The Night, starting at $38,210 (before the inevitable incentives all pickups seem to have), is positioned in the middle of 12 models.As with any pickup, the 1500\u2019s capability varies depending on how the truck is ordered. Towing ability ranges from 4,200 to 10,700 pounds. Maximum payload goes from 1,470 to 1,900 pounds.There will be three engine choices once the Environmental Protection Agency certifies the V6 diesel. The base power plant is a 305-horsepower V6 with 269 pound-feet of torque.My Night tester runs with the famed 5.7-liter Hemi V8 engine that cranks out 395 horsepower and 410 pound-feet of torque. Both available transmissions have 8 speeds. The button-operated 4-wheel-drive system is so simple that the job site manager can use it (a little construction yard humor there). For those who hate running boards, the $1,715 air suspension with remote lowering from the key fob makes loading your old dog easier.The Night is equipped with a Mopar exhaust, and its Wagnerian engine note will announce to the neighborhood \u2014 and perhaps the next one over \u2014 that someone just bought a new truck. Pure cave man in its primal tone, the engine will make it impossible to sneak home late at night. That said, it\u2019s highly recommended.Unless your work boot is hard into the throttle summoning that delicious rumble, the Ram goes about its business in refined form. Modern pickups pamper the crew, and Ram is about as comfortable as a truck can be. Sure, there are the occasional slight course corrections from the steering wheel found on any pickup. But the Night, with its blacked-out badges, grille and wheels, motors down the highway with confident visual swagger.Ram does not make a midsize truck, so the 1500 is as tidy as it gets with the brand. It doesn\u2019t feel overly large from behind the wheel, unless you are trying to squeeze through Times Square.None of these rigs will be confused with a Prius when it comes to fuel economy. The E.P.A. rates the 1500, equipped with 4-wheel-drive and the Hemi V8, at 15 miles per gallon in the city and 21 m.p.g. on the highway, with an average of 17 m.p.g. A comparably powered Nissan Titan returns an average of 18 m.p.g.; Chevy Silverado, 17; Ford F-150, 16; and Toyota Tundra, 15.Still, there\u2019s a lot to like when you walk up to a Ram pickup. It looks as if it would win a bar fight. And inside, there are clever features that should be adapted for all vehicles. A small rubber bumper grips smartphones perfectly. There are two glove boxes. Notebook computers drop effortlessly into the center console. Admittedly, it would be tough to wedge that kind of storage space between the seats of a Subaru.If it\u2019s been a decade since you have looked at a pickup trunk, you will appreciate stuff like LED lighting in the bed and the availability of lockable storage (that can be used as a cooler). But Ram\u2019s undampened tailgate drops with a bang if not lowered by hand, and there are no bumper cutouts that act as boot steps.The crew cab\u2019s back seat is spacious for three adults. By flipping those seat cushions upward, a bunch of big-screen TVs or a generator can easily slide into the cab for better security.One absolute Ram can\u2019t be proud of? Consumer Reports ranks the reliability of Fiat Chrysler products at the back of the pack. Yet Ram gained a tiny amount of market share last year. That\u2019s impressive in a segment where brand loyalty rules. It could have something to do with the look and sound. The Ram 1500 has plenty of presence while it gets the job done.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trumpism at Its Best, Straight Up", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byDonald Trump gave us Trumpism at its best on Tuesday night. And that was useful because it gave us a view of the political movement he represents, without the clownish behavior.The first thing we learned was that Trumpism is an utter repudiation of modern conservatism. For the last 40 years, the Republican Party has been a coalition of three tendencies. On Tuesday, Trump rejected or ignored all of them.There used to be Republican foreign policy hawks, people who believed that it was in America\u2019s interest to serve as a global policeman, actively preserving a democratic world order. Trump explicitly repudiated this worldview, drawing instead a sharp distinction between what\u2019s good for America and what\u2019s good for the rest of the world.There used to be social conservatives, who believed that the moral fabric of the country had been weakened by secularism and the breakdown of the family. On Tuesday, Trump acted as if this group didn\u2019t exist. He didn\u2019t mention a single social issue \u2014 abortion, religious liberty, marriage, anything.Finally, there used to be fiscal hawks who worried about the national debt. Trump demolished these people, too, vowing a long list of spending programs and preservation of entitlement programs.The Republicans who applauded Trump on Tuesday were applauding their own repudiation. They did it because partisanship is stronger than philosophy, but also because Reagan conservatism no longer applies to current reality.The second thing we saw was how Trump\u2019s ethnic nationalism emerges from the wreckage of the old G.O.P. Healthy American political philosophies balance individualism and collectivism, personal freedom and communal cohesion.The old Reagan conservatism was economic individualism restrained by social and religious traditionalism. Conservatives could embrace the creative destruction of the free market because they believed that the communal order could be held together by traditional morals and the collective attachments of family, church and local organizations.But in the 1990s conservatism devolved from a flexible balance to a crude anti-government philosophy, the Leave Us Alone coalition. Republicans talked as if Americans\u2019 problem was they were burdened by too many restraints and the solution was to get government off their backs.That may have been true of the businessmen who make up the G.O.P. donor class, but regular voters felt adrift and uprooted, untethered and exposed. Regular Republicans didn\u2019t want more freedom and more risk in their lives. They wanted more protection and security. They wanted a father figure government that would protect them from the disruptions of technological change and globalization.Donald Trump came along and offered them exactly that kind of strong government. He is not offering compassionate government, the way a Democrat might, but he is offering forceful government.Trump would use big government to crack down on enemies foreign and domestic. He\u2019d use government to create millions of jobs for infrastructure projects. He\u2019d use government to force or bribe corporations to locate plants here \u2014 the guarded order of national corporatism over the wide-open riskiness of free-market capitalism.The third thing we learned is that much of Trump\u2019s policy agenda contradicts his core philosophy. Trumpism is all about protection, security and order. But many of Trump\u2019s policies would introduce more risk into people\u2019s lives, not less.Trump\u2019s health care plan \u2014 tax credits and health saving accounts \u2014 would increase choice, instability and risk for individual health care consumers. His school-choice ideas might make for more competitive education markets, but they would also increase risk and insecurity for individual consumers.It\u2019s likely that Republican voters will simply reject these proposals. They\u2019ve got enough risk in their lives. It\u2019s quite likely that large elements of the Trump agenda will go down in flames because they go against what the country wants and even against his own core brand.Fourth, Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday offered those of us who want to replace him an occasion to ask the big question: How in the 21st century should government unleash initiative and dynamism while also preserving order? Trump\u2019s answer: Nationalize intimidation but privatize compassion. Don\u2019t look to government to offer a warm hand; look to it to confront your enemies with a hard fist.Human development research offers a different formula: All of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base. If government can create a framework in which people grow up amid healthy families, nurturing schools, thick communities and a secure safety net, then they will have the resources and audacity to thrive in a free global economy and a diversifying skills economy.This is a response that is open to welfare state policies from the left and trade and macroeconomic policies from the free-market right \u2014 a single-payer health care system married to the flat tax.The last thing Trump showed was this: We\u2019re in a state of radical flux. Political parties can turn on a dime. At least that means it\u2019s a time to think anew.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Xi Jinping, Seeking to Extend Power, May Bend Retirement Rules", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 For years, China\u2019s Communist Party has maintained a check on the power of its leaders by calling on them to retire if they have reached age 68 when a new term begins.Now President Xi Jinping, already the strongest Chinese leader in decades, may be maneuvering to bend those rules to retain a formidable ally \u2014 and create a precedent he could use to extend his own time in power.Mr. Xi, 63, who has shaken up many political norms, does not want to be shackled by an informal rule created by his predecessors, people close to senior officials have said.Whether Mr. Xi can get away with changing the age ceiling for staying in the party\u2019s top rank, the Politburo Standing Committee, has become a bellwether of how far he can consolidate his grip on a new party leadership that will be chosen in the fall.Mr. Xi\u2019s immediate goal appears to be opening the way to retaining Wang Qishan, who has led his signature anticorruption drive and become one of the most powerful and feared officials in China, those people and other observers said. Mr. Wang, who is 68, could be forced to step down this year if the informal age ceiling holds.Mr. Wang\u2019s fate has become one of the most intensely followed parts of the secretive maneuvering ahead of a Communist Party leadership shake-up late this year and is likely to be a topic of back-room speculation when the national legislature convenes here on Sunday.Mr. Wang\u2019s staying on is a strong possibility, though not a certainty, said a retired Chinese official who knows several leaders, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss elite political deliberations. He said that Mr. Xi said that the age rule was not absolute, which was understood by officials to mean that he wanted Mr. Wang to be considered for the next term.A party congress this fall will almost certainly reappoint Mr. Xi as party general secretary for five more years and appoint a new team to serve under him. Five of seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee must retire then under the current age limits, including Mr. Wang.The retirement age has been changed for political ends before. In 1997, President Jiang Zemin imposed a ceiling of 70 to dispense with one rival, and five years later reduced it to 68 to push out another. (He made an exception for himself, staying on as party leader until he was 76.)But while Mr. Xi is formidable, he may have to make trade-offs. Mr. Wang\u2019s chances of staying on may not survive the bartering among the party elite who choose the new lineup.In particular, Mr. Xi may face suspicions that he wants to use Mr. Wang as a stalking horse for keeping power beyond the usual two terms as top leader. That, too, is an informal rule that has developed since the 1990s, when Deng Xiaoping sought to prevent another dictator-for-life like Mao.By law, Mr. Xi can serve only two terms as president, but no law prevents him from retaining the more powerful post of party leader or some other position. Mr. Xi will turn 69 in 2022 when his second term as party general secretary ends.Neither Mr. Xi nor Mr. Wang has said anything publicly about his plans. That would be nearly unthinkable hubris in the shadow play of Chinese politics, where ambition and power plays come cloaked in high-minded rhetoric and rules.But the talk about Mr. Wang took off last October, when a party official, Deng Maosheng, told foreign reporters in Beijing that the age rule was not set in stone.At the time, it was unclear whether Mr. Deng was echoing the views at the top of the party. His comments were not reported in Chinese media.But before Mr. Deng\u2019s public remarks, Mr. Xi had said behind closed doors that the age rule was \u201cnot absolute,\u201d said the former official who knows several members of the party leadership.His account was corroborated by a former American official with extensive high-level contacts in China. He spoke on condition of anonymity to protect those contacts. He said two people who meet with senior leaders had told him that Mr. Xi had played down the \u201cseven up, eight down\u201d rule.Both unnamed sources said that, as far as they knew, Mr. Xi had not yet expressly demanded that Mr. Wang be kept on. Instead, by raising the age issue, Mr. Xi has signaled that Mr. Wang should be considered in discussions over coming months.After Deng Xiaoping began to free up the economy in the late 1970s, Mr. Wang abandoned a nascent career as a historian and became an expert on economic reforms. In the 1990s and early 2000s he took a series of government jobs cleaning up financial messes.\u201cYou were my teacher,\u201d Mr. Wang told Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, Mr. Paulson wrote in a book on dealing with China. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure we should be learning from you anymore.\u201dMr. Wang also displays a deep red streak of faith in authoritarian one-party rule not so far from Mr. Xi\u2019s convictions.Some in Beijing say they believe that with China\u2019s economy slowing and straining under debt, and President Trump threatening to curb Chinese exports, Mr. Xi could make a case for making Mr. Wang prime minister.Most insiders consider the move unlikely, however. Mr. Wang would be reluctant to take the job unless Mr. Xi gave him a bigger say over the economy, said Deng Yuwen, a commentator in Beijing who formerly edited a party newspaper. Mr. Xi might be unwilling to share that power.\u201cThe reason Li can\u2019t get much done is that everyone knows where the real power is,\u201d Mr. Deng said. \u201cWang Qishan would certainly want to be more like a traditional premier, with more power over the major economic decisions.\u201dThe retired official said that Mr. Wang had told friends that he was ready to retire at the end of the year. But Mr. Wang has also said he never expected to become the head of the party\u2019s anticorruption agency, and has warned officials always to be prepared for unexpected tasks.Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}

In taking power from the National Assembly, the ruling removed what most consider to be the only remaining counterbalance to the president\u2019s growing power in the country.The court said that lawmakers were \u201cin a situation of contempt,\u201d and that while that lasted, the justices themselves would step in to \u201censure that parliamentary powers were exercised directly by this chamber, or by the body that the chamber chooses.\u201d It did not say whether it might hand power back.Members of the National Assembly denounced the ruling on Thursday.\u201cThey have kidnapped the Constitution, they have kidnapped our rights, they have kidnapped our liberty,\u201d said Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the body, holding a crumpled copy of the ruling before reporters on Thursday.Oneida Guaipe, an opposition lawmaker from the country\u2019s central coast, said the body would continue to do its work, even if its laws would now be ignored when it produced legislation. \u201cThis is demonstrating before the world the authoritarianism here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people chose us through a popular vote.\u201dThe ruling was also a challenge to Venezuela\u2019s neighbors, which met in Washington this week to put pressure on the country to hold elections, and to discuss a possible expulsion of Venezuela from the O.A.S. on the grounds that the country is not democratic.Last week, the United States, Canada and a dozen of Latin America\u2019s largest nations called for Mr. Maduro to recognize the National Assembly\u2019s powers, a rare joint statement that reflected deep impatience with his government.\u201cWe consider it a serious setback for democracy in Venezuela,\u201d the United States State Department said on Thursday of the court decision. Peru withdrew its ambassador in protest.David Smilde, an analyst from the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group, said it might now be up to Venezuela\u2019s neighbors to encourage the country to hold elections again, given resistance from within the government. \u201cThe Maduro government seems to have no intention of respecting the basic elements of electoral democracy,\u201d he said.Critics say a long litany of other moves by the government are taking a toll on Venezuela\u2019s democracy. Perhaps most visible to Venezuelans was an effort last year to hold a recall referendum against the president, whose popularity is sinking along with the country\u2019s collapsing economy.While such a referendum was permitted by the country\u2019s Constitution, and highly favored in polls, Mr. Maduro alternatively called the effort illegal or a coup staged by his opponents. In October, a lower court suspended the process on the grounds that there had been irregularities in the gathering of signatures.Meanwhile, political prisoners continued to be arrested. In January, Mr. Maduro established a new \u201canti-coup commando\u201d to round up political dissidents accused of treason. The group has taken aim at members of the opposition, arresting many, including a city councilman from central Venezuela and a deputy lawmaker in the National Assembly.In February, after CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, the network\u2019s Spanish language channel, broadcast an investigation that linked Venezuela\u2019s vice president to a passport fraud scheme in the Middle East, Mr. Maduro ordered the channel off the air. The government has blocked the Caracas bureau chief of The New York Times from entering the country since October.But to many, the gradual assault against the National Assembly, more than a year in the making, was the most telling sign of democratic erosion in Venezuela.\u201cIt has come in fragments,\u201d Carlos Ayala Corao, a Venezuelan lawyer and legal analyst, said of the court\u2019s actions against the legislature. \u201cThey have been slicing it in pieces.\u201dThe conflicts began in December 2015, when rising grievances about the country\u2019s faltering economy propelled Mr. Maduro\u2019s opposition to win control of the legislature. It was the first time in years that the chamber was not dominated by the movement founded by the former leftist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.Mr. Maduro initially said he accepted the vote. He even appeared before opposition lawmakers to give his annual address on the state of the government in January of last year. But the Supreme Court, packed with loyalists to Mr. Maduro shortly before the National Assembly took power, was chipping away at the chamber\u2019s powers.It refused to let it seat four lawmakers on the grounds that there had been voting irregularities. That denied the opposition of a supermajority, which would have given it expanded powers over Mr. Maduro. The National Assembly went back and forth on the ruling, but eventually complied.As the National Assembly began to get to work, it continued to clash with the court. By last spring, the legislature had written laws delivering on campaign promises like one measure to invigorate the economy and another to free more than 100 political prisoners, only to see the court overturn them as unconstitutional.When Mr. Maduro tried to increase his own powers under a state of emergency that he declared, the legislature rejected the effort. But the court sided with the president. In October, the court stripped the National Assembly of its power to review the annual budget, leaving Mr. Maduro in charge of the country\u2019s purse strings.More recently, legislators tried to block the president from pursuing oil ventures without their approval. In Wednesday\u2019s ruling stripping the National Assembly of its lawmaking powers, the court said the president had the right to make these oil deals.It said its ruling was justified by the Assembly\u2019s choice to keep the lawmakers onboard whose elections had been questioned earlier. This act, it said, rendered the Assembly itself invalid.With few protesters in the streets of Caracas on Thursday, it was unclear what popular support the opposition might get from the public.Analysts say many Venezuelans feel as dispirited by the opposition as by leftist leaders, given the opposition\u2019s continued defeat by the government. Opposition leaders called for protests on Saturday and in the coming week but have been unable to draw large crowds since last fall.John Magdaleno, a political consultant, said he expected a wider crackdown against the opposition from Mr. Maduro in coming weeks, and possibly more arrests.\u201cIn my opinion, from now on, there will be growing pressures against lawmakers,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s probable there will be much greater persecution of political leaders.\u201dNicholas Casey reported from Iquitos, Peru, and Patricia Torres from Caracas, Venezuela.

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Epidemic of Infallibility", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byTwo weeks after President Trump claimed, bizarrely, that the Obama administration had wiretapped his campaign, his press secretary suggested that GCHQ \u2014 Britain\u2019s counterpart to the National Security Agency \u2014 had done the imaginary bugging. British officials were outraged. And soon the British press was reporting that the Trump administration had apologized.O.K., at this point it\u2019s not news that the commander in chief of the world\u2019s most powerful military is a man you wouldn\u2019t trust to park your car or feed your cat. Thanks, Comey. But Mr. Trump\u2019s pathological inability to accept responsibility is just the culmination of a trend. American politics \u2014 at least on one side of the aisle \u2014 is suffering from an epidemic of infallibility, of powerful people who never, ever admit to making a mistake.Later, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, a similar inability to admit error was on display among many economic commentators.So nobody is perfect. The point, however, is to try to do better \u2014 which means owning up to your mistakes and learning from them. Yet that is something that the people now ruling America never, ever do.But what\u2019s going on with Mr. Trump and his inner circle seems to have less to do with ideology than with fragile egos. To admit having been wrong about anything, they seem to imagine, would brand them as losers and make them look small.In reality, of course, inability to engage in reflection and self-criticism is the mark of a tiny, shriveled soul \u2014 but they\u2019re not big enough to see that.But why did so many Americans vote for Mr. Trump, whose character flaws should have been obvious long before the election?Catastrophic media failure and F.B.I. malfeasance played crucial roles. But my sense is that there\u2019s also something going on in our society: Many Americans no longer seem to understand what a leader is supposed to sound like, mistaking bombast and belligerence for real toughness.Why? Is it celebrity culture? Is it working-class despair, channeled into a desire for people who spout easy slogans?The truth is that I don\u2019t know. But we can at least hope that watching Mr. Trump in action will be a learning experience \u2014 not for him, because he never learns anything, but for the body politic. And maybe, just maybe, we\u2019ll eventually put a responsible adult back in the White House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pillars of the West Shaken by \u2018Brexit,\u2019 but They\u2019re Not Crumbling Yet", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisTwo years of grinding divorce negotiations now begin, with the outcome unclear, except that the talks are certain to be contentious and spiteful \u2014 and that the only sure winners will be lawyers and trade negotiators.For the first time, the European bloc is losing a member, not to mention its second-largest economy. The multilateral architecture that has shaped the Western world since the aftermath of World War II has taken a severe blow, and as the letter was delivered on Wednesday, questions abounded about whether this pivot toward nationalism and self-interest represented the beginning of a more volatile global era.The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.Picking winners at such a volatile moment is perilous, but many analysts agree that the British withdrawal, and the uncertainty it produced, has been good news for Russia, and possibly for China, as two large powers that can exercise greater leverage in negotiations with individual European capitals than with a tightly unified European bloc that, taken together, is a geopolitical powerhouse.\u201c \u2018Brexit\u2019 surely strengthens the disintegrative processes already underway in the E.U., and therefore is a boon\u201d to Russia, said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe E.U. is more powerful than any single actor, even Germany, so anything that diminishes a rival in the zero-sum terms in which Russia thinks strengthens the Russian voice in Europe.\u201dThe coming exit from the European Union has already turned Britain inward, with the government and the country\u2019s powerful tabloid news media fixated on the particulars of its withdrawal: the uncertainties of whether the country will maintain access to the bloc\u2019s single market; demands that the country take control of its borders to stunt immigration; and an insistence on \u201creclaiming sovereignty\u201d by returning lawmaking powers to London.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Those themes of national sovereignty and curbing immigration resonate across the Continent, which is why some saw the British exit as a political precursor and the European Union as an endangered species.With her government desperate to maintain Britain\u2019s standing in the world, Mrs. May has turned to President Trump. He and his chief political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, are deeply skeptical of multilateralism, free trade and \u201centangling alliances.\u201d While NATO may pass muster as a security shield (provided everyone pays up), the European Union, like the United Nations, seems an example of the world that Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon want to dismantle or, at the very least, weaken.Yet Mrs. May has also tried to present Britain as committed to globalization and to global trade \u2014 as, effectively, still open for business. It is a tricky circle to square, demonstrating how difficult it is to predict Britain\u2019s future. Some envision the country\u2019s fate as being a European equivalent of Singapore, sovereign and respected, a partner eagerly sought by the rest of the world. Others warn that Britain could be left much more isolated than it is now, especially since European leaders feel they must strike a hard bargain.\u201cThere is a political imperative that \u2018Brexit\u2019 not be seen as a success,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cbecause every government in Europe is challenged to some degree by resurgent nationalists who would be encouraged and inspired by a \u2018Brexit\u2019 success.\u201dFor those British lawmakers in favor of the withdrawal, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative legislator, the exit \u201cis a wonderful liberation for my country.\u201dThe single market, he told Prospect magazine, \u201cis a bureaucratic, highly regulated means of making British business more inefficient \u2014 it\u2019s about having a closed, inward-looking Fortress Europe approach, rather than engaging with the world.\u201dThere is \u201cno political event in my lifetime that has been better or more exciting for the nation,\u201d he added.But Mr. Leonard has his doubts.\u201cBritain may be sailing off to sea,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the welcoming arms won\u2019t be that numerous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s everyone\u2019s choice to make in the context of their work environment,\u201d says Ms. Leonard.Ultimately, the goal of the strike is to build a movement of women who agree that the wellbeing of a society stems from affordable child care and health care and an equal living wage.\u201cHistorically, when the state declines to provide things like health care and child care, those responsibilities are thrown back on the home and the family,\u201d says Ms. Leonard. \u201cThe people who usually do most of the work in the home to support the family are women.

{"Headline": "Firebrand Hindu Cleric Yogi Adityanath Picked as Uttar Pradesh Minister", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s governing party on Saturday appointed a firebrand Hindu cleric to lead the country\u2019s most populous state, a turning point for a government that has, until now, steered clear of openly embracing far-right Hindu causes.The choice of Yogi Adityanath \u2014 who has been repeatedly accused of stirring anti-Muslim sentiments \u2014 to lead Uttar Pradesh, came as a shock to many political observers here, who have become accustomed to the carefully moderated public positions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in line with his projected image as a pro-development leader and global statesman.Mr. Adityanath has openly called for India to be enshrined as a \u201cHindu rashtra,\u201d or Hindu nation, and supports the rebuilding of a temple to the Hindu god Ram, also known as Rama, on the site of a razed 16th-century mosque, a project that was halted after it incited bloody religious riots in the 1990s.With the appointment, Mr. Modi \u201cis unveiling a vision of benign majoritarianism,\u201d said Shekhar Gupta, a longtime editor and political talk show host. \u201cThat means it\u2019s a Hindu country, that\u2019s the fact, and we\u2019ll be nice to you if you behave yourself.\u201dFor Mr. Modi, the appointment represents a \u201cfinal rejection of Nehruvian socialism, which almost gave the minorities a slightly exalted status,\u201d said Mr. Gupta, referring to Jawaharlal Nehru, India\u2019s first prime minister and independence leader.Mr. Adityanath, who is often seen wearing the saffron robes of a Hindu priest, told followers he would focus on Mr. Modi\u2019s economic agenda.India is 80 percent Hindu, 14 percent Muslim and 2.3 percent Christian, according to the 2011 census.The selection of a hard-line Hindu chief minister suggests that the party credits right-wing activists for swinging the vote, said Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow in the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\u201cThe only conclusion one can draw is that he feels the base is mobilized and that they helped deliver this, and that there would be pushback if they did not get something in return,\u201d Mr. Vaishnav said. He added that he was \u201cbaffled\u201d by the choice, which shifts attention away from the pro-growth, development agenda that has been at the center of Mr. Modi\u2019s political movement.\u201cI think it\u2019s a regressive choice, and a lost opportunity for the prime minister,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a huge mandate, a huge victory. But there is going to be a backlash if he doesn\u2019t figure out the jobs question. That\u2019s issue No. 1.\u201dParty loyalists praised the decision. Some members made the case that Mr. Adityanath\u2019s selection did not represent a departure from Mr. Modi\u2019s 2014 pledge to focus on the economy and create jobs.Others openly celebrated the advent of a more muscular Hindu agenda.\u201cJustice to all, appeasement to none,\u201d said Sudhanshu Mittal, a Bharatiya Janata Party leader, in comments to NDTV, a cable news station.\u201cAppeasement,\u201d in this context, is typically understood to mean policies favoring the rights of Indian Muslims.\u201cAs a devout Hindu sannyasi,\u201d or someone who has renounced worldly things, \u201che will guarantee that the state doesn\u2019t discriminate, and justice for all,\u201d said Tarun Vijay, a former B.J.P. member of Parliament. He added that as chief minister, Mr. Adityanath \u201cmay make jihadi intolerant Muslims learn an alphabet of humanity and accepting differences as an Indian.\u201dMr. Adityanath, 44, was born Ajay Mohan Bisht, and studied mathematics before joining the priesthood. He rose to prominence as part of the campaign to rebuild the Ram temple, and has repeatedly been charged with fanning religious tensions.In 2007, he spent 15 days in jail on charges of inciting riots, The Hindustan Times reported. He was booked again later in the year, when riots broke out after he made a speech. He is still facing trial in the two cases, the newspaper reported.He won his parliamentary seat in 1998, and was re-elected four times.He has particularly strong support among Hindu priests and seers, who urged the B.J.P. to name him chief minister, saying it would clear the way for the construction of the Ram temple.Advertisement"}

Garcetti.Southern California is going through a building boom, and the city has approved a series of dense and tall projects over the ire of some neighborhood groups upset not only with what they see as overdevelopment, but also the influence of deep-pocketed special interests at City Hall. They argue a two-year moratorium will force Los Angeles to adopt uniform zoning plans to guide how neighborhoods should handle developments.Opponents \u2014 including Mr. Garcetti and labor unions \u2014 warn it would be damaging to the economy and throttle any effort to build desperately needed affordable housing here. Both arguments have been played out in television advertisements and billboards across town.Mr. Garcetti has campaigned nearly as hard against the measure as he has for his own re-election. One side note here: Mr. Garcetti, who faces 10 little-known opponents, needs to win 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff. Low turnout races can be dicey, especially with an initiative that could bring out people upset with the direction Los Angeles is taking under Mr. Garcetti.The second measure worth watching is a Los Angeles countywide sales tax increase to pay for services for the homeless. This follows a vote by Los Angeles city voters last year to finance $1.2 billion in bonds to build housing for the homeless. Both measures would require a two-thirds vote by the electorate. Considering how much money will be released should this pass, Los Angeles could offer a test in the years ahead of a key question: Can government spend its way out homelessness?(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)We want to get more of your voices in California Today.To that end, a new plan: Each Monday, we\u2019ll come up with a question for you, solicit responses, then feature a handful by the end of the week.It sounds dangerous. But some bicycle groups argue that cyclists are in fact safer when they are allowed to move more freely.

{"Headline": "Printing the Ancient Way Keeps Buddhist Texts Alive in Tibet", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byDerge JournalDERGE, China \u2014 The dozen or so Tibetan men wearing aprons sat in pairs in low chairs, facing each other. Each pair bent over a thin rectangular wooden block and worked by sunlight streaming into the second-story room open to a courtyard.Their hands moved quickly. Over and over they went through the same motions, several times each minute: One man slathered red or black ink on the block, which was carved with Tibetan words and religious images. Then his partner placed a thin piece of white paper atop the block and, bending even lower, ran a roller over it. Seconds later, he whipped off the paper and put it aside to dry.\u201cThey are like this every day,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just the faith in their hearts. Of course, it\u2019s good to make offerings to the Buddha using a lot of money, but it\u2019s more faithful to make offerings using your body, mouth and mind.\u201dThe monastery also houses collections of sutras, including 830 classic scriptures and copies of more than 70 percent of ancient Tibetan manuscripts, she said. The founder of the monastery, Chokyi Tenpa Tsering, embraced works from the range of Tibetan Buddhist schools.\u201cHe was very open minded, like the ocean containing water from all rivers,\u201d she said.Besides trying to preserve the old blocks, the printing house has been making new ones since the 1980s. A decade from now, it is expected to have 400,000 blocks, Ms. Pema said.The printing blocks are constructed from red birchwood in 13 steps. At an early stage, the raw pieces of wood have to be soaked in feces for a half-year. Those that do not crack or break during this period are then made into printing blocks, Ms. Pema said. Craftsmen apply an herbal solution that repels rats and insects.The printing operations employ about 60 people. The men have been here for two decades on average, despite low pay, Ms. Pema said. Each day, they print about 2,500 pieces of paper, on both sides, to be collected as sutras and distributed across the Tibetan plateau.At its height, the press employed more than 500 people, and almost all were monks from the neighboring Gonchen Monastery. These days, the printers are laypeople.Clipped to a string were thangkas showing popular aspects of the pantheon: the seated Sakyamuni Buddha, the fingers of one hand touching the earth; Medicine Buddha, holding a bowl; Mahakala, the fierce protector deity that appears in paintings as a blue, multiarmed, fanged demon.In one corner of the room, an abbot sat discussing a text with one of the printers.He said the monks here had once operated a clinic. Now he and others were the inheritors of the tradition. Like the printing process here, the practice of Tibetan medicine had managed to survive the Mao era and the advent of a quasi-market economy.\u201cThere were myths that Tibetan medicine contained a large amount of mercury and lead, but actually its ingredients are just normal,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome theoretical studies have also proven that Tibetan medicine is scientific.\u201dOutside, pilgrims walked around the building to complete a kora, or holy circuit. Old women spun hand-held prayer wheels and hobbled along with walking sticks. The monastery was one of three pilgrimage sites in the Tibetan world, each representing the body, mouth and mind of the Buddha, Ms. Pema said.One visitor, Sonam, said he saw more traditional dress in Derge than anywhere else in the region. He pointed to women circling the monastery with coral and turquoise stones entwined into braids in their hair. \u201cThey have money,\u201d he said.Chanting emanated from loudspeakers. In hills to the east of the monastery stood clusters of red three-story wooden homes, a traditional design around religious centers in Kham.Even if the scene around the monastery evoked ancient customs, the town did not. Modern five-story buildings lined the valley walls along the river. Yellow construction cranes loomed above the skyline, a sight typical of cities big and small across China. At night, neon signs glowed.Katia Buffetrille, a scholar of Tibet at the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes in Paris, said the sprawl of the town had surprised her when she visited last year. She had last come here three decades earlier.The monastery was in bad shape in 1985, she said. But the printing press was functioning back then, years after the end of the destructive Cultural Revolution.\u201cThe operations of the printing press are today similar to what they were in 1985,\u201d Ms. Buffetrille said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many pages they print every day.\u201d\u201cThat can explain the bad quality of the printing sometimes,\u201d she added.But the traditions endure. On the afternoon I visited, in a monastic building uphill from the printing press, monks held a dharma ceremony, which they do every few weeks. One monk walked around a crowded courtyard sprinkling drops of water on worshipers. Others sat on a dais at the front, reading aloud from scriptures that had been printed by hand next door.Vanessa Piao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gazprom Makes Concessions in E.U. Gas Deal, but Trouble Looms for Russian Giant", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byAfter fitful negotiations spanning nearly two years, Gazprom moved a step closer on Monday to resolving a longstanding dispute with European antitrust regulators critical of the company\u2019s dominance in regional natural gas markets.News of the provisional agreement provides a welcome respite for the Russian state gas exporter and for the government in Moscow, which has long benefited from Gazprom\u2019s profits.The company\u2019s issues, however, run far deeper.Gazprom faces tighter profit margins at home, thanks to a more competitive domestic market, and overseas because of regulatory pressure in Europe. Several major projects are also either running behind schedule or have been delayed. In the longer term, increasing demand for renewable energy will affect the company, which is dependent on fossil fuel sales.On Monday, though, the energy giant got some good news.Countries in Central and Eastern Europe have long argued that Gazprom used its powerful position to inflate prices and quash competition. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, filed charges against the company in April 2015, accusing it of breaking regional antitrust rules.The commission said on Monday it had provisionally accepted commitments by Gazprom to address those charges. Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s competition commissioner, could have imposed a large fine and forced the company to change the way it does business, but thus far, she has not.Gazprom\u2019s deputy chairman, Alexander Medvedev, said in a separate statement that the provisional deal demonstrated the company\u2019s \u201cwillingness to address\u201d European concerns, and hoped the commission would \u201crespond positively\u201d to the company\u2019s commitments.The high level of mutual dependence involving the two sides helped pave the way for a settlement. The European Union relies on Gazprom for about a third of its natural gas supply, and Moscow earns significant revenue from selling that gas to Europe.It may signal an easing of at least some of the tensions between Russia and Europe, which have been at odds for years over what officials in Brussels say are aggressive tactics by Moscow to leverage the region\u2019s energy supply to extract diplomatic concessions.Europe has also sought to reduce reliance on Russian energy, as the two sides face off over a growing list of geopolitical disputes, including the conflict in Ukraine and the civil war in Syria.The move is not the final word: Gazprom\u2019s customers and competitors have seven weeks to comment. The vetting process, a regular step in antitrust settlements involving the European Commission, has led the commission to abandon deals in the past, but that outcome is relatively rare.Still, it is a major step toward ending the case and providing some measure of closure for Gazprom.The company, formerly the Soviet ministry of gas, has long functioned as a bottomless expense account for Moscow. For years, it propped up the Russian budget, at times accounting for as much as a tenth of the country\u2019s tax revenue. In a sign of the company\u2019s political importance to the government in Moscow, Ms. Vestager noted on Monday that Russian ministers had joined Gazprom delegations on multiple occasions in talks over the dispute.With the government grappling with sanctions and austerity, and Russia\u2019s economy only meekly emerging from a recession, budget contributions from Gazprom in the form of dividends are more important than ever.The sprawling business, which controls the world\u2019s largest reserve of natural gas, is 50 percent owned by the government, with the remainder trading on exchanges in London and Moscow. Wary of its politicized management, though, investors have mostly stayed away in recent years. From a peak market capitalization of $367 billion in May 2008, Gazprom\u2019s value has plummeted, sitting at around $52 billion on Monday.And in recent years, as the energy market has shifted, so have the company\u2019s prospects.Oil prices \u2014 many of Gazprom\u2019s gas-exporting contracts are linked to them \u2014 fell from above $100 a barrel about two years ago to less than $30 last year, and are still only hovering at around $50 a barrel.It also faces tough competition both at home and abroad.Though it retains a legal monopoly on exports from Russia, domestic rivals are raising their production of natural gas. Gazprom, which owns the gas pipelines within Russia, is obliged by law to carry gas made by other producers for sale domestically. The increased supply has forced Gazprom to shut some of its own wells for lack of demand.World gas prices have also been under pressure thanks to vast new supplies of liquefied natural gas that can be transported worldwide on ships, upending the traditional requirement for pipelines and shaking up a market that had largely functioned within regions. The prospect of huge volumes of shale gas from North America has also helped keep prices low.Russia\u2019s own economic problems have consequences, as well. A fiscal shortfall means there is less capital available to invest in energy projects, while those that are underway have fallen behind schedule.Analysts expect Gazprom\u2019s highest-profile project, a pipeline to China called the Power of Siberia, to be delayed. The company insists it is on track to be working in 2019, but planned spending has been pushed back. Other proposals not yet started have been put off.Gazprom is also under pressure from a shift in energy consumption patterns in Europe.Use of alternative energy has been steadily increasing in the region. By 2020, renewable power sources like wind and solar will meet all of the Continent\u2019s projected new demand, according to Kingsmill Bond, an energy analyst at the research firm Trusted Sources. After that, green energy is expected to whittle away at demand for fossil fuels.\u201cThis new energy revolution will create a structural drop in energy prices over time,\u201d Mr. Bond said. \u201cIt means the petro states and the old energy providers such as Russia find themselves in a very different position.\u201dThere are good signs, however.Though demand for gas in Europe may be weak, the region\u2019s indigenous supplies from countries like Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands are in decline because of dwindling reserves.And the latest deal, though still provisional, provides some cheer, indicating Gazprom\u2019s often-fraught relationship with the European Union could be improving.The antitrust allegations focused on Gazprom\u2019s stranglehold on energy supplies for formerly communist and Soviet-bloc countries like Poland and Lithuania. Gas prices in those countries have frequently been higher than prices in Western Europe.Among the issues regulators investigated was whether Gazprom harmed competition by reducing its customers\u2019 ability to resell gas across borders. They also looked at whether the company used its powerful market position in Bulgaria and Poland by making supplies of gas conditional on agreements from those countries to participate in pipeline projects carrying even more Russian gas to Europe.In its statement, the European Commission said Gazprom had pledged to remove restrictions on reselling gas; ensure that prices in Central and Eastern Europe were competitive; and not act on any advantages regarding gas infrastructure that it had obtained because of its dominant selling position.\u201cThe European regulator seems to have found a clean way to exit this highly political and highly complex case,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a professor at the University of Liege specializing in competition law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Choice of I.M.F. Critic Highlights Trump\u2019s Reversal of Global Policy", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byFor nearly 20 years, Adam Lerrick, a conservative economist, has been a vocal scold of global organizations like the International Monetary Fund, arguing that such institutions burn through taxpayer money and foster an insular culture of elitism, bailouts and scant accountability.Now, Mr. Lerrick, a former investment banker and a visiting scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, is set to get a chance to turn philosophy into policy, after the announcement last week that President Trump intended to nominate him as deputy under secretary of the Treasury for international finance.The selection of Mr. Lerrick, who is well known in global financial circles for his evangelical opposition to bailouts for banks, countries and investors, underscores how Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team is turning to critics of global economic policy as it seeks to reverse decades of Washington consensus.Notably, Peter Navarro, an academic and author known for his highly critical views on China\u2019s economic policies, was named a senior trade adviser to the president, with a brief to examine relations between the United States and countries like China and Germany.Mr. Lerrick\u2019s new job has not yet been formally announced, and he must be confirmed by the Senate before he can get to work.But his pending appointment signals that another major cornerstone of conventional thinking under Democratic and Republican administrations \u2014 broad support for the I.M.F., the World Bank and other international financial institutions \u2014 will be scrutinized at the highest levels of the new administration.Mr. Lerrick\u2019s official remit includes advancing the Treasury\u2019s policy agenda with America\u2019s top economic allies, but it is expected that a major part of his job \u2014 his first in government \u2014 will be to push for major changes in how the World Bank and the I.M.F. are run.His skepticism of the fund\u2019s role as presiding firefighter of the global financial system dates to the late 1990s, when he became disenchanted with the I.M.F.\u2019s response to countries in Southeast Asia experiencing runs on their currencies.In 1999, having already quit his career as a senior investment banker at Salomon Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston, Mr. Lerrick wrote a paper in which he argued that American taxpayers could save a bundle if the I.M.F. were allowed to tap global bond market funds rather than relying solely on quota-based disbursements from the United States and other large nations.In essence, Mr. Lerrick\u2019s complaint was that the fund had strayed too far from its original mandate: to provide short-term loans to developed economies running short on cash. Instead, he said, it had become a lender of first resort to developing economies in various states of financial distress.Mr. Lerrick, a conservative economist, argued in 1999 that American taxpayers could save money if the International Monetary Fund were allowed to tap global bond market funds rather than relying solely on disbursements from the United States and other large nations.It immediately caught the eye of Allan H. Meltzer, a top economist in the Reagan administration who hired Mr. Lerrick in 1999 to help him with a report, ordered by Congress, that examined the business models of the I.M.F., the World Bank and other international lending bodies supported by Washington.\u201cIt\u2019s corrupting to give money to countries like Greece that never reform; those are taxpayer monies the people who voted worked hard for,\u201d Mr. Meltzer, now a professor at the Tepper Business School at Carnegie Mellon University, said in an interview last week. \u201cIf we bail out countries that do things that are not in the interest of their citizens, then we just get more of the same. Adam is the right man for this job.\u201dMr. Lerrick declined to comment for this article.When it comes to preaching the no-bailout line, he is such a true believer that he has come to be seen among bond investors and hedge funds as a sort of prince of darkness, counseling finance ministers from Buenos Aires to Berlin to impose losses on investors when governments can no longer pay their debts. He played a leading role behind the scenes in both the Argentine and Greek debt-restructuring dramas and also advocated haircuts for depositors in Cyprus.Once in government, though, and in the thick of a financial calamity, economists may find deploying the expertise of the fund and its war chest tempting indeed.That is what happened in 2010, when the I.M.F. joined Europe in bailing out Greece, Ireland and Portugal; as a result, the fund\u2019s loan book jumped to a high of $96 billion in 2012, from just $9 billion in 2007.Since the global financial crisis, the policy mood toward such rescues has shifted in Mr. Lerrick\u2019s direction: Those left holding Greek bonds in 2012 took a big hit, depositors with more than 100,000 euros in Cypriot banks in 2013 lost money, and there are now laws in place in Europe that make bond investors pay when a bank fails.Called before the Senate in 2000 to testify about the I.M.F.\u2019s future and the extent to which the United States government should continue backing the institution, Mr. Lerrick was asked point-blank by a senator: Do you think we need an I.M.F.?Yes, he replied, there was a big role for the I.M.F. to play as a lender of last resort to emerging markets. The problem, he said, is that when the fund does all these other things, its utility is diminished.\u201cWhat I would propose is that there is a valuable role for the I.M.F. to play,\u201d Mr. Lerrick said. \u201cBut reforms must be instituted to make sure that the costs are minimized, if not eliminated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fame, Fortune and an Itch to Run for Office", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In Florida, they know John Morgan from his law firm\u2019s colorful personal injury ads and 1-800-number billboards.In New Orleans, Sidney Torres IV became a local celebrity after parlaying his real estate fortune and flashy lifestyle into crime-fighting and a reality TV career.And in Nevada, Stephen J. Cloobeck, the gregarious founder and former chief executive of Diamond Resorts, vaulted into popular culture on the TV show \u201cUndercover Boss.\u201dWhat do they have in common? Like the man who became president of the United States, all three are finding that wealth and fame can go only so far in fulfilling overwhelming personal ambition. Chasing the greater riches of power and prestige, each is considering a campaign for high office.Politics may have once struck the ultrarich as a ponderous, ladder-climbing pursuit for stiffly programmed former class presidents, but President Trump has demonstrated that it can at least be tried on one\u2019s own terms. If nothing else, the newest occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is proof positive that money, fame and an outsider\u2019s profile can matter more than experience, basic legislative expertise and the other traditional qualifications thought to represent barriers to entry.\u201cA lot of people are saying, \u2018My God, if Donald Trump can get elected, anybody can get elected,\u2019 \u201d said Steve Westly, a former eBay executive who ran for governor of California in 2006.Spurred by Mr. Trump\u2019s election \u2014 or at least encouraged by it \u2014 a contingent of rich, fairly famous and largely Democratic neophytes has begun to line up for some of the most important elections of 2017 and 2018, including for governorships in Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Nevada and New Mexico, and a mayoral race in New Orleans.Similar messages may also be heard in the coming months in New Jersey, where the comedian and former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Joe Piscopo is weighing a run for governor this year, and in Maine, where Adam Lee, who runs the largest car dealership in the state and is a familiar face thanks to television advertising, is mulling a 2018 bid for governor.Mr. Trump did not invent the practice of running for office as a rich, or celebrated, amateur. Both parties have fielded such aspirants over the years. Republicans had notable success with figures like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger.But Mr. Trump, many strategists believe, has opened a wider path for wealthy candidates who resemble localized versions of, well, Mr. Trump: unapologetic self-promoters who relish publicity and have no inhibitions about flaunting their wealth.And adapting the \u201cany press is good press\u201d Trump axiom, some of them talk freely about their aspirations, answering personal emails or speaking at length on their cellphones while eschewing the protective shield of public relations consultants that surrounds conventional politicians and is often quickly erected around first-time candidates.\u201cI gave away $6.8 million last year, and my taxes are paid current,\u201d said Mr. Cloobeck, 55, a major Democratic Party donor, taking a swipe at Mr. Trump\u2019s reportedly parsimonious philanthropy and his mysterious tax returns. \u201cThat\u2019s two things that are different between Trump and myself.\u201dTaking a page from President Trump\u2019s playbook, the rich, famous and newly political boast of their enormous private sector success and vast fortunes while venting fury at \u201ccareer politicians.\u201d Mr. Cloobeck attacked his state\u2019s political establishment with a broad, Trump-like brush: \u201cRight now in Nevada, the entire state\u2019s in disarray.\u201dThey may only selectively embrace the comparison, but Mr. Trump\u2019s precedent-shattering win has served as an accelerant for the dreams of wealthy political novices across the country, a group now asking themselves the same question posed to the mirror by so many ambitious officeholders contemplating reaching for another rung up: Why not me?Armed with an immense fortune and an easy, boastful manner, Mr. Cloobeck, whose former company promotes resort timeshares with the credo \u201cVacations for Life,\u201d said he was still deciding whether to run to be Nevada\u2019s governor in 2018. He is already testing out his anti-establishment message, slinging criticism like Mr. Trump at both parties.Mr. Torres offers a similar indictment of New Orleans, which is suffering through a spike in murders.\u201cIf we get the same-old, same-old politicians to take a same-old, same-old approach, I just don\u2019t see how that benefits the people of New Orleans,\u201d he said.The 41-year-old star of a new CNBC real estate show, \u201cThe Deed,\u201d Mr. Torres has made a name for himself locally by creating a crime app and a private security force for the French Quarter. Beginning an interview with a boast about his standing in the polls, he said he would spend $4 million of his own money if he runs for mayor this year and offered a Trump-like vow: \u201cI\u2019m not going to do things that are politically correct. I\u2019m going to do things that are right.\u201dMuch the way Mr. Trump dismissed questions about his checkered private life, Mr. Torres, who sports a man bun, predicted few voters would care about his having had a child out of wedlock with a model or recoil at an Instagram account that is heavier on images of his Gulfstream jet than of gumbo. In fact, Mr. Torres readily volunteers that he was asked to relocate his private jet when Mr. Trump used a local hangar for a rally last year.\u201cI believe everybody should have the opportunity to have nice things,\u201d he said.Jeff Apodaca, a former Univision executive who is likely to run for governor of New Mexico, is a comparatively buttoned-up figure. Even though his father was governor in the 1970s, Mr. Apodaca said the state\u2019s political class had failed the state\u2019s economy. Asked if he meant Democrats as well as Republicans, Mr. Apodaca repeated the broad-brush criticism.\u201cThey\u2019re more worried about their political careers than the people of New Mexico,\u201d he said.Mr. Apodaca said he would have explored a campaign regardless of the outcome in the presidential race. But he said he believed the Democratic Party establishment had been more open to him as a candidate because of Mr. Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign.\u201cI think the establishment, the people who are now encouraging me, they might have come on board a little more since Trump has won,\u201d Mr. Apodaca said. \u201cWe have to do something different in New Mexico.\u201dMr. Morgan, whose Morgan & Morgan advertising is ubiquitous across Florida, said Mr. Trump had exposed the power of a populist message and the comparative ineffectiveness of traditional political methods, like television advertising.A champion of drug decriminalization with a penchant for unfiltered Twitter posts and artful profanity, Mr. Morgan, 60, said he was considering a run for governor in 2018 on a virtually single-issue platform of raising the minimum wage to $14 or $15 per hour, from $8.10. He said he would pledge to serve one term only and then go home.Unburdened by the typical politician\u2019s sense of restraint, Mr. Morgan, having just returned from a winter sojourn on the Caribbean playground for the rich, St. Barts, offered a rapid-fire preview of his campaign in a series of emails. He said Mr. Trump had done \u201cenlightening\u201d things in his race, described his own public profile as \u201chuge\u201d and repeated the pledge to serve just one term.\u201cMost politicians are so insincere and phony you can\u2019t watch it,\u201d Mr. Morgan wrote. \u201cAnd most never made a payroll and don\u2019t really understand.\u201dSimilar messages may also be heard in the coming months in Maine, where Mr. Lee, who runs the largest car dealership in the state and is also a familiar face thanks to television advertising, is mulling a bid for governor.Other political newcomers with identities outside the political realm are also considering governor\u2019s races, including J. B. Pritzker, heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, in Illinois, and Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach, in Alabama.It is difficult to forecast how relatively untested outsiders will fare in difficult elections, and few wealthy newcomers turn out to be political prodigies like Mr. Trump. But national Democrats have largely welcomed the emergence of deep-pocketed, well-branded candidates: Party strategists see Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Apodaca as among the most promising contenders in their states, and view Mr. Morgan and Mr. Cloobeck as formidable, albeit more unpredictable, contenders for their party\u2019s nomination.Mr. Morgan, Mr. Cloobeck and Mr. Apodaca all said they would expect to spend substantial sums of their own money on any campaign, and also to raise a good deal more than that through their extensive personal and business connections.Yet the presence of Mr. Trump in the White House is not just leading some unlikely figures to envision themselves in governor\u2019s mansions or city halls \u2014 it is also offering food for thought to a group of business executives and celebrities who may harbor their own White House fantasies.This group includes the Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who has sought to raise his profile and has a cadre of people around him with experience in politics and journalism. Aides to Mr. Schultz are trying to schedule a meeting between him and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who pioneered an earlier, more costly and tightly controlled model for moguls to jump into politics.Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and gleeful Trump troll, gladly engaged on his own political ambitions via email, even praising Mr. Trump for recognizing that the nature of communications in campaigns had changed. (Though when asked directly if he was thinking of running for president, Mr. Cuban sounded more like a politician: \u201cNice try,\u201d he wrote, adding a smiley face.)Mr. Trump did not invent the practice of running for office as a rich amateur. Both parties have fielded wealthy newcomers over the years. Republicans of late have had somewhat more success electing business executives to high office, including Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida and Senator David Perdue of Georgia.But Mr. Trump may have established a precedent for wealthy candidates with quirky, even controversial r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Tad Devine, a Democratic consultant who advised Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016 during his presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump had \u201clowered the threshold for running for president\u201d and opened a way for other self-funded candidates up and down the ballot.\u201cA lot of people, particularly wealthy individuals, are going to think: If he did it, why can\u2019t I?\u201d Mr. Devine said, citing potential celebrity candidates in 2020 like George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey.Yet Ace Smith, a veteran California Democratic strategist who has witnessed many a wealthy, first-time candidate lose in his state, cautions that those contemplating a run should keep in mind that Mr. Trump was unique.\u201cHe was a seasoned veteran of the back-and-forth of politics, he knew how to get covered on TV, and he knew how social media now flows into traditional media,\u201d Mr. Smith said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the current relationship of Stephen J. Cloobeck to the company he founded, Diamond Resorts. He is its former chief executive, not its current one.Advertisement"}

Insurers are on the fence, and other powerful forces like pharmaceutical companies remain largely on the sidelines.But the White House appears increasingly confident about the prospects for a health care overhaul to pass in the House. In a meeting with conservative leaders in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he anticipated the most trouble in the Senate, where moderate and conservative lawmakers are opposing the plan for different reasons. He said he was prepared to pressure holdout senators by holding the kind of stadium-style rallies he led during his presidential campaign.The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said Republicans were \u201cgoing through the inevitable growing pains of being an opposition party to becoming a governing party.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a new system for people,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s all the more reason why we have to do what we said we would do and deliver for the American people, and govern and use our principles.\u201dThe Times would like to hear from Americans who are signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The array of groups taking strong positions against the bill is evidence that its potential consequences extend far beyond health insurance coverage, to much of the nation\u2019s economy.The opposition is also a powerful reminder of how many past efforts to overhaul the American health care system failed because of resistance by major interest groups. Winning the support of the health care and insurance industries allowed the Obama administration in 2010 to push through the most significant health care legislation since President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society.Within a few months after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, his administration had lined up support from health care providers, insurers, consumers and pharmaceutical makers by offering a grand bargain: The health bill would include a requirement that most Americans have health insurance, providing millions of new customers through the law\u2019s often substantial premium subsidies and its option for states to expand Medicaid. In exchange, hospitals would have to accept spending cuts and the health care industry would have to accept new taxes to pay for the legislation.The Obama White House dedicated enormous effort to win pledges of support before Democrats even put out a bill \u2014 an effort not replicated by the Trump White House or Republican leaders in Congress.But the Affordable Care Act also created an array of taxes that the Republicans now hope to wipe away, helping them win the support of groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Tax Reform, led by the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation issued estimates this week showing how much revenue the government could lose starting in 2018 under the Republican bill, which the party has called the American Health Care Act, as a result of repealing taxes on drug makers (nearly $25 billion over 10 years), insurers (nearly $145 billion), makers of medical devices (nearly $20 billion), and high-income households (more than $270 billion from taxes on earned income and investment income).\u201cThe American Health Care Act repeals the medical device tax, which will result in greater investments in medical cures, lower health care costs and more high-tech manufacturing jobs in communities across the United States,\u201d trumpeted the Medical Device Manufacturers Association.The extent to which these groups mobilize on behalf of the Republican bill may help determine whether it succeeds.For now, the supporters of the House bill seem badly outgunned by opponents. On Wednesday, as two congressional committees took up the Republican repeal-and-replace bill, the American Nurses Association and a coalition of hospital groups came out against the proposal.The A.M.A., which has nearly 235,000 members and calls itself the voice of the medical profession, sent a letter to leaders of the two committees on Tuesday saying it could not support the Republican bill \u201cbecause of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations.\u201dIn particular, the group said it opposed a plan to replace the sliding, income-based premium tax credits provided under the Affordable Care Act with fixed credits based on age. The current system, it said, \u201cprovides the greatest chance that those of the least means are able to purchase coverage.\u201dAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance lobby, released its own lengthy statement on Wednesday. In a letter to the leaders of the House committees that drafted the bill, Marilyn B. Tavenner, the group\u2019s chief executive, warned Republican leaders that their plans to change Medicaid financing, among other things, could harm coverage and care.While many insurers have lost money in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s private insurance marketplaces, they have generally profited from the expansion of Medicaid, which would effectively be phased out under the Republican plan.\u201cAs a core principle, we believe that Medicaid funding should be adequate to meet the health care needs of beneficiaries,\u201d Ms. Tavenner wrote. \u201cMedicaid health plans are at the forefront of providing coverage for and access to behavioral health services and treatment for opioid use disorders, and insufficient funding could jeopardize the progress being made on these important public health fronts.\u201dA day earlier, AARP \u2014 the association of middle-aged and older Americans that is another crucial supporter of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 declared its opposition to the bill and even started running an ad against it. In a letter to Congress, the group said the bill would increase health costs for people ages 50 to 64, could lead to cuts in Medicaid coverage of long-term care and would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger ones.The hardening resistance complicated the case for the Republicans as they moved their bill forward on Wednesday.\u201cI respect those organizations and their views,\u201d said Representative Larry Bucshon, an Indiana Republican and a heart surgeon who conceded that criticism of the bill from doctors and hospitals could make it more difficult to sell the measure to the public. \u201cTheir voice is an important voice in health care.\u201dBut, he noted, those groups supported the health care law in 2010.\u201cHospitals have done quite well under the Affordable Care Act, but my constituents have not,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir premiums are going up. Their deductibles are high.\u201dAcross the rotunda, Republican senators were less enthusiastic.Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said she was not certain that a delay in the rollback of Medicaid coverage was \u201cenough for me.\u201d Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, expressed alarm that the bill\u2019s tax credits would not account for higher premium costs in insurance markets like hers, a largely rural state with little competition. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he did not want states that took the Medicaid expansion to \u201cget a benefit\u201d that the states that rejected the program did not.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she was unhappy that the bill removed money for Planned Parenthood.There was also a creeping concern about how quickly the bill was moving. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, essentially promised to move the bill to the Senate floor without the hearings and other processes that are normal for such a far-reaching piece of legislation. He had promised when Republicans took the majority that they would honor normal Senate processes and traditions.\u201cI think if that\u2019s the approach they take,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, \u201cthey won\u2019t have the votes in the Senate.\u201dJennifer Steinhauer, Emmarie Huetteman and Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "The Great War, and Great Change for Women", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 It is a myth dearly beloved of the contemporary fashion industry that World War I was when everything changed (at least when it came to clothes): Women cast off their corsets, flocked to factories and found a new kind of freedom.But as France continues to mark the centenary of the Great War, a Paris exhibition offers a more nuanced \u2014 and potentially controversial \u2014 take on the subject.The exhibition reopens the Biblioth\u00e8que Forney, a public research library for the decorative and applied arts, after extensive renovations. The building, in the Marais, is one of Paris\u2019s rare remaining medieval houses. It contains significant archives of wallpaper, posters and fashion magazines.Ms. Bass-Krueger and Ms. Kurkdjian are historians with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the largest governmental research organization in France. They filled the library\u2019s exhibition space (three rooms encompassing more than 2,150 square feet) with a rich selection of posters; 43 archival photographs; and 72 plates from fashion magazines and satirical journals. Fifteen garments were lent from the Palais Galliera, the City of Paris\u2019s fashion museum; the Mus\u00e9e de la Grande Guerre du Pays de Meaux, and the archives of the Chanel and Lanvin fashion houses \u2014 both of which remained in operation during the war.\u201cFrance could not afford for couture to fail,\u201d said Ms. Bass-Krueger, noting that the textile and dress industry was crucial to the country\u2019s wartime economy. \u201cThe industry was highly propagandizing, and signaled to Frenchwomen that the most important thing they could do was buy French fashion.\u201dCase in point: a silhouette with a shorter, flared skirt that had been introduced just before the war. Quickly rebaptized as a \u201cwar crinoline,\u201d it was pushed aggressively as allowing greater ease of movement even though it actually was heavier and more cumbersome than earlier styles.Similarly, the 1917 \u201cbarrel\u201d silhouette, advertised as lighter than crinolines, restricted the ankles, making it more difficult for women to move. In both cases, the goal was to get Frenchwomen to invest in a whole new wardrobe \u2014 not make them more comfortable.Equally complicated was the issue of dressing for work. As men were called up, women took traditionally male jobs (driving trams, delivering mail, working in factories), and their clothes reflected both the cultural ambivalence about this shift, and its temporary nature. Nurses excepted, most women wore their own dresses on the job, denoting official roles with homemade insignia.As a result, Ms. Kurkdjian said, \u201cWomen were on the roofs of Paris cleaning chimneys, but their clothes were often inappropriate\u201d to their new tasks: Long skirts were at risk of getting caught on pipes, doors and machines.Recognizing the danger, the government eventually mandated that factories provide protective workwear for women, but images of female industrial workers in men\u2019s gear generated biting criticism in the press. One 1917 magazine caricature in the exhibition shows a bar scene, with a woman in coveralls talking to a male factory worker. \u201cWhat\u2019s your husband doing?\u201d he asks. \u201cHe\u2019s at home mending my silks,\u201d the woman responds.In reality, though, female factory workers sought to remain elegant, accessorizing coveralls, blouses and skirt suits with brooches, necklaces and earrings \u2014 as did most wartime-era working women.\u201cIt was considered a national duty to look beautiful in wartime,\u201d said Adelheid Rasche, a fashion historian and curator at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, Germany, and author of \u201cWardrobes in Wartime, 1914-1918,\u201d \u201cBut women were now also expected to work like men. It became hard to know when to be modern and when to look as before.\u201dThis was particularly clear when it came to honoring the dead. Nineteenth-century mourning rituals were lengthy and highly codified; the Great War made this impractical. The exhibition includes a 1915 silk dress featuring a draped shawl collar and intricate lacework, for example, but by 1920 the equivalent outfit had been shortened, straightened and stripped of detailing. Meanwhile, women were mocked as \u201cmerry widows\u201d \u2014 even as they were urged to remarry and bear children.It all created a great divide between the new woman of soldiers\u2019 fears, and women as men wished them to be. Caricatures from satirical journals read at the battlefront figured women as either masculinized or spending wildly on the latest designs. In the exhibition, these are displayed opposite a wall of 50 pastel-tinted postcards received by soldiers, with studio photographs depicting women as subdued, romantic and mid-swoon.That may help explain why postwar, women were dismissed from their jobs and pressured to return to the home. Though the simple silhouette of a 1919 Lanvin gown in teal silk crepe illustrates the vast distance fashion had traveled from the restrictive prewar layers, gender relations had not kept pace.As the exhibition shows, the press then stressed that a woman\u2019s power derived not from her intellect or economic contributions, but her attractiveness. And if the corset was out, dieting was in. Said Ms. Kurkdjian, \u201cThe message is: We can\u2019t give you the vote, we can\u2019t give you real freedom, but you can be beautiful. And that should be enough.\u201dIt took another war before women got the right to vote in France in 1945, and the real fashion revolution would not come until the 1960s. Some battles, as the exhibition demonstrates, take decades.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Initiates \u2018Brexit\u2019 and Wades Into a Thorny Thicket", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 In one of the most consequential diplomatic events in Britain since World War II, Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday sent formal notice of the country\u2019s intention to withdraw from the European Union, starting a tortuous two-year divorce littered with pitfalls for both sides.Mrs. May told Parliament, \u201cToday, the government acted on the democratic will of the British people, and it acts too on the clear and convincing position of this house.\u201dThe British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.\u201cThe Article 50 process is now underway,\u201d she added, \u201cand, in accordance with the wishes of the British people, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.\u201dShe added: \u201cThis is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back.\u201d She cited the \u201cenduring power of the British spirit.\u201d And she painted a vision of a \u201ctruly global Britain, the best friend and neighbor to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe, too.\u201dAs a result, analysts say, she has frequently stressed her willingness to walk away from the table if a good deal proves elusive, leaving European Union negotiators wondering whether she is serious or trying to bluff her way into a stronger negotiating position.Given her negotiating \u201cred lines,\u201d the difference between whatever deal Mrs. May can secure and no deal at all may turn out to be relatively small. Blaming the Europeans for a collapse of the talks might be easier, politically, than bringing a weak agreement to Parliament.The politics are so toxic, Professor Menon added, that they make a disorderly departure from the bloc \u2014 often likened to walking off a cliff edge \u2014 plausible. \u201cIt\u2019s ugly and so frighteningly horrible, that I can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.European leaders have emphasized that Britain cannot \u201ccherry pick\u201d the rules and regulations it likes, and certainly cannot expect to have a better deal than countries that remain in the bloc. The last thing they want to do is lend greater momentum to the centrifugal forces already threatening to tear apart the European Union.Mr. Tusk said at a news conference in Brussels that there was \u201cno reason to pretend this is a happy day,\u201d and that Britain\u2019s plans to depart the bloc would only leave the 27 remaining members \u201cmore determined and more united.\u201d He added, \u201cWe already miss you.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.What makes the looming confrontation so dangerous is that both sides stand to lose economically in the event of a breakdown.From agriculture to aviation, from fisheries to pharmaceuticals, Britain\u2019s economy has been shaped by membership in the European Union, its main trading partner. With its single market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 and its customs union, the European Union ensures customs-free trade across frontiers in goods and some services.Without a deal, Britain faces customs checks at its borders and tariffs on imports and exports, not to mention the relocation of at least part of its lucrative financial services sector.But Britain is a big market for Continental Europe, too: Germany alone exports 800,000 vehicles there every year. Though London\u2019s dominant financial services sector is hardly popular, many businesses on the Continent rely on its deep capital markets.Britain is one of only two significant military powers in the bloc \u2014 the other is France \u2014 and has valuable security and intelligence capabilities that elevate Europe on the global stage.In her letter to Mr. Tusk, Mrs. May argued that without an overall agreement, \u201cour cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.\u201d Her officials later denied that this was a threat by Britain, arguing that it reflected the fact that some cooperation on policing issues was conducted through European Union channels.But Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s negotiator for Britain\u2019s exit, said there could be no \u201ctrade-off\u201d in talks between such issues and trade. \u201cI think that the security of our citizens is far too important,\u201d Mr. Verhofstadt said.To make matters more difficult, the final deal will require votes in perhaps 38 legislatures across Europe, as well as in the British Parliament.It is even possible that the negotiations could founder over the issue of money before they really get underway. Michel Barnier, the negotiator appointed by the European Commission, wants to resolve the terms of the departure before moving on to future trade ties.The commission estimates that Britain owes as much as $64 billion in future spending commitments and pension entitlements for European Union officials. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has rejected that idea, invoking the memory of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who in 1984 demanded \u2014 and received \u2014 her \u201cmoney back\u201d from European partners in another acrimonious negotiation.Diplomats say a collapse over money matters can be avoided if specifics are left until the end of the talks, when the parameters of a trade deal are known. European officials seem open to that idea of reaching agreement on the principles and methodology of calculating what Britain owes, based on commitments undertaken while it was a member. That would allow Mrs. May to justify payments as part of a deal allowing continued access to European markets.\u201cIf you go narrow, it is tremendously difficult,\u201d Mr. Fritz-Vannahme added. \u201cIt will not bring the problem to a conclusion in two years.\u201dHe said he believed one danger was the \u201cillusion\u201d among some in Brussels that the European Union was \u201cstrong enough to live without the Brits,\u201d who still have significant economic and military power. Another is the illusion among some Britons that they can dictate the terms of a deal.Professor Menon, too, said he thought the messages from some British politicians, reinforced by tabloid newspapers aggressively for the exit, were destructive. \u201cThe British people now think that Europeans will be stupid if they don\u2019t give us a good deal, because it\u2019s in their own interest,\u201d he said.Time will be a problem, too. British businesses want a transition period to adapt to the circumstances after withdrawal, but this requires an agreement on what Britain would transition to after 2019. And unless all this is decided quickly, it will be of little use; companies will not be able to wait long into 2018 before assuming the worst outcome and acting accordingly, even if that means a sharp economic adjustment.\u201cWhatever happens, she is not going to have a great deal,\u201d Professor Menon said, referring to Mrs. May. \u201cIt is still going to involve a lot of pain, given that we are outside the customs union and the single market.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Bostic as its new president.Mr. Bostic, an economist and a former housing policy official in the Obama administration, will become the first African-American to lead any of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional reserve banks, and just the fourth to serve on its policy-making committee, which raises and lowers interest rates.The Fed has come under mounting pressure from congressional Democrats and liberal groups to increase the diversity of its leadership \u2014 particularly at the regional banks.\u201cThis could have happened a long time ago, but we\u2019re happy that it happened now, and I look forward to this being a steppingstone for many others to have this opportunity as well,\u201d Mr. Bostic said in a videotaped statement released Monday by the Atlanta Fed.Mr. Bostic also joked that he could now be the answer to a question on \u201cJeopardy!\u201dHe will serve as chief executive of an institution with hundreds of employees, including economic researchers, bank regulators and people who work the plumbing of the financial system. The Atlanta Fed handles the central bank\u2019s processing of electronic checks.\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to be thinking about looking at how housing is contributing or hampering people\u2019s quality of life,\u201d Mr. Bostic said in the video statement.Mr. Bostic\u2019s views on monetary policy are unknown. He has little, if any, public record of discussing the subject. He will take his first turn as a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee in 2018. Five of the 12 regional reserve presidents vote each year. Mr. Bostic will join the Fed on June 5, replacing Dennis P. Lockhart, who joined the Fed in 2007 and stepped down in February upon reaching mandatory retirement.After earning a doctorate in economics at Stanford University, Mr. Bostic joined the Fed as a staff economist in 1995 and began to develop an expertise in housing policy, including the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to make loans in the communities from which they draw deposits.He joined the U.S.C. faculty in 2001 as a professor in the School of Policy, Planning and Development, exploring issues like the effects of government regulations on the availability of homeownership.His next stop was Washington: He was appointed in 2009 as assistant secretary for policy development and research at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He helped orchestrate the Obama administration\u2019s response to the collapse of the housing bubble before returning to U.S.C. in 2012.His Fed appointment was welcomed by groups that have campaigned to increase the central bank\u2019s diversity. Fifteen of the 16 members of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee are white. The exception is Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, whose parents immigrated from India.\u201cI could not be more thrilled about today\u2019s announcement,\u201d said Representative David Scott, a Georgia Democrat who co-signed the letter.Advertisement"}

Chief Doubts Consensus View of Climate Change", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said on Thursday that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming, a statement at odds with the established scientific consensus on climate change.Asked his views on the role of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas produced by burning fossil fuels, in increasing global warming, Mr. Pruitt said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d that \u201cI think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so, no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\u201d\u201cBut we don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.\u201dMr. Pruitt\u2019s statement contradicts decades of research and analysis by international scientific institutions and federal agencies, including the E.P.A. His remarks on Thursday, which were more categorical than similar testimony before the Senate, may also put him in conflict with laws and regulations that the E.P.A. is charged with enforcing.His statements appear to signal that the Trump administration intends not only to roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change policies, but also to wage a vigorous attack on their underlying legal and scientific basis.\u201cThe scientific community has studied this issue for decades,\u201d Dr. Santer added. \u201cThe consensus message from many national and international assessments of the science is pretty simple: Natural factors can\u2019t explain the size or patterns of observed warming. A large human influence on global climate is the best explanation for the warming we\u2019ve measured and monitored.\u201dThe basic science showing that carbon dioxide traps heat at the Earth\u2019s surface dates to the 19th century, and has been confirmed in many thousands of experiments and observations since.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Mr. Pruitt spoke at the Houston energy conference on Thursday afternoon in a session moderated by Daniel Yergin, a prominent energy economist and a member of a White House advisory panel. Mr. Yergin did not ask Mr. Pruitt any questions about his remarks from Thursday morning, saying later that he had been unaware of the comments when interviewing him.Mr. Pruitt did not clarify his comments or respond to reporters who sought to question him.He said at the energy conference that the Obama administration had gone too far with some environmental rules and that he intended to work more closely with industry and individual states to address pollution issues.\u201cThe future ain\u2019t what it used to be at the E.P.A.,\u201d he said.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks come as the Trump administration prepares to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s two signature policies to address global warming: a pair of sweeping regulations intended to curb carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles and power plant smokestacks.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks on Thursday were consistent with his past public statements questioning the established science of human-caused climate change, but in denying the role played by carbon dioxide, they go a step further.In addition to putting him at odds with the consensus of climate scientists, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks also raise the possibility that, as the Trump administration moves forward with unwinding Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, it could put the administration in violation of federal law.In 2009, the E.P.A. released a legal opinion known as an endangerment finding concluding that, because of its contribution to global warming, carbon dioxide in large amounts met the Clean Air Act\u2019s definition of a pollutant that harms human health. Under the terms of the Clean Air Act, one of the nation\u2019s most powerful environmental laws, all such pollutants must be regulated by the E.P.A. A federal court upheld the finding, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to it.Thus the E.P.A. remains obligated to regulate carbon dioxide.In his Senate hearing, Mr. Pruitt said that as administrator of the E.P.A. he would not revisit that 2009 legal finding. \u201cIt is there, and it needs to be enforced and respected,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said. But energy lobbyists close to the Trump administration have since urged the new administration to consider building a legal case against the endangerment finding.Advisers to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team said they read Mr. Pruitt\u2019s remarks as a signal that he intends to do just that.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign commitment was to undo President Obama\u2019s entire climate edifice,\u201d said Myron Ebell, who worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. transition team but has no role in policy making. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking through the whole thing, and based on what Scott Pruitt said this morning, I do think they are looking at reopening the endangerment finding.\u201dMr. Trump is expected to announce an executive order next week directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of unwinding the climate change regulations on emissions from power plants.Justin Gillis contributed reporting from New York, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}

What does that mean?Well, not much yet, because nothing substantive has actually happened.London\u2019s status as a financial center, and Britain\u2019s trading relationship with Europe, depend on what comes next.If a deal is not struck before the two-year deadline, London\u2019s bankers could be effectively severed from the European Union and many transactions based on the Continent would then be rendered illegal.Some companies already have their sights set on Europe and will start shifting jobs out soon.The two years is enough for businesses to adapt, but they will have to make decisions quickly, said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, an economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels.Prime Minister Theresa May has so far been able to avoid questions about the sorts of trade barriers that will be erected, and the financial markets were muted on the news of Britain\u2019s starting the exit process.Mrs. May\u2019s letter starting the withdrawal called for unity, but investors may be underestimating how closely political divorces can match real ones for bitterness and damage.How might a demand for arbitration by Google help Uber defend itself in a legal dispute involving Anthony Levandowski, the head of the ride-sharing app\u2019s self-driving car unit?Waymo, an autonomous-car business that was spun out into a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company, has accused Mr. Levandowski, who joined Uber six months after leaving Google, of colluding with Uber to steal information about Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology.Uber bought Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up, Otto, for $680 million in August.But before the Waymo lawsuit was filed, Google had demanded arbitration against Mr. Levandowski, asserting that he had used confidential salary information while trying to poach former colleagues to join Otto.Arbitration would be cheaper and faster for the companies than a federal lawsuit and would keep the case out of the public eye.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banks and Tech Firms Battle Over Something Akin to Gold: Your Data", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The big banks and Silicon Valley are waging an escalating battle over your personal financial data: your dinner bill last night, your monthly mortgage payment, the interest rates you pay.Technology companies like Mint and Betterment have been eager to slurp up this data, mainly by building services that let people link all their various bank-account and credit-card information. The selling point is to make budgeting and bookkeeping easier. But the data is also being used to offer new kinds of loans and investment products.Now, banks have decided they aren\u2019t letting the data go without a fight.In recent weeks, several large banks have been pushing to restrict the sharing of this kind of data with technology companies, according to the tech firms. In some cases, they are refusing to pass along information, like the fees and interest rates they charge. Both sides see big money to be made from the reams of highly personal information created by financial transactions.The struggle over this data points to a growing recognition in the world of finance that personal records rank among the most valuable currencies in the increasingly digital economy.But the law has been slow to keep up with the quickly evolving ways that companies seek to hold on to customer data or share it with others.The tech companies, in turn, complain that the steps being taken by banks will not lead to better security. They say the banks are motivated simply by a fear that the data will allow the financial upstarts to offer better deals on loans and checking accounts.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the real intent of the banks is to limit this data because it puts their business model at risk,\u201d he said.The European authorities have largely decided that people, not companies, own the digital records associated with their accounts. As a result, European banks are generally being forced to make it easy for customers to share their financial data with whomever they choose.In the United States, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act broadly directed banks to make electronic records available to people. But there has been little detail on what that means in practice.Banks, in the meantime, have taken the initiative by pushing technology companies to accept new agreements on how they use the data they pull from the banks.Some of the banks have said they do not want to share the interest rates and fees that they charge customers, even when customers ask for that information to be passed along, said Steve Boms, the vice president for government affairs at Yodlee. Mr. Boms said that his company was pushing back against the requests. \u201cWith data limitations, you are hindering the ability of millions of consumers to save more and optimize their finances,\u201d he said.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, which have been among the most aggressive in seeking new agreements, said they would pass along any information that customers wanted, as long as the customers themselves requested it. JPMorgan is hoping to create a dashboard on its website where people can choose to turn on or off the data flowing from the bank to any outside provider.The banks say they are pushing for new data agreements in an effort to stop technology companies from getting access to customer data in ways that the customers might not understand, or that could create security risks.Right now, few rules or standards exist for how technology companies can use the data they collect from customers. It is also not entirely clear who would be held liable if a data breach at a service like Venmo or Mint led to financial losses for a customer.\u201cIt is in everybody\u2019s best interest to come to more robust arrangements, from a security perspective,\u201d said Brett Pitts, the head of digital for Wells Fargo Virtual Channels.In January, both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo signed agreements with Intuit \u2014 the owner of Mint, TurboTax and QuickBooks \u2014 that will give Intuit more streamlined access to data from the banks, in exchange for new rules about how Intuit uses the data. The banks have said they want the agreement with Intuit to be a model for similar agreements with other technology companies.In recent negotiations, including those with Intuit, Wells Fargo has asked to be paid by technology companies that want better access to its data, a sticking point for technology companies that believe data should flow freely. Mr. Pitts said the payments were intended to help the bank cover the additional infrastructure costs involved in providing real-time access to data.The negotiations with Yodlee are particularly important because it is the largest so-called data aggregator. Yodlee and a few other data aggregators serve as the middlemen between the banks and the start-ups, pulling the data from the banks and putting it into a form that start-ups like Betterment and Digit can use.In addition to being the biggest aggregator, Yodlee has also been the most controversial because of what it does with the data it collects.Other aggregators that compete with Yodlee, including its largest competitor, Plaid, say they do not sell customer data to third parties and do not think it would be right to do so, given that the consumers do not generally know their data is being sold in this way.JPMorgan has been insisting in negotiations that it will provide easy access to its data only if technology companies agree not to sell the data to third parties. Intuit agreed to those terms in its deal with the bank.This has not been the only sticking point in negotiations with Yodlee, however. And Yodlee is not the only company that has complained that the banks are making it harder for customers who want access to information about their bank accounts.Mr. Harris of Personal Capital has been one of the most outspoken critics of the banks. His company allows consumers to look at all their financial accounts on one dashboard, and also provides them with financial advice based on their holdings.Mr. Harris, who was previously the chief executive at Intuit and PayPal, said that many banks publicly say they are sharing data while making it hard, behind the scenes, for companies like Personal Capital to get access to it. Some companies, he said, will throttle access to data, or shut it down for hours at a time.\u201cIt happens with a frequency that is too often to simply be the result of some technical problems,\u201d Mr. Harris said.He said that agreements like those Intuit recently struck with the banks would speed up the movement of data but give the banks too much control over the data flowing to companies like Personal Capital.\u201cWe suss out the data and show the customer what they are actually paying,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a business model point of view, that is not in the best interest of the banks and brokers. It\u2019s encouraging customers to get smart and get well-priced products.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Commerce Secretary Was No Friend to Russians at Cyprus Bank", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byNICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 When Wilbur L. Ross, a billionaire American investor, bought shares in the Bank of Cyprus three years ago, he found himself part owner of a big but failing bank with a vice chairman who used to work with Vladimir V. Putin in the Leningrad K.G.B. and five other Russians on its board.That was enough to raise concerns when President Trump nominated Mr. Ross to be his commerce secretary. The president\u2019s critics wanted to know if Mr. Ross had ever met with Russian intelligence, or if the bank ever gave favorable loans to the new president. They suspected that might be why Mr. Trump had spoken so favorably of Mr. Putin.According to bankers, lawyers and others who have worked closely with the Bank of Cyprus, within months of Mr. Ross\u2019s becoming a shareholder in the summer of 2014, all six Russians who were on the board when he arrived, including Mr. Putin\u2019s former K.G.B. colleague, Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, were gone, ousted in a rolling purge of Kremlin influence.\u201cHe has not been an accomplice of the Russians but the opposite,\u201d Loizos Hadjicostis, president of the Cyprus Union of Bank Employees, said in an interview.\u201cRoss came in to block the Russians, not to help them,\u201d he added. \u201cThe theory that Ross is a Russian Trojan horse does not make any sense to me.\u201dMr. Nelson said he had spoken with Mr. Ross about the Bank of Cyprus and had been told that Mr. Ross had one meeting of about an hour with a Russian investor in the lender in 2014. \u201cHe knows of no loans or interaction between the bank or anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign or organization,\u201d the senator said. He added that he believed Mr. Ross and that he could not understand the White House\u2019s \u201csecretive behavior.\u201d\u201cNot only is this lack of transparency unsettling, it\u2019s behavior that everyone in this Senate should agree is unacceptable and shouldn\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.After leading a group of around 30 investors from the United States and elsewhere in a 2014 investment in the Bank of Cyprus worth 400 million euros, Mr. Ross served for a period as co-vice chairman of the bank along with Mr. Strzhalkovsky, Mr. Putin\u2019s old K.G.B. associate. But Mr. Strzhalkovsky, who had no experience in banking, was then forced out.The only Russian with a prominent role in the bank today is Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire businessman who bought shares in 2014, around the same time as Mr. Ross. Like all wealthy business people still working in Russia, Mr. Vekselberg has maintained good relations with the Kremlin but, unlike Mr. Strzhalkovsky and the Russians ousted from the bank, he has a long record of actually doing real business.A company Mr. Vekselberg controls is now the biggest single Bank of Cyprus shareholder and has a representative on the board, Maksim Goldman, an American-educated Russian lawyer.As a result of this highly controversial maneuver, Mr. Strzhalkovsky and other Russians lost billions. But in September 2013, they secured seats on the Bank of Cyprus board, meaning that Russia, for the first time, had effective control of a major European bank.Unfortunately, said Mr. Neocleous, the lawyer, none of them knew anything about banking and they could not agree on ways to save the Bank of Cyprus from ruin. \u201cNone of them were bankers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could offer nothing.\u201dWith the lender on the edge of bankruptcy, John Hourican, an Irishman who had been brought in as chief executive, insisted that the bank raise capital. Fearful that the bank might go under, the Russians and other shareholders reluctantly agreed to the plan, which would greatly dilute their ownership stakes.But the bank conspicuously stayed away from Moscow.Adonis Papaconstantinou, who leads a group of Laiki Bank creditors seeking to recover lost money, and who was once on the Bank of Cyprus board, said that the 2014 share issue was intended to make it difficult for Russians to invest and was skewed in favor of potential investors from the United States and Europe.\u201cNobody could tell the Russians that they could not invest, but they are proud people and they could see that this was an attempt to keep them out \u2014 or at least minimize their influence,\u201d said Mr. Papaconstantinou, who lost his seat on the bank\u2019s board in the purge that started after Mr. Ross\u2019s arrival.Christodoulous Vassiliades, the managing director of a Cypriot legal firm that represented some of the former Russian board members, recalled that the Russians had already lost so much money in the 2013 banking blowout that most of them had little appetite for a fight with Mr. Ross over control of the Bank of Cyprus.\u201cThe bank is a business, not a geopolitical football,\u201d said Mr. Hourican, the chief executive.In many ways, however, it is much more than just a business. As the biggest bank in the country \u2014 a member of the European Union that is on a delicate fault line between East and West \u2014 the Bank of Cyprus plays an outsize role not only in the nation\u2019s economy but also in its political and even geopolitical direction. In a June 2013 letter to the European Central Bank pleading for help, the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, described the Bank of Cyprus as a \u201cmega-systemic bank\u201d on which the future of the island depended.Mr. Anastasiades, in public statements at the time, expressed alarm that the confiscation of deposits, carried out at the behest of the European Union in return for aid, would hand the bank to the Russians by issuing shares as compensation for seized money.This has led to speculation in Cyprus that Mr. Ross came into the bank as part of an operation arranged by Mr. Anastasiades with help from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who visited the island in 2014.Mr. Ross declined to comment.Mr. Anastasiades, in an interview, denied having asked Mr. Biden to help line up investors for the Bank of Cyprus so as to break the grip of Russian shareholders. The government, he said, had no business deciding who invests in a private bank, and no interest in expelling the Russians.\u201cWe are interested in keeping the Russian business community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a matter of Russians or Americans. We want everyone.\u201dThe bank, fortified by the 2014 recapitalization and money from the sale of assets in Russia, Serbia and elsewhere, has now stabilized and even managed to pay back nearly $12 billion in emergency loans granted at the height of the crisis by the European Central Bank.But while it is on the way to recovery and is no longer considered a potential beachhead for a Russian presence in Europe\u2019s financial system, the bank has not yet proved to be a good investment for Mr. Ross. Its share price is still lower than what he paid in 2014.Mr. Papaconstantinou, the former board member, said he spoke with Mr. Ross during one of his visits to Cyprus and asked why he had put money into such a troubled bank. \u201cHe told me he thought it was a good move because Cyprus had gone down so far it could not get any worse and could only go up,\u201d Mr. Papaconstantinou recalled.In the long run, that is probably a safe bet. But, said Stelios Orphanides, a financial journalist with Cyprus Mail: \u201cIt is like owning tickets to a first-class cabin on the Titanic. It is a good investment, so long as the Titanic does not go down. But if the Bank of Cyprus goes down, Cyprus goes down, too.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting from Nicosia, Cyprus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Scared Should People on the Border Be?", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byOpinionBROWNSVILLE, TEX. \u2014 The news here on the border with Mexico travels fast.Most of it is, in fact, \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 conjecture and unverifiable gossip exchanged over \u201cel Feisbuk,\u201d which is what people here in the Rio Grande Valley call the social network. Instead of snapshots and emojis, it now disseminates warnings. People are frightened, and frightened people repeat things that frighten them more:Stay at home tomorrow. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is conducting raids in the kitchens.Don\u2019t send your kids to school on Wednesday. The border patrol is looking for kids with no papers.Don\u2019t drive down 802 on Fridays anymore.There\u2019s a checkpoint at the grocery store. They arrested 100 people last night at 10.Who knows? Some of it might be true.You can\u2019t drive much farther south in Texas than Brownsville, a city separated from its Mexican neighbor by an iron fence, like an exclusive country club or drug dealer\u2019s hacienda. It\u2019s a border town, and one that has been suspiciously quiet while its future is bandied about in Washington by a president who equates \u201cmaking America great again\u201d to \u201cgetting the Mexicans out.\u201dMuch of the Rio Grande Valley abuts the fence, which stretches some 650 miles and was built in 2006 for $7 billion. The fence has done little to deter smuggling. Drug cartels, being crafty criminals, get around it in any number of ways: tunnels, light aircraft, homemade submarines, even T-shirt cannons fired over the fence.Smugglers of humans have adapted as well, using similar techniques (minus the T-shirt cannons). The main effect of making it harder to get across the border has been to create a greater need for coyotes \u2014 people, many of whom have ties to the cartels, who will help you cross for pay. This means even more trauma for migrants, including robbery, rape, ransoming and murder.Many of those who make it across end up staying here, on the border, because there\u2019s another checkpoint an hour and a half north, at Sarita.There are two border towns in every border town. There\u2019s the one I\u2019ve recently discovered, which is deeply involved in local schools, has air conditioning and Wi-Fi, and drives comfortably appointed tanks that pass as cars. It has Snapchat for the kids who do their homework, all the cable in the world and so, so much food.In this town, every Sunday is reason enough for barbecue, guacamole and limes picked fresh from the tree, squeezed right into your beer.Then there is the other border town, where I was raised back in the 1970s. It lives directly behind the first. It avoids eye contact. It cooks in the kitchens and manicures your St. Augustine grass and is paid \u2014 not much \u2014 by the hour. Those people \u2014 not your criminals or rapists or \u201cbad hombres\u201d \u2014 are waiting and waiting to take a swipe at that golden lie of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d they endured thousands of treacherous miles worthy of a Tolkien novel to reach.And while they wait, they work. Any work. They struggle through tertiary economies \u2014 reselling clothes, furniture or appliances at roadside stands, making tamales or tortillas in garages, setting up hair salons in living rooms (men\u2019s cuts $7), cleaning houses and offices and schools, mowing, cutting, picking. They always work. The work is compulsory.These two towns have lived side by side peacefully for generations. It\u2019s like a tide meeting a shore, a pattern repeated naturally, with a telescoping logic: There\u2019s the border in the border town, then the border town in Texas, then Texas in the United States, then the United States in the world. Now invert it: There\u2019s the world, there\u2019s America, there\u2019s Texas, there\u2019s the border town and finally, within the town, there\u2019s still another world, waiting to get in.Before I moved back to Brownsville in January, I\u2019d spent 23 years in Seattle. Throughout last year\u2019s election, I watched the news with the eyes of a West Coast liberal. As the veneer of social decorum paled and then vanished, we sat around being entertained by progressive news shows. Even after the confounding results of the election, we felt reassured and validated in our perception of the world, our ability to call out hypocrisy in institutions and governments, lawyers and hedge fund managers.Then I came home. Now I see, up close, the impact that election could have on people I know who are very much in danger of losing everything.They were burning the sugar cane when I came back. Slow-moving trucks with loud speakers drove around the fields calling out in Spanish that if anyone was hiding in there, it was best to get out: The fields were about to burn. It wasn\u2019t a trick. No one was going to arrest you. Just get out.The border was making a humanist accommodation. I wasn\u2019t certain why, but this put a knot in my throat. I felt something akin to pride.Lately there have been images on the evening news of gendarmes in ICE jackets knocking on doors, terrified children crying, portly Latin men in handcuffs, Border Patrol agents hydrating migrants in dirty ball caps before escorting them away for processing \u2014 the stuff of nightmares for the vulnerable.Conversely, there are stories about the parasites on the side of \u201cthe peoples.\u201d The immigration \u201clawyers\u201d who convince non-English speakers to pay thousands of dollars earned $5 an hour for a sheet of paper with official-looking letterhead on it, convincing them that it will be enough \u201cpapeles\u201d to ward off the most insistent of warrant knocks. A new kind of frontier snake oil.When I first came back, I wanted to accompany my father on a trip across the border into Matamoros for a pharmacy run \u2014 his Medicare covered only so much of his prescriptions, and he could get triple the amount for the same price there, and I wanted to (cough cough) refill some of my own scripts.He thinks I look like a \u201cbolillo.\u201d A white guy. Which is funny, because when my friends on the West Coast looked at me, I could tell they were envisioning a big floppy hat and crisscrossed bandoleers and fantastic revolvers.What frustrates me most about this border town is how passively it awaits its sentence from the bolillos from afar. Marches and demonstrations, \u201cDays Without an Immigrant,\u201d they happen only in faraway cities. Not here. It bewildered me at first, and then I understood: Oh, yeah. Probably not the smartest thing for people here to do, drawing attention to themselves right at the border.\u201cTerrified of deportation? Let\u2019s march and make ourselves known!\u201dBut is all this really a result of the new political climate? Or are we just hearing about it more, thanks to the hysteria propagated on el Feisbuk?The Trump administration has said that the government will stop exempting \u201cclasses or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\u201d But no new laws have been passed. If you ask the Border Patrol and ICE, they say there have been no changes in policy down here at the border, or none that they\u2019re willing to admit.Some of the stock images we see on the news are from long before the last election, or instances in which warrants are being served after months of investigation. ICE does not actually have crack detectives who drink coffee outside a suspect\u2019s mother\u2019s house, waiting until he comes home for Christmas to nab him.It might be months before the aftershocks of the new administration\u2019s ministrations finally reach the frontier and we see the actual effect of its new policies.But will the president\u2019s dream of a new and bigger wall change anything down here? Very likely not. Tunnels will be dug deeper. Cannons aimed higher. Ladders built taller. Coyotes will charge more. And most of the people building the wall will be Hispanic. In fact, dozens of the companies bidding for the contract are owned by Hispanics. Racism and self-loathing aside, ethics are the stuff of the comfortable: Down here, work is work. The Guardian quoted a Puerto Rican businessman who voiced a fairly universal attitude toward the $25 billion project:\u201cI think the wall is a waste of time and money,\u201d said Patrick Balcazar, the owner of San Diego Project Management. \u201cFor environmental reasons, it\u2019s dumb. From an economic point of view, it\u2019s dumb.\u201d But he said: \u201cIf you want to put up a wall, I\u2019m going to put up the best wall I can and I\u2019m going to pay my people. My goal is to build a wall so I can make enough money so we can turn this thing around and tear down the wall again.\u201dOr quicker to the point: \u201cWe don\u2019t see it as politics,\u201d said Jorge Diaz, who manages De la Fuente Construction. \u201cWe just see it as work.\u201dFor once, I\u2019d like to hear something good come out of this part of the world, just to shake things up. The only news to come out of South Texas is framed in the superlative, and not positively: extraordinary poverty, profound rates of illiteracy, generations-deep nepotism, off-the-charts diabetes, casual civil-rights abuses, untreated wastewater in the Rio Grande, the mythical crossover border violence and the mosquitoes.Lots to be proud of, really, when you reverse it, and consider them obstacles to overcome that make people, or a place, who they are. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Rio Grande Valley has so many proud sons and daughters.I\u2019m a citizen, born in Brownsville; I have no personal reason to worry. But I do, now, carry my passport and another form of ID with me when I leave the house, as if this were Eastern Europe in the buildup to World War II. Why tempt fate? Down here, it used to be that your command of English could see you waltz through a traffic stop. There were times in the \u201980s when I was a teenager and my friends and I could hardly speak from drinking, and we\u2019d still be allowed back across the border after a night in Matamoros. But those days are gone.Now, whenever I see any uniformed personnel, I quietly activate my civil, American posture and prepare to level my voice out and stand guard over my father and his status as a naturalized citizen, if the need arises.Which, again, is mealy-mouthed, knee-jerk liberal posturing, because in reality, his 71 years of experience here, his own adaptation to his environment, will see him through what\u2019s next, as will this border, which has lived through wars and political mood swings and buffoons and bloviates before, without the help of el Feisbuk, or people like me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Miners Found a 706-Carat Diamond in Sierra Leone. Who Should Get the Profit?", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 Fist-size and lumpy, the rock that a team of miners came upon recently in the diamond fields of Sierra Leone was orange with red speckles that looked like tiny droplets of palm oil.They almost tossed it aside. The rock didn\u2019t seem like the kind of gem that diggers typically unearth in a nation with a reputation for having some of the highest quality and most transparent diamonds in the world. But the rock was unusual enough to take to a local diamond dealer.\u201cThe look on his face when he saw the rock made me believe that we discovered something extraordinary,\u201d said the Rev. Emmanuel Momoh, a pastor who runs the team of diggers who found the rock.The strange lump turned out to be one of the biggest diamonds ever uncovered in Sierra Leone \u2014 an estimated 706 carats, valued at as much as $50 million. But Mr. Momoh\u2019s decision to hand the diamond over to the Sierra Leone government to handle the sale, instead of quietly selling it himself, has set off a debate in a country where suspicion of officials runs high.Sierra Leone allows miners to sell diamonds up to a certain size, but requires them to turn over larger stones to the government to sell, with the proceeds, in theory, going to the ones who found them, minus an unspecified government tax. Often, diamonds \u2014 both large and small \u2014 are sold on the black market, depriving the government of sorely needed revenue.People on social media have been abuzz about Mr. Momoh and his discovery. Some have praised him for turning over the diamond, figuring that more money will go toward rebuilding a country that has been devastated by war and, more recently, by Ebola. But others thought he was crazy to give it up, especially to a government they think has done little for the people of the country.\u201cWhat has the government done anything for me to give them the diamond?\u201d one person posted on Facebook.President Ernest Bai Koroma, who appeared on television brandishing the gem, has tried to calm those fears, saying that the government would act in the best interests of all involved.\u201cI believe a diamond like this should be publicly sold in the country so that we know the value of it, what is due to the government and what is due to the people so that everyone can have their share,\u201d Mr. Koroma said.Diamonds \u2014 especially so-called conflict, or blood, diamonds used by warlords to fund wars that have racked the region \u2014 have long been at the center of controversy in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa.The rock uncovered by Mr. Momoh\u2019s crew is not the first big gem to surface in Sierra Leone, or the first to generate controversy.Mr. Momoh is a preacher in a small church in Kono, a district in eastern Sierra Leone, and sells peanuts as a side business. He also owns a mining license for a small diamond field and has been running a crew of miners for the past six years.In many diamond-mining communities in Sierra Leone, those owning the land where gems are buried are required to secure a government-issued license to mine them. But mining licenses are cumbersome to obtain and can be expensive, so landowners and chiefs often work with entrepreneurs such as Mr. Momoh to buy the licenses. The entrepreneurs have almost total ownership of whatever is mined, paying a negotiated percentage of the take to the landowners.Even so, miners and license holders also tend to receive very little revenue for their discoveries \u2014 which are the result of very hard work. Miners work under harsh conditions, using heavy tools to dig out sacks of dirt to create large pits that often collapse, causing deaths or severe injuries.And when diamonds are found, the miners are so desperate for money they will often accept far less than the market value of the stones. In Kono, the nation\u2019s main diamond mining district, dealers are still predominantly foreign \u2014 including Lebanese, Guineans, Gambians and Malians \u2014 and officials say that they spirit the diamonds out of the country to avoid paying taxes to the government.\u201cThe entire diamond business is dominated by foreigners,\u201d said Paul Saquee, the head chief in Tankoro, in Kono District. \u201cI don\u2019t want to indict all of them, but they discourage local miners from handing diamonds to the government in order to smuggle them out the country.\u201dLocal miners and license holders also accuse the government and traditional leaders of keeping proceeds of diamond sales for themselves and accepting bribes from foreign companies.In 2003, a miner found a rock that was believed to be a huge diamond. Excitement about the discovery spread across the country, amid expectations that the proceeds would go to much-needed infrastructure projects.But experts cited by the government said the stone was corundum, another mineral. Many citizens believed that individuals within the government lied in order to keep the proceeds for themselves.When the miners in Koyadu, a small village in eastern Sierra Leone, found their rock, they handed it over to Mr. Momoh so that he could have it examined.Mr. Momoh, accompanied by the miners, took it to a Lebanese businessman who had a reputation for buying without delay. The dealer confirmed it was a diamond, and a major discovery.Everyone cheered.Mr. Momoh wanted to alert the village chief to the gem, he said, but an argument broke out in the dealer\u2019s shop.The dealer proposed keeping the discovery quiet so that the men who had uncovered the diamond could find a buyer and take the proceeds for themselves without paying tax, according to Mr. Momoh. Discussions over what to do stretched for hours.Eventually Mr. Momoh and the dealer agreed to take the diamond to the chief of the village, who insisted that the gem, because of its size, be handed over to the government.Government officials placed the diamond, and a document attesting that Mr. Momoh was its owner, in a vault at the country\u2019s central bank.Last week, an official statement from the government said proceeds from the sale would benefit the country.Officials have already contacted interested buyers, said Alhaji Ajibu Jalloh, the deputy spokesman for the government. The government will update the public on the sale with radio and television broadcasts, he said.\u201cWe understand there are doubts as to who will benefit from this diamond \u2014 that is why the government is doing everything in public and in a transparent way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pastor will have his share, the community where the diamond was discovered will have its share and everyone else involved will have their share of the proceeds.\u201dMr. Momoh said government officials have regularly been in touch with him and have repeatedly promised to give him his share of the proceeds, but he\u2019s worried: So far no one has told him what his cut will be.\u201cI want to contribute in the development of my community, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to be a beggar in about 10 or 15 years from now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Near a Victory on Rollback of Fuel Standards", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Automakers appear to be on the verge of a rare victory in their long-term effort to reduce government regulations on new cars and trucks.Any decision by the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department to reopen a review of the regulations could ease the pressure on the industry to meet the current target of 54 miles per gallon for vehicle fleets by 2025.Individual carmakers may react differently to a rollback of the federal standards. Some companies, for example, will continue to pursue electric car programs, while others may scale back their plans. And over all, the industry is likely to continue to make incremental fuel-economy improvements as new models are introduced, primarily as a selling point to consumers.But the aggressive targets of the Obama administration, which signed off on the current rules in January, would no longer loom as an escalating cost for automakers, which estimate that fewer than 4 percent of today\u2019s vehicles would meet the 2025 standards.Instead, auto companies will be given an opportunity to argue for less stringent standards during a government review period that could stretch into 2018.Environmental groups are already crying foul that car companies are now opposing the standards many of them agreed to during negotiations with the Obama administration in 2012 \u2014 when gasoline prices were much higher, increasing demand for smaller cars, and after the administration had rescued General Motors and Chrysler in carefully choreographed bankruptcies.\u201cAuto manufacturers are attempting to backpedal on vital climate and consumer protections,\u201d said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. \u201cA new administration is no reason to go in reverse.\u201dAutomakers are also hopeful that the new E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, will begin legal action to revoke California\u2019s ability to enforce its tailpipe standards.At least some of the administration\u2019s moves to roll back regulations could face court challenges on environmental grounds.While executives are reluctant to publicly discuss efforts to pare environmental regulations, the topic was reportedly addressed during President Trump\u2019s initial meeting in January with the chief executives of the three Detroit automakers: General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler.An executive of one of the Detroit companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was confidential, said they had pressed Mr. Trump to abolish \u201cdueling standards\u201d for state and federal governments and to better align rules covering fuel economy and carbon emissions.It is unclear how far the new leadership at E.P.A. will go toward dismantling the rules that were so integral to former President Barack Obama\u2019s program to cut pollution that contributes to global warming.Automakers say the 2025 target is unrealistic given the shift by consumers away from more fuel-efficient small cars to bigger pickups and S.U.V.s.\u201cNo agency ever had set standards so far into the future,\u201d Mr. Bainwol said. \u201cNo one could accurately project the circumstances affecting the technological and economic feasibility of these standards.\u201dWith prices below $3 a gallon, the companies are eager to capitalize on the demand for larger vehicles. About three in five new vehicles sold in the United States are pickups and sport utilities, and analysts expect the trend to continue and expand into global markets as well.The outlook for electrified vehicles, however, would be affected by weaker long-term standards.Some automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, have devoted few resources to electrified vehicles. Others are placing strategic bets on projects that tailor autonomous-driving technology to a new breed of electric cars.G.M.\u2019s new electric Chevrolet Bolt, for example, will be the preferred platform for the company\u2019s self-driving systems. And industry analysts doubt that any change in fuel-efficiency rules would reduce the momentum at G.M. and rivals such as Tesla for self-driving, electric models.But companies will be under less pressure to take dramatic steps to improve fuel economy on mass-market vehicles, such as shifting to lighter, more expensive materials or adding technology that improves performance without requiring more gasoline.Environmental activists fear that any pause in the efforts to improve fuel economy would stall the momentum toward cleaner cars.\u201cThese vehicle efficiency and emissions rules have helped us cut oil use, reduce pollution, save money at the pump and reduce the risk of climate change,\u201d said Ken Kimmell, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.Industry analysts have suggested that relaxing fuel-efficiency targets is only the first in a series of policy changes by Mr. Trump directed at the auto industry.His vow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement has drawn concern from automakers that rely on factories in Mexico to help supply the United States market.Reducing fuel-efficiency targets would save money for the car companies and usher in an unusual era of cooperation between the industry and Washington.By giving the automakers the relief they are clamoring for on fuel regulations, Mr. Trump could then prod them to expand investments and add jobs in their American operations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Firing of South Africa\u2019s Finance Minister Widens a Political Rift", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The two rival factions inside South Africa\u2019s governing African National Congress attacked each other publicly on Friday after President Jacob Zuma abruptly fired a well-respected finance minister who was considered a bulwark against government corruption.Mr. Zuma, who has been embroiled in a series of scandals since taking office in 2009, dismissed the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, as part of a late-night cabinet shuffle in which 10 of 35 ministers were fired.The deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called the decision \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Another senior figure, Gwede Mantashe, the A.N.C. secretary general, said the cabinet shuffle was not done with the party\u2019s approval. \u201cMinisters have been moved, and the majority of them were good performing ministers,\u201d Mr. Mantashe said.Jackson Mthembu, a senior A.N.C. lawmaker, said Mr. Gordhan\u2019s only crime was \u201cincorruptibility.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented to have senior A.N.C. members come out with dissenting views in public like this,\u201d said William Gumede, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and executive chairman of the Democracy Works Foundation, a good-government group.\u201cNow that the conflict has gone public, people and party members can see the divisions clearly,\u201d Mr. Gumede said. \u201cIt will be very difficult for Zuma to shrug this off and claim that everything is fine.\u201dThe firing was a result of a long-running battle between Mr. Zuma and Mr. Gordhan, and the interests they represent. Mr. Zuma\u2019s supporters have accused Mr. Gordhan of representing South Africa\u2019s white-led business community and have urged Mr. Zuma to fire the minister and replace him with someone with a looser grip on state coffers, so as to carry out \u201cradical transformation.\u201dMr. Gordhan\u2019s backers belong to the urban faction of the A.N.C., one less beholden to the politics of patronage that the party practices in rural strongholds.Mr. Ramaphosa, a liberation figure who also became one of the country\u2019s richest black businessmen after the end of apartheid, is considered the leader of the urban faction, and he is seen as a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Zuma as the party\u2019s leader in December.The other top contender, Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma, a former chairwoman of the African Union who was once married to Mr. Zuma, has been backed by groups most loyal to the president.The finance minister\u2019s dismissal sent the currency, the rand, plummeting as much as 5 percent at one point. The cost of borrowing for the government jumped, amid fears that rating agencies would downgrade South Africa\u2019s government bonds to junk status. Africa\u2019s most industrialized economy, South Africa is projected to grow 0.8 percent this year, and unemployment is 27 percent.Speculation is rife that Mr. Zuma might be compelled to step down before the scheduled end of his second five-year term in 2019, clearing the way for another party leader to take the reins.Mr. Gordhan, who learned of his dismissal from a television report, defended his record on Friday as protesters gathered at the headquarters of the National Treasury, part of the Finance Ministry.\u201cWe hope more and more South Africans will make it absolutely clear that our country is not for sale,\u201d Mr. Gordhan said. \u201cIt is important that the public knows what we do at the Treasury, how we serve South Africa, how the budgeting process works and how we make sure that the poor in South Africa benefit from the taxes that we collect from all South Africans, as well.\u201dThe firing on Thursday night capped a week of tensions that began on Monday when Mr. Zuma ordered Mr. Gordhan to return abruptly from a trade and investment roadshow in Britain. As rumors circulated that Mr. Gordhan would be fired, Mr. Zuma summoned A.N.C. leaders for a meeting. The meeting did not produce a consensus, officials have said.The South African Communist Party, part of the A.N.C.-led coalition that governs the country, said that Mr. Zuma had cited an intelligence report speculating that Mr. Gordhan might be plotting to undermine the president. Mr. Gordhan has called the report preposterous. Mr. Mthembu, the senior A.N.C. lawmaker, said that the intelligence report\u2019s accusations were \u201cplain rubbish.\u201dMr. Zuma, in a statement on Friday, announced that he had replaced Mr. Gordhan with Malusi Gigaba, the home affairs minister. Mr. Gordhan\u2019s deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, was also fired and replaced by Sfiso N. Buthelezi.The two new finance appointees \u2014 A.N.C. loyalists active in the party since their youth, and members of Parliament \u2014 are \u201clargely unknown to investors,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a research note on Friday. \u201cThis could create further uncertainty in South Africa\u2019s financial markets.\u201dMr. Zuma said that the shake-up \u2014 10 new ministers and 10 new deputy ministers were named \u2014 was intended to \u201cimprove efficiency and effectiveness\u201d and to \u201cbring some younger M.P.s and women into the national executive in order to benefit from their energy, experience and expertise.\u201dMr. Gordhan, after a stint as finance minister from 2009 to 2014, was reappointed to the job in December 2015, after Mr. Zuma abruptly replaced his successor, Nhlanhla Nene, with a little-known junior lawmaker. Mr. Zuma changed that decision four days later, after the rand and the stock market tumbled, and Mr. Gordhan\u2019s return to the job helped reassure investors.But Mr. Gordhan has repeatedly been at odds with the president since then. He resisted Mr. Zuma\u2019s push to approve expensive nuclear power plants, and he tried to rein in public spending. He also clashed with a powerful family, the Guptas, who are close to Mr. Zuma and are so influential that Mr. Zuma was obliged to publicly insist last year that he was in charge of his government.Trieu Pham, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities in London, said there were important differences between this week\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Gordhan and the firing of Mr. Nene in 2015. Mr. Gordhan\u2019s departure, if not the timing, had been expected; his replacement, unlike Mr. Nene\u2019s, is a cabinet minister, albeit one with limited experience in finance; and the rand and stock prices have risen in recent months, allowing some room for maneuver.\u201cThe long waiting time indicates that Zuma has well weighed the factors for and against the reshuffle, and thinks that he has garnered enough support to resist a power struggle and a breakup of the A.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Pham said.Norimitsu Onishi reported from Johannesburg, and Sewell Chan from London.

{"Headline": "As the Maldives Gains Tourists, It\u2019s Losing Its Beaches", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byGuraidhoo JournalGURAIDHOO, Maldives \u2014 From the foyer of his small guesthouse some 100 feet from the shoreline, Mohamed Nizar, 52, was wondering how long his business could remain viable.Last year, during an unusually nasty storm, water snaked through the narrow streets of Guraidhoo, a small island in the Maldives, pooling around the floor of the three-room house and chasing away guests.Down along the beach, the picture was even worse. Erosion of the shore has become so severe, he said, that the owner of a neighboring guesthouse stakes plastic jerrycans in the sand to curb flooding during sea swells.\u201cWhat is the lagoon now used to be the football field on this island,\u201d Mr. Nizar said on a recent afternoon. \u201cI have to leave this guesthouse if it keeps eroding. I am sure of it.\u201dGuesthouses have proliferated across this archipelago in the Indian Ocean, as the Maldives shifts away from catering to the \u00fcber-rich and welcomes budget-conscious travelers.But unlike resort islands, which spend millions of dollars on constructing sea walls, dredging sand and hiring marine biologists, islands with small-scale guesthouses are mostly reliant on the government for protection from shore erosion and rising seas, which many on Guraidhoo attribute to climate change.Residents say the funds for conservation projects are available in the form of tourist taxes, paid through business owners to the government. The problem, they say, is that it is unclear where the money is going \u2014 or whether it ultimately can save the world\u2019s lowest-lying country.\u201cWe\u2019re losing a nationality, an identity, a cultural history, a language, a script,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re losing the beaches. We\u2019re losing the coconut palms. We\u2019re losing everything.\u201dFor most of the Maldives\u2019s history as a tourist destination, its government prohibited visitors from staying on the 200 islands inhabited by locals. Instead, foreigners were ferried to privately owned resort islands where villas jutting out into the ocean are the norm.But after the 2008 election of Mohamed Nasheed as president \u2014 the first democratically elected leader after 30 years under autocracy \u2014 a law was passed that allowed residents to open guesthouses.Although the tourism industry is still dominated by villas rented for thousands of dollars a night, foreigners can now book more modest accommodations for as little as $30. Around 400 guesthouses are registered in the Maldives.As this backpacker brand of tourism expanded, questions have arisen about whether allowing visitors to stay alongside Maldivians would chip away at religious tradition on the islands. The Maldives is officially 100 percent Sunni Muslim.On a recent day, clusters of women wearing hijabs wove around Guraidhoo\u2019s candy-colored shops, which sell knickknacks imported from Thailand.Unlike resorts, guesthouses are prohibited from stocking alcohol, and island councils have designated certain stretches of the shoreline as \u201cbikini beaches\u201d where tourists are able to wear more revealing swim suits.The beach is its own separate island, heavily wooded and connected to the rest of Guraidhoo by a plank bridge. Occasionally, residents say, complaints are heard about the guests\u2019 attire. But for now, the question of modesty has mostly been addressed by moving the sunbathers to another island.Now, with guesthouses injecting cash into local economies and providing greater employment opportunities outside the resort industry, many hope this new revenue generator is here to stay. That is, of course, if the islands remain above water.Guraidhoo has a permanent population of around 1,900 people, but hosts 12 guesthouses and another 1,000 day visitors. But residents say the government has yet to start work on their island.\u201cIt is very simple,\u201d said Mohamed Solih, 50, the owner of Ithaa Beach Inn. \u201cThe cow that gives more milk has to be fed more. So islands that pay tourism taxes should be a priority in shore protection initiatives by the government.\u201dAsked how green taxes are spent, the Ministry of Environment directed questions to the country\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency, which directed questions to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance declined to comment despite repeated questions. A review of the country\u2019s 2017 budget proposal did not yield information about where green tax revenue is allocated.Among concerns voiced by residents of Guraidhoo are a monsoon season that has become more erratic and intense, and degradation of the reef system, which acts as a natural buffer against rising seas. There are also problems with erosion \u2014 which residents attribute to storm surges \u2014 harbor modifications and even shore protection practices on other islands.Gazing out toward the island of Kandooma, which is separated from Guraidhoo by a thin channel of water, Mr. Solih said he believed part of the erosion problem could be attributed to sand dredging at the nearby Holiday Inn Resort.\u201cErosion on this island is very much connected to the development work done on the resort,\u201d he said. \u201cKandooma is a coral rock island, not a sand island like you see now. They dredged sand and pumped sand and reclaimed the beaches. After that, erosion became a big problem here.\u201dAt the resort, Mohamed Shahid, a marine biologist who oversees shore protection projects, said sand dredging was not eroding Guraidhoo\u2019s shore, but he acknowledged that the relationship between the islands had occasionally been frosty.\u201cWe have had a lot of discussions with the local authorities on that side,\u201d he said, adding that Guraidhoo improperly disposes of garbage, which affects the resort. \u201cWe try to be diplomatic. We help them and they help us kind of a thing.\u201dOn a recent tour of the Holiday Inn, Mr. Shahid was enthusiastic about technology used to protect Kandooma. Apart from using a dredging machine, which he estimated cost several hundred thousand dollars, concrete sea walls have been erected at certain points near the beach.In total, Mr. Shahid said the operating budget for putting shore protection in place at the resort most likely surpassed $1 million.On a recent afternoon, a group of men with weather-beaten skin from the Guraidhoo council lounged on the beachfront, chewing areca nuts and discussing the next week\u2019s agenda.Hussain Yameen, 26, the council\u2019s wiry president, said it had been difficult to compromise with the resort, because, in part, he believes its work has approval from the Environmental Protection Agency. But his face brightened when asked about future projects on the island, saying he hoped Guraidhoo would have shore protection by the end of this year.\u201cRight now, we are trying to get some approval from the government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a plan on developing this island. The whole island will be protected.\u201dNear the water, Mohamed Shareef, 37, who lives in a beachfront house with six members of his family and 18 renters, was less optimistic about his chances of staying put.As water has crept closer to his home, occasionally lapping at steps leading up to the porch, islanders have begun stacking chunks of concrete from demolished buildings and pieces of broken tile along the shore to create a makeshift sea wall.Mr. Shareef said discussions of conservation on Guraidhoo should not be limited to guesthouses, which are typically built closer to the shoreline.\u201cIf another five or so feet of beach erodes, the waves will be inside my house,\u201d he said, pointing out toward the spot, over a plain of turquoise water, where a helipad used to be. \u201cIf the government wants to do something, it should not be because tourists are now coming to this island.\u201dMohamed Junayd contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "To Win Again, Democrats Must Stop Being the Abortion Party", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWhen I came to this country from Ireland some 45 years ago, a cousin, here 15 years before, advised me that Catholics vote Democratic. Having grown up in the Irish Republic, I was well disposed to Republican Party principles like local autonomy and limited government. Yet a commitment to social justice, so central to my faith, seemed better represented by the Democratic Party. I followed my cousin\u2019s good counsel.But once-solid Catholic support for Democrats has steadily eroded. This was due at least in part to the shift by many American Catholic bishops from emphasizing social issues (peace, the economy) to engaging in the culture wars (abortion, gay marriage). Along the way, many Catholics came to view the Democrats as unconditionally supporting abortion.Last year\u2019s election was a watershed in this evolution. Hillary Clinton lost the overall Catholic vote by seven points \u2014 after President Obama had won it in the previous two elections. She lost the white Catholic vote by 23 points. In heavily Catholic states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, she lost by a hair \u2014 the last by less than 1 percent. A handful more of Catholic votes per parish in those states would have won her the election.Her defeat is all the more remarkable considering that Mrs. Clinton shared many Catholic social values. By contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s disrespect for women, his racism, sexism and xenophobia should have discouraged conscientious Catholics from voting for him. So why did they? Certainly his promises to rebuild manufacturing and his tough talk on terrorism were factors. But for many traditional Catholic voters, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s unqualified support for abortion rights \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition (and promise to nominate anti-abortion Supreme Court justices) \u2014 were tipping points.Polls indicate that the nation holds mixed views about abortion. About 80 percent of Americans don\u2019t want to criminalize it again. At the same time, at least 60 percent of Americans \u2014 and most likely a higher percentage of Catholics \u2014 oppose abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Yet despite the clear complexity of those attitudes, political discourse largely ignores the possibility of a middle ground between making all abortions legal or prohibiting them entirely. Mrs. Clinton, like most Democratic politicians, fell into this either/or trap last year.When asked about abortion in the third presidential debate, Mrs. Clinton focused on the importance of a woman\u2019s right to choose, saying: \u201cI strongly support Roe v. Wade.\u201d But in making it appear as if she was viewing a wrenching moral decision only through a legal lens, she was losing many Catholic and evangelical voters. For them, her uncompromising defense of Roe was comparable to telling a group of Quakers, \u201cI\u2019m in favor of war,\u201d without even mentioning preconditions.Mr. Trump, in contrast, offered a graphic description of \u201cripping the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day,\u201d as if this were standard procedure. (More than 90 percent of American abortions are in the first trimester.)Amid Mr. Trump\u2019s dysfunction as president, Democrats may have a chance to reclaim their Catholic base in the 2018 midterm elections. By tradition and by our church\u2019s teaching on social justice, many Catholics could readily return to voting reliably Democratic. But for this to happen, their moral concerns regarding abortion must get a hearing within the party, rather than being summarily dismissed. How might that happen?To begin with, Democratic politicians should publicly acknowledge that abortion is an issue of profound moral and religious concern. As a candidate, Barack Obama did just that in a 2008 interview, saying, \u201cThose who diminish the moral elements of the decision aren\u2019t expressing the full reality of it.\u201dDemocrats should not threaten to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which forbids federal funds to be used for abortion except in extreme circumstances. They could also champion an aggressive program to promote adoption by strengthening the Adoption Assistance Act of 1980 and streamlining adoption procedures. The regulations in many states seem designed to discourage it.Democratic politicians should also continue to frame their efforts to improve health and social services as a way to decrease abortions. The abortion rate dropped 21 percent from 2009 to 2014. That downward trend would most likely end if Republicans eliminate contraception services provided through the Affordable Care Act.That Donald Trump, claiming to be anti-abortion, got the majority of Catholic votes to defeat a competent and decent Democrat underscores the continuing influence of abortion in American politics. If Democrats want to regain the Catholic vote, they must treat abortion as a moral issue, work for its continued reduction and articulate a more nuanced message than, \u201cWe support Roe v. Wade.\u201dThomas Groome is a professor of theology and religious education at Boston College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strangers on an 18-Hour Train", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byLivesMany years ago, before my family immigrated to the United States from Pakistan, we used to travel frequently by train. During a more recent trip home, instead of flying back to Karachi from Lahore, I decided to go by train again. I was interested to see what it was like traveling in economy class. I got a seat in Car No. 3, and amid thunder and rain, the train hissed out of the station. Its pace was slow. The compartment was packed.Those who had reserved seats occupied them, while others were perched on the floor, next to the seats or even by the toilets, with the result that it became difficult to move around or to use the toilet yourself. Families with little children spread quilts and pillows on the seats and on the floor.A conductor entered the car and started checking tickets. The passenger in Seat 54, a tall, middle-aged man with sharp gray eyes, had only an unreserved ticket, so he was asked to vacate the seat. But he took the conductor aside and returned in a few minutes to the same place. The conductor, overlooking the mess everywhere in the car, smiled and went about his duty.If it were not for the rains in Punjab, the heat and dust would have been unbearable. I noticed that the man sitting in Seat 54 kept watching a young woman in a window seat with a little child on her lap. The woman\u2019s eye fell on the man\u2019s face, and she immediately looked down and adjusted her dupatta, her scarf.The night wore on, and people began to close their eyes, but the seats were so uncomfortable that only a very heavy sleeper could manage to get any rest. The train continued its slow pace, stopping every so often at another station. Because of the heat and suffocating air in the compartment, many windows were kept open. The woman with the child on her lap looked over at the man in Seat 54. He was still staring at her. I was beginning to get angry with him. Even under such filthy and uncomfortable circumstances, he couldn\u2019t resist indulging his desire to gaze at an attractive woman. She began to look back at him with fire in her eyes.Turning her face away, she played with the child again for a while. The train was approaching a station. I could see the familiar lights of Khanewal, and as we stopped, a memory flashed through my mind. Two decades earlier, whenever we traveled this route and stopped at this station, my little daughter would urge me to take her out and buy some ceramic toys from one of the stalls. We would buy the toys, and I would enjoy a cup of tea in a clay cup at a tea stall. It was now 2 a.m., and I got down from the train to recapture this pleasant memory. I was drinking my tea when two burly men came near me and stood on either side. I could feel something probing at my right. \u201cTake out your wallet and give it to me,\u201d ordered one of them. I took it out and handed it to him. The other man relieved me of my wristwatch. \u201cHave a safe journey,\u201d one said before they both disappeared.I was shaken, and not just because I lost my wallet and watch. The watch was cheap, bought for four dollars from Kmart in Chicago, and there were only a hundred rupees in my wallet; the rest of my money, my credit cards and my IDs were safely tucked inside my shoes. But it struck me that you should never try to recapture the memorable scenes of the past, because you are likely to lose those memories forever. I finished the cup of tea and returned to my seat on the train.The train started again. The child was still awake on his mother\u2019s lap, but the woman found it difficult to keep her eyes open. She was soon lost in a short wink of sleep. Her head fell forward. A moment later, the child began to climb the open window \u2014 one leg went over it. The man in Seat 54 leapt up and grabbed the child before he fell out.The commotion woke up the woman. She seemed to be in a panic, and then reality dawned. \u201cHere you are,\u201d the man said as he gave the child back to her. \u201cYour child has been looking for an opportunity to crawl out of the window,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have been watching the whole time.\u201d He stretched his back and moved away. The woman was dumbfounded, and so was I.The woman had a few sips of water, then got up to thank the man, but he was nowhere to be seen. The train moved on. Early in the morning, at Drigh Road Station, the woman got up to get off the train. She searched for the man again but couldn\u2019t find him.\u201cBhai,\u201d she addressed me, calling me brother. \u201cIf you see that man, will you kindly thank him on my behalf?\u201dI nodded. Before I got down at Karachi Cantt, I searched the whole compartment for him \u2014 but he was gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushners, Trump In-Laws, Weigh $400 Million Deal With Chinese Firm", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byA New York real estate company owned by the family of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law has been negotiating to sell a $400 million stake in its Fifth Avenue flagship skyscraper to a Chinese insurance company with ties to leading families of the Communist Party.The Chinese company, Anbang Insurance Group, would pay to get a high-profile piece of Manhattan real estate and would commit to spending billions more to completely transform the 60-year-old tower into a chic condominium and retail citadel.If signed, the potential agreement would create a financial marriage of two politically powerful families in the world\u2019s two biggest economies, but it would also present the possibility of glaring conflicts of interest. The Kushner family, owners of the tower, would reap a financial windfall courtesy of a Chinese company, even as Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump as well as his son-in-law, helps oversee American foreign policy.News of the negotiations surfaced as President Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, were preparing for their first meeting, to be held next month.Asked about a deal at a news conference on Tuesday, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, referred questions back to the Kushner Companies. \u201cJared went through extraordinary lengths\u201d to comply with conflict-of-interest rules, he said.A spokesman for Anbang said in a statement that there was no agreement and that \u201cthere is no investment from Anbang for this deal.\u201dIn his presentation to prospective investors, Charles Kushner, the leader of the family company and Jared\u2019s father, has said that once renovated, the property would be worth more than $7 billion, according to a real estate broker and two investors who have heard the pitch and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they want to do further business with the companies. That would make it the most valuable property in Manhattan.Anbang, a huge Chinese conglomerate with almost $300 billion in assets, is owned by 39 companies, many of them shell companies that, when traced, lead to empty offices or government registration bureaus, according to Chinese government records. At least 35 of the companies, which collectively control more than 92 percent of Anbang, trace all or part of their ownership to relatives of Mr. Wu, to Deng\u2019s granddaughter or to Chen Xiaolu, the marshal\u2019s son, though the three no longer show up as owners in company records, The New York Times reported in September.Should an agreement be reached, going into business with the family of the son-in-law of the American president would buy Mr. Wu an immense amount of credibility within China because he is seen as having influence at the apex of power in the United States, said Minxin Pei, a professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College in California, who focuses on Chinese politics and corruption.\u201cHe is purchasing political prestige, and that is a priceless asset for somebody like him,\u201d Mr. Pei said by telephone.A deal, however, could face scrutiny by the American and Chinese governments before it is completed. The Chinese government has been eager to stanch the flow of overseas investments as the economy slows.A White House press officer said that \u201cthese private-sector negotiations will not affect the Trump administration\u2019s policies or approach with China in any way.\u201dThe deal would value the 41-story aluminum-clad office tower at $2.8 billion, a high value for a building that has never been considered a New York trophy. Anbang would eventually take a controlling stake in the property and obtain a $4 billion construction loan, Bloomberg said, for a makeover of the tower, which would have luxury apartments at the top, a multifloor retail mall at the base, and a hotel in the middle.The proposed development comes at an odd time in New York.For years, foreign investors have poured billions of dollars into New York apartments, hotels, office buildings and developments based on a perception that this is one of the most stable markets in a tumultuous world. But luxury hotel rates in New York have started to fall, and developers who rushed to build supertowers with $100 million penthouses have seen a drastic slowdown in sales.The Kushner family declined to discuss details of the deal.\u201cKushner Companies is in active discussions around 666 Fifth,\u201d a spokesman said in a brief statement Monday, \u201cand nothing has been finalized.\u201dA spokeswoman for Kushner Companies had said previously that Jared Kushner recused himself in November, not long after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, to avoid conflicts of interest.Mr. Kushner has also since stepped away from the day-to-day business of the company and placed some of his assets in a trust.Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, said on Monday that Mr. Kushner had sold his interest in 666 Fifth Avenue to a trust in which neither he, nor his wife, Ivanka Trump, nor their children are beneficiaries at a price \u201cbased on third-party appraisals.\u201d The amount paid has not been revealed. Ms. Hicks, in an email, also said that Mr. Kushner \u201chas not communicated with anyone regarding this matter since the president took office.\u201dThe Kushners bought 666 Fifth for $1.8 billion on Jared\u2019s birthday in January 2007, as part of a plan to reposition the family company as a major Manhattan developer. Until then, the Kushners were based in New Jersey, where they owned a huge portfolio of suburban garden apartments and donated heavily to the Democratic Party.But the deal at 666 Fifth came with a big price, $1,200 per square foot. As the family struggled to make its mortgage payments amid the recession, it slowly sold segments to Vornado Realty Trust, which owns 49.5 percent of the building\u2019s office space and a slice of the retail, and others. They would have to be bought out for the deal to close.A spokesman for Vornado declined to comment.The proposed deal would be a form of political risk insurance for Mr. Wu, said Mr. Pei, the political science professor. China is in the middle of a widespread crackdown on corruption, and billionaires are not immune.\u201cNow he has extra protection, because Chinese authorities who want to come after him will now have to think twice about the political fallout,\u201d said Mr. Pei, who wrote \u201cChina\u2019s Crony Capitalism.\u201d \u201cFor him, it is a brilliant move.\u201dSusanne Craig contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump\u2019s Island Mentality", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byEditorialThroughout history, American presidents have declared it their job to protect and advance the interests of the United States and its citizens. President Trump has shoehorned that wholesome, uncontroversial idea into a narrow-minded, exclusionary governing platform that\u2019s likely to alienate much of the world while hurting the very people whose cause he claims to uphold.In his campaign, his Inaugural Address and, most recently, his speech to Congress, Mr. Trump has proudly embraced the isolationist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rallying cry from the 1930s while rejecting the internationalism of his predecessors. He has disparaged NATO, an alliance that has helped keep the peace in Europe for more than half a century; cozied up to Russia and its latter-day czar, Vladimir Putin; disdained global solutions to global problems like climate change and the surge of refugees from Syria, Iraq and elsewhere; and declared his intention to upend the international trading system created by the United States and its allies. Nowhere is his cramped vision more evident than in his scapegoating of unauthorized immigrants as criminals and his rejection of the American ideal of welcoming the foreign-born.A GO-IT-ALONE APPROACHOf late, Mr. Trump has seemed to back off from some of his views, as in his assertion on Tuesday evening that \u201cwe strongly support NATO.\u201d But it is unclear what that will mean in practice, especially since Defense Secretary Jim Mattis repeated Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to \u201cmoderate\u201d America\u2019s commitments to NATO if the allies don\u2019t pony up more for defense.In one breath Mr. Trump tells Congress, \u201cOur allies will find that America is once again ready to lead\u201d; minutes later, he says: \u201cMy job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.\u201d No president can claim to represent the world; yet since World War II, all have accepted, even celebrated, America\u2019s unique power and ability to lead in promoting democracy, peace and free markets. The word \u201cdemocracy\u201d did not appear in Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, something that should have been central to this address. And he said little about working with allies on common interests.One retreat from world leadership can be seen in Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to cut funding for the State Department and foreign aid by as much as 37 percent. Many in Congress have expressed opposition to these reductions that, if carried through, could force the downsizing of already understaffed embassies, curtail communication with other governments and multilateral institutions, and devastate programs that help feed starving people and support keeping the peace.ECONOMIC NATIONALISMBy raising tariffs and canceling trade agreements, the Trump administration will needlessly hurt American businesses and workers while antagonizing friendly countries. A far better approach would be to insist on stronger labor and currency standards in trade agreements while helping American workers and industry by investing in education and infrastructure.ANTI-IMMIGRATION HYSTERIAIt would be beyond foolish for America to withdraw into a shell. The country is not diminished, but strengthened, when it engages with the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Dubai\u2019s Skyline Adds a Trophy, the Architect Calls It Stolen", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byNow, Dubai is about to gain another landmark. The Dubai Frame, set to open this year, is literally and figuratively a frame imposed on the overwhelming view \u2014 two parallel towers linked by an observation deck. It is a marker of how far the city has traveled, drawing the eye from the drab buildings of the old settlement along Dubai Creek to the riotous profusion of neon-draped skyscrapers stretching south to the Persian Gulf. It is a totem of Dubai\u2019s ambitions.It may also be counterfeit.The Mexican-born architect whose initial design inspired the structure, Fernando Donis, has accused the Dubai municipality of breaching his copyright in a lawsuit filed in December in United States federal court. Nine years ago, Mr. Donis won an international competition to design the building, besting more than 900 other entrants. Yet he was not included in the project\u2019s execution and was not compensated for his intellectual property, his lawsuit claims.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d Mr. Donis said. \u201cThe Frame is mine, and they don\u2019t want to grant that it is mine. The infringement doesn\u2019t just victimize me. They have taken something from all architects \u2014 the protection of our ideas.\u201dRaised as a monument to Dubai\u2019s aspirations as a center of international commerce, the Frame is now a physical manifestation of the crude system that erected it.Dubai\u2019s ruling al-Maktoum family has long pledged reforms aimed at bringing rule of law to a business realm often subject to the self-interested edicts of officials. But the city\u2019s entrenched system leaves outsiders vulnerable to mistreatment \u2014 from professionals sketching blueprints to construction workers laying foundations.Both tend to arrive for similar reasons, using Dubai as an opportunity to advance their fortunes. Professionals come hoping to make their names. Migrant workers descend from some of the poorest nations on earth \u2014 Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines \u2014 seeking to support families at home.Both are prone to similar fates. Professionals can find themselves shortchanged and lacking redress in a system in which kinship can outweigh contract terms. Migrant workers frequently fall prey to shady recruiters proffering exaggerated wages.In crying foul, Mr. Donis joined other foreign professionals who have described a system in which proximity to power trumps the sanctity of law.In 2009, investors from the United States, Britain, Russia and elsewhere contended that they had been cheated by Al Fajer Properties, a developer founded by a sheikh who is part of the al-Maktoum family. One British investor, Moses Oye, said the developer used falsified pictures to raise $140 million, making it appear that apartments in a high-rise development had already been completed though no construction had taken place. Calls for a probe by the Dubai government yielded no action, Mr. Oye said.\u201cWhat do you do when the independent government agency trusted by the ruler of Dubai to regulate and monitor the real estate developer\u2019s performance actually participates in a cover-up operation that deprives investors of their rights?\u201d Mr. Oye said.A spokesman for Al Fajer denied wrongdoing, adding that any blame should fall on a local sales agent.9 PhotosTwo years ago, dozens of investors in the Palm Jebel Ali \u2014 a manufactured archipelago shaped like a palm tree, and planned to include villas, a water park and six marinas \u2014 took the extraordinary step of writing to Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, pleading for clarity on the future of their holdings.The project is the work of Nakheel, now a government-owned developer started by a sheikh who served as a key adviser to the ruling family. Construction began in 2002. But as real estate prices plunged after the global financial crisis of 2008, Nakheel halted work while hanging on to deposits reaching 50 percent of the villa prices.Nakheel said it began offering refunds in 2011, but investors complained that they were not being made whole. The company maintains that it has \u201clong-term\u201d plans to complete the project.A Nakheel spokesman did not respond to questions.Among migrant workers in Dubai, tales of mistreatment are legion.As a parade of workers returned to their dormitories from prayers at a nearby mosque on a recent afternoon, some complained that they receive less than what is due. Most are in debt to recruitment agents who arranged their jobs. The agents typically retain their passports, workers say.When things go awry, workers sometimes find themselves caught \u2014 unable to switch jobs, and unable to go home. One such worker is S. Ramesh, who arrived here last summer from India thinking he had found a way to support his family and who now worries he may never see his family again. On a recent morning, he stood outside a dormitory that houses workers constructing the Frame, begging for help.The United Arab Emirates, the federation that includes Dubai, has responded to such experiences with reforms for workers at both ends of the economic spectrum. The federation has strengthened contract law while protecting minority shareholders. It has made it permissible for migrant workers to switch jobs while outlawing payments to recruitment firms.But the niceties of the law contrast with the daily realities of the marketplace. Dubai\u2019s economy is dominated by developers that function like arms of the government and have relationships with the al-Maktoum family.The lawsuit Mr. Donis filed seeks unspecified compensation for damages and a ruling that his copyright was breached.The Dubai municipality has \u201ctaken the Dubai Frame as its own without paying or crediting the person who created it,\u201d said Edward Klaris, a New York-based lawyer representing the architect. (Mr. Klaris is married to Robin Pogrebin, a writer for The New York Times.) \u201cThis is an egregious infringement of international copyright and a sad case of sovereign bullying that deserves to be corrected.\u201dThe Dubai municipality did not respond to questions. In correspondence with Mr. Donis reviewed by The New York Times, the Dubai government dismissed his complaints, noting that he received a $100,000 prize for winning the competition. City officials maintain Mr. Donis lacked local licenses needed to execute the project.So much has changed here since the 1960s, when this smuggler\u2019s paradise was home to only 40,000 people and barely had electricity. In the decades since, Dubai has exploded into a modern metropolis of 2.7 million, a global transportation hub, a regional financial center and a popular tourist destination.Yet beneath the surface, much remains the same.In Bur Dubai, the oldest part of the city, young men patrol the outskirts of a bazaar, wooing shoppers with promises of cheap copies of Rolex watches, Gucci handbags and Louis Vuitton luggage. \u201cReal, genuine fakes,\u201d one said. Three miles away, inside the gates of Za\u2019abeel Park, scores of laborers apply a patina of gold to the sides of Mr. Donis\u2019s creation.\u201cThey simply wanted to take the project and eliminate my name,\u201d he said.From the observation tower atop the Frame, Dubai is supposed to shimmer with modernity. Lost in the haze are the concrete-block dormitories honeycombed with closet-size rooms that house migrant workers.They are the inconspicuous force behind Dubai\u2019s staggering development. Some eight million migrants reside in the United Arab Emirates, according to the United Nations, or roughly 84 percent of the population \u2014 the largest concentration on earth.Kauser Sorker, 31, a laborer from Bangladesh, works at the Frame, erecting scaffolding. He earns 850 dirham a month (about $231) \u2014 enough to send money home to his wife and 4-year-old daughter, but not enough to see a different life ahead of them. \u201cThe company makes the promised payments,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not much.\u201dOn a recent trip home to visit his family, his daughter treated him like a stranger. Here in Dubai, loneliness tears at him. \u201cI am always thinking about my family,\u201d he said.And yet the Frame workers are comparatively fortunate. Outside Mr. Sorker\u2019s dormitory in the al Quoz industrial area, S. Ramesh stands on the cracked sidewalk, beseeching passers-by for rescue.Mr. Ramesh, who like many Indians uses a single initial, comes from outside the city of Hyderabad. He and his wife and their two children grew okra, corn and tomatoes, subsisting on less than $2,000 a year.When the monsoon rains failed to arrive last June, their crops vanished into dust. They went to a Hindu temple and made an offering. A staffing agency offered to secure him a construction job in Dubai, promising he would earn more than $500 a month.Mr. Ramesh had to hand over two months of his future salary to cover the cost of arranging his contract, his air travel and his visa. His wife sold her wedding jewelry.When he arrived in Dubai, he was taken to a squat dormitory block on a street reeking of raw sewage.The next morning, the agent drove him to a high-rise building. He would not be doing construction, but rather cleaning apartments. From 5 in the morning until 7 at night, Mr. Ramesh vacuumed, dusted and scrubbed, he said, stopping only for a 15-minute lunch break. Then he walked back to the dorm through the blistering Arabian heat, past an indoor ski area complete with machine-made snow.Four months after arriving, he had yet to be paid, he said. The agent tells him that his visa has proved more expensive than expected.Mr. Ramesh cleans the rooms of other migrant workers in exchange for minutes on their phones to call his wife in India. She sobs and tells him to come home.But the agent has his passport and has refused to refund his recruitment fee, he said. He has no money for a plane ticket.The view engineered by Mr. Donis, the architect, crops out such everyday tragedies, spotlighting a futuristic tangle of glass and steel.Mr. Ramesh is beyond that frame.\u201cThis is my destiny,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m stuck.\u201dFor Mr. Donis, Dubai was supposed to be the place for his solo debut.The competition, in 2008, beckoned as an invitation to create something prominent \u2014 \u201can iconic tall emblem structure that contributes to the new face of Dubai,\u201d according to the rules. The municipality set a goal of attracting two million tourists a year to the site.The contest was overseen by ThyssenKrupp Elevator, a German industrial giant. It was governed by the rules of the International Union of Architects, an organization affiliated with Unesco that lays down a code of conduct for professionals. Union-supervised competitions had produced designs for the Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Pompidou Center in Paris.Mr. Donis, 44, had already spent enough time in Dubai to be struck by its audacity. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that a city can just be raised from scratch in such a short time,\u201d he said.Unlike neighboring Abu Dhabi, which is rich in oil, Dubai has little of that precious commodity. City leaders folded the proceeds from what oil they had into infrastructure, making Dubai a major shipbuilder and container port. Then, they turned it into one of the busiest air hubs on earth, a gateway connecting Asia to Europe and North America.Successive waves of real estate development have constructed an empire of luxury high-rise apartments and resorts centered on hedonistic pursuits. Today, Dubai is a city where one can sit in a glass-fronted dining room atop a seven-star hotel and dine on truffles and caviar while gazing at beachfront villas set on an island shaped like a palm tree.\u201cI was very critical of the architecture,\u201d Mr. Donis said. \u201cI thought, you could propose something else, something more serious.\u201dHe sketched a slender, unadorned frame, a concept he had written about at length in his graduate studies. City leaders declared him the winner. They flew him to Dubai and honored him with a celebration dinner at the Raffles Hotel. He presented his vision to the crown prince.The contest rules endowed him with legal ownership of his idea: \u201cThe author of the preliminary design placed first will keep his copyright and his work may only be used by the Dubai Municipality when he has signed the corresponding contract.\u201dYet almost as soon as contract negotiations commenced in June 2009, municipal officials signaled their intent to force Mr. Donis to transfer the copyright, according to hundreds of pages of correspondence reviewed by The Times.They haggled over fees. The municipality threatened to give the job to a local firm, according to the documents reviewed by The Times. Mr. Donis repeatedly lowered his demands for compensation while holding fast to the one thing he valued most \u2014 his copyright.But the municipality insisted on gaining the copyright, Mr. Donis said. It cited rules requiring that architects working in Dubai maintain a local registered office, meaning he could serve only as a consultant.Mr. Binno did not respond to repeated calls and emails posing questions.Mr. Donis raised the specter of legal action. He sought aid from ThyssenKrupp. He wrote a complaint to the International Union of Architects, addressing his letter to the co-director of the union\u2019s competition division, Tomaz Kancler.In an email to The New York Times sent in response to questions, Mr. Kancler said he and the union confronted Dubai officials with concerns that Mr. Donis was being unfairly excluded.\u201cWe realized the deviations from the rules,\u201d Mr. Kancler wrote.The pressure produced an invitation for Mr. Donis to visit Dubai. There, the architect recalled, municipal officials assured him that a contract would soon be readied enabling him to keep the copyright.But when the proposed contract arrived, it offered only an advisory role. He had to hand over his copyright. He would be barred from promoting his work. The municipality could terminate the contract at any point.\u201cIt\u2019s like you have no contract,\u201d Mr. Donis said.He tried to negotiate further, but Dubai officials stopped responding. Construction began.In October 2012, he received a letter from Ram\u00f3n Sotomayor, chief executive at the time for southern Europe, Africa and the Middle East for ThyssenKrupp Elevator. The issue Mr. Donis had been complaining about amounted to \u201ca commercial disagreement,\u201d Mr. Sotomayor wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by The Times. \u201cThyssenKrupp does not have any possibility to interfere.\u201dMr. Donis ultimately named ThyssenKrupp a co-defendant in his lawsuit. A ThyssenKrupp spokesman said the suit \u201chas no basis at all,\u201d because the company \u201chad no role in the decision awarding the architecture contract for the Dubai Frame,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will defend our position in court vigorously.\u201dLate in 2013, Mr. Donis was aghast to find photos on the web showing that the Frame had been transformed into a literal picture frame adorned with gold leaf \u2014 a departure from his stark, unornamented conception.He wrote one last time to the Dubai director general: \u201cIf the images published indeed show what seems to be the updated building design, the Dubai Frame \u2014 and I say this with the highest respect \u2014 will be far from becoming a masterpiece.\u201dThese days, Mr. Donis works in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, more than 4,000 miles away from Dubai. He catches glimpses of his creation via occasional news articles on the web.\u201cIt looks fantastic over all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they stole it.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "North and South Korea Give China a Double Headache", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government is ratcheting up pressure on South Korea over its plans to deploy an American missile defense system, with the state-controlled news media urging the public to boycott South Korean retail products and threatening diplomatic and even military repercussions.China\u2019s latest pronouncements follow months of not-so-subtle punitive measures that have already taken a toll on the South Korean economy, including an unofficial ban on Korean television shows and pop stars. The campaign risks a backlash in South Korea even as Beijing\u2019s relations with North Korea have also grown strained \u2014 a sign of how recent advances in the North\u2019s nuclear program have put China in a bind and are upsetting the regional security balance.No date has been set for the system\u2019s deployment, but the Pentagon said on Wednesday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wanted it in place \u201cas soon as feasible.\u201d Military experts said the United States could use C-17 transport aircraft to quickly move the system\u2019s truck-mounted launchers, interceptors, radar, fire control units and support equipment to South Korea.An outspoken Chinese general, Luo Yuan, now retired, recommended a tough series of responses in an article on Thursday, going so far as to suggest a military strike against the missile system. \u201cWe could conduct a surgical hard-kill operation that would destroy the target, paralyzing it and making it unable to hit back,\u201d General Luo wrote in the Global Times, a state-run newspaper that often features strident, nationalist views.\u201cSince the United States, Japan and South Korea choose not to respect China\u2019s major security concerns, China does not need to be a gentleman on everything,\u201d the general wrote. \u201cWe must not undermine our own security interests while respecting the security interests of others.\u201dPeople\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper that is often considered the official voice of the leadership, said in its international edition this week that China should consider a \u201cde facto\u201d severance of diplomatic ties with South Korea.It said in a commentary that China should take \u201cpolitical and military measures\u201d against South Korea and that it should consider coordinating with Russia in dealing with what it called the \u201cU.S.-Japan-South Korea antimissile network.\u201d The paper was referring in part to statements by Japan that it might consider using Thaad as a defense against North Korea.China has said that the Thaad system would threaten its nuclear deterrent capacity. It said the system\u2019s powerful radar would make it much easier for the United States to detect Chinese missiles and would give the American military much more time to intercept them.Chinese state news outlets have also suggested a consumer boycott of South Korean products. Much of China\u2019s anger has been borne by Lotte, a South Korean conglomerate that provided the government with land for the Thaad deployment in a deal that was finalized this week. Lotte has stores and shopping malls across China, and modest groups of mostly older Chinese held protests at the company\u2019s outlets in several cities on Thursday.On Wednesday, the Lotte website serving Chinese shoppers was hacked, the company said. On Thursday, another hacking attack shut down its duty-free shop\u2019s website for several hours. Lotte also said that some construction had been stopped by the Chinese authorities on the grounds that it had failed a fire inspection.In recent months, popular South Korean stars have been denied visas to perform in China, and South Korean TV shows have been blocked from Chinese video streaming websites. Many in South Korea say they believe those actions are in retaliation for the Thaad issue, though China has denied any link.\u201cAs soon as the opportunities reopen, she will resume her concerts in China,\u201d Mr. Jo said. \u201cBut right now, we have no idea when that will happen.\u201dTrade experts said Beijing might be reluctant to take more extreme economic measures. China is South Korea\u2019s largest trading partner by far, but South Korea is also China\u2019s fourth-largest, and Beijing would probably be reluctant to damage those ties during the current economic slowdown.South Korean politicians have said that Washington wants the Thaad system deployed by mid-May, when many expect presidential elections to be held in the South. President Park Geun-hye was impeached by South Korea\u2019s legislature in December over a corruption scandal, and she awaits a ruling by the country\u2019s Constitutional Court on whether she will be permanently removed from office. The court\u2019s decision is expected in the coming weeks, and if it rules against her, a new president will be elected 60 days later.South Korea\u2019s progressive opposition is seen as having a strong chance of winning the presidency should that election be held. Opposition politicians have expressed skepticism about the Thaad system, and some have charged that the United States wants to rush the deployment to ensure that it is completed before a new president takes office.Members of the largest opposition party, the Democratic Party, have visited China twice since August. In January, in an unusual development, a delegation from the party met with the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi.China had hoped it could persuade the South\u2019s next president to refuse to agree to Thaad, said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cNow China is afraid Thaad will be deployed before the new president of South Korea is in office,\u201d he said.Even as China\u2019s fury toward the South is on full display, it is also at odds with the North. A North Korean diplomat, Ri Kil-song, arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for five days of talks, an apparent effort by Pyongyang to reach out to China, its economic and political benefactor.Mr. Ri and Mr. Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, made soothing public statements on Wednesday about the \u201ctraditional friendship\u201d between their two countries. Behind the scenes, though, things are unlikely to have been so smooth.The killing may have been taken as an affront by Beijing because the victim had lived in Macau, a Chinese special administrative region.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Environmental \u2018Wrecking Ball\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:The Trump administration appears poised to take a wrecking ball to a rule that increases the mileage for cars, trucks and S.U.V.s, saves consumers money (on average $1,500 a vehicle), cuts oil use and reduces harmful pollution.The automakers were key architects of these standards when they came out in 2012, but now some are trying to back out of their commitment, even though they are experiencing record sales, and new technologies are coming on line to make it faster and cheaper than expected to meet these standards.It is a travesty that the Trump administration would let the car companies renege on such an important agreement. But it will be a long hard fight. It will take years to repeal the rule, and at the end of the day, the Trump administration will have to persuade a skeptical court that there is new information that justifies changing course.Supporters of this rule are ready for that fight.KEN KIMMELL, CAMBRIDGE, MASS.The writer is president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.To the Editor:In the meantime, he will err on the side of recklessness and gut programs already in place or planned that aim to better understand and curb emissions.TOM GOODMAN, PHILADELPHIATo the Editor:As a Republican appointee, I had the pleasure of working for hard-working, thoughtful Bill Ruckelshaus at the start of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. The E.P.A. was established by a conservative president, Richard Nixon, and supported by every Republican and Democratic president since, including our most conservative president, Ronald Reagan. As \u201cRuck\u201d points out, this support came because it was demanded by the American people, by their representatives in Congress and by the economy of the United States.While every large-scale entity, especially government entities, needs periodic review and change, it is the basis of conservatism to conserve the good as we evolve as a society. A clean, healthy environment is essential for America, and we should be setting the standard for the global economies.It is also essential to reinvigorate our federalist system, but that does not mean erasing the federal component and leaving the entire job to the states. After all, air and water do not know anything about political borders.The new, learning Trump-Pence administration will, I hope, take the time to examine the complexities of environmental regulation and proceed wisely, and sometimes slowly. It is the conservative way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Plots Demise of Bronx\u2019s Unloved Sheridan Expressway", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byMr. Cuomo said he intended to include nearly $700 million in the state budget for the first phase of the project, which would involve the rare step of decommissioning the expressway, also known as Interstate 895. That would be the first significant funding of a plan that community activists and some local elected officials have championed for more than 15 years.\u201cThis is transformative,\u201d said Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president. \u201cYou cannot put any dollar figure on the amount of quality time that families are going to be able to spend along the river.\u201dHe was referring to the Bronx River, which was once one of the most polluted waterways in the country. Now, Mr. Diaz said, the river not only supports fish again but is also home to beavers.He said the Sheridan Expressway was among the \u201cmajor fumbles and errors\u201d of Mr. Moses, the highway-enamored city planner who designed the Cross Bronx Expressway and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. \u201cHe was considered the great planner of his day, but he didn\u2019t necessarily do it with consideration of the community,\u201d Mr. Diaz said.Mr. Moses originally intended the Sheridan, which is just over a mile long, to extend farther, plowing through the Bronx Zoo and connecting to the New England Thruway. But that plan failed to gain public support, leaving the Sheridan as an underused stub that links the Cross-Bronx to the Bruckner Expressway.Large trucks still use the expressway to get to and from the produce market at Hunts Point. But those trucks exit the Sheridan and rumble through local streets to reach the market.David R. Shuffler, a community activist, lives on one of those streets and said he feared for the safety of his 1-year-old son. \u201cI hear trucks barreling through my street every single night and all day long,\u201d said Mr. Shuffler, who is the executive director of Youth Ministries for Peace and Justice.Mr. Shuffler\u2019s organization is a member of the South Bronx River Watershed Alliance, which has been campaigning for changes to the Sheridan since 1999. The group derailed a state plan to extend the Sheridan to the Hunts Point market and has pressed for alternatives that would be less disruptive to the community. That pressure led to a federally funded study by city planners in 2013 that recommended transforming the Sheridan by installing traffic lights and crosswalks.Mr. Cuomo said his plan would strike a balance between the community\u2019s demands for a safer roadway that offers access to the parks along the river and the needs of the merchants in the market. He said it would also help to bring down the persistently high rates of asthma among children who grow up around Hunts Point.\u201cIt\u2019s a line of trucks and it\u2019s loud and it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a phone interview, describing the traffic through Hunts Point. But he said that the market is a critical part of the economy of the Bronx, employing about 3,500 workers, many of whom live in the surrounding neighborhoods.Getting the various community groups to agree on a comprehensive solution was complicated, Mr. Cuomo said. But, he added, \u201cThis was always a money problem.\u201dMr. Cuomo said he would allocate $600 million, in addition to a previous allocation of $97 million, toward the first phase of what would ultimately be a $1.8 billion project. It would turn the Sheridan from an interstate highway into Sheridan Boulevard, with landscaped medians and at least two crosswalks.\u201cThat is what makes it a boulevard,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cThere\u2019s no turning back on that. Otherwise, you\u2019re not doing a boulevard.\u201dLater phases of the plan call for new ramps, including one that would carry trucks over the Bruckner Expressway and onto Edgewater Road, which leads directly to the Hunts Point market. The project was also designed to eliminate a notorious bottleneck at the interchange of the Sheridan and the Bruckner by adding a lane to the Bruckner and relocating ramps to the Sheridan.All of those changes should reduce travel time for trucks going to and from the market, about one-fifth of which use the Sheridan, state officials said. The less time the trucks spend idling, the less exhaust they will spew into an area once known as \u201casthma alley,\u201d officials said.Elena Conte, the director of policy at the Pratt Center for Community Development, which is part of the community group alliance, called the governor\u2019s commitment laudable but said she was awaiting the details of his plan. \u201cIt\u2019s an encouraging start, and a lot of very important details need to be worked out,\u201d Ms. Conte said.\u201cTo the extent that the proposal the governor is investing in seeks to address the legacy of Robert Moses\u2019 top-down planning, it is a visionary step forward,\u201d Ms. Conte said. \u201dIf Governor Cuomo wants credit for undoing the legacy of Robert Moses in the South Bronx, he will do that not just by making physical changes but also by listening to a community that Moses pointedly ignored.\u201dAn earlier version of this article on mobile included a map that misidentified the number in the road sign for the Bruckner Expressway. It is Interstate 278, not 287.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Acts. Workers in Mexico and Merchants in Malaysia Suffer.", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Rising interest rates in the United States are driving money out of many developing countries, straining governments and pinching consumers around the globe.Supported byCIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ, Mexico \u2014 Francisca Hervis Reyes and her family have persevered on the border, working in factories more than 1,300 miles from their hometown. They remained even as deadly warfare between drug cartels turned this city into one of the most dangerous on the planet.Like millions of other people from Southeast Asia to Africa to Latin America, Ms. Reyes and her family are absorbing the consequences of a major shift playing out in the global economy.By mandate, the Fed is answerable to the people of the United States.When times are lean and businesses are reluctant to hire, the Fed makes money more available by nudging down rates. When times are good and concern builds about elevated prices, it cools things off by lifting rates and tightening credit.Yet in reality, the Fed is the central banker to the world.The dollar is the money used most widely as the repository of savings and as the currency for trade. When the Fed lowers rates, it makes the dollar less attractive, encouraging investors to seek rewards elsewhere. When the Fed lifts rates, investors switch gears, yanking capital and selling off other currencies.\u201cEvery time the peso goes down, we can afford less and less,\u201d Ms. Reyes said on a recent evening, as pale desert light gave way to chilly darkness. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about going back to Veracruz. People are leaving the factories and going back to their towns.\u201dThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third consecutive quarter.The Fed forces can be traumatic, especially in less affluent places.More than $259 billion poured into developing countries the next year, according to the Institute of International Finance, a trade association. From 2010 to 2015, the annual capital flows to those places averaged $328 billion.\u201cThe effect of interest rate increases on emerging countries is surprisingly strong,\u201d said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, an international trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing.\u201dMost economists assume the rate increases expected this year will play out far less dramatically. The Fed has telegraphed its plans, giving investors time to prepare. Many emerging countries have amassed larger reserves of dollars, giving them ammunition against a drop in their currencies.Still, some countries are already showing strains.Within the investing world, the peso functions as a proxy for all developing countries \u2014 the thing to bet against when sentiments go negative. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the first port of call for anyone who thinks something bad is going to happen to emerging markets,\u201d said Mark Weisbrot, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. \u201cMexico is vulnerable.\u201dChinese leaders have long nursed fears about an uncontrolled exodus of cash.Allen Zhang, an electrician who works at a coal mine in the mountains of central China, lives in a modest house on the edge of Jincheng, a gritty city whose population has roughly quadrupled over the last quarter-century, to about 500,000.Mr. Zhang has sought to supplement his $290-a-month pay by satisfying new demand for housing. He has tapped into his savings and used his handyman skills to add six rooms to his family home, renting the new quarters out to factory workers.A buyer recently offered $350,000 for the house \u2014 a sum equivalent to what Mr. Zhang would earn in the mines over a century. He turned it down.\u201cI want more,\u201d he said.These are the expectations confronting Chinese officials as the Fed makes it more difficult to keep money inside the country.During the 1990s, China ignored lectures from Washington on the merits of opening up capital markets. When the Asian financial crisis arrived in the late 1990s and investors pulled money out of the region, many economies were leveled. China suffered little, claiming vindication.In the face of the Fed, China retains formidable powers to support the value of its currency. It is sitting on some $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, money it can use to buy its currency in world markets.\u201cMoney in China cannot get out without going through a lot of hoops,\u201d said Zhu Ning, an economist at Tsinghua University.For Vincent Lo, a billionaire real estate developer, such hoops amount to an operational problem.Mr. Lo has long raised financing for projects in China by selling bonds in Hong Kong and Singapore. Before new controls, his companies had over $2 billion worth of renminbi sitting in bank accounts in mainland China \u2014 more than enough to pay his debts coming due outside the mainland.But once China began imposing more limits on the movement of money, his cash and his debts were on different sides of the divide.Mr. Lo has raised $500 million in recent weeks by selling dollar-denominated bonds in Singapore.\u201cI don\u2019t want to get hit with not having the foreign currency to pay,\u201d he said. \u201cI might just get a couple hundred million more.\u201dA year ago, the lights were burning brightly for Vivy Yusof, a prominent Malaysian entrepreneur. So brightly that, on an episode of her reality show, she joked, \u201cI\u2019m Kim Kardashian.\u201dMs. Yusof is at once a symbol of what has gone economically right in Malaysia and, with the Fed now raising rates, how much could go wrong.She is part of a group of tech-savvy business leaders who have emerged as Malaysia tries to evolve beyond its traditional dependence on selling commodities like palm oil and petroleum.Economic growth has been flagging, a reality playing out across Southeast Asia as the region adjusts to China\u2019s slowdown. China is not buying commodities like it used to.Even before the Fed\u2019s move, global investors were fleeing. Foreigners once owned more than half of Malaysia\u2019s local bonds, but have sold off 17 percent of their holdings since August. Their nervousness grew in November as Malaysia imposed controls on the movement of money.Malaysia\u2019s currency, the ringgit, has lost 8 percent against the dollar in the last year. For Malaysia\u2019s consumers \u2014 and for companies that serve them \u2014 imports are getting more expensive.Ms. Yusof sells hijabs and other clothing, catering to cosmopolitan Muslims with a taste for distinctive patterns. Some of her garments are made in China. When the dollar rises, her profit margins are squeezed. And though online sales are brisk, business at her three mall stores has begun to slow.\u201cWe used to do a lot better,\u201d she said.Southeast Asia\u2019s leading budget airline, AirAsia, based in Malaysia, is preparing for worse. Its biggest costs are in dollars \u2014 fuel and jet leases. Yet most revenue is in local currencies, meaning that the airline is taking in less just as it must spend more.AirAsia has increased its hedging \u2014 basically, insurance against whipsawing markets \u2014 to three-quarters of its dollar-based fuel costs, from about half. It hopes to raise $1 billion and reduce debt by selling an airline leasing business.AirAsia\u2019s founder and chief executive, Tony Fernandes, has been lobbying the Malaysian government to cut the fees it charges for airport slots. \u201cI\u2019m going around seeing varying cabinet ministers saying, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get your costs down,\u2019\u201d he said.Across Asia, in a trendy Istanbul neighborhood along the Bosporus, shopkeepers complain that their sales have been savaged by the plunge in the Turkish lira, which has lifted their prices for imported sporting goods, luggage and clothing.The chaos of a recent spate of terrorist attacks seems increasingly a memory, as college students have returned to the neighborhood of Kadikoy. But foot traffic is having little impact on the till.\u201cThere is no decline in number of customers,\u201d said Serdar Celik, who runs a luggage store that specializes in foreign brands. \u201cBut sales fell by 25 percent compared to last year. Prices rose by 20 percent for almost everything in the last month.\u201dIn Mexico, Francisca Hervis Reyes has no way to cut her own costs, beyond putting less food on the table.Born in southern Mexico, where her parents were farmers, she headed north nearly three decades ago, to the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, in a reach for upward mobility. The borderlands were buzzing with factories known as maquiladoras \u2014 plants that assemble components for American manufacturing operations. Soon, Nafta would fertilize more.Ms. Reyes, 47, began making upholstery for car seats. Her wages purchased fresh fruit and meat. She hired a nanny to look after her three daughters.These days, she makes auto parts that go into transmissions, earning 162 pesos per day, or about $8.40. Her husband earns 149 pesos per day \u2014 about $7.75 \u2014 making fuses for electrical boxes.But as the peso has surrendered roughly one-fourth of its value over the last five years, their living standard has deteriorated.Throughout Mexico, the weak peso has been lifting prices for everything from cars to cooking gas to tortillas. As of February, prices were rising at an annualized pace of nearly 5 percent, Mexico\u2019s highest rate of inflation in seven years.Mexico\u2019s central bank has been steadily lifting rates to protect its currency in the face of a possible trade war with the United States. With the Fed adding pressure, many analysts expect Mexico\u2019s central bank to deliver a fresh rate increase this month.Chicken, beef, milk and vegetables have all risen in price, with many of these items imported from the United States. Ms. Reyes\u2019s family subsists mainly on beans and pasta.She pointed toward a bodega across a patch of gravel from her house. \u201cEggs are twice the price they were six months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been buying less.\u201dShe used to send money back to her family in Veracruz, where one of her sisters is blind. Not anymore.Inside the concrete-block home she shares with her husband, their three daughters and three grandsons, the ceiling is stained from leaks. The walls are crumbling. Two windows are boarded up and held together by masking tape, having been damaged by a rock fight between two gangs.As the family prepared to share a lone queen-size bed, positioning their bodies sideways to maximize space, they had no heat to cut the 44-degree chill.\u201cWe use blankets,\u201d Ms. Reyes said, \u201cand what love we have.\u201dPeter S.

{"Headline": "Corporate Japan Is on Foreign Buying Spree. Toshiba Shows Pitfalls.", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Toshiba of Japan had big dreams for global expansion when it bought the American nuclear company Westinghouse 11 years ago. To make them come true, it seemed willing to pay almost any price.At $5.4 billion \u2014 double initial estimates \u2014 the amount Toshiba paid to take control of Westinghouse took many aback. Japanese companies were known for splurging on foreign deals, then coming to regret it. Toshiba was put on the defensive from the start.\u201cI want to make this an example of a successful foreign acquisition,\u201d said Toshiba\u2019s president, Atsutoshi Nishida, who was all too aware of corporate Japan\u2019s shaky deal record. He insisted Toshiba had paid the \u201ccorrect price.\u201dYet corporate Japan\u2019s buying binge has only intensified. Overseas acquisitions have doubled in value over the past three years, as declining business prospects at home propel previously inward-looking companies into foreign markets, where more famous names like Toyota and Honda have already made their mark.The problem? Too many Japanese deals are duds, specialists in mergers and acquisitions say.Some deals done years ago are now swamping Japanese companies with red ink. The failures point to a lack of accountability at the companies \u2014 and could portend more stumbles to come.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that they have no other choice, that the only way to grow is though foreign acquisitions,\u201d said Hideaki Miyajima, a professor in the commerce department of Waseda University in Tokyo. Desperate deal making, he said, is a natural response to problems in Japan\u2019s economy \u2014 but one that can all too easily backfire.\u201cWhen the president says \u2018We\u2019re buying,\u2019 subordinates see it as their job to get a deal done, no matter what,\u201d Professor Miyajima said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s too expensive, no one stops it.\u201dKnown for splurging on trophy assets in the 1980s, Japanese companies today are buying up foreign names for a different reason: Their country\u2019s population is shrinking and aging, and consumers are no longer spending the way they used to. Department store sales and supermarket sales have declined. Beer sales have fallen by nearly half since 2001.Desperate for new customers, Japanese businesses spent more than $100 billion on foreign takeovers in 2016, according to Dealogic, which tracks deal data. That was close to a record; measured in yen rather than dollars, it was the most ever.Executives hope the investments will generate faster growth and higher profits down the line. But inexperience, recklessness and weak oversight by corporate boards have led to past missteps.\u201cOften there\u2019s no one on the board who can oppose the president,\u201d said Nobuo Sayama, a former investment banker who has advised both Japanese acquirers and foreign targets. \u201cAs a result, companies pay absurd amounts of money, or they mismanage the acquisition afterward.\u201dToshiba is hardly alone.Kirin, the beer maker, bought a string of breweries overseas, including Brazil\u2019s second-largest brewer, Schincariol, for a total of $3.9 billion in 2011. Last month, it sold the business to Heineken for $700 million.The sale followed heavy write downs. \u201cIt was gut-wrenching, but we had to drain the wound,\u201d Kirin\u2019s chief executive, Yoshinori Isozaki, said in 2015 after booking a $1 billion loss on the investment. He added: \u201cOverseas strategy is very difficult.\u201dRakuten, Japan\u2019s biggest e-commerce site, wrote off most of its 2010 purchase of a French online retailer last year. Marubeni, a major Japanese trading house, wrote down its 2013 acquisition of the Gavilon Group, an American grain trader.Many takeovers fail. And it is difficult to say exactly how much Japanese companies overpay for their targets, since valuations can be subjective and information on smaller deals is not always disclosed.Still, Japanese buyers do seem unusually generous. According to Dealogic, from 2014 to 2016 they paid 40 percent more on average than their target companies were valued by stock markets. That compares with a 29 percent premium paid by American acquirers in comparable deals.Bain & Company, a merger advisory firm, found that Japanese buyers ended up writing down the value of an acquisition or selling it under financial pressure in around 40 percent of cases \u2014 an unusually high rate. Junya Ishikawa, a partner at Bain, said bosses often leapt at what they saw as \u201cgame-changing, once-in-a-lifetime deals\u201d and ended up in over their heads.And at sprawling conglomerates like Toshiba, whose chief executives rise through the ranks and serve for only a few years, bosses control mountains of cash and feel they must use it quickly to create a legacy.\u201cShareholders ask executives why they\u2019re holding on to so much cash, and they say they\u2019re thinking about M&A deals,\u201d said Mr. Sayama, now a professor at Hitotsubashi University. \u201cThen investment bankers come calling with proposals.\u201dOn Friday, Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, said Westinghouse needed to decide by the end of this month whether to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. Toshiba faces a March 27 deadline to publish its latest assessment of its finances, and what happens to Westinghouse will be crucial. If Toshiba misses the deadline, it could be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.Toshiba declined to comment on any deliberations, saying it was a matter for Westinghouse and American authorities, but it did say on Tuesday that it was \u201cactively considering\u201d a sale and other strategic options for the unit.In seeking to build nuclear power plants in the United States, Toshiba was working hand in hand with the Japanese government, which has been keen to develop new markets for Japanese infrastructure technology. Tokyo offers low-interest financing, in the form of loans and loan guarantees from the state-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation, to companies including Toshiba that take on such projects. Critics say government support can lead companies to ignore economic risks.The bank declined to comment on loans to specific companies.Toshiba sought to resolve its Westinghouse problem by buying an American construction company, Stone & Webster. The company is a contractor on two Westinghouse nuclear-power projects, in South Carolina and Georgia, that are years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.Satoshi Tsunakawa, Toshiba\u2019s president, said at a news conference last month that Toshiba had approved the acquisition in the hope that, by taking direct control of Stone & Webster, Westinghouse could reduce cost overruns. Instead, the takeover made things worse: Stone & Webster was facing billions of dollars in liabilities.Mr. Tsunakawa said Toshiba was investigating how Westinghouse and its advisers failed to spot the liabilities when deciding how much to offer Stone & Webster\u2019s owner, the engineering group Chicago Bridge & Iron Company.Mr. Tsunakawa did little to rebut another common criticism of Japanese acquirers \u2014 that they rely too much on outsiders\u2019 assessments of what businesses are worth, without doing hard-nosed examinations of their own.\u201cC.B.&I. gave us the documentation,\u201d he said, \u201cand we believed it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of Atsutoshi Nishida, an executive at Toshiba at the time it bought Westinghouse. He was president, not chairman.Advertisement"}

The cuts had a far harsher impact on poor and disadvantaged groups than the general population, according to Irish human rights groups.Mr. Muiznieks said that during his visit over three days in November, he saw evidence of the return of economic growth, but that many people had \u201cnot yet started to benefit from the recovery and were still experiencing longstanding difficulties and the negative impact of budgetary cuts.\u201dThe budget cuts affected Travelers in a \u201cgravely disproportionate manner,\u201d he said \u2014 as high as 86 percent in education, and 85 percent in housing.\u201cNo other section of the community has suffered such a high level of withdrawal of funding and human resources, compounded by the state to spend even the limited resources that it has made available,\u201d the report said.Irish society has mixed attitudes toward Travelers. Some associate the group with criminal activity and antisocial behavior. Their origins in Ireland date back at least 1,000 years, according to DNA evidence. While many retain a nomadic lifestyle, others \u2014 known as \u201csettled Travelers\u201d \u2014 have chosen to stay put.According to the 2011 census, only 1 percent of Irish Travelers complete higher education. A little over 84 percent were unemployed, a rate six times higher than for the general population. Life expectancy for Traveler men is 15.1 years lower than for other men; Traveler women live 11.5 years less than other women. In addition, the suicide rate for men in the group is 6.6 times higher than for non-Traveler men.The report by Mr. Muiznieks, a Latvian-American human rights activist and political scientist, touched on a range of subjects, highlighting the status of Irish women and children. He urged the Irish authorities to tackle \u201cpersistent gender inequalities,\u201d gender stereotypes and women\u2019s continuing disadvantages in employment, education and other fields. His report also called for better protections for women from domestic violence.Ireland currently has a near total ban on abortion that has been in the Constitution since 1983. Mr. Muiznieks said that \u201cdecriminalizing abortion within reasonable gestational limits is essential to women\u2019s equality.\u201dHe also noted that drastic budget cuts affecting child care had not been restored since the Irish economy recovered. Child poverty rates have increased since the 2008 downturn. According to the 2011 census, 9.3 percent of children were living in consistent poverty, with 22 percent reporting that they had gone to bed or to school hungry.Emily Logan, the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, said the report was a \u201cwelcome intervention.\u201dBernard Joyce, director of the Irish Traveler Movement, an advocacy organization in Dublin, said in a statement that although \u201cethnicity recognition was a welcome and progressive step,\u201d it \u201cdoesn\u2019t address all of the challenges faced by the community.\u201d He called for \u201ceconomic and budgetary redress.\u201dThe government said that it would give Mr. Muiznieks\u2019s recommendations \u201ccareful attention,\u201d and that they would serve as an important tool in its work to \u201censure the human rights of all citizens of and residents in Ireland.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Platform Companies Are Becoming More Powerful \u2014 but What Exactly Do They Want?", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyDuring a February ride in San Francisco, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was recorded arguing with and eventually berating an Uber driver from the back seat of his car. The driver, who had been working with the company since 2011, accused Kalanick of undercutting drivers of high-end cars like his, plunging him into bankruptcy. Kalanick responded with a lecture about the basic economic logic of his company: Soon, the supply of luxury cars on the app would be reduced, causing demand to increase. Besides, he went on, if the company hadn\u2019t added a lower-priced tier, it would have been beaten by competitors. This did not satisfy the driver, which seemed to enrage Kalanick, who erupted into a moralizing tirade. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own [expletive],\u201d he said, before leaving the car.Uber, like so many other successful tech companies in 2017, is a \u201cplatform business,\u201d one built around matchmaking between vendors and customers. If successful, a platform creates its own marketplace; if extremely successful, it ends up controlling something closer to an entire economy. This is intuitive in a case like eBay, which connects buyers and sellers. Airbnb, too, resembles an age-old form of commerce, connecting property owners with short-term lodgers. TaskRabbit and Fiverr connect contractors with people looking to hire them. Some of the largest platforms are less obviously transactional: Facebook and Google connect advertisers with users, users with one another, software developers with users. But while the transactions that happen on their platforms largely take a different form \u2014 taps, shares, ads served and scrolled past \u2014 the principles are essentially the same, as are the benefits. These businesses are asset- and employee-light, low on liability and high on upside. They aspire to monopoly, often unapologetically, and have been instrumental in rehabilitating the concept. (The logic is seductive and often self-evident: Facebook is more useful if everyone is on it, therefore everyone should be on Facebook.)Predictably, platforms have long been intoxicating to investors. They\u2019ve also been the subject of rapturous popular business writing. In their 2016 book \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms,\u201d the economists David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee cast the subject in revolutionary terms, calling for a \u201cnew economics\u201d to account for businesses that are \u201ctransforming economies\u201d around the world, \u201cmaking life easier and better for billions of people\u201d \u2014 the sort of broad and ideological claim previously reserved by economists for capitalism as a whole.Amid the cheerleading, a comprehensive criticism of the platform model has been slow to emerge. Nick Srnicek\u2019s \u201cPlatform Capitalism,\u201d published in December, tries to situate the rise of platforms in a broader history of capitalism and to project those lessons forward. Srnicek recasts a few features of platform businesses as potentially problematic. Among them is their tendency to metastasize from transaction enablers to, with sufficient success, participation gatekeepers. A food-delivery app like Seamless begins its life with promises of liberation, connecting customers with nearby restaurants, taking care of payments and eliminating phone calls. But in the cities where it has been most successful, its customer base becomes too big to ignore, even for restaurants that struggle to afford its steep commissions. In other industries, the stakes are much higher. An insurgent Airbnb feels as if it\u2019s enabling new types of transactions between previously unconnected people. A dominant Airbnb might come to resemble something between a superintendent and a landlord for millions, not to mention a force reshaping cities in its image.Platform companies have themselves hired economists to help conceptualize and manage the economies they\u2019ve created. Google, Airbnb, Uber and Amazon have aggressively recruited professors and researchers to help understand what, exactly, they have on their hands, and how to expand, regulate and exploit it. Within a rigidly structured platform like Uber, for which the company sets prices, the economic problems are somewhat akin to those of a command economy: How low can we push the cost of a ride before drivers stop participating? (Quite low, for now.) How do we deal with sudden increases in demand? (Surge pricing, controversially.) How might new drivers be both induced to join the platform and more deeply compelled to stay? (Through the introduction of vehicle-financing programs and short-term loan services.)Platforms are, in a sense, capitalism distilled to its essence. They are proudly experimental and maximally consequential, prone to creating externalities and especially disinclined to address or even acknowledge what happens beyond their rising walls. And accordingly, platforms are the underlying trend that ties together popular narratives about technology and the economy in general. Platforms provide the substructure for the \u201cgig economy\u201d and the \u201csharing economy\u201d; they\u2019re the economic engine of social media; they\u2019re the architecture of the \u201cattention economy\u201d and the inspiration for claims about the \u201cend of ownership.\u201dBut the tensions that platforms like Uber create with their customers, their workers and the world that surrounds them will soon become harder to ignore as these companies foment economic and social change, the consequences of which will increasingly be thrust into spectacular display. The Kalanick video was a P.R. nightmare not just for Uber but also for the platform economy in general, posing grand questions about the world it promises, or threatens, to create. The zeal for platforms, combined with the technology industry\u2019s internalization of their merits and inevitability, will push them into areas where the tensions they create become starker and the ideologies they carry become more apparent.Nowhere is that ideological dimension more clear than in the Kalanick video from February. Driver and founder sat inches apart, alienated from each other by the system over which one presides and within which the other toils: the founder explaining to the driver how the platform works and must work; the driver appealing to this person for better pay. It resembles nothing more than one man remarking on the rain while the other thinks, \u201cDon\u2019t you control the weather?\u201d Platforms seek total control even as they abdicate responsibility. In other words, they\u2019re perfect.For now, the tensions that platforms can breed have been obscured \u2014 or at least ignored \u2014 in large part because platformized labor has arrived first in sectors where employment was already widely precarious and contract-based, like taxi driving. As the model expands, these tensions may become more visible as workers with more political and social capital are subjected to them. The recent history of platforms, however, has been defined by the failure of all but a few smart or lucky people to imagine just how successful and powerful they can be.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Angela Merkel Save the West? Don\u2019t Count on It", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 The crisis of Western liberalism just seems to get deeper: first Brexit, then the election of Donald Trump. Last December, a far-right figure came within a whisker of entering the imperial palace in Vienna, and Italy\u2019s young technocratic prime minister resigned after losing a referendum on constitutional reform. Far-right parties now lead the polls in forthcoming elections in the Netherlands and France.Ms. Merkel\u2019s self-effacing, steady political style is certainly the polar opposite of Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic egotism, but for her advocates she stands for much more than just propriety and decorum. She represents an unwavering commitment to human rights and free trade and to a host of rules-based international institutions, like the European Union and NATO and the World Trade Organization.If the future of Western liberalism rests on Ms. Merkel\u2019s shoulders, then it really is in trouble. She has often spoken in support of European and Western unity, but her actions have done little to strengthen them. Moreover, it\u2019s not clear how deep her ideological commitment to liberalism really is \u2014 or, for that matter, whether she has any ideological commitments at all.To understand Ms. Merkel\u2019s ambivalent liberal legacy, we must start with economics. Under her leadership, Germany has steadily performed well \u2014 at the expense of other European countries. Within the zero-sum economy of the eurozone, Germany has enjoyed huge balance-of-payments surpluses, selling machine tools and cars to consumers around the Continent. France, Italy and other former exporters, meanwhile, have fallen behind.The eurozone works for Germany because it provides a mechanism for turning German economic might into a depoliticized, anonymous set of macroeconomic rules. This was why the Greek crisis of 2015 was so traumatic for Germany and why Ms. Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, were unforgiving in their treatment of Greece.The Greek government and, in particular, its finance minister at the time, Yanis Varoufakis, tried to transform the shadowy and technocratic meetings of the eurozone finance ministers into public arguments about the causes of the crisis. This changed Germany\u2019s de facto running of the currency union into something much more sinister, where what is good for Germany is not good for Europe as a whole.But even if Germany has succeeded at the expense of Europe\u2019s poorer countries, Ms. Merkel is no nationalist. Pragmatism and opportunism alone drive her decisions, and retaining power is her primary goal. This has been her approach to politics at home during her nearly 12 years in office: She has taken the sting out of German electoral politics by adopting key policies promoted by other parties. In the space of just weeks in 2011 she reversed her policy on nuclear energy, adopting the Green Party\u2019s longstanding pledge to eradicate Germany\u2019s reliance on nuclear power. She has done something similar on the national minimum wage, a key Social Democrat Party policy that she has made her own.When it comes to the international liberal order, this attitude means that collectively agreed-to rules don\u2019t count when weighed against German public opinion. Just look at Ms. Merkel\u2019s handling of the European refugee crisis. In August 2015, she declared that all Syrian refugees stuck in the Balkans and Southern Europe were welcome in Germany. A cause for celebration for supporters of more open borders, Ms. Merkel\u2019s decision was arguably a unilateral breach of European asylum law.As ever with the German chancellor, it is difficult to know her motives. Perhaps she was overcome by a desire to help desperate people. More likely, she was attempting to rehabilitate Germany\u2019s battered image. Her decision to open Germany\u2019s borders came only a few weeks after she had thrown her weight behind a new bailout agreement with Greece that imposed on the Greek people a pitiless schedule of debt repayments and led to an outpouring of anti-German sentiment in many parts of Europe.Whatever her motivations, her welcoming spirit didn\u2019t last long. In the course of 2016, faced with growing domestic opposition, Ms. Merkel shifted the focus to closing borders and deporting asylum seekers. As many as 70 percent of asylum seekers arrived in Germany without documentation, and Ms. Merkel\u2019s government has turned its attention to expelling those it feels have no right to stay.Will Ms. Merkel defend the Western liberal order against the onslaught of Donald Trump when she visits Washington this week? Of course she won\u2019t. She may not go as far as holding his hand \u2014 but she will strike a deal with Mr. Trump that is good for Germany and good for her electoral fortunes at home. That is what she has always done, and it would be absurd to expect her to do anything different.Advertisement"}

Taking a broad look at design and fashion, \u201cThe Jazz Age\u201d encapsulates the changes of the era in jewelry, tableware, furniture, posters and architectural fixtures.Many of the items directly reflect the excitement and novelty of the modern age, like Louis W. Rice\u2019s skyscraper tea service from 1928, with tall, rectangular pots in silver-plated brass. Radios in sleek Bakelite pay tribute to the new medium as a means of instantaneous communication reaching across the planet; one by Raymond Loewy from 1933, called \u201cNew World,\u201d is even shaped as a globe.\u201cThe Jazz Age\u201d also looks at developments in manufacturing, when major department stores were studying contemporary trends in European furniture and creating mass-market versions for the rising American middle classes. Those imitations could still be surprisingly avant-garde, like Lord & Taylor\u2019s version of a Jallot dressing table and bench, whose pinched angles make them look like something out of a German Expressionist film set.\u201cThe whole ethos of the 1920s is about innovation,\u201d said Sarah Coffin, the curator of product design and decorative arts at the Cooper Hewitt. \u201cPeople were using old methodologies and new ones concurrently, to create something new.\u201dJazz itself is a loose connecting thread throughout the exhibition. Ms. Coffin said that she chose the Jazz Age as a historical concept tying together trends in art and popular culture from the end of World War I into the 1930s. It was a time when European designers found a new market in the booming 1920s American economy, and black American celebrities like Josephine Baker were likewise finding a new freedom and adoration in Paris. Meanwhile, women were becoming increasingly liberated.The connection to jazz was more literal on the streets of Harlem, whose nightclubs were the chic attraction of the time and had a particular draw on young artists, including both white Americans and European transplants, each curious about African-American culture.The Harlem walking tour will pass by the sites of several historic music venues, like Smalls Paradise and the Alhambra Ballroom, where Bessie Smith and Jelly Roll Morton performed. Some of the most famous clubs of the time, however, have been lost in the churn of redevelopment; the Cotton Club and the Savoy Ballroom, for instance, were torn down to make way for a housing complex.Ryan Maloney, the director of education and programming at the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, said that the tour was intended not as an architectural study but as a way to delve into the history of Harlem culture, which had its impact on the design of the 1920s and continues today.\u201cIt is based around the idea of vibrations,\u201d Mr. Maloney said. \u201cThe musical vibrations, the cultural vibrations, the artistic vibrations that were set into motion here in this neighborhood. When we think about music, dance, fashion and the language we have today, so much of that can be traced directly back to Harlem during the era that this exhibit is highlighting.\u201dThose kinds of connections, between museums and across the city, are the kind of thing that Ms. Baumann said she wanted the Cooper Hewitt to embrace, with \u201cThe Jazz Age\u201d as an example.\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can,\u201d she said, \u201cto make this much more than just an exhibition.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Federal Cuts Loom, New York State Aims to Protect Itself From Washington", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 The agonies of budget season in Albany are all too evident: marathon negotiations and legislative sessions running all night; bills debated, batted around beyond recognition and often left for dead; and the hopes of millions of constituents raised and dashed in the course of an hour.Indeed, the only upside of the process is that \u2014 in recent years, at least \u2014 it ends by April 1, the beginning of the state\u2019s new fiscal year.But on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo again floated the ominous possibility that the Capitol\u2019s budget season might effectively stretch past Friday night\u2019s deadline, as the state girds for a round of cuts in federal funding, estimated by the governor to be at least $1.2 billion. That prospect has the governor suggesting that Albany lawmakers pass a so-called extender \u2014 for weeks or even months \u2014 that would effectively freeze spending at last year\u2019s level until Washington\u2019s proposed budget comes into sharper focus later this spring.The caution seems understandable; few are optimistic that the Trump administration or the Republican-controlled Congress will be eager to help New York, one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most dependable outposts.\u201cI was in Washington for eight years, I\u2019ve gone through this, I\u2019ve seen this movie,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat who was a cabinet member under President Bill Clinton. \u201cUltraconservatives try to cut federal spending, right? That\u2019s their mantra.\u201dLegislative leaders, however, seemed to think that the governor\u2019s hopefulness was premature.\u201cThere\u2019s no final deals on anything,\u201d said Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the Assembly, emerging from a meeting in the executive chambers in the Capitol.And while he seemed confident of a deal this week, John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who leads the Senate, said that there were still intense discussions to be had on issues like reform to the workers\u2019 compensation system, which his party has made a priority.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s suggestion that budget extenders might be necessary could be viewed as an attempt to gain negotiating leverage: Legislators do not get paid if the state passes an extender \u2014 only if they pass a budget.For even as Mr. Cuomo was raising the idea, he was also outlining a scenario that would avoid such a situation. \u201cIf we can get a financially reasonable budget that could handle cuts from the federal government, that would be my first option,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo said his main areas of concern were Medicaid and education. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s executive budget proposal included nearly $1 billion more in statewide school aid, a 4 percent increase. But both the Senate and Assembly budget plans were more generous, with the Assembly calling for $1.8 billion more in aid over current levels, and the Senate suggesting a $1.2 billion increase.\u201cThe governor is holding up Donald Trump as the bad guy here, but Andrew Cuomo is the one who is threatening to leave children in underfunded classrooms,\u201d Billy Easton, the executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, said on Tuesday, suggesting that low-income students could lose access to libraries and other services. \u201cIf he succeeds, our schoolchildren will be the ones who pay the price.\u201dRichard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, called Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan \u201cthe largest education budget in history, in a time of potential massive federal cuts.\u201dOthers seemed disappointed that Mr. Cuomo said that he did not want to raise taxes on the rich \u2014 something pushed by the Democrat-dominated Assembly \u2014 though the governor has advocated extending the so-called millionaire\u2019s tax to help pay for his agenda.\u201cI don\u2019t think any governor will be able to protect their state from Trump and the Republican Congress with a blanket no-taxes pledge,\u201d said Michael Kink, executive director of the Strong Economy for All Coalition, a union-backed group, adding that \u201cbillionaires and millionaires can afford to pay.\u201dWhat seemed clear was that there was still work ahead. Mr. Flanagan spoke to an Albany truism: Until everything is done, nothing is done, noting that seemingly disparate issues \u2014 housing, money for heroin addiction, water infrastructure \u2014 were all tied together in the budget proposal talks.\u201cNo one of these things is going to get done in isolation,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Beijing, Two Wheels Are Only a Smartphone Away", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byBeijing JournalBEIJING \u2014 Stepping off a stylish, compact, orange-and-silver bicycle on the sidewalk outside her Beijing office, Cao Dachui kicked down its metal stand and locked the back wheel. Her half mile ride from a nearby subway station cost just 14 cents, and she could leave the bike anywhere.\u201cIt\u2019s so very convenient,\u201d Ms. Cao, 27, said as buses and cars roared by, disgorging the stink of gasoline exhaust. Walking to the advertising agency would have taken twice as long. \u201cLife has really gotten easier,\u201d she said. Her friend Ma Zheng, 23, who was parking his own shared bike, nodded.Now, Beijing may be returning to its roots \u2014 with a modern twist. Thanks to about two dozen technology start-ups, brightly colored shared bikes have flooded Beijing since last year, dotting a normally drab cityscape with flashes of bumblebee yellow, kingfisher blue and tangerine.Beijing commuters have long endured packed buses and airport-style security checks at subways, so many Chinese like Ms. Cao are embracing the shared bikes for the flexibility and freedom they offer. Commuters pick up the bikes and then ride and drop them off anywhere they like, locking the back wheel, with no need to find a stand or retether them, in contrast to city bike programs in Paris or New York.Urban obstruction is nothing new here. Scooters whiz down sidewalks and cars often park randomly, even on crosswalks, giving daily life in Beijing the feeling of a hectic video game. But the bikes \u2014 strewn around the city like bright candies \u2014 have taken Beijing\u2019s chaos to another level, and drivers are particularly upset.\u201cIn the last few months, the bikes have been going crazy. They\u2019re like monsters occupying the city,\u201d said Huang Linwei, 29, a designer who drives to work in Beijing every day from Tongzhou, an eastern suburb. \u201cMore than once I\u2019ve found it difficult to park my car because the bikes are parked all over the place!\u201dOthers fear for their livelihood. Xu Jianmin, 56, an electric rickshaw driver, said he had made less money transporting commuters since the tens of thousands of bikes began appearing this winter.\u201cI know our business is kind of a gray zone, that we are not registered with the government, and of course nobody cares if we\u2019re affected,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cBut I have to make money.\u201d\u201cI probably would like the bikes, too, if I had another job,\u201d he added.Angela Cai, a spokeswoman for Ofo, a market leader in bike-sharing in cities across China, said the company was working to address the dumping of bikes in public places. Workers wearing heavy blue coats can now be spotted on side roads in Beijing\u2019s Chaoyang district, picking up discarded Ofos.Riding the bikes requires only a few taps on a smartphone.Customers download one of the start-ups\u2019 apps, electronically transfer a deposit and then pay per ride by using a bike\u2019s individual code. Bikes that rely on mobile technology feel right at home in a place like Beijing, where even elderly people are often early adapters of technology.Some companies offer booking services and even GPS to enable riders to find the nearest pair of wheels. But it doesn\u2019t always work as well as it sounds \u2014 when I booked a bike recently, I wandered in circles for 10 minutes without finding it. I was at a high-rise mall, and it is possible the bike was parked on a different floor from those I was able to check.Costing as little as 7 cents a half-hour and designed to take people the last leg from public transport to their places of work or entertainment, the bikes have the potential to transform urban living and even shape people\u2019s decisions about where to live and work. Those are vital issues in this sprawl of about 20 million people, many of whom spend hours a day commuting.\u201cHaving a bike like this might allow me to choose, say, to live a bit further out, or take another job in a place that isn\u2019t as easy to get to,\u201d said Ms. Cao, the employee at the advertising agency.Analysts in China say there are three factors behind the sudden surge: a lot of cash looking for a home, a good idea and government support.But easy money is only part of the story, according to Wang Chenxi of Analysys, a Chinese data and analysis firm. \u201cBehind this is the push of capital, but shared bikes are a good product,\u201d Ms. Wang said in an interview via WeChat, a messaging app. \u201cCapital needs an outlet, and just at that moment, shared bikes came along.\u201dMs. Cai, the Ofo spokeswoman, said the company thought that as the city\u2019s population grew, and traffic jams got worse, \u201cshared bikes could solve the \u2018last mile\u2019 problem in an environmentally friendly way.\u201dAnother important reason for the speed and scale of the investment in the bike-sharing start-ups is government support, said Lin Chen, a professor at the China Europe International Business School, which is based in Shanghai. \u201cCapital only goes quickly to industries that the government supports,\u201d she said.Among frequent users of the bikes, they provoke a tangible sense of enthusiasm \u2014 even glee.One recent afternoon, Feng Yuqin, 70, used her smartphone to unlock a bike parked on a sidewalk near Ms. Cao\u2019s office. She said that she used to ride either her own pedal bike or her electric bike to the park to exercise, but that the bikes had been stolen a few times.\u201cWith these, there\u2019s no loss,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me really happy!\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Photograph Never Stands Alone", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byOn PhotographyDanny Lyon\u2019s photograph \u201cThe Cotton Pickers\u201d makes me tense. I love and hate it at the same time. The photograph is from the late 1960s, but its form is so iconic and its atmosphere so fabular that it could have been made a hundred years earlier. On a wide field, men are stooped over in agricultural labor. The field stretches a great distance back, ending in a line of trees that marks out the horizon. The men working the field are dressed all in white. They have long white sacks on their backs and white hats on their heads. It\u2019s hard to tell exactly how many of them there are, perhaps just under three dozen, but the four or five in front are distinct. These men in front, in addition to being dressed similarly, are stooped in unison. Their faces are very dark, devoid of detail. It cannot be said with certainty that they are black men (they could simply be caught in deep daytime shadow), but they very likely are.This photograph (\u201cThe Cotton Pickers, Ferguson Unit, Texas,\u201d to give it its full title) has an extraordinary sense of rhythm, a rhythm that makes it as visually arresting as Ren\u00e9 Burri\u2019s photograph of four men on a rooftop in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThe Cotton Pickers\u201d was taken on a prison farm. The long curve of each man\u2019s back is continuous with the line of the sack slung from his shoulder and set down behind him on the ground. This gives each man a strange profile, as though he were some long-bodied, giant-tailed marsupial. The photograph has such high contrast that it looks more like an engraving or a painting. Set against the field\u2019s darkness, the cotton crop is floral in effect, or astral. Or, as the escaped slave Solomon Northup wrote in a surprising passage in his 1853 memoir, \u201cTwelve Years a Slave\u201d: \u201cThere are few sights more pleasant to the eye, than a wide cotton field when it is in the bloom. It presents an appearance of purity, like an immaculate expanse of light, new-fallen snow.\u201dImages make us think of other images. Photographs remind us of other photographs, and perhaps only the earliest photographs had a chance to evade this fate. But soon after the invention of photography, the world was full of photographs, and newly made photographs could not avoid semantic contamination. Each photograph came to seem like a quotation from the great archive of photographs. Even the earliest photographs are themselves now burdened by this reality, because when we look at them, we do so in the knowledge of everything that came after. All images, regardless of the date of their creation, exist simultaneously and are pressed into service to help us make sense of other images. This suggests a possible approach to photography criticism: a river of interconnected images wordlessly but fluently commenting on one another.But words have their place, too, and what goes without saying often needs to be primed with speech. The images that associatively come to my mind when I look at \u201cThe Cotton Pickers\u201d are highly personal, but they remain opaque until I name them. The pattern of the cotton field in Lyon\u2019s photograph reminds me of something the great art critic John Berger once wrote: that when we look at a star-filled night sky, we are able to tell stories about it only by organizing the stars into constellations. A strong photograph like \u201cThe Cotton Pickers\u201d is like a star on a clear night. We can track it better when we locate it in relation to other stars.These men in Lyon\u2019s photograph with their outsize burdens immediately remind me of figures in one of Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado\u2019s photographs of the Serra Pelada gold mine in Brazil, the entire picture plane of which is an array of small sacks set on glistening backs. There is no individuality: The men are interchangeable parts in a terrifying theater of mass labor. And in the drawing of \u201cPrudence\u201d (1559) from Pieter Bruegel the Elder\u2019s series on the Seven Virtues, there is a detail of two figures side by side, almost identical to each other, their heads obscured by the two enormous sacks they prudently haul away for a future time of need. When I began to think about Lyon\u2019s image, the Salgado and Bruegel pictures, quietly at rest in my memory, glowed in response, as though summoned.\u201cThe Cotton Pickers, Ferguson Unit, Texas\u201d is one of a series of photographs that Lyon made in Texan prisons over a 14-month period from 1967 to 1968. Lyon already had behind him a fine body of work, done at the forefront of the civil rights movement, as the official photographer of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). He gained unfettered access to six prisons in Texas, including the Jim Ferguson unit in Midway, and emerged with a portfolio of images of the guards, the prisoners, their interactions and the prisons\u2019 conditions. This project became the basis of his 1971 book, \u201cConversations With the Dead.\u201d The book is full of excellent photographs, some of which work in much the same way as \u201cThe Cotton Pickers,\u201d like a photograph of the Ellis unit clearing a wood: white-capped, white-clad men distributed against a dark ground.But when I try to understand the mysterious visual effect of \u201cThe Cotton Pickers,\u201d I don\u2019t restrict my reading to those images that are obviously related to it. I am interested in how Lyon came by the image and in the images that might have influenced him, but I am also interested in how my mind receives it, without reference to Lyon\u2019s intentions. I think not only of Salgado and Bruegel but also of the sack-carrying migrants in Jacob Lawrence\u2019s painting \u201cFrom Every Southern Town Migrants Left by the Hundreds to Travel North,\u201d a panel in his Migration Series (1940\u201341). The poor sometimes have bags, but throughout history the very poorest have had to make do with sacks, or simply with a cloth gathered up at the edges. This bulging, precarious load is part of our collective memory of deprivation, connoting wearisome toil, hasty migration or both.Consider, for instance, an 1860s photograph by an unknown photographer of a winding line of black people standing in a field carrying loads on their heads. It is an image of suffering, no question. But is the suffering related to an exodus, with its uncertain future, or is it related to brutal servitude, with the grim certainty that the labor is unending? This photograph is sometimes titled \u201cSlaves Returning From the Cotton Fields in South Carolina,\u201d which suggests the latter; but the feeling of ambiguity remains. And I think of the way \u201cThe Cotton Pickers\u201d is bound to other rhythmically satisfying images from the history of photography: Paul Strand\u2019s silhouetted figures dwarfed by the great buildings of Wall Street, Dorothea Lange\u2019s bent-backed Mexican migrant picking tomatoes, Lee Friedlander\u2019s note-perfect scatter of musicians walking on a New Orleans street.\u201cThe Cotton Pickers\u201d is an activist picture. Lyon hoped that his prison series would change the way people thought about incarceration. Perhaps it did. But it certainly couldn\u2019t stem the huge increase in the number of imprisoned Americans between the late \u201960s and now, or the way that increase disproportionately affected black Americans. \u201cThe Cotton Pickers,\u201d considered by itself, is also a work of compressed history. Within a single frame, we witness forced labor, the plantation economy, cotton\u2019s allure, black subjection, government control and the facelessness of the impoverished. It reaches back to images from the 19th century and before, and it stretches forward to the crouched and hooded prisoners of Guant\u00e1namo Bay.I hate \u201cThe Cotton Pickers.\u201d It\u2019s unpleasant to be confronted with the abasement of these men in the form of a photograph. But I love the photograph for its compositional harmony, which is like the harmony of a chain gang\u2019s song, or like the paradoxical pleasure Northup took in the sight of a cotton field in bloom.Teju Cole is the magazine\u2019s photography critic and the author, most recently, of the essay collection \u201cKnown and Strange Things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here are 12 examples.In other cases, the Obama-era rules under attack have drawn objections even from some liberal groups that called them examples of overreach, like the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s protest of a system to block mentally ill people from buying guns.The regulatory retrenchment is unfolding on multiple fronts.New White House appointees at agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have also personally intervened in recent weeks to block, delay or start the process to nullify other rules, such as a requirement that corporations publish tallies comparing chief executive pay with average employee wages.Barack Obama, shortly after being elected president, pressed the E.P.A. to let the State of California set more stringent limits on auto emissions, a proposal that the Bush administration had rejected.It is a radical role reversal for state attorneys general \u2014 their Republican colleagues spent the last eight years suing the federal government to block the enactment of many Obama-era rules. Now the Democrats are planning to try to prevent many of these same rules from being revoked.\u201cDemolish the administrative state?

The Department of Agriculture has delayed a rule that would make it easier for chicken farmers to sue chicken processors. Business groups, including the National Federation of Independent Business, want to kill the rule.But small-scale chicken farmers are fighting back.Mike Weaver, a West Virginia farmer who said he had voted for Mr. Trump and was pleased with most of what he had seen so far, said he wished Mr. Trump would meet with farmers.Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Republicans Unveil Plan to Replace Health Law", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans unveiled on Monday their long-awaited plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, scrapping the mandate for most Americans to have health insurance in favor of a new system of tax credits to induce people to buy insurance on the open market.The bill sets the stage for a bitter debate over the possible dismantling of the most significant health care law in a half-century. In its place would be a health law that would be far more oriented to the free market and would make far-reaching changes to a vast part of the American economy.The House Republican bill would roll back the expansion of Medicaid that has provided coverage to more than 10 million people in 31 states, reducing federal payments for many new beneficiaries. It also would effectively scrap the unpopular requirement that people have insurance and eliminate tax penalties for those who go without. The requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to their full-time employees would also be eliminated.People who let their insurance coverage lapse, however, would face a significant penalty. Insurers could increase their premiums by 30 percent, and in that sense, Republicans would replace a penalty for not having insurance with a new penalty for allowing insurance to lapse.House Republican leaders said they would keep three popular provisions in the Affordable Care Act: the prohibition on denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, the ban on lifetime coverage caps and the rule allowing young people to remain on their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26.Republicans hope to undo other major parts of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, including income-based tax credits that help millions of Americans buy insurance, taxes on people with high incomes and the penalty for people who do not have health coverage.Medicaid recipients\u2019 open-ended entitlement to health care would be replaced by a per-person allotment to the states. And people with pre-existing medical conditions would face new uncertainties in a more deregulated insurance market.The bill would also cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood clinics through Medicaid and other government programs for one year.\u201cObamacare is a sinking ship, and the legislation introduced today will rescue people from the mistakes of the past,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader.Democrats denounced the effort as a cruel attempt to strip Americans of their health care.\u201cRepublicans will force tens of millions of families to pay more for worse coverage \u2014 and push millions of Americans off of health coverage entirely,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader.A comparison of the House Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare and the current law.Two House committees \u2014 Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce \u2014 plan to take up the legislation on Wednesday. House Republicans hope the committees will approve the measure this week, clearing the way for the full House to act on it before a spring break scheduled to begin on April 7. The outlook in the Senate is less clear. Democrats want to preserve the Affordable Care Act, and a handful of Republican senators expressed serious concerns about the House plan as it was being developed.Under the House Republican plan, the income-based tax credits provided under the Affordable Care Act would be replaced with credits that would rise with age as older people generally require more health care. In a late change, the plan reduces the tax credits for individuals with annual incomes over $75,000 and married couples with incomes over $150,000.Republicans did not offer any estimate of how much their plan would cost, or how many people would gain or lose insurance. The two House committees plan to vote on the legislation without having estimates of its cost from the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper on Capitol Hill.But they did get the support from President Trump that they badly need to win House passage.\u201cObamacare has proven to be a disaster with fewer options, inferior care and skyrocketing costs that are crushing small business and families across America,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer. \u201cToday marks an important step toward restoring health care choices and affordability back to the American people.\u201dOn Monday, four Republican senators \u2014 Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 signed a letter saying a House draft that they had reviewed did not adequately protect people in states like theirs that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.Three conservative Republicans in the Senate \u2014 Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 had already expressed reservations about the House\u2019s approach.Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, also offered a warning on Monday, joining with Mr. Paul to urge that Republican leaders pursue a \u201cclean repeal\u201d of the health care law.The move to strip Planned Parenthood of funding and the plan\u2019s provisions to reverse tax increases on the high-income taxpayers will also expose Republicans in more moderate districts to Democratic attacks.The bill would provide each state with a fixed allotment of federal money for each person on Medicaid, the federal-state program for more than 70 million low-income people. The federal government would pay different amounts for different categories of beneficiaries, including children, older Americans and people with disabilities.The bill would also repeal subsidies that the government provides under the Affordable Care Act to help low-income people pay deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for insurance purchased through the public marketplaces. Eliminating these subsidies would cause turmoil in insurance markets, insurers and consumer advocates say.However, the House Republicans would provide states with $100 billion over nine years, which states could use to help people pay for health care and insurance.The tax credits proposed by House Republicans would start at $2,000 a year for a person under 30 and would rise to a maximum of $4,000 for a person 60 or older. A family could receive up to $14,000 in credits.Even with those credits, Democrats say, many people would find insurance unaffordable. But Republicans would allow insurers to sell a leaner, less expensive package of benefits and would allow people to use the tax credits for insurance policies covering only catastrophic costs.While Republicans have argued over how to proceed, Mr. Trump has expressed only vague goals for how to repeal the Affordable Care Act and improve the nation\u2019s health care system. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers and their aides are waiting to see whether he uses his platform, Twitter account and all, to press reluctant Republicans to get behind the House plan.The new version of the House Republican bill makes several changes to earlier drafts of the legislation.It drops a proposal to require employees with high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance to pay income and payroll taxes on some of the value of that coverage. In addition, it would delay a provision of the Affordable Care Act that imposed an excise tax on high-cost insurance plans provided by employers to workers.Congress had already delayed this \u201cCadillac tax\u201d \u2014 despised by employers and labor unions alike \u2014 by two years, to 2020. The new legislation would suspend the tax from 2020 through 2024.House Republicans would offer tax credits to help people buy insurance if they did not have coverage available from an employer or a government program. Under earlier versions of the bill, the tax credits increased with a person\u2019s age, but would not have been tied to income. Backbench Republicans said the government should not be providing financial assistance to people with high incomes.Accordingly, under the new version of the bill, the tax credits would be reduced and eventually phased out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Bets on Sensitive U.S. Start-Ups, Worrying the Pentagon", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 When the United States Air Force wanted help making military robots more perceptive, it turned to a Boston-based artificial intelligence start-up called Neurala. But when Neurala needed money, it got little response from the American military.So Neurala turned to China, landing an undisclosed sum from an investment firm backed by a state-run Chinese company.Chinese firms have become significant investors in American start-ups working on cutting-edge technologies with potential military applications. The start-ups include companies that make rocket engines for spacecraft, sensors for autonomous navy ships, and printers that make flexible screens that could be used in fighter-plane cockpits. Many of the Chinese firms are owned by state-owned companies or have connections to Chinese leaders.The deals are ringing alarm bells in Washington. According to a new white paper commissioned by the Department of Defense, Beijing is encouraging Chinese companies with close government ties to invest in American start-ups specializing in critical technologies like artificial intelligence and robots to advance China\u2019s military capacity as well as its economy.The white paper, which was distributed to the senior levels of the Trump administration this week, concludes that United States government controls that are supposed to protect potentially critical technologies are falling short, according to three people knowledgeable about its contents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWhat drives a lot of the concern is that China is a military competitor,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who is familiar with the report. \u201cHow do you deal with a military competitor playing in your most innovative market?\u201dThe Chinese deals can pose a number of issues. Investors could push start-ups to strike partnerships or make licensing or hiring decisions that could expose intellectual property. They can also get an inside glimpse of how technology is being developed and could have access to a start-up\u2019s offices or computers.Trump administration officials and lawmakers are raising broad questions about China\u2019s economic relationship with the United States. While the report was commissioned before President Trump took office, some Republicans have called for tighter regulation of foreign takeovers by giving a broader mandate to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Known as Cfius, the committee reviews foreign takeovers of American companies, but critics say that its scope does not include smaller deals and that it has other weak spots.Ashton B. Carter, former secretary of defense under President Barack Obama, had tapped Mike A. Brown, the former chief executive of Symantec, the cybersecurity firm, to lead the inquiry into the Chinese investments, according to two of the people aware of the white paper\u2019s contents.A spokesman for the Department of Defense said it \u201cwill not discuss the details or components of draft internal working documents.\u201dNeither the high-tech start-ups nor their Chinese investors have been accused of wrongdoing, and experts said much of the activity could be innocent. Chinese investors have money and are looking for returns, while the Chinese government has pushed investment in ways to clean up China\u2019s skies, upgrade its industrial capacity and unclog its snarled highways. Proponents of the deals said American limits on technology exports would still apply to American start-ups with Chinese backers.Still, some start-ups \u2014 especially those making hardware rather than money-drawing mobile apps like Snapchat \u2014 said Chinese money was sometimes the only available funding. But even a company struggling for money can ultimately come up with a big breakthrough.Chinese investors have a bigger appetite for risk and a willingness to do deals fast, said Neurala\u2019s chief executive, Max Versace.To demonstrate his software\u2019s capabilities to the Air Force, Mr. Versace said, Neurala used its software on a ground drone from Best Buy to make it recognize and follow around the service\u2019s secretary, then Deborah Lee James, during a meeting.\u201cWe were told by the secretary of the Air Force, \u2018Your tech is awesome, we should put it everywhere,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNo one followed up.\u201dAmerican military officials have \u201cfigured out a very good way to give $10 billion to Raytheon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to give a start-up $1 million to develop a proof of concept? That\u2019s still very, very hard.\u201dMr. Versace of Neurala said the company took pains to ensure that the Chinese investor had no access to its source code or other important technological information.To address concerns that it was not tapping innovations from start-ups, the Pentagon in 2015 set up a group called Defense Innovation Unit Experimental to enable investments into promising new companies. While at first it struggled, in 2016 it helped carry off a barrage of deals. The unit also prepared the white paper.In May 2015, Haiyin Capital also invested an amount it did not disclose in XCOR Aerospace, a Mojave, Calif., commercial space-travel company that makes spacecraft and engines and has worked with NASA. XCOR did not respond to requests for comment.About the fund\u2019s investments, Mr. Wang said, \u201cWe strive to get a portion of research and development moved back to China so that we can avoid China being only a low-end manufacturer.\u201d Haiyin Capital did not respond to a request for comment.Quanergy did not respond to requests for comment. Its investors also include foreign automakers and South Korea\u2019s Samsung.Kateeva\u2019s chief executive, Alain Harrus, said that while investors in Silicon Valley had begun looking more at hardware companies, raising big rounds for capital-intensive technology can be tough. Kateeva ultimately raised money where its customers were, in China and South Korea. Mr. Harrus said he believed more should be done in America to figure out the best way to nurture and fund core next-generation technologies.Ken Wilcox, chairman emeritus of Silicon Valley Bank, said in the past six months he had been approached by three different Chinese state-owned enterprises about being their agent in Northern California to buy technology, though he declined.\u201cIn all three cases they said they had a mandate from Beijing, and they had no idea what they wanted to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just any and all tech.\u201dAn article on March 23 about Chinese firms\u2019 investments in United States companies specializing in technology with potential military applications referred incorrectly to entities that invested $9.9 billion in Silicon Valley tech start-ups in 2015. Chinese companies participated in funding rounds worth that amount; Chinese investors did not make up the total $9.9 billion.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Travel Abroad, in Your Own Country", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported bySCOTTSBURG, Ind. \u2014 Sheriff Dan McClain knew little of the opioid epidemic in this depressed corner of southern Indiana when he took office in 2011, but he has since had a crash course in how easy it is to get pain prescriptions that lead to addiction, and how supposedly tamper-proof opiate medications are cooked down and shot up. Lives unravel. The jail he oversees just off the sleepy Main Square is a combination of \u201cmental health facility, rehab facility and straight-up incarceration.\u201dMcClain was a member of the Navy SEALs for 13 years; seeing friends killed in the Middle East, he was consoled by pride in his country. But now he sees an America adrift. Morals declined along with pain thresholds. Medications spread; stoicism sagged. \u201cWhat happened to self-respect and taking responsibility?\u201d he asks me. \u201cPeople used to be ashamed to get on welfare or social programs. Now they don\u2019t have to work, they get housing and groceries, and they\u2019re bored. With nothing to do they do drugs. At least that\u2019s my best swing at it.\u201dScott County is Trump country. For McClain that\u2019s because \u201che brought American pride to the surface again.\u201d The president won 67 percent of the vote here in November. A few weeks into his presidency, I found support at near fever pitch. Trump was shaking things up. He was putting moral standards back. He was the most honest president in a long time because he was doing what he said he would do. He has recruited billionaires to his cabinet who know how to create jobs. He was out to win big and to heck with measuring every word.\u201cI like Trump, he\u2019s a brilliant man,\u201d Bill Graham, the affable eight-term Republican mayor of Scottsburg, told me. \u201cIt might be better if he didn\u2019t open his mouth so quickly, but he\u2019s going to challenge a broken system. In the end it\u2019s about morals. We\u2019re not going to let somebody run God out of our country.\u201dI was a foreign correspondent for many years, work that involves the shedding of assumptions and absorption in place. To see what\u2019s over here, you have to let go of what\u2019s over there. Scott County, for coastal metropolitan Americans, is a foreign land. In a fissured nation, there are fewer and fewer moments of genuine encounter between rival tribes, each confined in its ideological canyon. So what could bring the country together, usher Brooklyn closer to Scottsburg?Perhaps the best bet is a vastly expanded, even mandatory, national service program that might at once throw Americans of every creed and culture together for a year or two at an impressionable age, fire up civic engagement and even revive the American dream.If Trump is serious about rekindling America\u2019s spirit, a G.I. Bill for civilian national service would go a lot further than the 10 percent increase in military spending he\u2019s seeking in his first budget. It would offer patriotic substance instead of perilous nuclear braggadocio. If \u201cWhere did you do your service year?\u201d replaced \u201cWhere did you go to college?\u201d as a reflex question, the United States might begin to heal.About a million Americans have passed through AmeriCorps since its establishment a little over two decades ago, and some 80,000 are serving at any one time. They do things like provide disaster relief, teach coal miners coding, help veterans write r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, educate young people about the opioid epidemic and generally patch holes in America\u2019s fraying social fabric.In doing so, they get to solve problems with people very different from themselves. Liza Dyer, now 31, described her time in AmeriCorps a few years ago in Washington state. \u201cPeople were coming in with very different belief systems and my job wasn\u2019t to just talk at them, but to really listen to what they were coming in with and build on that without judging them,\u201d she said.In return they get a living allowance and, currently, around $5,800 to pay for higher education. They also get a leg up at more than 450 companies that have agreed to prioritize hiring national service alumni.Demand exceeds funding. Appropriations for the Corporation for National and Community Service, the federal body that oversees programs, have stalled; its annual budget of $1 billion (supplemented by grants from the private sector) represents a tiny fraction of federal spending. \u201cA really scaled-up national service program is an idea that\u2019s perfect for where we are as a country,\u201d AnnMaura Connolly, the president of Voices for National Service, told me.But Trump seems to be moving in the opposite direction, despite traditionally strong Republican support for national service. AmeriCorps is on a draft White House budget office list of programs the president might eliminate to get to \u201csmall government.\u201d And Trump has not yet appointed anyone to head the Corporation for National and Community Service.Boasts of restored national greatness and $54 billion of additional military might will not help Scott County. Nor will the Dow at 21,000. It\u2019s another corner of America where most low-skill manufacturing jobs have vanished.Last year, I traveled to Hazard, a hard-hit coal town in Kentucky, and found many of the same issues (as well as the same fervid Trump support). It turns out that this area of Indiana is sometimes called Little Hazard because so many destitute Appalachian families came here decades ago to work in factories. Why here? Because it\u2019s where a single tank of gas would get you.Those jobs are now gone, along with good unions and retirement benefits. Precariousness has become a way of life. When an H.I.V. outbreak occurred in 2015 just up the road from Scottsburg in Austin, it was a sign of what poverty and desperation could spawn in a sleepy rural community. A big-city disease, as locals viewed it, was not meant to erupt in a Hoosier backwater, population 4,200.Brittany Combs, a public health nurse whose grandfather came from Hazard, told me addicts had been using ditch or toilet water for needles sharpened with nail files and shared by 15 people. Vice President Mike Pence, then governor of Indiana, agonized over how to respond. Possession of a needle without a prescription was illegal, but H.I.V. cases kept doubling. Should pragmatism outweigh principle? Pence turned to prayer before eventually authorizing the clean needle exchange that brought the epidemic under control. \u201cHe had to pray a lot to allow it,\u201d Jackie Crane, another public health nurse whose son overdosed on heroin last year and almost died, said.Alan Khazei, a social entrepreneur based in Boston, knows about such depressed American towns from his mother, whose relatives lived in Rust Belt Pennsylvania. He knows about the American dream through his father, who fled Iran in the 1950s and became a distinguished physician. He has an idea to revive both.The 1944 G.I. Bill provided cash payments for tuition and other benefits to more than two million returning veterans; it was paid back many times over through what these educated veterans subsequently brought to the American economy. Khazei would like to see a similar bill for today\u2019s youth. Put $5,000 into a savings account for every child born \u2014 about four million of them a year \u2014 for a cost of about $20 billion (or double that if it were $10,000). With compound interest over 18 years, that would grow into a significant sum that could be used toward payment for college. Then make the money available on condition of a year of national service.\u201cWe\u2019d be saying, if you serve your country between the ages of 18 and 28, we\u2019ll jump start you on your American dream,\u201d Khazei told me. He believes that with serious investment, even before such a program came to fruition, there could be a million Americans in civilian national service by the country\u2019s 250th anniversary in 2026.It\u2019s worth a try. The case for a cabinet-level position for national service is persuasive. American fracture is advancing by the day because Americans are no longer obliged to look one another in the eye and find solutions.So far, Trump\u2019s administration has only sharpened divisions. Steve Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, seems to see red rural states as the essence of the \u201cAmerican spirit\u201d and places like New York and Los Angeles as centers of internationalist dilution and defeatism. On the coasts, meanwhile, red state attraction to Trump is a source of fathomless mystery.Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, once used a bowl to illustrate the administration\u2019s strategy during a breakfast with an acquaintance of mine: The rim was all the pointy-headed peripheral coastal types; the meat was in the deep middle, the heartland, where Trump claims a special bond with \u201cthe people\u201d whose \u201cvoice\u201d he is. For all the sops to unity \u2014 \u201cWe all bleed the same blood\u201d \u2014 in Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, this is an administration ready to fan division if it sustains the fire of a mass movement wedded to its leader.The people of Scott County are mainly Trump supporters, but they are not waiting for his help. Plenty of volunteers are coming together to seek solutions to the region\u2019s problems. Lori Croasdell, who heads marketing for the Scott County Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to community revival, spoke to me of \u201ca culture of recovery.\u201d The H.I.V. crisis had been a wake-up call. Addiction is being destigmatized, help and education made more accessible. Croasdell spoke with a group of women all devoting their creative energies to breaking the cycle of poverty and drugs. One, Jamie Raichel, told me she used to work in schools on dropout prevention. Her employer never knew she\u2019d become addicted herself to prescription opiates. But she broke the habit; it will be seven years this month, she said, tears welling.That is the real \u2014 and unifying \u2014 American spirit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Discards to Build Art (and Rebuild a City)", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byMr. Gates has taken materials he salvaged from shuttered African-American businesses, schools and churches on the South Side of Chicago, where he is based, into a tower gallery in the museum\u2019s East Building. There, he has reconstituted slate shingles from a roof, wooden planks from a gym floor and bound copies of Ebony magazine into monumental structures that echo abstract canvases elsewhere in the institution, but are embedded with unsung stories of black laborers and entrepreneurs.This highly visible platform at the National Gallery of Art, which attracts more than five million visitors annually, shines a light on Mr. Gates\u2019s mushrooming grass-roots revitalization project on Chicago\u2019s South Side, which invests in people and places others have written off.Mr. Gates, a 43-year-old Chicago native, moved to South Dorchester Avenue in that neighborhood in 2006 after taking a job nearby at the University of Chicago (where he is now director of the Arts and Public Life Initiative). He had studied urban planning and ceramics at Iowa State University and earned a master\u2019s degree in fine arts and religious studies from the University of Cape Town, in South Africa.\u201cTheaster\u2019s bringing art into a neighborhood where there\u2019s not a lot of resources devoted to those sorts of questions, and he\u2019s bringing labor and craft traditions into the National Gallery,\u201d said Sarah Newman, the curator of the National Gallery exhibition. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of circular economy. He\u2019s got the whole art world interested in him, and he is pointing everyone\u2019s eyes at issues that he\u2019s concerned with.\u201dLast year the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington recruited him to join its board specifically to help build a stronger local community around the institution, according to its director, Melissa Chiu. There, he initiated a series of four performances, the first in September in collaboration with the musicians the Black Monks of Mississippi, which drew many residents from Washington. \u201cThere were visitors who had never been to the Hirshhorn before,\u201d Ms. Chiu said.\u201cTheaster has an incredible social intelligence that institutions can learn from,\u201d Ms. Chiu said, noting that museums tend to speak with a \u201cmonolithic voice.\u201d\u201cWhen you think of how Theaster operates both on a grass-roots level and in national institutions, each time it\u2019s very much him, but it\u2019s refracted in a different way,\u201d she added. \u201cHe can speak to people in ways they understand.\u201dThat has meant persuading Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago to sell him, for $1, a bank scheduled for demolition, with the stipulation that Mr. Gates come up with funds to renovate it. (Mr. Gates put $4.5 million into the Stony Island Arts Bank through a combination of fund-raising, loans, sales of artworks and his own resources, according to Rebuild\u2019s director of programs and development, Amy Schachman.) And that has meant persuading Samaria Rice, the mother of Tamir, the 12-year-old boy killed by the police in Cleveland, that the arts bank would be the right place to take the dismantled playground gazebo where the shooting took place. (The City of Cleveland had agreed to transfer the structure to the Tamir Rice Justice Foundation.) Later this year the arts bank will create a memorial incorporating parts of the gazebo.\u201cThe gazebo could never be rebuilt fully because Tamir will never come back,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection space where people can talk together about the challenges they\u2019ve had in their lives.\u201d\u201cWhat Theaster\u2019s done in Chicago is shift the center of gravity,\u201d Mr. Ligon said. \u201cHe\u2019s made it clear that art can operate in a variety of different spaces on the same level. In a bank that was abandoned for years, Theaster\u2019s project is about saying there\u2019s value in these things.\u201dAt the National Gallery, Mr. Gates has remade slate shingles from the demolished St. Laurence Church in Chicago into a roof measuring some 50 feet by 20 feet and turned on its side like a fortress. Freed of its function, and visible in a way a roof typically isn\u2019t, the beautifully constructed mosaic evokes the serial minimalism of an Ad Reinhardt painting and the language of abstraction. (Mr. Gates\u2019s father worked as a roofer.)\u201cCan craft rise to the level of art?\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cCan labor rise to the level of art? What gets canonized? It\u2019s something Theaster\u2019s dealing with head-on in the context of the National Gallery and what we value as a culture.\u201dMr. Gates has also reassembled a gym floor removed from a school \u2014 one of the many that have been closed in his neighborhood and in other predominantly African-American communities around the country \u2014 into a 20-foot-by-10-foot wall piece titled \u201cA Game of My Own.\u201d Its basketball court lines are jumbled and now read as abstract bits of color, suggestive of a Mondrian painting.\u201cIt\u2019s these schools, these gymnasiums, these coaches that teach the rules and instill a set of values,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about violence without talking about the fact that we close schools.\u201dMr. Gates said he hoped this work could operate as both an interesting art object and as a catalyst to help the restoration of schools. \u201cI need to live as the artist and the contractor, the dreamer and the builder,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to just be the dreamer in this moment, as much as I would love to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
