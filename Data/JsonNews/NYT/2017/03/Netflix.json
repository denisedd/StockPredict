{"Headline": "YouTube Unveils Subscription Television Service", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "Supported byBy popularizing video watching over the internet, YouTube, which Google bought in 2006, started the ball rolling on so-called cord-cutting, the practice of consumers\u2019 abandoning cable and satellite television subscriptions for web-based video services. YouTube\u2019s latest move, announced Tuesday, highlights how far it has come as well as the challenges in trying to replace cable and satellite TV.The company said it planned to introduce a new subscription service called YouTube TV in the next \u201cfew months,\u201d offering more than 40 channels including all four major networks, Disney Channel, FX and ESPN, for $35 a month. The subscription includes the ability to store an unlimited number of programs on a cloud-based digital video recorder for up to six accounts.\u201cYouTube TV represents an effort to evolve television,\u201d said Susan Wojcicki, YouTube\u2019s chief executive.But YouTube is now wading into the complex web of broadcast television, which has tripped up other technology companies seeking to break the grip of pay TV providers.It\u2019s an arduous and tedious process that demands securing deals with media conglomerates hoping to bundle its popular channels with less attractive offerings. It also requires ironing out agreements with the big four networks \u2014 NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox \u2014 and local affiliates that carry that network programming.It appears that YouTube is grappling with both of those issues. It did not announce a specific start date, and the company said it would roll out the service first in markets where it had secured rights from local affiliates. It also did not identify those markets. And YouTube TV is missing some popular channels, like Time Warner\u2019s HBO, CNN, TBS and TNT; Viacom\u2019s Comedy Central and MTV; and Scripps Networks Interactive\u2019s HGTV and Food Network.YouTube\u2019s incomplete lineup demonstrates how difficult it is to offer consumers what they want in a TV service while undercutting the prices offered by cable and satellite companies, said Jan Dawson, who runs the technology research firm Jackdaw.\u201cIt highlights how resistant to disruption the TV broadcast industry is,\u201d he said.One appeal of so-called over-the-top services is that they theoretically offer consumers choice in selecting the channels they watch at a more affordable price than the traditional bundles offered by pay TV services.However, the ability to cherry-pick channels is limited and the cost of an internet TV service adds up quickly. Most internet TV services offer a basic package of channels and then require consumers to pay extra for tiers of additional channels \u2014 similar in practice to pay TV offerings. In addition, there is the additional cost of paying for an internet connection \u2014 something that cable and satellite TV companies bundle with the cost of television.The huge audience flocking to YouTube, acquired by Google for $1.65 billion, makes the service one of the most valuable properties of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. While Alphabet does not disclose YouTube\u2019s revenue or earnings, the potential to turn that audience into dollars through advertising or subscriptions represents a major opportunity.The research firm eMarketer estimated that YouTube generated $5.6 billion in advertising revenue for Google last year and projected 20 percent growth in 2017.YouTube has also started offering an advertising-free subscription version, YouTube Red, that also includes access to the company\u2019s original programming \u2014 mainly programs and movies from the service\u2019s internet-famous stars.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Experimentalist on Broadway", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "FeatureThrough his stripped-down, radically humane approach to theater, Sam Gold has found a new dimension to a classic American play.Supported byFor anyone familiar with Tennessee Williams\u2019s masterpiece \u2014 the story of a young man who abandons his mother and sister to pursue a life of artistic freedom \u2014 these choices will be surprising. Williams was a controlling aesthete, and in his stage directions, he specifies that the set consist of a threadbare living room on the ground floor of a grim St. Louis tenement around 1938. But what we saw next was an even more profound revision.The house lights stayed on as the play\u2019s four performers appeared, emerging from a door at audience level and lining up before a staircase that led to the stage. First, the character of Tom Wingfield (Joe Mantello), whom Williams based on himself, mounted the stairs and delivered the play\u2019s famous opening monologue directly to the audience. He explained that the play is not a traditional play but a \u201cmemory\u201d and that he will be both the narrator and a character in it. He then introduced the other characters, who one by one climbed the stairs to join him onstage: His mother, Amanda Wingfield (Sally Field), a gloriously needy woman; his sister Laura (Madison Ferris, making her Broadway debut), an eccentric 23-year-old who is written as having a limp; and Jim (Finn Wittrock), the \u201cgentleman caller,\u201d an \u201cemissary from a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from.\u201dWhen it was her turn, Laura approached the staircase in a wheelchair. She folded her body in half and placed her hands on the ground, putting most of her weight on them. She hoisted her butt high in the air and shuffled backward on her hands and feet over to the first step to sit down. Amanda collapsed the wheelchair and, lifting it with visible effort, carried it up the steps. Then she came back down to help Laura.This feeling of unsettling intimacy was familiar from every Sam Gold production I\u2019ve seen \u2014 from his downtown tragicomedy \u201cThe Flick,\u201d to his Tony-winning Broadway musical \u201cFun Home,\u201d to his wrenching \u201cOthello,\u201d which played this winter at the New York Theater Workshop. At 38, Gold is one of the most celebrated theater directors in New York, a master at gently stripping both audience and actors of their expectations and creating a sense of collective interdependence. He does this by dispensing with theatrical conventions \u2014 showy sets and costumes, a clear separation between stage and audience, acting that titillates or entertains \u2014 so that the focus stays fixed on the bodies of the actors and their words. \u201cI\u2019m not very interested in pretend,\u201d Gold told me. \u201cI\u2019m interested in putting people onstage. I want people. And I want a world that reflects the real world.\u201d His pared-down worlds are, paradoxically, inviting: They corral everyone in the theater toward maximum receptivity. Once you learn the rules and submit to them, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve been initiated into a family.A few days before the dress rehearsal, I joined Gold at the Belasco Theater. As we talked, stage technicians rushed around us, testing microphones and arranging props. Gold has worn the same uniform since he was 19: a dark shirt with slightly baggy black jeans, gray New Balance sneakers and owlish glasses that make his childlike face appear solemn. A tangle of curls sticks up from the top of his head, giving him a touch of appealing dishevelment. His walk is tentative, as if he is testing the floor beneath his feet, but when he speaks, he is lucid and assured.When Williams wrote \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d in the early 1940s, Gold explained, he was resisting the theatrical conventions of his time, what Williams called \u201cthe straight realistic play with its genuine Frigidaire and authentic ice cubes.\u201d So he wrote a story that was supposed to operate like a memory: shadowy, poetic, expressive. He created an autobiographical narrator who comments on the action, something that had rarely been done before. And he wrote honestly \u2014 though discreetly \u2014 about being gay.Gold asked himself what it would really mean to put a memory onstage. A memory is not a simulacrum of an event \u2014 it\u2019s a version of it that\u2019s colored by emotion, and it can present itself to us anywhere, anytime. \u201cTo me that means there can\u2019t be a set,\u201d he said. \u201cThere can\u2019t be fake walls, and there can\u2019t be a couch. The biggest thing was no couch.\u201d He staged the play this way in Amsterdam first, at the invitation of the director Ivo van Hove, but when he was thinking about bringing it to New York, he wanted to go further in his updating of Williams. \u201cIt was very emotional and vulnerable for him to say: This is my life. I\u2019m haunted by my sister and my mother,\u201d Gold said. \u201cHe was putting himself out in this raw, vulnerable way. Letting his faults be there, letting his homosexuality into the play at a time that that was dangerous.\u201dGay characters on Broadway are now a norm, but there had never been an actor in a wheelchair cast in a leading role. Gold decided that to be faithful to Williams\u2019s revolutionary spirit, he would put onstage a person the audience is unused to seeing there. He and Scott Rudin, the show\u2019s producer, began a search throughout the United States and England for actresses with disabilities. They chose Ferris, who at 25 had a range of performing experiences but had never appeared in a professional production.When Ferris mounts the stairs, she moves as she would in real life. This is the beginning of Gold\u2019s transformation of Laura \u2014 a character usually played as pathologically fragile \u2014 from symbol into human being. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to act like she\u2019s vulnerable, because the vulnerability is in the prop \u2014 there\u2019s a wheelchair that gets to do that vulnerability for her,\u201d Gold told me. \u201cShe gets to have agency, and she gets to be the kind of woman I\u2019d rather see onstage.\u201d Gold hoped that by watching her climb the stairs, we would be roused to an immediate understanding of the family whose lives we were about to enter: The difficulty of their situation is palpably real. The stakes are urgent. Sitting in silence, with the lights up, we were also being invited to see our bodies in Laura\u2019s. All bodies have limitations and failures. All bodies are, at one time or another, dependent on someone else\u2019s for help.His hit musical \u201cFun Home\u201d \u2014 which won five Tonys and is now on a national tour \u2014 may have come closest to this ideal. For that play, based on Alison Bechdel\u2019s autobiographical graphic novel about gay life, suicide, family dysfunction and unarticulated love, he wanted to show the audience three different time frames at once: Alison at 10, Alison at 19 and Alison at 43. To accomplish this, Gold staged the play in the round, something that is almost never done with musicals because the format can make it hard to hear the singing in every seat. But Gold insisted on it, because it allows for simultaneity, so that the stage imitates the page of a graphic novel. \u201cIt gave me this opportunity to have the older Alison involved in scenes she\u2019s not in, and watch them and participate in them,\u201d Gold said. \u201cAnd because of that, there\u2019s a kind of doubling of the intimacy and emotional intensity of the piece. You can keep turning it and looking at it from another angle.\u201d In a play about the closet, nothing was hidden: Audience members could gaze at one another as well as the performers. It\u2019s the only musical I can think of that has a young girl singing an anthem about the beauty of an older butch woman she saw in a restaurant, desire and pride playing across her face.\u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d is Gold\u2019s sixth Broadway show, another experiment in making a large audience experience how small a theater can be. At a rehearsal for the play in early January, in a studio in the Flatiron district, Gold sat behind a table, clutching a mug with a picture of a kitten on it. His resting face is sphinxlike, but when he speaks with actors, he is teasing and open.They were rehearsing the final scene of the play, in which Laura has her first romantic encounter, with Jim, who has come over to her family\u2019s apartment for dinner. The meeting was engineered by Amanda out of the mixed motives that afflict most parents: a genuine desire to see her daughter settled, and a projection of her own fantasies onto her child. Gold had cast both characters against type, so as to complicate the balance of power between them. In most productions, Laura is a pale, tremulous being, and Jim is perfectly ordinary. But Ferris has thick blond hair, high cheek bones and the vivacity of a stereotypical ing\u00e9nue. Likewise, Wittrock looks like a teen heartthrob \u2014 confident and crisply handsome.That day, Gold was staging the beginning of their meeting, when Jim approaches Laura holding a lit candelabrum and wine and looks around for a place to sit.Jim: Where shall I set the candles?Laura: Oh \u2014 oh, anywhere. ...Jim: How about here on the floor? Any objections?Laura: No.Jim: I\u2019ll spread a newspaper under to catch the drippings. I like to sit on the floor. Mind if I do?Laura: Oh, no.Jim: Give me a pillow?Laura: What?Jim: A pillow!Laura: Oh. ... [she hands him one]Jim: How about you? Don\u2019t you like to sit on the floor?Laura: Oh \u2014 yes.Jim: Why don\u2019t you, then?Laura: I \u2014 will.In Gold\u2019s production, Jim\u2019s invitation to Laura to join him on the floor had become a minefield of potential humiliations. The only light onstage would be provided by the candelabrum, and the two would huddle over it, warmly illuminated, wet concrete glinting all around them. Getting them there, during this exchange, required a complex choreography. And to make the moment believable, Gold\u2019s direction would have to answer a number of questions. How could Jim ask this of a woman in a wheelchair? Is he being cruel? Or is he simply clueless \u2014 and is it precisely his cluelessness that is liberating for Laura, giving her the wherewithal to crawl to his side? Together with the actors, Gold set out to explore all the possible oscillations of feeling that they each might be experiencing.\u201cHow about you? Don\u2019t you like to sit on the floor?\u201dThe question hung in the air, as Ferris bent down, moved aside the bulky footrest at the bottom of her wheelchair and then supported herself with her hands so that her body became a triangle with her butt as the peak. She then swung the bottom half of her body downward, where she landed in a squat. Ferris repeated the movement again and again, trying different ways to maneuver her body toward Jim and the candelabrum: walking on hands and feet, crouching and sliding. None of it looked casual, and she would have to practice until it did. Gold wants every gesture and utterance in his plays to feel so inevitable that it\u2019s as if there was never any direction at all. This takes a lot of extremely detailed directing.When Jim asks Laura to come even closer, so he can see her better in the candlelight, Ferris tried a few moves, saying, \u201cI have to do this very embarrassing sort of walk-crawl in front of him, so it just adds to the uh \u2014 \u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s so embarrassing,\u201d Gold interjected. Ferris moaned lightly for a moment, then said, \u201cI don\u2019t like doing it in front of you guys!\u201d At this frank acknowledgment, the mood in the room shifted \u2014 a feeling akin to the dimming of the lights at a party \u2014 and the rehearsal continued.I asked Gold a few weeks later if he remembered this moment, and he answered wryly: \u201cActing is humiliation. I\u2019m always asking actors to do things that they\u2019re going to feel humiliated by. If they\u2019re not humiliated, I\u2019m not doing my job.\u201dIn the same way he does with an audience, Gold intentionally destabilizes actors as a way of bringing out raw feelings. Sally Field told me how demanding the opening of the play is. \u201cIt\u2019s arduous,\u201d she said. \u201cI may not make it one night. The chair could come flying down. My legs are completely black and blue from that chair banging into my legs.\u201d But the difficulty of carrying that wheelchair up the stairs helped her understand something new about Amanda\u2019s character. \u201cThe predicament that life has handed her is so mind-boggling. She\u2019s so without choices of how to fix the predicament, because the ailment that her oldest child has is so real, is so true. It\u2019s so physical.\u201d There is an \u201cunadorned humanness\u201d to Gold\u2019s vision.Annie Baker, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright with whom Gold has collaborated for nearly a decade, told me about an argument they had when they were making \u201cThe Aliens,\u201d a play about three stunted young men, which takes place on the back patio of a coffee shop in Vermont. Gold and the set designer Andrew Lieberman felt that the set should be only four feet deep \u2014 \u201cwhich is nothing, basically.\u201d The idea of such a shallow stage worried Baker. They eventually compromised and ended up with a set that was six feet deep. \u201cI just remember it changed in this incredible way,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIt\u2019s just these guys up against a blue wall for the entire play.\u201d The actors could hardly gesticulate, much less move across the stage for dramatic effect. The picture the audience saw was so still, it was almost like a photograph. Gold is always asking himself, Can the audience read the minds of the actors? By taking everything away, he was trying to leave only what he calls \u201cpure thought\u201d onstage, so that the audience would register even tiny flickers on the actors\u2019 faces as they experienced emotion.In \u201cThe Flick,\u201d a play about two popcorn sweepers and a projectionist at a small-town movie theater, Gold limited the actors by asking them to repeat the same movements over and over again. The set consisted of rows of dirty red velour theater seats, and for three and a half hours, the actors walked up and down them with brooms and dustpans, unfolding their hopes and failures in the offhand way that can happen in the weird proximity of a workplace. Because the space was so confined, every gesture had to be precise, every word and pause teased out for maximum nuance. Matthew Maher, a 45-year-old actor who has appeared in Gold\u2019s \u201cUncle Vanya,\u201d \u201cThe Flick\u201d and \u201cOthello,\u201d explained that every sequence in \u201cThe Flick,\u201d down to the eye rolls, was tightly choreographed, and yet he said he has never been in a show that felt more improvisational: \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a demonstration of some weird physics rule that chaos can exist in the tiniest space.\u201d The whole performance was a high-wire act. \u201cHe puts actors in a position where the only way they can make the thing work is for you to give the performance of your career,\u201d Maher said. \u201cHe thinks you\u2019re a genius.\u201dWhen Gold was 15, the family moved to Manhattan. He went to Dalton, the Upper East Side prep school, where he began to act and direct and found the artistic community he had always wished for. He instantly identified with what he calls \u201ca New Yorker\u2019s psychology,\u201d feeling relaxed in a dense crowd. The atmosphere of a subway car, where one person might be in mourning while another was late for an appointment, became a model for him of the kind of democratic place a theater could be.In college at Cornell, Gold took a course with a film professor who was also a Jungian psychoanalyst. The small group of students met in a tiny room to watch Tarkovsky, Bergman and Bresson on 16-millimeter film. For Gold, sitting there, in that \u201cmelancholic and vulnerable little space,\u201d was an otherworldly experience. Each meeting, after the movie ended and before the class discussion began, there was a short break. Gold would go across the street to a deli for a snack, and every time he felt as if he were about to get hit by a car. \u201cI was living in this kind of emotional mental space for so long,\u201d he said, \u201cthat it was really hard to reintegrate long enough to get a bagel.\u201d When the students returned, they would discuss the film, but he was still lost in the world of the movie. He wanted to be the creator of that experience, to bring people together in a small room and send them to an unfamiliar place that they would have to find their way back from.At first, he became an actor, and he moved back to New York to try to make it. It took him a year to realize that he was a terrible at it, simply unable to live in the present tense. What appealed to him, he realized, was the community that coheres around a play \u2014 how \u201cthe play becomes this little story that everybody can invest in together.\u201dIn 2003, Gold was accepted at Juilliard for directing. He had a small, close-knit ensemble at his disposal: the third- and fourth-year acting students, who had been living, playing and \u201cwriggling on the floor\u201d together for two years. While at school, he also served as an assistant director to Elizabeth LeCompte at the Wooster Group, the legendary company at the vanguard of the downtown theater scene. The two places were in productive conflict. At Juilliard, he found a group of openhearted young people who were being groomed for traditional success; the Wooster Group was wild and visionary, a company held together by the enigmatic charisma of LeCompte.The Wooster Group, whose core members have now been together for 42 years, rehearses every weekday for six hours or more in the Performing Garage in SoHo. Work on projects often goes on for years before an audience sees them, and after a play opens, the actors continue rehearsing it. From LeCompte, Gold learned that directing is a process of creation in layers, like painting, and that the most spellbinding performances emerge from intimate knowledge of the actors: drawing from their personal histories and designing productions around their specific bodies. It was a process Gold compared to biological evolution. \u201cI found that the rhythm in the ritual of coming in every day, the boredom, the space meant that something more weird and interesting and unexpected would enter the room.\u201dLike LeCompte, Gold resists what he calls \u201crepresentational reality\u201d: a detailed mirage of recognizable life that the audience can passively witness. Gold, along with a small group of set designers he works with again and again, makes the space of the theater feel unfamiliar in order to prod the audience into alertness. This can mean dispensing with a stage altogether and having an entire play take place in front of the proscenium, right on top of the audience, as he did in \u201cLook Back in Anger,\u201d or creating a sealed ecosystem for the performers and spectators to share, as he did when he staged \u201cFun Home\u201d in the round and \u201cOthello\u201d in a one-room plywood army barracks that the audience sat in too.For \u201cOthello,\u201d Gold and Lieberman realized a fantasy that they always had: to do away entirely with theatrical lights. Instead, the actors used military-style lamps to light the space themselves. The first scene of the show takes place in complete darkness, with the actors lying down on mattresses on the floor and the audience surrounding them on three sides. Gold wanted to \u201clet the audience breathe, let them hear each other breathe and let the Shakespeare and the poetry sort of come out of the darkness.\u201dGold brushed it off when I asked if he thinks the ancient civic ritual of theater attendance ought to be revived in our fragmented modern age. \u201cThe Greeks didn\u2019t have movies or Netflix or the printing press,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be that prescriptive or be that self-important about the role of theater.\u201d But Gold\u2019s mission is not unlike that of his predecessors: to engineer a place where we sit alongside other people as we encounter our most complex, hidden emotions.\u201cMost theater you see has a reassuring quality,\u201d Herzog explained to me in an email. \u201cSam is not someone who requires or even likes reassurance, so he also doesn\u2019t provide it in his work. This has the paradoxical effect of rendering the audience both more alert (I am not being closely chaperoned through this experience) and more trusting (I am not being manipulated/lied to).\u201d In recent years, Gold has wanted to take on only projects that feel important enough to draw him away from his children.In mid-January, I returned to the rehearsal studio to watch the progress of the gentleman-caller scene. Gold took his seat at the director\u2019s table, and Ferris and Wittrock began to run the sitting-on-the-floor sequence. After Laura decides to join Jim on the floor, the stage directions specify that she should place her pillow several feet away from him, prompting him to invite her to come closer.\u201cI can\u2019t hardly see you sitting way over there,\u201d Jim says to Laura. \u201cI can \u2014 see you,\u201d she replies. \u201cBut that\u2019s not fair, I\u2019m in the limelight,\u201d he says. Laura then edges toward him.For this moment to make sense, Ferris needed to first seat herself outside the halo of the candlelight, and then, at Jim\u2019s beckoning, move toward it. This required some more delicate maneuvering for Ferris, negotiating the balance between fragility and empowerment, pity and straightforwardness in the interaction between Jim and Laura. By the end of the play, Gold hoped that the audience would see Laura anew, as a person with a playful inner life. She goes to the zoo because she likes it there, not because she is lonely and limited. She collects glass because it appeals to her imagination. \u201cShe\u2019s a person,\u201d Ferris told me. \u201cShe\u2019s not just this fictitious idea.\u201d\u201cI want to try to ride the line between being courteous but not being overly sensitive,\u201d Gold instructed them from behind the director\u2019s table. \u201cWhen I pictured this moment in the story, I\u2019ve always told myself that Jim is not thinking about it. That he\u2019s like: Come sit on the floor! Let\u2019s sit on the floor! And that you\u2019re like, Yeah, I would like that. It\u2019s like, Great, I\u2019d love to sit on the floor with you! As opposed to just, I don\u2019t want to have to do that in front of you. But I don\u2019t know. Maybe that story isn\u2019t the right story.\u201dGold probed this idea with the actors for a few minutes \u2014 how to play it like a romantic scene: two beautiful young people in candlelight, trying things together.What I had watched, I realized later, was Gold substantially reinterpreting the lines of the play, complicating them so that a moment that could have been smooth and quick \u2014 passing a pillow, sitting on the floor \u2014 had become ridged with silence, surprise, subtext. He was performing a kind of freestyle literary criticism, turning a scene that\u2019s often played for pathos into a funny, sparky one about a woman with spunk and originality encountering an unremarkable man, manipulating him a little to get what she wants.They ran the sequence again. Jim\u2019s tone was even more guileless, and Laura\u2019s was bolder, but still questioning. You could hear the meaning of the scene deepen.As Gold watched them, his ordinarily deadpan expression became radiant. He looked like a kid hypnotized by a movie. He was seeing how much he could uncover.Sasha Weiss is a story editor for the magazine.

Do they have to worry something they own won\u2019t work with another they just bought?What products make no sense to you?My own rule, which I\u2019ll probably break eventually, is that if I need to be in front of the device to take advantage of its primary use, then I don\u2019t need it to be smart. A lot of kitchen gadgets fall under this category. There\u2019s not much to be gained from an internet-connected toaster or internet-connected coffee maker because I need to be in the room with it to grab the toast or coffee, anyway.What have you done in your own house?My house is a work in progress. I\u2019m always pulling out some device and adding another.At one point I had seven home security systems running. Most of my lights can be controlled through Amazon Alexa devices, either via smart switches or smart bulbs. When I go to bed I can shut off the downstairs lights, confirm that the thermostat has gone into night mode and lock the front door, all with my phone. My home theater system \u2014 yes, I put in one of those, too \u2014 is integrated through a universal remote and hub, which also controls the room\u2019s lights, and all that can be operated by voice through an Echo Dot. To watch a movie all I have to do is say \u201cAlexa, turn on Netflix,\u201d and the projector turns on, the system loads up Netflix and the lights automatically turn off. All of that is done with easy D.I.Y. products.Is there anything you can\u2019t live without?What\u2019s your next home project?I just ordered some motion sensors for my Hue lights so my lights will automatically turn on when someone walks in the room.

In any event, it appears that the situation for many consumers involves keeping cable and shuffling various streaming services.So in addition to all the other monthly bills, we are also, in this scenario, forced to keep up with individual fees for streaming services.

{"Headline": "In AMC\u2019s Western \u2018The Son,\u2019 the Novelist Philipp Meyer Lassoes TV", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byDRIFTWOOD, Tex. \u2014 On a blistering day last August, the novelist Philipp Meyer was at a cattle ranch in the grassy Hill Country of Central Texas, standing in a field that had been turned into a replica of a Comanche camp.Mr. Meyer watched as makeup artists applied fake blood and ash to the prosthetic limbs of a white buffalo hunter who had been captured and tortured by the Comanches.\u201cThis is great!\u201d he said. He studied the scene more closely, and then suggested making the charred ground around the actor\u2019s limbs bigger. After all, he noted, the fires would have been burning for hours.It\u2019s rare for novelists to wield this much influence over screen adaptations of their work. They may get an executive producer credit and an occasional ceremonial visit to the set, yet typically they just cash their checks and move on to their next novels. But Mr. Meyer is far from typical. Bald and muscular, with a square jaw and thick beard, he\u2019s handy with pistols, rifles and hunting bows, and looks more at home on a working cattle ranch than most M.F.A. graduates. He wrote three of the episodes in the first season, and rewrote the rest. And he was a near constant presence on the set throughout the five months of filming, weighing in on casting, props, costumes and the choreography of battle scenes.\u201cHe was heavily involved in everything,\u201d Mr. Brosnan, who spoke admiringly of Mr. Meyer\u2019s \u201cswagger,\u201d said. \u201cHe\u2019s a gung-ho weapons nut, with his own arsenal, and he was very specific in the choice of weapons I would use.\u201dMr. Meyer admits his obsession with historical details was \u201cprobably annoying\u201d to the other writers and producers. But his scrupulous oversight of even minute aspects of the production was always part of the bargain.\u201cHe\u2019s definitely put his fingerprints on the show,\u201d said Joel Stillerman, the president of original programming and development for AMC and SundanceTV. \u201cIt was clear that he was not comfortable just walking away, and he felt like he had something to contribute.\u201d\u201cNovelists, who are the most qualified people when it comes to the world of the books they\u2019ve written, are the first people to be benched in this process,\u201d said Mr. McGreevy, who was a writer and executive producer on the Netflix adaptation of his horror novel, \u201cHemlock Grove.\u201dTelevision has become an increasingly attractive medium for novelists (like Richard Price, Tom Perrotta and Nic Pizzolatto), who see it as an ideal form for teasing out long story arcs and subtle character development. But it\u2019s rare for them to have as much of a creative stake as Mr. Meyer does in \u201cThe Son,\u201d and he\u2019s feeling the pressure. Whether \u201cThe Son\u201d succeeds, critically and commercially, could determine whether El Jefe becomes a big player in the already heated competition for literary properties, which have become a staple of prestige television.\u201cThere\u2019s this sinking feeling of, \u2018Oh, this is years of my life,\u2019\u201d he said, using an expletive. \u201cIt almost feels like writing a first novel.\u201dSo when \u201cThe Son,\u201d which became a critically acclaimed best seller that sold 300,000 copies and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, caught the interest of several production companies, he agreed to Mr. McGreevy\u2019s pitch.\u201cI said, you can go with these heavy hitters who will back up dump trucks of money to your house but will likely marginalize you in the process, if the thing gets made at all,\u201d Mr. McGreevy said, \u201cor you can take the risk of us doing this together.\u201dMr. Meyer chose the riskier option. In the spring of 2013, he and Mr. McGreevy and Mr. Shipman wrote a 126-page script for \u201cThe Son\u201d and started shopping it to TV networks. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Entertainment Studios made on offer on the series but never followed through, and the fledgling studio later shut down.To make the multigenerational epic work dramatically, the source material underwent some major changes. In the show, one of the book\u2019s major characters, Jeanne Anne, is Eli\u2019s granddaughter, rather than his great-granddaughter, which compressed Mr. Meyer\u2019s sprawling novel into two parallel narratives, in 1849 and 1915. (The original story spans more than 160 years.)\u201cPhilipp understood that anything we did to his book didn\u2019t unwrite the book,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, the showrunner and executive producer for \u201cThe Son.\u201dStill, Mr. Meyer wasn\u2019t content to cede control. \u201cPhilipp has zero on-set experience, zero television experience, but his ideas are taken, they are valuable,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.Mr. Meyer takes a method-acting approach to writing. While researching the book, he went to extreme lengths to learn about Comanche customs and life in 19th-century Texas. At a ranch in Southwest Texas, he shot a buffalo and drank a mug full of its blood, so that he could accurately describe the taste when young Eli eats a raw buffalo liver. He studied animal tracking, fire building and plant identification at a wilderness-survival school, and learned enough Comanche to write dialogue.Mr. Meyer brought the same obsessive attention to detail to the show.\u201cIt\u2019s taken me weeks to memorize,\u201d said Zahn McClarnon, who plays Toshaway, a Comanche warrior who takes Eli under his wing. \u201cWe, as native actors, don\u2019t get any credit for that. It\u2019s like Tom Cruise learning Japanese.\u201dOccasionally, Mr. Meyer\u2019s commitment to historical accuracy created uncomfortable moments. Some of the Native American actors expressed concern that the Comanches were portrayed as savages who relished rape and torture. Mr. Meyer and the other writers made some changes to the script, like cutting the depiction of a rape.\u201cAs native people, we have been portrayed in a certain way throughout the history of television, with stereotypes,\u201d said Mr. McClarnon, who is of Lakota descent. \u201cThe producers were very open about changing things and listening to the cast and to the native advisers, and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201dStanding near the mangled body of the buffalo hunter on the set, Mr. Meyer said he was aiming to capture a bloody chapter in American history, from which no one emerged innocent. That day, they were filming some brutal scenes from an episode that takes place in the Comanche camp. The episode features Jacob Lofland as young Eli, who\u2019s been living with the tribe and feels torn over the fate of another captive, a white buffalo hunter who is being tortured to death.\u201cThey were pretty inventive with torture stuff,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cThe best political stance to take is honesty. White people did horrible things, Native Americans did horrible things.\u201dWorking on a TV show has taken a bit of a toll on his fiction writing. Mr. Meyer said he\u2019s been struggling to finish his next novel, which is overdue to his publisher.\u201cThe crazy thing is, now I have to make sure I have time to write novels,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Internet service providers have always been able to monitor network traffic, see what websites you visit and share some of that information with advertisers.Yes.The new F.C.C. rules would have given consumers stronger privacy protections \u2014 without such restrictions, internet providers may decide to become more aggressive with data collection and retention. Expect more targeted advertising to come your way.These companies provide your connection to the internet. Your gadgets are each assigned an identifier, called an IP address, and an internet provider can see which IP addresses are being used on your account.When you are browsing the web, the service provider helps route your device\u2019s internet traffic to each destination website. In other words, internet providers can see which devices you use and which websites you visit and choose to retain that data.Many privacy advocates say this a good time to consider investing in a virtual private network, or VPN. A VPN is a tunnel that shields your browsing information from your internet service provider and allows you to appear as if you are in a different location.However, a VPN isn\u2019t a foolproof solution. A VPN service is also tied to a service provider, meaning a VPN provider could also share your information with the service provider if it wanted to, said Runa Sandvik, a director of information security for The New York Times.In other words, you will have to pick a VPN provider that has a strong privacy policy and take a leap of faith.Tor essentially encrypts your browsing activity and bounces a website request to multiple servers, decrypting layers of information about the request with every server \u201chop,\u201d which makes it difficult to see from where and whom the original request came.Some services might break: for example, Netflix blocks VPN users from accessing its content. And Tor often makes web browsing sluggish.Ms. Sandvik recommended using a combination of the two whenever it feels necessary \u2014 like when you are accessing sensitive information related to your work, for instance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Miscue Calls Attention to Amazon\u2019s Dominance in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 There have been many opportunities to consider how crucial Amazon has become to the smooth operation of the internet over the past few years.Among the many consequences of the shutdown: Users of the business messaging service Slack couldn\u2019t upload files. Photos on the technology news site The Verge didn\u2019t display. Quora, a popular question-and-answer site, couldn\u2019t be reached.It was a rare fumble for Amazon in cloud computing, in which companies pay to run their online applications in data centers operated by big providers.Amazon\u2019s service interruption, though not nearly bad enough to spark a panic among customers, was viewed by some as a moment for reflection.\u201cIt really is a wake-up call to enterprises,\u201d said Craig McLuckie, a former Google technologist who is now chief executive of Heptio, a start-up that makes software tools for more easily moving applications between clouds. \u201cThey certainly need to understand to what level of dependency they have on a single provider.\u201dAmazon\u2019s error was still fresh in people\u2019s minds last week at the Google Cloud Next conference, a jamboree for the search giant to show off its seriousness in cloud computing. At the beginning of her keynote speech, Diane Greene, Google Cloud\u2019s chief executive, boasted about how reliable Google\u2019s cloud service was last year. Taking a jab at Amazon, she quipped that \u201cso far, 2017 looks promising, too.\u201dIt was part of a barrage unleashed by Google to persuade potential customers that they should piggyback on the $30 billion of infrastructure investment it had made over the years.\u201cWe\u2019re here for real; this is an incredibly serious mission,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cWe have the money, means and commitment to pull off a new platform of computation globally for everyone who needs it.\u201dBut even big customers Google showcased at its conference emphasized the importance of not relying exclusively on one company. Darryl West, global chief information officer of HSBC, said at the event that the bank used Google, Amazon and Microsoft for cloud services, noting that each company has its strengths.Paul Gaffney, Home Depot senior vice president of information technology, who also spoke at the Google event, said, \u201cAll of us have a role as consumers to drive competition so multi-cloud is a very important part of doing that.\u201dOne fear among businesses is that Amazon\u2019s dominance could lead to a new form of \u201clock-in,\u201d giving it huge leverage over customers because of the costs of switching providers. In the 1980s and 1990s, those costs helped Microsoft gain a seemingly unshakable grip on personal computing. Microsoft is betting that won\u2019t happen this time.\u201cThis won\u2019t be a winner-take-all scenario,\u201d said Judson Althoff, executive vice president of Microsoft\u2019s worldwide commercial business.Although they have become credible competitors to Amazon in the past few years \u2014 especially Microsoft \u2014 the newcomers to cloud computing have a long way to go. In the fourth quarter, Amazon accounted for 40 percent of the worldwide market for public cloud services, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft and 6 percent for Google, which was tied for third place with IBM, according to Synergy Research Group.Disruptions like the one in late February in what Amazon calls its simple storage service remain rare, especially in relation to comparable computing services operated privately by companies within their own walls. Even with the problem, which lasted for about four hours, the Amazon storage service was up and running more than 99.98 percent of the time in the United States and Europe over the last 90 days, according to CloudHarmony, a cloud measurement service owned by the technology research firm Gartner.Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, did not expect what transpired to cause a rush of companies to shift their cloud computing away from Amazon. She said it was highly unusual for companies to run the same application in more than one cloud because it introduced new complexities and costs.To avoid being knocked offline, companies can set up their applications to run in multiple regions, across the company\u2019s network of data centers. All of the big cloud providers offer volume discounts, the full benefits of which customers don\u2019t get to enjoy if they divide their use of cloud services among multiple providers.Still, there are some compelling reasons to use multiple providers, Ms. Leong said. Often companies rely mostly on Amazon for cloud service, while a specific development team inside the company familiar with Microsoft technologies will use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service.A few years ago, Hearst, the media company, was exclusively using Amazon for cloud computing, but later added services from Microsoft and Google, said Philip R. Wiser, Hearst\u2019s chief technology officer. He said some of the company\u2019s internal online services had been affected by Amazon\u2019s interruption, but nothing the public would have noticed.Because it\u2019s relatively early in the emergence of cloud computing, Mr. Wiser said he believed it was important to spread one\u2019s bets around.\u201cBeing multi-cloud as a company and having the skill and understanding of how to move between investments \u2014 that is an asset,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have that as a stated mission for all of our infrastructure team.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed to this story from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

If you pick a good stand-in, I\u2019ll bring you back a cool souvenir.This seems like a good idea; lots of people don\u2019t want to pay hundreds of dollars for cable but probably can\u2019t get all their entertainment from Netflix and Amazon. But I do wonder if that\u2019s a TV company pipe dream. Maybe cord cutters will switch entirely and never miss TV. Personally, I pay for cable and almost never watch it. It\u2019s like burning money every month.In all, it has not been a great week for Uber. But I have been saying that a lot lately.This reminds me of the time Zenefits, the high-flying human resources start-up, was found to have installed software to let its workers cheat on a licensing course. You know what happened at Zenefits after that? The C.E.O. had to resign, there were hundreds of layoffs, regulators began long-term investigations and imposed millions in fines, the company\u2019s valuation plummeted, and its long-term prospects are still in question.Or, hey, I just thought of another comparison. It\u2019s like when Volkswagen created software to pretend its cars had low emissions in testing, but they didn\u2019t actually.In other words: This is bad.So I\u2019m kind of a Snap bear \u2014 and no, that\u2019s not some sort of terrifying euphemism. I believe their marquee product, Snapchat, has some significant challenges in regard to growth, and their thesis of being a camera company is far from borne out. (I will admit, however, that I am waiting for my pair of Snap Spectacles to arrive in the mail.)How does that add up to a successful company?But since you\u2019ve cast yourself as the Snap bear, let me pretend to be the Snap bull. I think it could be a mistake to compare it to Twitter for a simple reason: Snap is visual and Twitter is not. Snap, I think, is thus a more faithful replacement of the world\u2019s most popular pastime: watching TV. The big opportunity for all consumer internet companies is the money that will flow from TV ads to digital ads, and I think Snap has a pretty good shot at capturing a huge slice of that market.I also wouldn\u2019t compare it to GoPro. Yes, Snap says it\u2019s a camera company, but we\u2019re taking it too literally. It\u2019s a camera company whose main innovation is camera software, not hardware. In this way it is a bit like Apple: Apple\u2019s physical phone hardware is in many cases on par with that of competitors, but the reason that Apple makes essentially all the profit in the smartphone business is that its software keeps people glued to iPhones. Snap, too, is investing in software that hooks you in, and its hardware will be secondary to that. This is very different from GoPro, whose software is at best forgettable \u2014 leaving it open to competition from low-end manufacturers.Anyway, have you decided what car service you\u2019re using to get to the airport?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Now Netflix Is All Thumbs", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNetflix, as you may have heard, is killing off its stars. At a recent news conference at its headquarters in Los Gatos, Calif., the company announced it was shedding its former one-to-five-star rating system in favor of binary digits: namely, thumbs up or thumbs down.\u201cNow it\u2019s easier to tell us what you like,\u201d the site promises.The writing had been on the wall. When I visited the company in 2012, full of questions about how it turned my methodical rating behavior into recommendations about what to watch next, Netflix\u2019s vice president of product innovation, Todd Yellin, told me the firm was \u201cde-emphasizing\u201d ratings in its algorithms.Stars were on the out for several reasons. For one, Netflix was transitioning from a DVD rental business to a streaming company. It was less reliant on you telling it what you liked (via ratings), because it could already tell what you liked \u2014 simply by analyzing what you had watched.This sort of virtue signaling, often undercut by divergent behavior, is everywhere \u2014 witness the discrepancies that sometimes occur between polling and actual voting in elections. And it\u2019s generally a one-way process: No one gives Adam Sandler\u2019s latest five stars and then secretly watches \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity.\u201dBut why aspirational reviewing should happen on Netflix is intriguing, given that no one else sees your Netflix queue. It\u2019s just you, clicking your way to a better version of yourself.Another reason for Netflix\u2019s shift from stars to thumbs is that, in the term of data scientists, star ratings are statistically \u201cnoisy.\u201d I may have spent a few minutes rationalizing my three-and-a-half star rating \u2014 \u201cWell, the direction was a bit flaccid, but the story was an interesting take on globalization and the cinematography was amazing\u201d \u2014 but from a recommendation standpoint, that wasn\u2019t all that much more useful than simply saying whether I liked it or not.Of course, it is hard to resist the notion that Netflix\u2019s decision represents some kind of dumbing down.Recently, in a bathroom at Frankfurt Airport, I came across a sign that asked: \u201cSatisfied with the cleanliness of this restroom today?\u201d Below were three buttons: a green happy face, a yellow neutral face and a red sad face. This simple interface seemed appropriate to the task; I am sure the airport management did not require a more detailed analysis from me of its restroom hygiene (\u201cWhile I appreciated the level of polish on the tiles, I felt the hand dryer could have been slightly warmer\u201d).But a film, in theory, is a more complex experience than a trip to the toilet. Should our responses be so streamlined, so channeled into the world of internet \u201cA/B\u201d preference-testing?In a world of vastly proliferating consumer choice, it is small wonder we should turn to the quickest, most primitive gestures to express judgments. After all, we know what we like. But these binary snap decisions should give us pause.Every fast click on Facebook also serves to steer us deeper into our own proclivities; our every bleary post-binge-watch thumbs-up gives us more of the same, more of what we \u201clike.\u201d But in this one-click world, we should not forget that many of the best, most lasting works of art \u2014 novels, paintings, films \u2014 were things that, in their day, very often got the thumbs down.I have lately been spending less time on Netflix, and more time on a new streaming service, FilmStruck, which includes the holdings of TCM and the Criterion Collection. On the site, there are neither stars nor thumbs, as if to say: While you may or may not \u201clike\u201d every film here, we think they are all worth your time. This I like.Advertisement"}

As the audience filters in, a bored-looking woman sits in a swivel chair, gazing at a desktop monitor. This is a copy shop called Harlem Office, and she works here, taking home a paycheck that isn\u2019t nearly big enough.At the very top of the play, things look promising: In dim light, the show\u2019s five actors move together, bending and lifting like field hands in chains \u2014 a striking image, and the first of the play\u2019s several references to slavery. When the lights go up, all is contemporary realism again as Yusuf (Chinaza Uche), an ingratiating nerd freshly graduated from New York University with a bachelor\u2019s in philosophy, interviews for a position at the shop with Xiomara (Flor De Liz Perez), who has eyes on becoming the store\u2019s manager.Yusuf gets his job, though not at the promised wage, and Xiomara gets hers, morphing instantly into a martinet whose principal allegiance is to the unseen owner. The transformation doesn\u2019t go over well with her friend Isabel (Pernell Walker), who has worked at Harlem Office far longer. Unable to break into management, she concentrates on coddling the regulars, like Amenze (Tina Fabrique), a 60-something community activist, who gets more than her share of copies on the house.But the janitor, Danilo (Cesar J. Rosado), is elated for Xiomara. They grew up in the same building in East Harlem. They\u2019ve known each other all their lives. To him, that translates into loyalty. Xiomara sees it differently.Divisions are more plentiful than alliances in \u201cDolphins and Sharks,\u201d whose mix of characters seems orchestrated to make a point about fragmentation along lines of race and class. Yusuf, raised in New York, was born in Nigeria \u2014 which to Isabel, who is African-American, means that he\u2019s African, not black. Their argument about their respective prejudices is one of the few times that the show heats up.But this is a production divided against itself. Between each flat scene, Ms. Brathwaite imposes jolting moments of sensory overload: a confusion of projections, flashing lights, video and high-volume sound that contributes little to telling the story at hand. Similarly, placing some scenes in a closed room upstage (the set is by Marsha Ginsberg) is needlessly distracting.The most delicate performance comes from Mr. Rosado, whether Danilo is exulting over a sonogram of his unborn child or raging at Xiomara, who has moved up ever so slightly in the world and swiftly forgotten what it was like to toil down below.The play\u2019s argument about income inequality and a broken, racist system is clear. So is the notion that people who unite to confront a common foe stand a better chance than people who turn against one another. As Amenze says, delivering the moral that explains the play\u2019s title, \u201cDolphins swim in groups to avoid shark attacks.\u201dBut here that shark remains an abstraction, and the blood sport is dismal indeed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Stand-Up Specials to Stream This Week", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byOn ComedyThanks to an aggressive push by streaming services like Netflix and Seeso, there have never been more new hours of comedians telling jokes than right now.Netflix\u2019s deals with Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle (who will post two filmed concerts on Tuesday) have received most of the attention, but what makes this golden age of specials particularly exciting is the amount of new work from young comics on the rise. Here\u2019s a look at some recent noteworthy releases.Staged by a fellow comic, Bo Burnham, who beautifully directed this special in the Masonic Hall in Manhattan, it\u2019s a startlingly intimate opening that anticipates the quietly searching, introspective jokes that follow. The recent presidential election shadows this hour, particularly in its melancholy mood.Mr. Carmichael is a deeply political comic, but his contrarian perspective is clarified as much by the way he probes his psyche as by his examination of the issues. His apathy is a central theme. In a culture in which so many on social media trumpet their moral rightness, Mr. Carmichael, who has an acclaimed NBC sitcom, \u201cThe Carmichael Show,\u201d invites the audience, sometimes explicitly, to judge his wrongness.He explains his indifference to global warming or inability to support the troops with conviction. In his soft-spoken delivery, he presents confessions of embarrassing thoughts, transgressions that are not cheap provocations so much as the activity of a free and fearless mind. Explaining that Jay Z means more to him than the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he says plainly: \u201cI know every Jay Z lyric. I only know, like, four bars of the \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019 speech.\u201dIs Katherine Ryan the new Joan Rivers?In general, Ms. Ryan is more likely to remind you of other performers than lay a claim to her own style. She has charming moments but could use an editor; her impressions of Bill Cosby and Mr. Burns from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d are unpersuasive.One reason Rivers was so singular is that, while she desperately wanted laughs, her instinct was to challenge rather than pander to her audience. Here is where Ms. Ryan parts ways with Rivers. When she tells a joke about how out of shape Americans are, she\u2019s giving British fans exactly what they want.Ms. Alonzo, who had a short-lived ABC sitcom, is a dynamic stage presence, addressing audience members as if they\u2019re old friends while effortlessly projecting to the last row. In between jokes, she flashes a bewildered smile, as if she can\u2019t believe what she just said. In this set, her nostalgic portrait of her late mother is genuinely moving, but her funniest material, about the challenges of being poor, brings to mind the best stand-up of Roseanne Barr.Her finest set piece investigates her childhood fantasy about the band New Kids on the Block, which, she recalls, involved her working as a maid on their tour bus.\u201cEven in my fantasy,\u201d she marveled, \u201cI can\u2019t give Latinos better jobs.\u201dMidway through his impressively polished debut special, Fahim Anwar \u2014 one of a growing number of gifted Muslim comics working clubs (Hasan Minhaj and Mo Amer are two others to keep a close eye on) \u2014 paused to boast with mock swagger that he was now part of the most feared minorities in the United States. An American of Afghan descent, Mr. Anwar conceded that African-Americans remain in the competition.\u201cIn a dark alley, you might be more afraid of him than me,\u201d he said of black men, \u201cbut on public transportation, I feel like I win that one.\u201dMr. Anwar even has an alter ego, an arrogant comic named Lance Cantstopolis, who is a mix of Borat and Tony Clifton. He shows up at the end of the special for a second, but I would not be surprised if this cartoonish character finds his own vehicle before too long.Carmen Lynch has such a mellow, meandering, deadpan delivery that it\u2019s easy to underestimate how many punch lines she packs into a minute. Tall with a lopsided grin, she has a casual, just-chatting style that masks a sneakily dark sensibility and precision writing.

Your answer came on Monday\u2019s \u201cLate Show,\u201d as Mr. Colbert revived his arrogant conservative pundit character from \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here because America needs me,\u201d that Mr. Colbert told \u2026 himself. \u201cPlus, I wanted to stop you from making an ass of yourself on network TV with your misguided analysis of Trump\u2019s budget.\u201d He didn\u2019t hold back in his tongue-in-cheek support for the president. Here are a couple of his most memorable (and absurd) lines:On the Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney\u2019s comment that the Trump budget is \u201ccompassionate\u201d to taxpayers:\u201cYes, you can\u2019t just focus on helping the needy and forget the people whose taxes pay for it. That\u2019s like praying for the accident victim who needed a transfusion and forgetting about the guy who\u2019s walking around a pint light now. Give that guy a cookie!\u201dOn the budget\u2019s proposed funding cut for Meals on Wheels, on the grounds that the program is inefficient:\u201cFolks, I know what you\u2019re saying: You\u2019re saying, \u2018They did meet their objective, Stephen.

{"Headline": "Netflix Casts a Wider Net for Original Documentaries", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byStreamingIt was early in March 2015, the filmmaker Ava DuVernay recalled recently, when she was approached by Lisa Nishimura, the vice president for original documentary and comedy programming at Netflix, who asked \u201cif I had any story I wanted to tell.\u201d As it happened, Ms. DuVernay had been thinking \u201cabout an overview of where the United States currently stands in terms of mass incarceration.\u201dWhat secured the nomination were two things: the movie\u2019s extraordinary quality and the perspicacious marketing department at Netflix\u2019s documentary division.Flexibility of formatting is one component of this success story. On March 28, Netflix will premiere \u201cFive Came Back,\u201d about a group of prominent Hollywood directors and how they were changed by World War II, in three episodes. Mark Harris, the film\u2019s screenwriter and the author of the book on which it is based (who is a longtime colleague and friend of mine), noted that had the project been picked up by a television network, \u201cthe directive would have been, \u2018Please fill this 90-minute slot.\u2019 Whereas with Netflix, the first thing they asked was \u2018What should this be?\u2019\u201dMs. DuVernay recalled that Netflix\u2019s commitment to making \u201c13th\u201d what she thought it should be remained consistent for the entire process.\u201cAfter I started it, I realized that it needed to be about more than the immediate situation, and I wanted to add historical perspective\u201d she said. \u201cThat meant an expanded budget, and expanded time.\u201d She noted that she wanted a two-and-a-half-hour cut reduced to 100 minutes. \u201cLisa told me, \u2018It can be two and a half hours.\u2019 The 100-minute length was something I wanted.\u201d Ms. DuVernay added, \u201cThe division is filled with people who are real filmmakers, who have made documentaries, been in the editing room.\u201dWhat it looks like to the creator is borne in mind throughout the process; Netflix\u2019s goal over all, according to the filmmakers working with them, is to create distinctive stories.\u201cIn this line of endeavor, you hear about things like network notes, and that\u2019s always a kind of vicious punch line,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cWe kept waiting for that moment, but it never came. [Netflix] was always constructive and supportive.\u201dMs. Nishimura, the executive making all this possible, said she was lucky \u201cto have come from a professional background that supports creators first.\u201d Before joining Netflix almost a decade ago, she worked with Chris Blackwell, the music entrepreneur who founded Island Records, at the indie film company Palm Pictures. When she joined Netflix, it was a DVD rental entity, and she was buying up titles and \u201coverseeing relationships with creators worldwide.\u201d In the process, she discovered that audiences had a hunger for documentaries not always reflected at the box office.\u201cTelevision ratings exist because of ads, which we\u2019re free of, and box office has become so reliant on Friday night returns that it\u2019s warped perceptions of what audiences want,\u201d Ms. Nishimura said. \u201cJust because a person doesn\u2019t go see a documentary on a Friday night, it\u2019s not a reflection on the film; it\u2019s just a reflection that maybe a documentary isn\u2019t a film that a couple is going to want to see on date night. What we\u2019ve discovered is that we can elevate storytelling and bring it to a global platform and create a cultural moment.\u201d (According to a Netflix spokeswoman, 73 percent of all subscribers \u2014 more than 68 million \u2014 watched at least one documentary on the site in 2016.)\u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d certainly created a cultural moment, and \u201c13th\u201d did so on a scale that even its creators did not necessarily expect. \u201cWhen we created it, we wondered whether or not it was a uniquely American story,\u201d Ms. Nishimura said. \u201cReally it\u2019s a story of \u2018the other,\u2019 and how we treat each other as humans, and what can happen when that goes awry. And so it did get a response from a global audience. And will continue to. The docs live on our service forever. We\u2019re allowing stories to continue to find their ceiling over time.\u201dAn article last Sunday about Netflix misidentified the next project that the director Ava DuVernay is working on. It is \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d adapted from the Madeleine L\u2019Engle book \u2014 not \u201cSomething Wicked This Way Comes,\u201d adapted from the Ray Bradbury book.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kids Are Getting Older Quicker. And Disney Tries to Adapt.", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byBURBANK, Calif. \u2014 Grandma is mad. Her grown daughter, Bex, who got pregnant as a teenager, just blazed back into town and let a big secret slip. Grandma had raised 13-year-old Andi to believe that Bex was her older sister. Well, the truth is a tad more complicated.Meanwhile, Andi\u2019s school life is only a little less unsettling. A boy is coming to terms with his sexuality. And Andi has her own budding love life to consider.The latest from MTV?\u201cI know I can\u2019t go to the hugely dramatic space,\u201d said Gary Marsh, president of Disney Channels Worldwide. \u201cI can\u2019t go to the sexual space. I can\u2019t go horror. Where can I go that would elevate the content and get people talking about us in a way that is different from the way they talk about us normally?\u201dSitting in his office here, amid mementos from glory-days hits like \u201cHigh School Musical,\u201d Mr. Marsh mused about breakthrough shows for adults like \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d on Netflix and \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d on AMC.\u201cThere has to be an equivalent in our space,\u201d he said. \u201cStories that matter, that deal with more complex issues, that are emotional, resonate longer. They stick to your guts.\u201dWhether \u201cAndi Mack\u201d connects with viewers when it makes its premiere on April 7 is anyone\u2019s guess. (Disney Channel released the first two episodes on its digital platforms on Friday to spread word of mouth.) But Mr. Marsh\u2019s willingness to even take the risk is revealing: As storytelling tastes change and viewing habits shift, the predictable formulas are no longer enough.The internet has created more curious and progressive kids. That has led to what the industry calls \u201cage compression\u201d \u2014 getting older younger. At the same time, Netflix in many ways has become the go-to outlet for families. YouTube has also had an enormous impact.Disney Channel ratings have been sinking. In February, according to Nielsen data, standard viewership was down 18 percent among children 2 to 11 from the same period in 2016 \u2014 even as the rival Nickelodeon held steady. (Unlike the animation-heavy Nickelodeon, Disney Channel does not sell traditional ads, so ratings matter less. But it does sell sponsorships, and needs to keep viewership high to justify the fees it charges cable distributors.)Wall Street has started to notice, increasing the pressure to find a new hit. On Disney\u2019s most recent conference call with industry analysts, Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, blamed lower ratings on \u201ca proliferation of kids programming\u201d (Netflix) and \u201ca bit of an off cycle\u201d at Disney Channel itself.\u201cWe think that the ratings are likely to improve with the addition of some new shows that we think creatively are very strong,\u201d Mr. Iger said.But Ms. Minsky, whose other credits include \u201cSex and the City,\u201d was not keen to create a show with child actors.Still, Ms. Minsky said that something Mr. Marsh had told her at breakfast was intriguing. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re kind of looking to do something different \u2014 we feel like ABC Family has abdicated that market for teenagers, and there is an opportunity for us,\u2019\u201d Ms. Minsky recalled.For the crucial lead role, Ms. Minsky cast the newcomer Peyton Elizabeth Lee. Aside from her presence on camera, Ms. Minsky liked that the young actress did not look as if she had fallen off a child-star assembly line: Ms. Lee, who is of mixed ethnicity, has short hair and a crooked grin. \u201cDisney was, like, \u2018Should we grow her hair out?\u2019 And I was, like, \u2018No!\u2019\u201d Ms. Minsky recalled.\u201cAndi Mack\u201d stands out for more than its subject matter. Scenes were shot outside. Sets were built to look like the real world. (Andi does not have an impossibly bedazzled bedroom.) Story lines play out over a full season. The characters, not the situation, are meant to be compelling.Mr. Marsh emphasized that \u201cAndi Mack\u201d was written in a \u201crelatable, respectful and age-appropriate way.\u201d Consultants from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and the National Center on Adoption and Permanency were hired to help Ms. Minsky navigate the family-twist drama. The advisers emphasized \u201ctaking responsibility for choices\u201d and \u201cthe enormous responsibilities of a parent or guardian,\u201d a Disney Channel spokeswoman, Patti McTeague, wrote in an email.In other words, \u201cAndi Mack\u201d broadens the Disney concept, but only to a degree. \u201cIf the brand is a circle, put your pivot foot in the center of the circle, take your other foot and stretch it as far as you can go,\u201d Mr. Marsh said. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t let go of your pivot foot, you will be safe.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted part of the name of an organization that was hired to consult on \u201cAndi Mack.\u201d It is the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, not the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At 91, Ella Brennan Still Feeds (and Leads) New Orleans", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byDrinks are often followed by dinner, also from Commander\u2019s, and wine. Ms. Brennan favors Champagne and distinguished whites from the C\u00f4te de Beaune because, as she puts it, \u201cI\u2019m too damn old to drink cheap wine\u201d and \u201cbecause I can.\u201dIn New Orleans, there is little question that Miss Ella, as Ms. Brennan is widely known here, has earned her sense of entitlement. Her hometown\u2019s civic pride is tightly linked to its reputation for culinary excellence; Ms. Brennan helped create that reputation, and has made maintaining it a personal responsibility for more than 60 years.At 91, she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1,400 people, both full and part time, and she has mentored countless talents, including the celebrity chefs Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse.\u201cShe was there to embrace and elevate, not just me but the entire staff,\u201d said Mr. Lagasse, whom Ms. Brennan plucked from obscurity and installed, at age 23, as Commander\u2019s chef in the early 1980s. \u201cThe list of people she has impacted in the hospitality industry in America is endless.\u201dThe book and film tell the story of a hard-charging, no-nonsense businesswoman \u2014 her other nickname is Hurricane Ella \u2014 who excelled in a male-dominated profession decades before gender imbalance in the restaurant industry became a hot issue.On a recent afternoon, Ms. Brennan sat next to the unlit fireplace in her living room. As she moved a sore leg back and forth between an ottoman and the floor, she suggested that her impulse to empower employees was a rejection of restaurant industry norms she confronted as a young woman.\u201cIn those days, no one was paying attention to developing people,\u201d she said. \u201cA restaurateur has to be part of a team to make something everyone can be proud of.\u201dHer decision to tap Mr. Prudhomme, a Cajun, to run Commander\u2019s kitchen in the 1970s loosened the grip that European-born chefs had on American fine dining. Alongside Ms. Brennan, and later on his own, the media-savvy Mr. Prudhomme helped set the table for a renaissance in American regional cooking that has yet to abate.\u201cNew Orleans was really the centerpiece of the whole American food movement,\u201d the New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent said. \u201cAnd Ella put New Orleans on the map.\u201dIn 1946, Mr. Brennan bought Vieux Carr\u00e9, a French Quarter restaurant that Ms. Brennan described recently, with typical candor, as \u201cterrible.\u201d Mr. Brennan hired her to manage the business, looking to prove that an Irish family could operate a restaurant superior to established French-Creole restaurants like Arnaud\u2019s, Antoine\u2019s and Galatoire\u2019s.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d Ms. Brennan recalled. \u201cBut Owen was a raconteur. He slept till noon. He got me to do all of the things he didn\u2019t like. So I learned.\u201dA voracious reader, she pored over books recommended by the restaurant\u2019s two chefs, Jack Eames and Paul Blang\u00e9, whose respect she sought and whom she frequently praised. \u201cI was amazed at their talent,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were like surgeons.\u201dThe gregarious Brennan family \u2014 the other siblings were Dick, Adelaide, Dottie and John \u2014 cultivated a clientele of influential locals and visitors, including celebrities. All the while, Ms. Brennan worked with the chefs to elevate Vieux Carr\u00e9\u2019s food. For inspiration, she traveled frequently to New York City, where she became a regular at the \u201c21\u201d Club. Culinary pioneers like James Beard and Helen McCully, the food editor of McCall\u2019s magazine, took the young visitor under their wings.\u201cYou had to go to New York in those days,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cI was trying to get New Orleans to that level.\u201dBy all accounts, Brennan\u2019s ushered in a new age for fine dining in the South. It became a grand showcase for New Orleans joie de vivre, replete with a wine cellar, antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional French-Creole cuisine. The national press took notice, especially of its boozy, multicourse breakfasts.\u201cAmerica was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment,\u201d Ms. Brennan wrote, \u201cand all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food.\u201dMs. Brennan helped develop new dishes, including bananas Foster. She pushed to expand the family\u2019s restaurant properties, with spotty success, aggravating a rift between Owen\u2019s heirs and what came to be known as \u201cElla\u2019s side\u201d of the family.In 1973, Ms. Brennan was dismissed from Brennan\u2019s, initiating a bitter, litigious family split that has never fully healed. \u201cIt was a tragedy,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cFamily is everything to us.\u201d(Owen Brennan\u2019s sons continued to run Brennan\u2019s until 2013, when a group that includes Ralph Brennan, a son of John Brennan, purchased the debt-riddled property at a sheriff\u2019s auction. Brennan\u2019s of Houston, overseen by Ms. Brennan\u2019s son Alex, is part of her restaurant group.)Commander\u2019s Palace, which Ms. Brennan acquired in 1969, was a sprawling property in need of repair. In partnership with her sisters and brothers, she set about turning it into a restaurant that would eclipse Brennan\u2019s. Early reviews weren\u2019t favorable. But over time, Commander\u2019s became renowned for its sophisticated blending of south Louisiana and nouvelle cuisines \u2014 Ms. Brennan christened the style haute Creole \u2014 and its warm, celebratory approach to fine dining.\u201cWe want people who eat here to feel important, and we want them to have fun,\u201d Ms. Brennan said.Ms. Brennan never presumed that her management responsibilities ended at the kitchen door. Alex McCrery, a Commander\u2019s line cook in the early 2000s, recalled that Ms. Brennan admonished another cook for proposing that the kitchen make mustard ice cream.\u201cShe was the type who was like your mom is when she is disappointed in you,\u201d Mr. McCrery said. \u201cShe was stern, and you\u2019d feel like you really messed up.\u201dMs. Brennan said she \u201cgave up men for Lent\u201d after her divorce in 1970 from Paul Martin.

{"Headline": "How the Internet Is Saving Culture, Not Killing It", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne secret to longevity as a pundit is to issue predictions that can\u2019t be easily checked. So here\u2019s one for the time capsule: Two hundred years from now, give or take, the robot-people of Earth will look back on the early years of the 21st century as the beginning of a remarkable renaissance in art and culture.That may sound unlikely to many of us in the present. In the past few decades, we\u2019ve seen how technology has threatened the old order in cultural businesses, including the decimation of the music industry, the death of the cable subscription, the annihilation of newspapers and the laying to waste of independent bookstores.But things are turning around; for people of the future, our time may be remembered as a period not of death, but of rejuvenation and rebirth.Part of the story is in the art itself. In just about every cultural medium, whether movies or music or books or the visual arts, digital technology is letting in new voices, creating new formats for exploration, and allowing fans and other creators to participate in a glorious remixing of the work. This isn\u2019t new; from blogs to podcasts to YouTube, the last 20 years have been marked by a succession of formats that have led to ever-lower barriers for new and off-the-wall creators.But now something surprising has happened.In the last few years, and with greater intensity in the last 12 months, people started paying for online content. They are doing so at an accelerating pace, and on a dependable, recurring schedule, often through subscriptions. And they\u2019re paying for everything.You\u2019ve already heard about the rise of subscription-based media platforms \u2014 things like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify and Apple Music. But people are also paying for smaller-audience and less-mainstream-friendly content. They are subscribing to podcasters, comedians, zany YouTube stars, novelists and comic book artists. They are even paying for news.It\u2019s difficult to overstate how big a deal this is. More than 20 years after it first caught mainstream attention and began to destroy everything about how we finance culture, the digital economy is finally beginning to coalesce around a sustainable way of supporting content. If subscriptions keep taking off, it won\u2019t just mean that some of your favorite creators will survive the internet. It could also make for a profound shift in the way we find and support new cultural talent. It could lead to a wider variety of artists and art, and forge closer connections between the people who make art and those who enjoy it.\u201cWhat we want to do is change the entire financing mechanism that drives the production of content online,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cWe want to change how things are paid for and how the web runs. For us, it\u2019s a very, very big problem.\u201d\u201cI do think something has changed culturally,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cThis new generation is more concerned with social impact. There\u2019s a desire to vote with your dollars and your time and attention.\u201dSome of that is happening in the news business, too. The New York Times and many other newspapers reported a surge in subscriptions after Donald J. Trump won the presidency last year.Huge content platforms have been criticized for the way they treat artists. Even if lots of people are paying for services like Spotify, critics say that it can be difficult for musicians, especially smaller and less-well-known ones, to make a sustainable living from the platform.Yet many artists are finding ways around these difficulties. Thanks to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, artists can now establish close relationships with their fans. They can sell merchandise and offer special fan-only promotions and content. And after finding an audience, they can use sites like Patreon to get a dependable paycheck from their most loyal followers.This sort of alternative arrangement isn\u2019t easy to pursue; it can take time, effort and skills in unusual dark arts (such as how social-media marketing works). But there are signs it is catching on: At the Grammys last year, the award for best new artist went to Chance the Rapper, who has famously, proudly rejected every offer to sign with a record label and even to sell any of his music.If there are difficulties in navigating the modern cultural business, there are upsides, too.\u201cI don\u2019t have to go out on the road and play in bars,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be a father and I can be a husband. This normalizes my career. It normalizes the career of being an artist, which has never been normalized.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byIn President Trump\u2019s oft-changing world order, Roger J. Stone Jr., the onetime political consultant and full-time provocateur, has been one of the few constants \u2014 a loyalist and self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster\u201d who nurtured the dream of a presidential run by the developer-turned-television-star for 30 years.But two months into the Trump presidency, Mr. Stone, known for his pinstripe suits, the Nixon tattoo spanning his shoulder blades and decades of outlandish statements, is under investigation for what would be his dirtiest trick \u2014 colluding with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton and put his friend in the White House.Mr. Stone, 64, is the best known of the Trump associates under scrutiny as part of an F.B.I. investigation into Russian interference in the election. John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman whose hacked emails were released by WikiLeaks, accused him in October of having advance warning of the hacks, which the intelligence community has concluded were orchestrated by Russia.When Mr. Schiff asked Mr. Comey at the House hearing how Mr. Stone could have known that Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails were going to be released, the F.B.I. director again refused to answer. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I can comment on,\u201d Mr. Comey replied.Mr. Stone has denied advance knowledge of the hacks or any involvement with the Russians. But his public statements have given investigators something to focus on.Before the Podesta emails were released, Mr. Stone said in a speech that he had \u201ccommunicated with\u201d Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder \u2014 whom he has defended for years \u2014 and that he had a large trove of material on the Clintons that he would publish shortly before the election. He has acknowledged having communicated over Twitter with the online persona Guccifer 2.0, who American officials believe is a front for Russian intelligence officials. And there was the Podesta tweet.But Mr. Stone has explanations for each: The timeline of his \u201cbenign\u201d contacts with Guccifer 2.0 \u2014 \u201cwho may or not be a Russian asset\u201d \u2014 disproves claims of collusion; his communication with Mr. Assange was through an intermediary and was \u201cperfectly legal;\u201d and the Podesta tweet referred to information in an article he wrote that appeared two months later, not any emails.Now under scrutiny by both F.B.I. and Senate investigators, Mr. Stone has hired two lawyers to represent him. But in an interview, Mr. Stone maintained that this was \u201ca scandal with no evidence.\u201d\u201cThere is still not an iota of proof that anyone on the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians,\u201d said Mr. Stone, who met Mr. Trump through their mutual mentor, the McCarthy-era fixer and lawyer Roy M. Cohn.Mr. Stone learned from Mr. Cohn that all press is good press, and to hit back, hard and often, and he is doing just that.His recent book, \u201cThe Making of the President 2016,\u201d is part paean to Mr. Trump and part pushback against the claims related to Russia. While promoting the book, Mr. Stone has said he believes his communications were monitored by the government, and he supports Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that there must have been surveillance of him as a candidate.Few people go as far back with Mr. Trump as Mr. Stone. Over the years he was by Mr. Trump\u2019s side as he toyed with running for president and then, in 2015, finally decided to do it. But he seems to prefer the role of outside adviser in a relationship that has had many ups and downs. It was the role he played in 2016 after he left Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign over what Mr. Stone said was a fight about its direction.Mr. Stone said he decided to leave; Mr. Trump maintained that he fired him.As an informal adviser, Mr. Stone supported Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to focus extensively on immigration at the start of the 2016 campaign, and believed that he could tap into a core group of disaffected Republican voters. He encouraged his engagement with conservative online media, such as Newsmax and, later on, Breitbart. He also advised Mr. Trump to attack Mrs. Clinton over how she dealt with women involved in her husband\u2019s extramarital affairs, a line of attack that Mr. Trump embraced. Mr. Trump offered praise for Mr. Stone on the coming Netflix documentary \u201cGet Me Roger Stone.\u201dTo both his allies and critics, Mr. Stone, a native of Connecticut, presents a contradictory portrait. His name inspired anxiety in a generation of New York political operatives. He has embraced theories that Mr. Trump pushed in the campaign about Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s father somehow being tied to the John F. Kennedy assassination. And once a week he guest-hosts on a radio show hosted by Alex Jones, who has a devoted following of Trump voters along with a raft of conspiracy theories of his own.On Monday, when he devoted most of his show to defending Mr. Stone, Mr. Jones expressed concern that Mr. Stone\u2019s life was in danger \u2014 a reference to Mr. Stone\u2019s claim that he was recently poisoned with polonium as well as the victim of a \u201csuspicious\u201d hit-and-run broadside car crash last week. Mr. Stone did not let that keep him from an event in Orlando to promote his book the following day.But Mr. Stone is also a libertarian and strong supporter of gay rights and legalized marijuana who expressed concern in 2016 that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team didn\u2019t try harder to get him to disavow the Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke. While he has long been an outlier in the political world, he got his real start in national politics with the Reagan campaign in 1979. He is renowned among Republican political professionals for using the internet for years before \u201cany mainstream Republicans or activists,\u201d according to Tony Fabrizio, a veteran Republican pollster.And for a time, as a partner in a white-shoe Washington lobbying firm, Mr. Stone was a part of the swamp that Mr. Trump now wants to drain. He worked there with his old friend, Paul Manafort, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman. His ties to Russia are now under scrutiny by the F.B.I., but Mr. Manafort denies any suggestion that he colluded with Russian officials or anybody else.But those establishment days seem far in the past. As scrutiny of him has intensified in recent weeks, Mr. Stone has lashed out more aggressively, sending a series of caustic, obscenity-laced messages on Twitter, several of which he deleted a few hours after posting.\u201cDon\u2019t confuse Roger Stone with the character I play,\u201d Mr. Stone said with a chuckle in an interview on Sunday, conceding that he has sometimes sent a \u201ctwo-martini tweet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u201813 Reasons Why\u2019 She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byIn tone and style, it resembles a more serious, grimmer cousin of Freeform (formerly ABC Family) series like \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cTwisted.\u201d Like them, it literalizes the idea that teenage life is a mystery, one that adults can\u2019t hope to solve.Young viewers may find the combination of thriller and morbid teenage melodrama in \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d addictive, though parents should be aware that it contains startlingly naturalistic depictions of rape and suicide.The rest of us won\u2019t have as much patience for the show\u2019s excessively convoluted, repetitive and unlikely story, or for the narrative gimmick reflected in its title.The action begins a few weeks after the death of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a junior at a suburban high school. Clay (Dylan Minnette), a socially awkward classmate who had a crush on her, receives a shoe box full of vintage cassette tapes (Maxell 60s, if you\u2019re a nostalgist).They contain Hannah\u2019s descriptions of 13 traumatic events that led to her decision to kill herself, each addressed to the schoolmate or adult who caused that particular trauma. She\u2019s left instructions that the box be passed from one tormentor to another, and Clay is late in the list, so most of the other people she accuses have already heard the tapes before he receives them.The novel began the same way but took place in one night, as Clay listened to the tapes while visiting the scenes of Hannah\u2019s downfall. The TV show\u2019s developer, the screenwriter Brian Yorkey, has expanded the story to 13 hourlong episodes by beefing up the present-day portion of the narrative (which continually shifts between the past as seen by Hannah and the present as experienced by Clay).Clay now becomes a detective and avenging angel, confronting other students in a campaign to get to the truth and, in the process, repair Hannah\u2019s reputation. The show also makes more room for adults (goosing the drama by having Hannah\u2019s parents file a lawsuit against the school), which means that the largely anonymous cast can be supplemented with more familiar and accomplished performers like Brian d\u2019Arcy James, Steven Weber, Keiko Agena and Kate Walsh.You can understand why the book would, almost inevitably, become a 13-episode series, but the inflation has several unfortunate consequences. Reading a young-adult novel in one sitting, it\u2019s easier to suspend your disbelief regarding Hannah\u2019s copious misfortunes, which include broken friendships, a fatal auto accident and sexual violence.We\u2019re meant to see that there\u2019s an emotional and practical order to these events \u2014 Hannah\u2019s diminished standing and waning self-confidence lead to new incidents of bullying or abandonment. But the show doesn\u2019t make her downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.Another problem is a storytelling contrivance that quickly becomes irritating. To parcel out the surprises and stretch the drama, the Netflix Clay, unlike the novel\u2019s Clay, chooses not to listen to the tapes in one sitting \u2014 as any normal teenager would, and as the other fictional teenagers in the show do.Instead he listens to the recordings one at a time, and keeps confronting the other characters \u2014 quizzing them, arguing with them, fighting with them \u2014 without knowing the whole story, or his own role in it, even though he could find out with just a few hours of binge listening. It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you\u2019ll find yourself, like Clay\u2019s antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.If you stick with \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d \u2014 and the watchful, smart performance by Mr. Minnette (\u201cScandal,\u201d \u201cAwake\u201d) is one reason to make the effort \u2014 it builds up some cumulative force. In the last four episodes, two directed by Jessica Yu, one by Carl Franklin and one by Kyle Patrick Alvarez, it achieves a momentum and gravity somewhat equal to its subject matter. (It also throws in a groaner of a pretext for a possible second season.)You might find yourself skeptical, though, despite the undeniable veracity of some of the show\u2019s depictions of high school angst. The overall message \u2014 one that probably appeals to teenagers \u2014 is that it\u2019s possible to figure out why someone takes her own life, and therefore to guard against it happening to others. But the beleaguered school counselor played by Derek Luke may have it right when he tells Clay, you can just never tell.A television review on Friday about the Netflix series \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d omitted one of the directors of the last four episodes. Besides Carl Franklin and Jessica Yu (who directed two of them), Kyle Patrick Alvarez directed an episode.Advertisement"}

On Friday, March 17, Sire Records will release a self-titled album from Mr. Shaffer and his longtime colleagues, who are once again calling themselves the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Band (as they did on NBC).Making this record has provided Mr. Shaffer the opportunity to reconnect with the modest musical dreams he had before becoming an unlikely television star, to play the music he loves best and to stave off inertia in a period when it was expected he might not do anything at all.\u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long to figure out I wasn\u2019t happy doing that,\u201d he said, speaking from the apartment he keeps near Lincoln Center. \u201cWhile I still can, let me rock. Maybe that should be the title of the tour.\u201dDespite all the free time he had to spend with his wife and two children, Mr. Shaffer felt untethered by the absence of a daily gig.\u201cInside, I said to myself, \u2018That was fabulous, now you can do other things \u2014 enjoy your life,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI got depressed right away. I wasn\u2019t interested in doing that.\u201dIn his time on \u201cLate Night\u201d and \u201cLate Show,\u201d Mr. Shaffer was more than just an all-knowing one-man jukebox; he was the host\u2019s reliable barometer of what was normal, what was askew and what was O.K. to laugh at.\u201cHe was so much better at his job than I was at my job,\u201d Mr. Letterman said in an interview. \u201cIf something was going crazy, all I had to do was look behind the guest\u2019s head at Paul, and I could see that Paul sensed the same problem that I sensed. We would know, yeah, the engine has broken.\u201d(As Mr. Shaffer said, he saw his role in these interactions as, \u201cI had to be there, ready to react musically or with a response, or else risk that question, \u2018Can you hear me?,\u2019 if I wasn\u2019t quick with it.\u201d)For Mr. Shaffer, his years with Mr. Letterman vastly exceeded his youthful aspirations of playing music in New York, a dream cultivated by his time spent listening to American pop groups and the songs of Brill Building composers.Mr. Shaffer came to New York to play keyboards in Mr. Schwartz\u2019s 1974 Broadway musical \u201cThe Magic Show,\u201d to work as a studio musician and to play on National Lampoon comedy records with budding humorists like Christopher Guest.Surrounded by these ascendant comedians, Mr. Shaffer said he did not feel funny himself but had an aptitude for regurgitating what other people said. \u201cI was known for remembering stuff that sometimes they would come up with and didn\u2019t remember themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody said something funny, late at night, I would repeat it out loud, just to lock it in. I was absolutely a fan, all these years.\u201dWill Lee, the bassist and another charter member of the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Band, said Mr. Shaffer\u2019s greatest skill was \u201chis diplomacy as a human that allowed him to navigate the waters of a guy like Dave Letterman.\u201d\u201cDave himself was looking for a persona,\u201d Mr. Lee said, \u201cand Paul not only helped him feel comfortable within his persona, but helped him find it along the way.\u201dFelicia Collins, the guitarist and singer who played with Mr. Shaffer\u2019s CBS Orchestra for nearly 22 years, said the job offered \u201cevery single thing you could dream of wishing to do in your career as a musician.\u201dWhen that job ended, Ms. Collins said: \u201cIt just felt like there\u2019s nowhere else to go after that. I was depressed for months. I couldn\u2019t watch television. I couldn\u2019t talk to people. And then my mother said, \u2018Get out there \u2014 you can\u2019t just look like you dropped off the face of the earth.\u2019 And she was right.\u201dMr. Shaffer said the fog of his own post-\u201cLate Show\u201d malaise began to lift when he was approached by Seymour Stein, the chairman and co-founder of Sire Records, to make an album for the label. \u201cI cheered up right away \u2014 I wasn\u2019t depressed anymore,\u201d he said.Richard Gottehrer, the veteran songwriter (\u201cMy Boyfriend\u2019s Back\u201d; \u201cI Want Candy\u201d) and Sire Records co-founder who produced the album, said it was Mr. Shaffer\u2019s tribute to an era and a sound that fundamentally changed the musician\u2019s life.\u201cIt was the spirit of that music that got him out of a small town in Canada and made him think, gee, I don\u2019t have to follow in my father\u2019s footsteps and be a lawyer,\u201d Mr. Gottehrer said.Mr. Shaffer and his band mates will begin their tour in April, knowing that it will be a different, better-behaved take of his time on the road with the Blues Brothers. (\u201cThis will be a drug-free version of that,\u201d Mr. Lee said.)It may not be the kind of music that moves units by the millions anymore, Mr. Shaffer said, but then again, what does? \u201cIt kind of takes the pressure off,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Well, nobody\u2019s selling records unless you\u2019re Adele.\u2019 I\u2019m not Adele. Nobody expects me to really sell this thing.\u201dOn this itinerary, Mr. Shaffer is likely to be in bed at a reasonable hour after each show, and this time he\u2019s flying commercial. Still he can\u2019t help feeling a little wistful about the airborne deathtrap that carried him around the country the last time. \u201cIt was good to have your own plane,\u201d he said. \u201cAs rickety as it was, it would take off as soon as we boarded.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even so, I eventually quit, to pursue the TV writing career I\u2019d always wanted.But not after spending \u2014 some would say wasting \u2014 10 years and six figures to get there.The LSAT was rough. The logic games that make up its most infamous section are real killers, and my name, which means \u201clogical\u201d in Arabic, failed to give me any sort of edge. Studying was grueling, repetitive and at times mind-numbingly boring, adjectives that happen to have quite a bit of overlap with the way some lawyers would describe their jobs.... The test is to the desire to become a lawyer as a dating service with 2,000 personal questions and a registration fee is to the desire for a relationship. It\u2019s easier to swipe aimlessly on your phone while binging on Netflix at 2 a.m., but if swiping is all you\u2019re willing to do, that might tell you something about what you actually want.And remember, studying for the LSAT creates a lot of angst \u2014 but so will being a lawyer, if being a lawyer isn\u2019t for you.\u2014 Do you agree that entrance exams like the LSAT can separate the people who really want to pursue a course of study from those who \u201cjust aren\u2019t sure what else to do with their lives\u201d? Explain.\u2014 What are other examples of requirements that can help people understand if a certain career is or is not right for them?\u2014 Have you ever experienced a similar situation, perhaps not with an academic path, but any pursuit in which the less serious are \u201cweeded out\u201d through a process?\u2014 If you have, how does your experience compare to the writer\u2019s description of practicing law for seven years before moving on to a different career?Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

{"Headline": "Dave Chappelle on Trump, Cosby and His Netflix Deal", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byA Word WithWhether lambasting racial inequity with his trademark eccentricity, or putting on a Jheri curl wig for a now-legendary parody of Rick James, Dave Chappelle has long been considered one of the most exciting stand-ups in comedy. But he hasn\u2019t issued a special or album since his infamous decision to walk away from the critically acclaimed \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d on Comedy Central \u2014 and a $50 million contract \u2014 in 2005.In an interview that touched on the death of Prince and his conflicted feelings about Bill Cosby, Mr. Chappelle spoke by phone on Thursday about his contract with Netflix, his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d appearance and how the election of President Trump affects comedy. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.It wasn\u2019t like I made a deal and had to go out and do a lot. [Laughs] I just had to deliver the shows.And you\u2019ll be releasing another brand-new special for Netflix this year as part of the three-special deal. Yeah. I\u2019m working on that now.Not a bad deal. Do you have other unreleased shows still in the vault?I have hundreds of hours of high-quality audio recording of shows I did after I quit my television show. And then I [taped] three specials \u2014 one in Chicago, one in Austin, and one in L.A. Oh, and I also recorded the Radio City shows.These specials showcase a comedian who is reinvigorated by stand-up comedy.I could quit my show, and that\u2019s one kind of difficulty. But quitting doing stand-up would be another. I\u2019m sure everybody gets to a point where they run out of [stuff] to say, and they\u2019ve got to take a knee and recharge and be introspective and live their life. But it\u2019s hard to not ever come back to. Guys might walk away from it and close the door, but they don\u2019t lock it behind. Eddie Murphy always entertains the possibility of doing it again. Even though he doesn\u2019t do it, I\u2019m sure he thinks about it all the time. It\u2019s just one of those things where you\u2019ll do it for 10 years, and then you\u2019ll think about it for the next 30. Many of your contemporaries are still performing.It kind of reminds me of the \u201990s: Chris [Rock] is back out there, I see Jerry [Seinfeld] around, I hear Jon Stewart is around again. All these people who are great comics that stopped doing stand-up. It\u2019s fun to see everybody back. It\u2019s a good time for comedy in that respect. But the whole Trump thing makes it harder for comedians.How so? He\u2019s so skewed, it\u2019s hard to find an angle that sounds fresh. If you talk about him, it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re part of the chorus and not a soloist.How do you view the dynamic between comedy and bringing truth to power?I think it\u2019s interesting that people perceive us as having a sanctuary. Because I don\u2019t. In fact, I think we\u2019re almost disproportionately taken to task over what we say.It\u2019s a hard thing to talk about. I looked up to him like everybody did. I didn\u2019t know him that well, but the times that we hung out were fun and very memorable and often funny. He was very generous with his advice, and he was very generous with his access. He let me see some of his process. He fostered a community among artists. He used to have these parties where we would go over to his house, and there would be all these musicians that I admired, and they\u2019d just do these jam sessions in the basement. Everybody at the party was playing something. I think when he died there was the icon dying, but then there was this pillar in the community of people dying.Take me through hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d last November in the immediate wake of the election.At a certain point [on election night], we were all in the writers\u2019 room, and as the night went on, and Trump was picking up these Electoral [College] votes, everyone stopped writing. And then everyone was just staring at the TV. I saw people tear up sketches they were writing. They\u2019d assumed Hillary was going to win. Now there was essentially no show on Saturday. It was like the wind got knocked out of the writers\u2019 room. I was really worried.And yet you delivered a humorous, poignant monologue reflecting your equal parts hope and fear for the future.The best advice I got was from Louis C.K. I went to a comedy club Friday night [before the show] and saw him. And Louis told me: \u201c[Forget] the rest of the show. The monologue is all that matters.\u201d I was stressed out all that day. But right before I went onstage, this calm just washed over me. Everything just felt right.As someone who idolized Bill Cosby as a child, it\u2019s surprising you dedicate so much time in both specials to the rape allegations against him.The Bill Cosby thing was tough for me. I\u2019m not saying that to detract from his alleged victims at all. But he was a hero of mine.Is there a mourning process involved?How do you respond when critics put you in the same conversation as comedy greats like George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock?I appreciate it, but it\u2019s not a useful thing. I don\u2019t know what to do with that but just be humbled by it. You never feel like you\u2019re better than your heroes.What does life look like moving forward? I need time to think. I need to have experiences. I have to live in order to get onstage. When I\u2019m sitting there staring into space, that\u2019s the heavy lifting. I\u2019m like everybody: Sometimes I\u2019m wildly optimistic; sometimes I feel doom and gloom. We all just keep moving.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Money-Losing Snap Could Be Worth So Much", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Common SenseTesting the upper limits of valuation, Snap\u2019s investors are betting on the kind of rapid growth that few, if any, companies have ever achieved.Supported byBy now, even most of us over 35 \u2014 old age, by Snapchat standards \u2014 are aware of the photo sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial America.Even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that self-destruct, or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow, turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts, you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $34 billion.At that price, Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook \u2014 not to mention such internet stalwarts as Google, Amazon and even Netflix \u2014 look like bargain-basement \u201cvalue\u201d stocks.Snap \u201clooks tremendously overvalued to me,\u201d said Brian Hamilton, a co-founder of Sageworks, a financial analysis and valuation firm.Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Snap as a \u201cfield of dreams.\u201d Even with rosy growth forecasts, \u201cat $22 billion, we\u2019re looking at a stock trading at five to eight times estimated revenues in 2020,\u201d he said before the valuation rose even higher. \u201cThe only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba, and they have massive scale. And both of them are profitable.\u201dMajor I.P.O.s of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992.So let\u2019s be generous and ignore profit. How about revenue? Snap said it generated $404 million in sales in 2016. A valuation of $34 billion is about 84 times revenue.That\u2019s six times as high as Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio, which is 14. It\u2019s 14 times as high as Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which trades at just over six times revenue. Amazon trades at a mere three times. Even high-flying Netflix trades at seven times.Compared with Snap, however, those are mature companies, whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as they\u2019ve aged. As Mr. Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry Gold put it in a recent note to clients: \u201cThere is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all. The sky\u2019s the limit and history is not a guide.\u201dTo justify a valuation of even $25 billion, \u201cyou have to make some very lofty assumptions,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cThey would need to grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent, which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly.\u201d He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the history of American business.But let\u2019s ignore revenue, too. This is social media, after all, where \u201cdaily active users\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d are the coins of the realm.And $1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for Snap. At $34 billion, each of Snap\u2019s daily active users is worth $215, six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for Instagram.As of January, Instagram reported 300 million daily active users. At $215 each, the Instagram app alone would be valued today at $64.5 billion.These are static numbers, and what Snap is selling investors is growth. According to Snap\u2019s prospectus, Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016, about the same as the year before. If it can pull that off again next year, it would reach an impressive 234 million users, though still short of Instagram.The Snapchat story \u201cis all about growth,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about economics.\u201dBut Snapchat\u2019s growth slowed sharply in last year\u2019s fourth quarter \u2014 just about the time Instagram started its own version of Stories, a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos. It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters.By comparison, 150 million Instagram users are now using its Stories feature. That\u2019s already nearly as many as Snapchat\u2019s entire user base.Maybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user, even if its user base doesn\u2019t grow all that much. It\u2019s currently generating an average of $5.83 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebook\u2019s North American average of $12.81, the MoffettNathanson analysis notes, suggesting plenty of room to grow.But even doubling revenue doesn\u2019t get Snap close to a Facebook valuation.There are, of course, superhigh revenue and user-growth assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuation.Still, very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels (and I looked for some). The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as $30 billion. But that\u2019s based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of $3.8 billion in 2018.Mr. Gold said some investors were buying into the I.P.O., but not to hold Snap for the long term. \u201cPeople are saying they\u2019ll wait for a valuation that\u2019s truly astronomical, and then take the other side of the bet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run into trouble over the next few quarters.\u201dDespite many of its somewhat juvenile features, at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate, substituting images for language. \u201cSnapchat has built a better mousetrap,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s engaging, and it\u2019s fun, especially for young people.\u201dThat\u2019s a story that obviously appealed to investors starving for the next hot social media company. Whether they\u2019ll want to cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains to be seen.\u201cThis looks and smells like Twitter to me,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time, if ever, before they see any meaningful appreciation.\u201dAbout the best Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Gold could come up with: Snap\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t \u201cpatently crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Wherever there\u2019s a vent providing even tepid heat, homeless people often gather.When I joined the team covering Canada, I knew very little about the country and started asking editors in New York for story ideas. One suggested going to a place with an interesting name \u2014 Medicine Hat \u2014 because she had read they had a plan to end homelessness.I was intrigued, particularly when I came across articles saying they had since reached their goal. But I was naturally skeptical. Like many stories that The Times looks into, the reality was more complex than the headlines portrayed. \u201cEnding homelessness,\u201d in this case, simply meant reaching a goal set in the city\u2019s plan \u2014 connecting with homeless people within 10 days of their being identified, but not necessarily solving their problem. Plenty of homeless people turn up at shelters each night \u2014 as more than 20 did on my first night in town.What struck me most was the homeless people themselves, or people \u201cexperiencing homelessness,\u201d as social workers prefer to say, reminding us that homelessness is not an identity. All the people I spoke to were warm and funny, intelligent and articulate, despite any addictions or mental illnesses that may have led them to the street. They each had an interesting life story to tell \u2014 filled with remarkable adventures, cherished memories, loves lost and tragedy endured. They were all very much like you and me.I regret that I didn\u2019t have space to tell all of that.

{"Headline": "New Chairman at Paramount Pictures Faces an Arduous Task", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Viacom has turned to one of Hollywood\u2019s most seasoned and respected executives, James N. Gianopulos, to revive its faded Paramount Pictures operation.But some analysts worry that Paramount is already too far gone.Mr. Gianopulos, who turns 65 in April, will take over as chairman of Paramount on April 3, Viacom said on Monday. Mr. Gianopulos, the consummate Hollywood insider who is treasurer of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, previously ran 20th Century Fox.But any turnaround at Paramount is years away under the best of circumstances.Moreover, the few series that Paramount has are weakening. The last \u201cTransformers\u201d movie, released in 2014, took in 30 percent less in North America than its predecessor. (The next chapter, \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight,\u201d arrives in June.) Paramount\u2019s aging \u201cStar Trek\u201d film series hit a similar snag last year. Its \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise is anchored by Tom Cruise, and how long he can remain an action star is an open question.\u201cWe don\u2019t think Paramount has enough top-tier intellectual property to successfully dig its way out of the profitability hole it finds itself in,\u201d Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a recent report.Mr. Gianopulos worked at Paramount before. In the mid-1980s, he was the studio\u2019s senior vice president for business affairs and international operations. It was a boom time. In 1986, Paramount had five of the year\u2019s 10 top-selling films at the domestic box office, including \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d and \u201cCrocodile Dundee.\u201dBut the movie business has changed substantially. With streaming services like Amazon and Netflix as new competitors for leisure time and movie attendance in the United States flat, studios have veered toward extravagant, effects-driven films that can play on a global stage. Mr. Creutz estimated that 30 movies with budgets of $100 million or more will be released this year, seven more than in 2015.He added that Mr. Gianopulos would have \u201ca running start\u201d because of Paramount teams \u201cwho are right now exploring new ways to strengthen the studio and position it for success.\u201d A spokeswoman declined to make Mr. Bakish or Mr. Gianopulos available for interviews.Despite its challenges, Paramount retains signs of life. The studio\u2019s marketing and publicity departments are considered strong. Mr. Grey started a fledgling television production business that could grow into a profit center. And several coming movies could be hits, including \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d a science-fiction action drama set for release on Friday; and \u201cBaywatch,\u201d a raunchy adaptation of the lifeguard television series.In some ways, Mr. Gianopulos may take comfort in Paramount\u2019s long-term history: The studio has battled its way back from the brink before.In the early 1960s, hobbled by cost-cutting and the release of contract players after the forced sale of its theater chain, Paramount was nearly shuttered and sold for the real estate value of its lot. Instead, a new corporate boss, having little to lose, brought in a brash, untested producer \u2014 Robert Evans \u2014 to run the place. The result was a creative rebirth that led to seminal hits like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cChinatown.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now with the series\u2019 release approaching, Mr. Jones has found himself trying to balance his defense of the series while simultaneously promoting minority representation in Hollywood.Changing the race of a main character, as the fans had hoped, wouldn\u2019t be that unusual.As it stands, though, the change usually comes at the expense of Asian roles.The main character is the scion of a rich businessman, but his parents are killed and he is left abandoned during an expedition in the Himalayas. He\u2019s taken in by monks who raise him and train him in martial arts.Some have argued that Danny Rand must be white to convey that he\u2019s an outsider in Asia and again when he returns to the United States. But, Mr. Chow countered, if you\u2019re looking for a character who doesn\u2019t feel at home in either place, who better than an Asian-American?The idea of a white man being taken in by foreigners, learning their ways and emerging as their champion \u201cseemed new in 1973, but in 2017 it\u2019s a storytelling trope that needs updating,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have all these trappings of Orientalism on top of a white savior trope, why not upend both of those things by casting an Asian-American to play the role?\u201dMr. Jones, best known for his role as Loras Tyrell in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d has appeared sympathetic to the plight of minority actors. He started a discussion on Twitter of minority representation in Hollywood with a tweet on Sunday:The tweet linked to a speech by Riz Ahmed, an actor, at the House of Commons. But some fans found Mr. Jones to be an unwelcome commentator of representation issues, and the ensuing backlash led him to temporarily delete his Twitter account.\u201cThe characterization of Danny Rand may have remained true to its source material but our show incorporates and celebrates actors from all different backgrounds,\u201d he responded to one fan on Twitter.\u201cWith this instance in particular, what I struggle with and what frustrates me is that people are commenting on the headline without understanding the full picture, without understanding the full story,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll find with the way that we\u2019re telling this story is we\u2019re addressing the issues that people are very concerned about in a very intelligent and modern way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Moves to Overturn Obama-Era Online Privacy Rules", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byRepublicans said President Barack Obama\u2019s appointee to the F.C.C., Tom Wheeler, had created a slew of overbearing rules for broadband providers that would put them at a disadvantage relative to internet companies like Google and Netflix. Those internet companies are not regulated by the F.C.C. but are increasingly in competition with telecom companies for online streaming customers.Lawmakers and Republican regulators at the F.C.C. have said they plan to target the 2015 classification of broadband as a utilitylike service that is strapped with strong regulatory oversight. They are also set to seek the overturning of Obama-era net neutrality rules that forbade broadband providers from blocking, slowing down or charging extra for downloads of websites and apps.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve created is confusion, and this is the way to rein in an agency that was overreaching,\u201d said Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who introduced the House bill to overturn the privacy rules. She used the Congressional Review Act in a procedure that lets lawmakers scrap regulations recently created by government agencies.Ms. Blackburn said the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces privacy policies created by web companies such as Facebook and Google, was the best agency to oversee broadband privacy.\u201cThe rule departs from the technology-neutral framework for online privacy administered by the Federal Trade Commission,\u201d the Trump administration said. \u201cThis results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor.\u201dBroadband companies immediately celebrated the House vote. They promised they would honor their voluntary privacy policies, noting that violations would be subject to lawsuits.\u201cToday\u2019s vote removing another set of unnecessary regulations is a win-win for consumers and their privacy,\u201d said Jonathan Spalter, the chief executive of the broadband lobbying group USTelecom. \u201cOnline users will continue to have the consistent and strong privacy protections they require and the promise of continued innovation they expect from the internet.\u201dDemocratic lawmakers and regulators protested the vote, saying consumers had few options for high-speed internet service, which meant more government oversight of the companies was needed. Broadband providers have an expansive view into consumers\u2019 online habits, including seeing what sites and apps are visited, which can expose sensitive information.The F.C.C. rules would have given consumers greater power to stop companies from making money off such information, the Democrats said.\u201cThe rules gave individuals control over their information when it comes to privacy,\u201d Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democratic F.C.C. commissioner, said in an interview. \u201cThe proprietary information these companies have at their disposal should not only be treated with care, but consumers should have a voice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In \u201cThe Discovery,\u201d he explained: \u201cThey offer you this opportunity to move to another plane of existence. The reality, when you try to do that, is that you find that you always take yourself with you. And that\u2019s what the movie got at for me.\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\u201cThe Discovery\u201d deals with some weighty themes. What got you interested in it? The movie is a mind-bender \u2014 it takes some effort, and I really liked that. When you watch the movie for the first time, you need to be quiet for a little while and think about what you\u2019ve just seen.Did the film cause you to reflect on existence and life after death?I want to leave viewers with their own conclusions. But I think a lot of us are saddled with a feeling that I refer to as \u201cAnywhere but here.\u201d If I was only in that other city, I\u2019d be happier. If I only had that other job, I\u2019d be happier. What if you can just push the reset button and start fresh? I think the reality is, you can never escape yourself.You\u2019ve made serious films and silly ones. Which are the truer expressions of yourself?Are the cast members from \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d still a part of your life?We all text each other on our birthdays and things like that. We were on that show for nine years. We watched each other get married and have kids and go through health scares and all the things that happen over a decade. I realized at one point, this is the longest I\u2019ve known any group of people besides my family. There\u2019s something that lasts forever about that.Of all the things you\u2019ve done, does it ever seem strangest that you were on a network sitcom for nine seasons?My only experience prior to \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d was critically acclaimed failures. [laughs]You\u2019re also an author of the young adult book series \u201cNightmares!\u201d and \u201cOtherworld.\u201d Where do you find the time?I have an amazing writing partner for the books, Kirsten Miller. I live on a farm now. I moved out of L.A. when the show ended. But my brain is not great at relaxing. And so within a couple weeks, I tend to need to write something.Like an actual farm, with animals and crops that you tend to?No animals. I have an orange grove. I tend to it by pointing at stuff. We have an orchard manager. [laughs] I would like to seem more masculine than I actually am, but I don\u2019t handle any of the equipment or anything like that.When did you decide it was time to move out of Hollywood?I went to a small town to get ready for \u201cEnd of the Tour\u201d and read \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel I could do that with the distraction of the big city. In L.A., there\u2019s a real quiet \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d being whispered into your ear, constantly. All of a sudden, with that voice gone, I realized that I felt significantly better.Do you feel like you\u2019re living the dream?It\u2019s an impulse I\u2019ve always had, which is, I\u2019m going to move to the mountains, and no one\u2019s ever going to see me again.

{"Headline": "Review: Netflix Tries to Channel Its Chi With \u2018Marvel\u2019s Iron Fist\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byIs \u201cIron Fist\u201d as bad as its 14 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating would indicate? Not exactly. Through six episodes it\u2019s blandly mediocre, though it starts to perk up a little in Episodes 5 and 6. In the Netflix-original catalog, it\u2019s well ahead of \u201cFuller House\u201d and \u201cHemlock Grove.\u201dAnd there are extenuating circumstances. Netflix likes its comic-book shows on the serious side, unlike the DC Comics shows on CW, which are lightweight, somewhat fantastical entertainment.That hasn\u2019t been a problem with Marvel-Netflix heroes like Jessica Jones and Daredevil whose powers and origin stories are, in the comic-book context, relatively everyday. But Danny Rand (Finn Jones) was raised in a monastery that (spoiler alert) exists in an alternate dimension and aligns with Earth only every 15 years. \u201cIron Fist\u201d is \u201cBrigadoon\u201d with Asian monks and kung fu, and it should be silly fun. It probably would have worked better at CW.Some of the show\u2019s problems seem to stem from trying to soft-pedal this supernatural premise. Details of the origin story are introduced grudgingly and very gradually, and there are no real scenes in the magical realm of K\u2019un-Lun. Instead, we see Rand in present-day New York, where he returns and tries to regain control of his father\u2019s company.The first four episodes are largely about the barefoot, Zen-spouting Rand trying to navigate the corporate world, which could be an analogy for how uncomfortable the show seems to be with its mystical martial-arts premise. In Episode 2 a character watches Rand being interrogated and barks: \u201cAsk him where he\u2019s been the last 15 years.\u201d You sympathize with his impatience \u2014 you\u2019d like the show to stop poking around, supply those answers and move on to kicking evil\u2019s behind.That\u2019s a bandwagon I\u2019m not prepared to hop on. But you\u2019d think that the show would have avoided the casual Orientalism of its depiction of Chinatown, which begins with a lion dance and firecrackers and progresses to hatchet-wielding triads.The sad thing, and perhaps the hopeful thing, about the dawdling featurelessness of the early episodes is that you can see a better show struggling to get out. The actors \u2014 including Mr. Jones; Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing, a cage-fighting ally; and especially Tom Pelphrey as Ward Meachum, Rand\u2019s childhood frenemy \u2014 are better than the material they\u2019re given. And the testy, unusually complicated relationship between Rand and Meachum has the potential to be interesting. Until we see the full season, we won\u2019t know whether the show manages to focus its chi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Netflix, the Borders Remain Open", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAlongside its well-publicized drive to dominate original content, Netflix is quietly transforming our television experience in another, perhaps just as profound way. Already this year it has added series from Argentina, Britain, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain and Turkey to its American offerings. The United States may be tightening its borders to other countries\u2019 citizens, but for now, at least, their television shows are flooding in unmolested.Netflix has a lot of competition in this area. But it has programmed foreign series more aggressively than other general-interest streamers like Amazon and Hulu, and while smaller specialty sites may have larger offerings in Asian soap operas (\u201cDramaFever\u201d) or British dramas (AcornTV), Netflix\u2019s scale gives the shows it acquires a greater potential impact.The mission goes bad, of course, and its ugly consequences play out across 12 tense episodes. \u201cFauda\u201d is a thriller, and it includes plenty of violent action, but the battles and chases have a frighteningly casual, lived-in feeling. There are no phalanxes of black SUVs, just beaten-up vans and rattling cars carrying combatants dressed in T-shirts and sandals and bearing weapons that look like they came from the bargain bin at the gun fair.\u201cFauda\u201d is also a family drama, in a way that American thrillers can\u2019t really duplicate. The opposing sides live in such close quarters, and with so much shared history, that wives, children, cousins and girlfriends get caught up in the danger in believable ways, without the manufactured plot twists American dramas employ to put family members in jeopardy.\u201cNobel\u201d is slicker than \u201cFauda,\u201d more American-style in its production values and editing. But it has a similar seriousness of purpose and a ground-level common sense about family and organizational dynamics that American dramas \u2014 hyped-up and contrived even at their best \u2014 seldom achieve.The title is a reference to the Nobel Peace Prize, which hangs in the background of the story like a guilty conscience. The eight-episode series traces a geopolitical conspiracy that ties together oil interests, humanitarian organizations, the Norwegian government and, centrally, an elite Norwegian special-forces unit whose work in Afghanistan involves it in murder and cover-ups back home.Like \u201cFauda,\u201d \u201cNobel\u201d is about the effects of violence on a society, but from the opposite perspective: the Norwegians, smug about the peacefulness and order of their lives, are shocked by the sudden intrusion of murder and scandal. What distinguishes both shows, for viewers accustomed to American TV, is that they make political violence feel like a sad and dangerous reality rather than a heroic video-game fantasy.Advertisement"}

Tari Thomas, the superintendent of schools for a consolidated school district that includes Petersham, said the district experimented with sending older students home with online coursework to complete on laptops (although that was not the case on Tuesday, because the students had already used up the five days of online learning they were allowed for the year).\u201cThere have been a small pocket of parents that have said, \u2018Why can\u2019t kids be kids and have a snow day?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Thomas.But, Ms. Thomas added, \u201cWe\u2019ve had parents say, \u2018Oh my gosh, thank goodness you gave them something to do.\u2019\u201dIn Central Park in Manhattan, it was a different story.

Others let them go ahead, and voters navigated wind and snow to make it to the polls.\u201cWe had to instruct our voter clerks to tell the voters, please don\u2019t drip on the ballots,\u201d said Wayne Colby, the town moderator in Henniker, N.H., west of Concord.\u201cI grew up in New Hampshire,\u201d Mr. Colby said, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t have snow days for elections.\u201dThe town meeting, where voters hash out the budget or other issues related to fire and police departments, is older than the state itself. It is also a day of voting for local offices, ordinance changes or bonds.When it became clear that the day would collide with a major winter storm, some town moderators wondered if they could postpone their votes and meetings. The answer from the governor? It\u2019s not clear, but please don\u2019t.\u201cGiven that there are differing opinions, the best we can do is strongly recommend that all towns stay open for voting tomorrow,\u201d said Gov.

{"Headline": "Willing to Blow the Whistle on Doping? New Legal Aid Group Wants to Help", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byLAUSANNE, Switzerland \u2014 Inspired by the Russian doping scandal, a new nonprofit foundation is offering financial and legal assistance to whistle-blowers with information about cheating in international sports.The foundation, Fair Sport, is working with the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports, and plans to help protect and advise people who have evidence that could inform the agency\u2019s investigations as well as related government investigations into bribery, corruption or drug trafficking.Whistle-blowers approved by Fair Sport\u2019s board of directors \u2014 which includes a venture capitalist, a former United States federal prosecutor and a four-time Olympic speedskating gold medalist from Norway \u2014 will be eligible for assistance with a range of services, including housing, criminal defense, immigration applications and psychological counseling.\u201cMost of the big cases of cheating have been revealed because of whistle-blowers,\u201d said Johann Koss, the speedskating medalist and a founder of Fair Sport. \u201cBut most of the people who\u2019ve come out and talked have been totally isolated afterward.\u201dDrawing on private donations and commitments from international law firms to provide their services without fees, the organization is seeking to minimize the risk whistle-blowers face in speaking out, emphasizing confidentiality while empowering people who are jeopardizing their livelihoods and possibly incriminating themselves.Fair Sport, registered as a nonprofit organization in both the United States and Britain, hopes to raise $3 million to $5 million this year, Mr. Koss said. A majority of the money will go toward whistle-blower expenses, he said, while some is expected to be used to vet candidates before the foundation agrees to help them.Fair Sport is completing an agreement with WADA, the antidoping regulator, under which each may refer witnesses to the other. The foundation does not plan to conduct investigations itself aside from initially assessing the credibility of those it might help, Mr. Koss said; it will instead hand information over to WADA or the proper authorities.The Stepanovs and Dr. Rodchenkov have left Russia and have lived in hiding in the United States, expressing concerns about their personal safety while relying on individual donations since leaving their jobs. They have been vilified in Russia, called traitors by government officials and the state news media.\u201cThey took risks with not only their lives but also financially, and it became clear there was really no support for whistle-blowers,\u201d said Bryan Fogel, a filmmaker who financed Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s move to Los Angeles in late 2015 and produced a documentary about the Russian doping scandal, \u201cIcarus,\u201d which was acquired by Netflix this year.Jim Swartz, an American venture capitalist and a founder of Impact Partners, which produced Mr. Fogel\u2019s film, conceived of Fair Sport after seeing the risk Dr. Rodchenkov had opened himself up to in speaking out about the orders the Russian sports ministry had given him to \u201cwin at any cost.\u201dMr. Swartz recruited a group of founders, including Edwin Stier, a former chief of the criminal division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in New Jersey; Louisa Watt, a partner at the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in London; and Mr. Koss, the Olympian, who is also a social entrepreneur and a physician who has worked with the International Olympic Committee.Though many of the principal players are from North America, Mr. Stier said the foundation planned to establish relationships with investigators and lawyers throughout the world, hoping to be poised to protect informants of any nationality.\u201cPeople who come forward are going to have a lot of baggage,\u201d Mr. Stier said. \u201cThey can be heroic figures who emerge from a dark past, but we\u2019ve got to be prepared to assess who they are and how accurate their information is, and then assure them they\u2019re protected.\u201dIn addition to its collaboration with WADA, Fair Sport is also pursuing agreements with national antidoping authorities and law enforcement agencies, Mr. Koss said, hoping to refer witnesses while also soliciting referrals of credible whistle-blowers in need of assistance.Last year, as the doping scandal mounted, WADA committed to building out its investigation team, from one person to six. Five of those jobs have been filled, WADA said. Heading up the regulator\u2019s new intelligence division is G\u00fcnter Younger, a former employee of the German criminal police and Interpol.\u201cClearly people are at great risk when they come forward,\u201d said Rep. Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce committee. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to do it if they think they\u2019re just going to get blown off.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now house rentals are shrinking too with the rise of the tiny-house hotel.\u201cWhen you think about how you drew houses as a child, they look like a Tumbleweed tiny house,\u201d said Steve Weissmann, the chief executive of Tumbleweed Tiny House Company.The innate charm of the designs, coupled with the social experiment of sharing close quarters, has fueled an entire category of reality television shows and documentaries that has helped drive the growth of tiny-house inns where travelers can try out the lifestyle.

Rates start at $129.\u201cGetaway is about being in a beautiful tiny house in nature and doing as little as possible,\u201d the co-owner Jon Staff wrote in an email, explaining that keeping the specific location secret prevents renters from fully mapping their vacations in favor of allowing \u201cpeople to regain the sense of quiet and spontaneity that we seem to have lost.\u201dWith names like Isidore and Columbia, the boxy Scandinavian-influenced houses with knotty pine or plywood walls have two-burner stoves, minirefrigerators, queen beds and electric toilets (from $89).

{"Headline": "Will Dropping the LSAT Requirement Create More Miserable Lawyers?", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn my fourth year as a practicing lawyer, in an earnest attempt to persuade a starry-eyed student who\u2019d just been admitted to law school to save himself, I warned him: Going to law school was one of my biggest regrets, ranking right up there with the time I accidentally bought low-fat Brie.I was stuck inside with that sad slab of cheese for all of Snowmageddon 2010.The move might succeed in expanding the pool of applicants. But here\u2019s what it won\u2019t do: increase the number of people in law school who actually want to be lawyers.See, the LSAT is a speed bump with potential to separate those who truly want to be lawyers \u2014 the ones who thrive doing logic games in the same way they\u2019ll relish adding Bluebook-style footnotes to briefs and motions in years to come \u2014 from those who just aren\u2019t sure what else to do with their lives.I practiced at a firm for seven years. Lawyers are notoriously dissatisfied and depressed, but I had an unusually positive experience. Even so, I eventually quit, to pursue the TV writing career I\u2019d always wanted.But not before spending \u2014 some would say wasting \u2014 10 years and six figures to get there.The LSAT was rough. The logic games that make up its most infamous section are real killers, and my name, which means \u201clogical\u201d in Arabic, failed to give me any sort of edge. Studying was grueling, repetitive and at times mind-numbingly boring, adjectives that happen to have quite a bit of overlap with the way some lawyers would describe their jobs.To be fair, some people truly savor the privilege of being a member of the bar. They proudly tack on \u201cEsquire\u201d at the end of their names when introducing themselves at parties or asking to speak with a restaurant manager.But that\u2019s not most lawyers. For many I\u2019ve met, pursuing a law degree was simply the path of least resistance. (This is anecdotal. I don\u2019t have the statistics because I\u2019m not a math person \u2014 another reason I took the LSAT, not the G.R.E.) The end of the LSAT requirement could make defaulting to this option even more convenient.The test is to the desire to become a lawyer as a dating service with 2,000 personal questions and a registration fee is to the desire for a relationship. It\u2019s easier to swipe aimlessly on your phone while binging on Netflix at 2 a.m., but if swiping is all you\u2019re willing to do, that might tell you something about what you actually want.And remember, studying for the LSAT creates a lot of angst \u2014 but so will being a lawyer, if being a lawyer isn\u2019t for you.You may avoid taking the test, but believe me, you don\u2019t want to end up talking about the decision to start a legal career, the same way you talk about the time you accidentally bought low-fat Brie.An opinion essay on last Sunday about the LSAT misidentified the law school at the University of Arizona.

In \u201cIngobernable,\u201d the goings-on are less, well, explosive but still result in a change at the top.What can be said is that the series focuses not so much on the man who is president when it begins, Diego Nava (Erik Hayser), but on the first lady, Emilia Urquiza (Kate del Castillo). Before the premiere is half over, she finds herself on the run, a suspect in the nation-shattering event that has just transpired.The series puts quite a lot of faith in that flight, assuming we\u2019ll find it captivating even though we\u2019ve learned very little about Emilia or why she\u2019s running. You keep waiting for the show to break away from its propulsive introduction and go into a flashback that shows how the first couple, apparently once the nation\u2019s darlings, got to the vitriolic point that we see at the start, in which Emilia hopes Diego will sign divorce papers.And eventually there are some flashbacks, though they\u2019re brief and coy. This series doles out its secrets slowly. It also is in no hurry to bring on the side plots that American political dramas love so much. You have to wait until Episode 3 before the cast of characters begins to branch out.Ms. del Castillo, though, isn\u2019t given much to do early on other than look furtive, so viewers less familiar with her will need to bring some patience to this series (which includes English subtitles). Only by the third episode does it begin to demonstrate that it aspires to be something more than just a woman-in-jeopardy thriller.

Companies make a lot of money from our data, and we have very little say in how it\u2019s used.Weigend argues persuasively that in this \u201cpost-privacy\u201d world, we should give our data freely, but that we should expect certain protections in return. He advocates a set of rights to increase data refineries\u2019 transparency and to increase our own agency in how information is used. Companies like OkCupid, WeChat and Spotify should perform data safety audits, submit to privacy ratings and calculate a score based on the benefits they provide \u2014 a sort of credit score for the companies that mine our data. Meanwhile, we should have the right to amend, blur and import or export our own data into any system we please.Not everyone believes that our information should be freely available as long as we agree to the terms of use. In \u201cThe Art of Invisibility,\u201d the internet security expert Kevin Mitnick advocates the opposite. Mitnick notes various reasons we may want to hide our data: We\u2019re wary of the government; we don\u2019t want businesses intruding into our lives; we have a mistress; we are the mistress; we\u2019re a criminal. Mitnick, who served five years in prison for hacking into corporate networks and stealing software, offers a sobering reminder of how our raw data \u2014 from email, cars, home Wi-Fi networks and so on \u2014 makes us vulnerable. He describes basic privacy protections (using a strong password, avoiding public computers) along with more advanced techniques (encrypting files on a hard drive, using a VPN and Bitcoin for online purchases). Most will seem familiar and perhaps rudimentary to those with any technical savvy. For everyone else, he offers an uncomfortable view of how data can be exploited.Both books are meant to scare us, and the central theme is privacy: Without intervention, they suggest, we\u2019ll come to regret today\u2019s inaction. I agree, but the authors miss the real horror show on the horizon. The future\u2019s fundamental infrastructure is being built by computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and security experts just like Weigend and Mitnick, who do not recognize their own biases. This encodes an urgent flaw in the foundation itself. The next layer will be just a little off, along with the next one and the one after that, as the problems compound.Right now, humans and machines engage in \u201csupervised learning.\u201d Experts \u201cteach\u201d the system by labeling an initial data set; once the computer reaches basic proficiency, they let it try sorting data on its own. If the system makes an error, the experts correct it. Eventually, this process yields highly sophisticated algorithms capable of refining and using our personal data for a variety of purposes: automatically sorting spam out of your inbox, say, or recommending a show you\u2019ll like on Netflix. Then, building on this foundation of data and algorithms, more teaching and learning takes place.But human bias creeps into computerized algorithms in disconcerting ways. In 2015, Google\u2019s photo app mistook a black software developer for a gorilla in photos he uploaded. In 2016, the Microsoft chatbot Tay went on a homophobic, anti-Semitic rampage after just one day of interactions on Twitter. Months later, reporters at ProPublica uncovered how algorithms in police software discriminate against black people while mislabeling white criminals as \u201clow risk.\u201d Recently when I searched \u201cC.E.O.\u201d on Google Images, the first woman listed was C.E.O. Barbie.Data scientists aren\u2019t inherently racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. But they are human, and they harbor unconscious biases just as we all do. This comes through in both books. In Mitnick\u2019s, women appear primarily in anecdotes and always as unwitting, jealous or angry. Near the end, Mitnick describes trying to enter Canada from Michigan, and wonders if he\u2019s stopped \u201cbecause a Middle Eastern guy with only a green card was driving.\u201d (He might be right, but he doesn\u2019t allow for the possibility that his own criminal record could also be responsible.)Weigend\u2019s book is meticulously researched, yet nearly all the experts he quotes are men. Early on he tells the story of Latanya Sweeney, who in the 1990s produced a now famous study of anonymized public health data in Massachusetts. She proved that the data could be traced back to individuals, including the governor himself. But Sweeney is far better known for something Weigend never mentions: She\u2019s the Harvard professor who discovered that \u2014 because of her black-sounding name \u2014 she was appearing in Google ads for criminal records and background checks. Weigend could have cited her to address bias in the second of his six rights, involving the integrity of a refinery\u2019s social data ecosystem. But he neglects to discuss the well-documented sexism, racism, xenophobia and homophobia in the machine-learning infrastructure.The omission of women and people of color from something as benign as book research illustrates the real challenge of unconscious bias in data and algorithms. Weigend and Mitnick rely only on what\u2019s immediate and familiar \u2014 an unfortunately common practice in the data community. University computer science, math and physics departments lack diversity in staff and coursework. Corporate data science is homogeneous. So are professional and academic conferences, where the future of data is discussed. If the people mining and processing our data are nothing like us, and if the machines learn only from them, our data can yield only warped caricatures, like the zombies you see on TV.As a futurist, I try to figure out how your data will someday power things like artificially intelligent cars, computer-assisted doctors and robot security agents. That\u2019s why I found both books concerning. Think of all the characteristics that make up who you are: how much coffee you drink, how fast you drive, how often you open your refrigerator, your respiratory rate, what slang you use, the random strangers you\u2019ve friended on Facebook. You may look like Weigend and Mitnick and therefore may not have experienced algorithmic discrimination yet. You, too, should be afraid. We\u2019ve only recently struck oil.Amy Webb, chief executive of the Future Today Institute, is the author of \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In New York, Bringing Broadband to Everyone by 2018", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byHALCOTT, N.Y. \u2014 It\u2019s about 15 miles from here to a dairy testing facility in Roxbury, or about one hour and 20 minutes round trip if you know these dusty mountain back roads like Chris DiBenedetto, a dairy farmer. He has been going back and forth for years, ferrying a sample of fresh milk for a federally mandated drug test before he can start processing each batch.But what stressed him the most were the valuable daylight farming hours lost to the journey, while he was stuck in his car or waiting for the results.Now, Mr. DiBenedetto gives a sample to a driver heading that way to do the drop-off, letting the new fiber wiring hanging over his old route do the simple document delivery for him via email.The dairy farmer in this speck of a town about 140 miles north of New York City was one of the first beneficiaries of an ambitious initiative to extend broadband to every household in the state by 2018 \u2014 no matter how rural or far-flung the address \u2014 which would make New York the first state to reach that high-speed internet milestone.For years, this town was like many isolated spots in New York and across the country, left sitting on the shoulders of the digital highway unable to access the broadband speeds that so many businesses and households count on. But now under a state-led program, towns like Halcott, with fewer than 300 residents, are getting wired, giving residents faster access to the internet and opening new opportunities for businesses.Two Stones Farm, a small goat farm here, has created an online store to offer more products, including artisanal cheese. \u201cI look at it this way: It\u2019s very much like electricity was at one time,\u201d said Alan White, 54, who owns Two Stones Farm with his wife. \u201cElectricity would have never come to our valley if it was based strictly on population. It\u2019s not a luxury. It\u2019s a necessity that we need to operate.\u201dThe problem is worse in poorer and rural areas: At least 30 percent of people in Mississippi and Arkansas do not have access to broadband, and sparsely populated states like Montana have similar access rates.The challenge in the United States is that it has vast tracts of sparsely populated regions where the cost of laying new fiber and cable wiring for broadband significantly outweighs the profits \u2014 39 percent of Americans living in rural areas lack broadband access, compared with 4 percent of those living in cities, according to the F.C.C.Under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s \u201cBroadband for All\u201d initiative, New York\u2019s program is one of the most aggressive broadband expansions in the country, and is designed to help stem any losses a private company incurs through what is known as a reverse auction process.Using data from the Federal Communications Commission to identify both unserved and underserved areas, the program divides the state into census blocks. The state then auctions off grant money for each census block, awarding the financing to the private company that seeks the lowest state subsidy.The system has attracted different providers, including major telecommunication companies like Fairpoint and Frontier, as well as smaller utilities like Middleburgh Telephone Company, known as Midtel, and Margaretville Telephone Company.Along the two-lane roads winding through Delaware County in the Catskills, Midtel trucks are following a path similar to one they took years ago, threading fiber optic cables for broadband across the valley.\u201cAll the served, underserved and unserved areas don\u2019t end up in a nice row,\u201d said Jim Becker, the president of the company, which has existed for more than a century and is still overseen by his 94-year-old grandmother, Marge Becker. \u201cSometimes you have to build through somewhat of a served area to get to an unserved, and vice versa.\u201dTurning on broadband can transform lives in rural places.Here in Halcott, a hamlet in the Catskills, the broadband has allowed Mr. DiBenedetto to broaden his business online \u2014 a yogurt company in Brooklyn recently contacted him about a single source contract. His daughter, Elena, was able to help out on the farm while getting a master\u2019s degree online.\u201cIn today\u2019s technology-driven world, access to high-speed internet is essential to building strong communities, growing the economy and supporting our everyday lives,\u201d Governor Cuomo said. \u201cNew York is leading the nation with the largest state broadband investment program in history \u2014 ensuring high-speed internet access for all residents, especially those in rural areas, and empowering students, entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive in our global economy.\u201dUnder New York\u2019s program, providers must offer 100 mbps speed \u2014 fast enough to download a movie in high definition in 90 seconds \u2014 for $60 a month. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the F.C.C., acknowledging that it was a reasonable price given that prices elsewhere could be much higher. \u201cBut if you\u2019re really poor, can you afford it? I don\u2019t know. If you are a poor rural person living in Appalachia, that\u2019s a big bite out of your budget.\u201dBut many rural businesses in New York have jumped at the chance for faster internet.About an hour from Halcott lies the Beaverkill Valley Inn, a historic hotel sitting on the banks of the Beaver Kill river, a world-famous fly-fishing spot in Lew Beach, N.Y. There\u2019s no cellphone service, so for years the inn and its guests shared a satellite internet connection.\u201cWe were competing with our guests\u2019 need and our own need to do business,\u201d said Kathy Bryant, one of the inn\u2019s managers. She noted that despite a sprawling property well suited for corporate retreats and meetings, the inn was unable to attract such business because of its limited internet.After years of pleading with local officials and telecommunications providers for a broadband connection, the inn was connected to high-speed internet by the Margaretville Telephone Company last August. Today, flush with retreats, weddings and guests spending an extra day or so \u201cworking from home,\u201d the inn just had the most successful year in its 120-year history.\u201cNow, we just reassure them that they can still unplug while they\u2019re up here,\u201d Ms. Bryant said with a laugh.Advertisement"}

In advertising, in movies, even on smartphones.But there is one problem: Americans are having less sex.From the early 1990s into the early 2000s, Americans generally had sex from about 60 to 65 times a year, according to the study. But after 2002, Americans appeared to lose interest. While the decline has been nearly across the board, one group seems to be pulling everyone else down: married couples.Married couples generally have sex more often than single people, but that advantage is declining. Married couples had sex an average of 56 times a year in 2014, down from 67 in 1989. But more people are staying single \u2014 meaning there is less sex \u2014 and the couples who do walk down the aisle are making fewer trips into the bedroom.The report highlighted several cultural changes in recent years that could have contributed to the decline. Americans have far more options these days for different kinds of pleasure \u2014 like browsing Facebook and social media, playing video games or watching Netflix.Still, there is no clear reason for the decline, but the report did rule out two possibilities: longer hours at work and pornography. Americans work longer days, but a busy work life was actually connected with higher sexual frequency. The consumption of pornography, which is now more accessible than ever before, was also tied with a busier sex life.Despite all the declines, one age group showed no interest in slowing down: people over 70. They had sex nearly 11 times during 2014, up from an average of 9.6 times in 1989.Advertisement"}

Laughter changes pacing, meaning and tone, and in part because of its use as a social signal, it can assist or even save a joke.He may have just thought this joke was really funny, which, told by him, it was. But his jokes are carefully worked out, and that laugh also served a purpose: To make it clear that he\u2019s being ridiculous, to blunt the edge of a harsh joke by sending a signal to the crowd. Even if he didn\u2019t intend the laugh, it could have also been the instinctive move of a crafty professional.Such ingratiating laughs are even more common on late-night TV. I compared the monologues from talk-show hosts on network television to the stand-up specials released on Netflix over the past few months, and found that one of the biggest differences is in the amount of performer laughter. In their specials, stand-ups mostly keep a straight face, presenting jokes the way an actor performs a part, while hosts like Jimmy Fallon and James Corden are generally easy laughs, cracking up at even the most innocuous stories by famous guests.Late-night hosts laugh to connect with their audience, but Mr. Trump appealed to his audience through a different route.

She assembles a diverse cast of characters and through them we see it all: the ravages of war; the social climbing of drug-traffickers; the complicated relationships between the well-intentioned rich and the poor who serve them; the abducted who spend years as captives of a peasant Marxist movement that uses children as soldiers; the feeling of displacement and deracination among young Colombians who grow up in the United States and are now bicultural and Latino, and are still obsessed by and conflicted about their country of birth. Colombia is fertile land these days if you\u2019re searching for writing material \u2014 think of Netflix\u2019s \u201cNarcos.\u201d\u201cThe Lucky Ones\u201d is presented as a novel, but it feels more like a collection of interconnected stories. A few are set in New York and in Cali (Colombia\u2019s third-largest city, where the author grew up), but others take place in the part of Colombia that is mostly jungle, in the canopied camps of rogue armed groups. Pachico takes us on an enjoyable and freaky joy ride. We travel from the monkey bars in the yard of an expensive private school to the dire playgrounds of displaced children living in the city\u2019s slums. We go from a drug lord\u2019s Xanadu to streets right out of \u201cMad Max\u201d; from 20-day marches in the jungle with daily activities like Spiderweb Inspection and Toucan Watching to scoring cocaine in a parking lot in Queens with a spoiled cale\u00f1ita \u2014 a young woman from Cali.Pachico\u2019s characters are all seductive, but what really drew me in is her ability to describe emotions. The book opens inside the privileged house of Stephanie Lansky, saying goodbye to her parents. She can\u2019t wait to spend the weekend on her own. By Page 5, the teenager\u2019s idea of the perfect plan turns into a horror film when a stranger rings the doorbell. She knows that he could be there to yank her away.Pachico conveys the fear that Colombian children grow up with \u2014 she made that pit in my stomach open up again. Next, she takes us deep into the jungle and inside the head of a kidnapped American teacher who, to control impending madness, resorts to teaching \u201cHamlet\u201d to a class of twigs and rocks. Then, it\u2019s a love story between two outsiders in Stephanie\u2019s elite school, a scholarship boy and the chubby daughter of a drug kingpin who keeps a lion in his backyard. We then endure a chapter in which descendants of the girl\u2019s coke-addicted pet rabbits start speaking to one another. Give in to them \u2014 at the end you\u2019ll come out of this ride with a better understanding of Colombia\u2019s surreal state of affairs.Pachico provides a new view of one of the most protracted wars in the Western Hemisphere. Fifty years ago, \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u201d defined Colombia. Today, it\u2019s Macondo mixed in with Pablo Escobar\u2019s Medell\u00edn. In the last 20 years, memoir took over Colombia\u2019s storytelling, and Pachico has made full use of it. She acknowledges a handful of books, one of them mine, and I found myself reading about my own childhood game (candy supposedly falling from the sky) played by one of her characters.I welcome Pachico\u2019s voice into the club. She has combined her memories and our accounts to create a millennial\u2019s view (not a criticism!) of the complexities of Colombia, full of existential angst and funny details. This one got me laughing: Stephanie\u2019s smile filled with bits of corn that \u201chang down from her upper molars like vines for Tarzan.\u201d Or when she decides to call the men who can come to take her away from her Disney-decorated bubble \u201ccheese sandwich rebels.\u201d Or when the kidnapped gringo recalls being told that going to Colombia is \u201cspecial like a girlfriend you know you shouldn\u2019t be with.\u201dGo to Pachico\u2019s Colombia. The book is fragmented, just like the puzzle of the map of Colombia kept by the cale\u00f1ita, a member of the monkey-bar posse who left for the United States as a child and in her 20s still keeps an orange suitcase filled with memorabilia. When she is too homesick \u2014 and too high \u2014 she throws the puzzle on the floor. She sits there trying to make the pieces fit, but like Colombia, they never do.Silvana Paternostro is the author of \u201cMy Colombian War: A Journey Through the Country I Left Behind.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Penis Seat\u2019 Causes Double Takes on Mexico City Subway", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byA seat in a subway car in Mexico City\u2019s metro system caused a stir earlier this year. There were awkward glances. Visible discomfort. Baffled looks. Some laughs. And of course, the inevitable pictures from passengers\u2019 camera phones.It was meant to be provocative, and it was. A seat was changed to look like the lower half of a male\u2019s body, including the penis, part of a campaign by UN Women and the Mexico City government to raise awareness about sexual harassment on subways.On the floor beneath the seat, there was a sign reading, \u201cIt is annoying to travel this way, but not compared to the sexual violence women suffer in their daily commutes.\u201dUN Women and the Mexican government collaborated on a second video as well, which has also begun picking up traffic. It is called \u201cExperimento Pantallas\u201d \u2014 or \u201cexperiment screens.\u201dThat experiment involved installing cameras that would take tight shots of male buttocks and display them on screens for all to see. In the video, a number of men are shown expressing disgust and embarrassment.\u201cWe wanted to do something different,\u201d said a Yeliz Osman, a program coordinator with the Mexican UN Women office. \u201cWe wanted to target men because on a global level, the majority of programs talking about sexual violence or sexual harassment always target women and girls. We wanted to change that because we don\u2019t think that women are the problem.\u201dThe campaign is called #NoEsDeHombres (a rough translation would be \u201cthis isn\u2019t manly\u201d), and it is aimed at men, both with the video ads and with newly unveiled print ones that show guys giving lascivious looks with slogans like \u201cthis is how your mother gets looked at every day.\u201d\u201cWe need to make clear that this is violent, not flattering, and incentivize men to intervene if they witness it\u201d, said Ana G\u00fcemez, director of the Mexican UN Women office, during the presentation of the campaign this Thursday.According to a national survey done in 2016 by the Mexican Institute of Women, Inmujeres, nine out of 10 women or girls who use public transportation feel unsafe while doing it. A wide-ranging Reuters survey done in 2014 also showed that the Mexico City transport system is the second-most dangerous for women overall out of 15 world capitals. However, Mexico City was squarely in first place for specific questions like \u201chave your been verbally harassed?\u201d or \u201chave you been groped?\u201c\u201cIn order to generate change, you need to create empathy,\u201d Ms. Osman said. \u201cThe idea is that men can get a sense of what it is all like. By creating empathy, we hope that this might change their behavior.\u201dMs. De Anda was one of several Mexican public figures who participated in the presentation of the #NoEsDeHombres campaign, alongside the wrestler El Hijo del Santo and the actor Alfonso Herrera, familiar to United States audiences from Netflix\u2019s show, \u201cSense8.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Millyard Transitions From Textiles to Tech", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 The 19th-century brick mill buildings lining the Merrimack River in this city of 110,000 seem an unlikely choice for the headquarters of Dyn, an internet performance company whose clients include Twitter, Netflix and Zappos.Kyle York, Dyn\u2019s chief strategy officer, is from New Hampshire but moved to San Diego after college. His California friends thought he was crazy when he returned home in 2008 to help his high school friend Jeremy Hitchcock, then Dyn\u2019s chief executive, expand the start-up.\u201cEverybody said, \u2018You\u2019ll never build a tech company there,\u2019\u201d Mr. York said.The revitalized mill district is gaining a wider reputation as a fertile ecosystem for technology firms. Buildings that were once filled with upward of 10,000 workers toiling over mechanical looms and other machinery are now home to at least 30 tech company offices, including Texas Instruments and Autodesk, along with professional offices, college classrooms and a smattering of restaurants. The concentrated activity is attracting apartment and hotel developers, who are beginning to build within the millyard and just outside it in the city\u2019s downtown.The millyard makes good strategic sense as the location for ARMI, Mr. Kamen said, because if you draw a line between the major research institutions at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, N.H., and Harvard and M.I.T., in Cambridge, Mass., \u201cwe\u2019re sitting right in the middle.\u201dOriginally from Long Island, Mr. Kamen has been a champion of the millyard since he began buying up and rehabilitating vacant factory buildings in the early 1980s. At that time, \u201cthere were tumbleweeds running through there,\u201d Theodore Gatsas, the Manchester mayor, recalled. \u201cKamen made an investment down there when a lot of other people wouldn\u2019t.\u201dThe city has helped by loosening use restrictions to encourage revitalization, Mr. Gatsas said, but most investment in the area has come from the private sector. Recently, three mill buildings, including the one occupied by Dyn, were purchased from a longtime owner for a reported $11.2 million by Bill Binnie, the president of Carlisle Capital Corporation, in Portsmouth, N.H.The factories\u2019 vast interiors, located about 50 minutes from Boston just off Interstate 93, make for pleasant work environments, with wood floors, exposed brick and granite, lofty ceilings and large windows. Asking rents are competitive, at $14 to $16 per square foot, and few large blocks of space remain, according to Daniel Scanlon, a senior associate with Colliers International.Mr. Kamen estimates he owns close to one million square feet of mill space (about a third of the total), including DEKA\u2019s headquarters and, in the building next door, the future three-story home of ARMI.To free up that space, Mr. Kamen negotiated its purchase from the University of New Hampshire, which maintained a commuter campus there. He then leased to the university 120,000 square feet at another mill building just up the road. As a partner in ARMI, the university will direct the nationwide education and work force development plan needed to get it off the ground, said Michael Decelle, the dean of the Manchester campus.Aligning itself with the millyard\u2019s high-tech focus, the campus has strengthened its offerings in science, technology, engineering and math, including a new biotechnology major, and added state-of-the-art laboratory facilities in its new location. Many students walk to internships at tech firms and medical facilities nearby.A potential hurdle for continued growth of the dense district is the need for more parking. The millyard\u2019s existing spaces are maxed out, and the city has been reluctant to invest public dollars in a parking garage without upfront guarantees that the spaces will generate cash flow, Mr. Scanlon said.A planned 106-room Tru hotel, a midlevel Hilton brand, to be built on a former city-owned surface lot in the heart of the millyard, will receive a $750,000 city subsidy toward construction of an on-site garage to replace the lost spaces and add about 50 more. The $25 million project, scheduled for completion in 2018, will include 10,000 square feet of retail.\u201cThe millyard needs to very carefully look at finding a way to unearth every new parking space they can without overinvesting,\u201d said Peter Flotz, the hotel developer and the managing member of the Lansing Melbourne Group. More residential development will help ease the demand, he said.Those projects are slowly taking shape. More than 500 rental units, including lofts and micro apartments, have been added in and around the mill district in the last few years, according to city economic development officials. Mr. Kamen said he hoped to see residential development speed up as the millyard added jobs.T. J. Parker, a co-founder of PillPack, a mail-order pharmacy that prepackages customers\u2019 prescribed daily doses, said that he would like to see more parking and amenities in the millyard, but that he had no regrets about locating his start-up here in 2013. PillPack now has customers in every state but Hawaii, and has expanded its millyard operation from an initial 1,600 square feet to 88,000, or nearly an entire factory floor.A New Hampshire native, Mr. Parker nurtured the business in an accelerator in Boston before moving it to the millyard. Real estate and staffing costs were both more daunting in the Boston market, he said. (He lives just outside Boston, in Somerville.) And the millyard, as the base for Mr. Kamen\u2019s company, held a special allure.\u201cDean Kamen was the prototypical hero when I was a kid,\u201d said Mr. Parker, who grew up in Concord. \u201cI stayed home from school the day he announced the Segway.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Julie Andrews and Henson Puppets", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byOn a wintry morning last month, Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton breezed into the Jim Henson Company\u2019s Creature Shop in Queens, where they warmly greeted puppets hanging limply from a stand.\u201cWhy, hello there!\u201d said Ms. Andrews, 81, hailing the foam and fabric creations as if they were close friends.Ms. Andrews quickly apologized. \u201cI just wanted to lift his feathers up a bit,\u201d she said.The difference now? She helped bring these latest puppets into existence. Besides starring in \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d Ms. Andrews helped create, write and produce the show with Ms. Hamilton and Judy Rothman Rof\u00e9, an Emmy-winning writer on \u201cMadeline\u201d and other kids\u2019 programs. On the show, she plays Ms. Julie, who teaches a performing arts class to five puppet pupils. Over the debut season\u2019s 13 episodes, Ms. Julie and celebrity guests (including Alec Baldwin, Idina Menzel, Josh Groban, Carol Burnett and David Hyde Pierce) inspire the eager young thespians to create and perform an original musical.Both mother and daughter want the show to champion the vital role they see the performing arts play in teaching children critical thinking, empathy, tolerance and communication skills. \u201cIt\u2019s the bridge across all countries,\u201d Ms. Andrews said, referring to drama, dance and music. \u201cThe hardest part for us with the show was not to get preachy but also to make it wildly entertaining.\u201dMs. Andrews is keenly aware that her new show is entering a rapidly changing children\u2019s television world. The traditional major networks and even the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon are losing young viewers to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, which are plumping up their kids\u2019 programming with ever more offerings. Netflix currently streams more than 40 of its own children\u2019s shows, including \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events\u201d and \u201cTrollhunters,\u201d while Amazon offers 15 originals, such as \u201cAnnedroids\u201d and \u201cTumble Leaf.\u201d And HBO, which streams via HBO Go and HBO Now, cut a deal a year ago to air new episodes of \u201cSesame Street\u201d nine months before they appear on PBS.\u201cWhen I was growing up, I watched \u2018The Smurfs\u2019 on Saturday morning,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst specializing in technology and media at BTIG Research, referring to the NBC cartoon show from the 1980s. \u201cThat was the definition of kids\u2019 TV. Kids today don\u2019t even think about turning on the TV networks or cable on Saturday. They want it on demand, and that\u2019s how they\u2019re used to getting it.\u201dFor the streaming services, in particular, their treasure trove of data clearly show what their viewers crave: According to Netflix, more than half of its 93 million members in nearly 200 countries, for example, regularly watch its children\u2019s shows.\u201cChildren\u2019s content is important, because it\u2019s our first opportunity to build brand love for Netflix that we hope will last a lifetime,\u201d said Andy Yeatman, director of global kids content at Netflix.The real targets, of course, are parents who pay the subscription fees. \u201cKids\u2019 content gives the household a reason to subscribe, because kids watch every single day,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said.Following their schmooze with the puppets, Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton discussed the birthing process for their show over scones and coffee in a conference room at the Creature Shop. The women have an easy rapport, built up not only as mother and daughter but also as the co-authors of more than 30 popular children\u2019s books, including the \u201cDumpy the Dump Truck\u201d and \u201cThe Very Fairy Princess\u201d series. (Ms. Andrews has four other children, including two stepchildren, as well as 10 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.)After the Henson Company approached Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton with the show\u2019s concept, the project was shopped to Netflix in late 2015; Mr. Yeatman and his team quickly said yes. \u201cOne of the things that attracted us was not so much that Julie was attached, but that this was a topic she cared a lot about: building a love for the performing arts in kids,\u201d Mr. Yeatman said.Then the real work started. Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton, together with Ms. Rof\u00e9, spent a week last winter mapping out the show\u2019s narrative arc and writing the pilot episode at the actress\u2019s home in Sag Harbor, N.Y. The peripatetic Ms. Andrews, a widow since the death in 2010 of the director Blake Edwards, now considers Sag Harbor, a former whaling village (where Ms. Hamilton also lives), her primary residence.Next came the creation and building of the show\u2019s seven puppet characters (which include a dog and Hugo the duck). Ms. Julie\u2019s five pupils are a true rainbow coalition, including one who is in a wheelchair and another who is seemingly gender neutral. \u201cThat\u2019s Riley; she loves all the technical backstage stuff,\u201d Ms. Andrews said, pointing to an androgynous puppet sporting shortish red hair and round glasses. \u201cShe\u2019s a girl.\u201dMs. Hamilton, 54, an actress turned writer and arts educator, chimed in. \u201cIf pressed, we\u2019d say that she\u2019s a girl, but maybe not forever,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be as diverse as possible.\u201dMs. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton weighed in extensively when the puppets were being designed and built at the Creature Shop. They helped choose hair color and texture, outfits, even nose shapes.\u201cMom, remember the 17 different fabric swatches we went through for Peri\u2019s skirt?\u201d Ms. Hamilton asked, referring to the diva-in-training puppet.\u201cYes!\u201d Ms. Andrews replied. \u201cWe wanted it as icing pink as possible.\u201dThe women also sat in on final casting sessions to pick an actor to play Gus, Ms. Julie\u2019s (human) assistant. Giullian Yao Gioiello (\u201cThe Carrie Diaries\u201d) won the role after strumming his guitar and demonstrating his human-beat-box prowess.\u201cI was a bit in awe when I first walked in,\u201d he said of meeting Ms. Andrews. But after spending six weeks of nearly 15-hour days shooting the series at Grumman Studios in Bethpage, N.Y., he came to regard his energetic co-star as his honorary grandmother. \u201cShe\u2019d share stories and get me her favorite tea, a British brand called PG Tips.\u201d The biggest surprise? \u201cThat Julie Andrews at the end of the day wants a martini.\u201dMs. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton also lined up many of the show\u2019s celebrity guest stars.In the first episode, Ms. Menzel introduces the pupils to Broadway musicals. Ms. Julie informs them that Ms. Menzel was the voice of Elsa in Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen,\u201d a credit sure to impress young viewers more than her Broadway credits from \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cRent.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t say no to Julie Andrews,\u201d Ms. Menzel said.After working with her on \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d Ms. Menzel said, she\u2019s especially impressed by the veteran star\u2019s polite perfectionism. \u201cWe would rewrite things on the spot to make them better. She doesn\u2019t settle. She wanted to get things right, but she did it with grace.\u201dSeveral of the guest stars sing with Ms. Andrews, warbling original songs. Following a botched surgery on her vocal cords 20 years ago, her once four-octave range is now reduced to one. These days, she speak-sings. \u201cI touch what notes I can and say the others,\u201d Ms. Andrews said. \u201cI have about three or four good bass notes left. I could sing you a terrific version of \u2018Old Man River.\u2019\u201dMs. Andrews said she despaired, post-surgery, because her whole identity \u201cwas being able to sing and the joy of it.\u201d She eventually realized \u2014 \u201cIt was a great lifesaver\u201d \u2014 that there were other ways to incorporate music into her life.Ms. Hamilton nodded. \u201cIn this show, Mom was very hands-on with the songs and the underscoring,\u201d she said.Ms. Andrews added, \u201cThe arrangements, the scoring \u2014 it\u2019s something I\u2019m so passionate about.\u201dMs. Julie joins in, picking up a china teacup and rhythmically whacking at it with a spoon.The action was unscripted. \u201cWho better than an English mum to pick up a teacup and start banging away?\u201d Ms. Andrews said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s serendipity.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with an article about the new show \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d using information from Netflix, misstated the names of several puppets in the show. They are Riley, Spike, and Peri \u2014 not Yomo, Bingo and Nimble.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Netflix Specials, Dave Chappelle Challenges His Audience", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byOn ComedyIt was probably inevitable that Dave Chappelle would do the most provocative comedy on Bill Cosby.They both lean heavily on giddily funny stories, self-referential bits about previous shows going badly wrong and some explosively silly sex jokes. There\u2019s no mention of President Trump, but an imagined movie pitch about a superhero who fights Mexicans might be an allusion. Mr. Chappelle also compares himself to peers, flashing jealousy over the success of Kevin Hart and throwing a jab at Key & Peele for \u201cdoing my show\u201d as well as performing a pretty fantastic impression of Katt Williams.In \u201cSpin,\u201d Mr. Chappelle builds sweeping historical premises that position him as an elder statesman. \u201cI\u2019m from a different time,\u201d he says, before describing how jarring it was to watch the 1986 Challenger space shuttle explode live on television while in school. Sharing that disaster together was a touchstone for many of his generation. Singling out a kid in the audience, he says: \u201cFor your generation, the space shuttle blows up every day.\u201dHis point seemed to be that communal tragedy and anger have become part of a steady diet in our social media feeds. The result is that people stop caring, retreating to their phones. Mr. Chappelle may criticize the younger generation, but he stops short of anything approaching a lecture, always far more comfortable skewering his own insecurities and irresponsibility.The special is cleverly organized around stories of the four times he met O. J. Simpson, first when he was a teenage comic and Mr. Simpson was a beloved sports star, and finally after he left his show and Mr. Simpson was the protagonist of the trial of the century. Whereas the brilliant documentary \u201cO. J.: Made in America\u201d traces a history of race relations through that football player\u2019s life, Mr. Chappelle locates his own fears through those mundane encounters with Mr. Simpson.\u201cSpin\u201d was shot in Los Angeles and has a Hollywood vibe, with a Morgan Freeman voice-over in the opening scene, then a helicopter shot and an entrance filled with smoke and loud music. Dressed in white sneakers and a jacket with his name on the front, Mr. Chappelle looks like a star. \u201cDeep in the Heart,\u201d shot in Austin, Tex., has a slightly more down-to-earth style, with Mr. Chappelle, in denim, spending a large part of the show seated near the stage, smoking.That material appears to be older, with references to the Ray Rice, Paula Deen and Donald Sterling scandals. Some of his provocations, like a paranoid riff on vaccinations, seem less than fully formed; and the show loses its comic zest in some of his fogyish umbrage over sensitivity to transgender people. But he does throw out some bar-stool arguments that work nicely as jokes. \u201cI don\u2019t think men should be gynecologists,\u201d he said, calling it \u201ca conflict of interest.\u201dThe special\u2019s backbone is about Mr. Chappelle\u2019s home life, weaving together a story about friction with his wife and one about dealing with a son who has been in a fight in school. In these long, splendidly preposterous set pieces (one involving an extortion attempt that seems too outrageous to be true), you might notice why Mr. Cosby means so much to Mr. Chappelle.While they are very different comics \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Cosby doing jokes about foot sex and masturbation \u2014 they share a meticulously patient storytelling style and a crusty, slightly impatient attitude toward the younger generation. And now 43, after nearly three decades in show business (he was 14 when he first went onstage), Mr. Chappelle not only has a new kind of gravitas, but he has also embraced his status as an older comic with mature worries, like schools for his kids and growing old with his wife.Mr. Chappelle does not, however, pose as a responsible paternal figure in the chaos of domestic life. In his stories about small-town Ohio family life, he remains the immature mischief-maker, a well-meaning dad with the instincts of a reckless kid. Mr. Chappelle is an authority figure for a world that doesn\u2019t believe in them anymore.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Budget for Everything\u2019: Basing Life on What You Can Afford", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byThe article struck a chord with readers, who responded with the money trade-offs they make to afford the things they really want: a family vacation, a debt-free retirement, a trip to see polar bears.I\u2019ve been doing travel nursing for several months now and I finally have extra money to play with. We don\u2019t have very many possessions at this point since we move every couple of months. We are staying in a small one-bedroom apartment since it\u2019s just my husband and 4-year-old.We spend our extra money attacking our debt while also nurturing the hobbies that we finally have time for. For me that\u2019s books, music, hiking and traveling. Plus, my job is kind of like a working vacation sometimes! I don\u2019t want to work just to survive. That\u2019s not life.We will continue to live below our means when it comes to our \u201cset costs\u201d like housing and transportation. We don\u2019t spend much on material goods. Our disposable income will go toward enjoying life and doing what we love.I drive an older car, have a roommate, rarely eat (or drink) out in order to save money to fund trips, buy hobby-related toys, and build a runway to allow pickiness in the future job market. I also prioritize living in a cool place with lots of hiking opportunities over income, relative to most people.Also having a blast in grad school, when I (presumably) could be making more going into some more lucrative field. Ditto for choosing majors in undergrad (though I\u2019d have done that differently, in retrospect).Buying our ranch-style house newly-built in an older, established neighborhood saved us a lot of money in the home-buying process. We don\u2019t have the biggest house in the neighborhood, but it is comfortable, modern and adequate for our needs. The best thing we\u2019ve done financially is refinance our mortgage few years ago.We are not taking a big vacation for the next four years until our oldest child graduates from college debt-free thanks to a fully-funded scholarship for grad school and attending a service academy for her undergraduate degree. Part-time work throughout the year allows us to increase our savings. These savings allow us to add additional money to our principal and pay our house off even quicker.My husband and I are in our early 40s and our house will be paid off when we turn 50. Saving money and trading off now so we can enjoy the value of not having to pay a mortgage is what I am most looking forward to.My husband, daughter, two cats and I live in a travel trailer in a campground \u2014 $600/month covers rent, utilities, water, sewer, trash, and cable. Plus there is a year-round pool and hot tub! While we work on downsizing more, our other possessions are stored.My husband and I live in the Bay Area and just bought a condo. That was a trade-off. We wanted a single family home. We planned to have two kids, but with the cost of day care here at $1,800 to $2,000 a month for infant care we don\u2019t plan on expanding our family for quite awhile.We budget for food every week and keep our costs down. Lots of our friends with disposable income do more activities, but we don\u2019t do that as I am a teacher. We don\u2019t have cable, but we have Hulu, Netflix, and internet. We always put our son first \u2014 that is our number one. We budget for everything, and we don\u2019t take vacations unless to see family.Every time I spent hundreds of dollars on classroom supplies, that was money I could have put toward saving for my own family, which stings now that we\u2019re ready to start one. My husband, also a teacher, and I have actually talked at length about how to get by in our classrooms while refusing to spend any more of our own money on supplies. My classes have been pretty bare bones lately.I\u2019m a solo mom, so it\u2019s just my income and no child support. I meal-plan for the week, so I only buy what I need at the grocery store. I cook 3-4 days out of the week, and then we do leftovers the other nights. My daughter packs all of her lunches on Sunday so that we don\u2019t need school lunch. I bring my drinks, breakfast bars and lunch to work.We have no TV/internet because we are rarely home, and I like for us to be outdoors, or my daughter is constantly reading. I skip a lot of invitations because it costs too much to go out to eat.I do all of this because my daughter chose to swim competitively. So, between paying for before/after school care and her swimming, there isn\u2019t much left (after rent, utilities, etc.). We do live in a nice house, and I love to provide that for her. I\u2019m very fortunate that I have family that will watch her for free and shuttle her from school to practice, as needed.My daughter has been in love with polar bears her whole life, and she even collected donations in lieu of gifts one year for Polar Bears International. I want to save money so she can see them in the wild before it\u2019s too late.I\u2019m retired and single, so I have to be careful with my money. Instead of paying for cable TV, I watch DVDs from the library, stream stuff over the internet or read a book. I make coffee at home instead of going to Starbucks, and I shop at the thrift store.My car, bought in 2001, was paid for long ago, and I plan to keep driving it until it drops. I save enough each month to visit my granddaughter once in a while. I have a pension, Social Security and retirement savings. I also have health insurance through Medicare and my former employer. I\u2019m one of the lucky ones.My trade-off is living abroad. I would be living paycheck to paycheck in the same position in the U.S. I am able to save money, travel, and do so many things I enjoy because I work in Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Five Came Back,\u2019 and Inspired the Likes of Spielberg", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported bySidestepping the impossible task of compression, this chronological series takes the gambit of having each director\u2019s story relayed by a contemporary counterpart. The pairings aren\u2019t always the expected ones.Steven Spielberg, whose own movies share obvious affinities with those of Frank Capra and John Ford, is the surrogate for William Wyler. Mr. Spielberg\u2019s eye is one of the series\u2019 strongest assets: He extols the aerial photography in \u201cThe Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress\u201d (1944), an account of a B-17 bomber\u2019s mission, and later notes how Wyler avoided camera motion until a crucial scene in \u201cThe Best Years of Our Lives\u201d (1946), one of several postwar films held up as examples of how the directors\u2019 experiences overseas transformed their movies.The explication of Frank Capra falls to Guillermo del Toro, who shares insights into Capra\u2019s populism, his immigrant\u2019s can-do mentality and his shrewdness as an entertainer. Paul Greengrass, no stranger to drama in the air (\u201cUnited 93\u201d) or on the sea (\u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d), seems to understand Ford intuitively. Of Ford\u2019s documentary \u201cThe Battle of Midway\u201d (1942), he notes the dangerousness of the camera placement and moments when violence visibly distresses the image. Francis Ford Coppola defends John Huston\u2019s use of staging in \u201cThe Battle of San Pietro\u201d (1945) as potentially capturing the essence of the situation more completely than straight documenting might have.With its use of archival clips, men talking into the camera and narration by Meryl Streep, \u201cFive Came Back\u201d might seem like standard documentary filmmaking. But it\u2019s easy to overlook the complexity of its editing, which distills a trove of footage in superbly illustrative ways.Of the wartime directors, George Stevens, whose story is told by Lawrence Kasdan, arguably has the spottiest critical reputation, and he vanishes for long stretches of \u201cFive Came Back\u201d until his teaming with John Ford to film the D-Day invasion.Above all, \u201cFive Came Back\u201d is an invitation to see more: It\u2019s hard to watch it without wanting to visit (or revisit) Wyler\u2019s \u201cMrs. Miniver\u201d or Ford\u2019s \u201cThey Were Expendable.\u201d It\u2019s further proof, if any were needed, that these men weren\u2019t simply creating propaganda, but art that would endure.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Is Trump\u2019s Next Target, Administration Says", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byThe Trump administration served notice on Thursday that its next move to deregulate broadband internet service companies would be to jettison the Obama administration\u2019s net neutrality rules, which were intended to safeguard free expression online.The net neutrality rules, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015, aimed to preserve the open internet and ensure that it could not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.Supporters of net neutrality have insisted the rules are necessary to protect equal access to content on the internet. Opponents said the rules unfairly subjected broadband internet suppliers like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter to utility-style regulation.In a news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, mentioned the net neutrality rules affecting telecommunications and cable internet services, noting that the Obama administration had \u201creclassified them as common carriers.\u201dMr. Spicer said President Trump had \u201cpledged to reverse this overreach.\u201d The Obama-era rules, Mr. Spicer said, were an example of \u201cbureaucrats in Washington\u201d placing restrictions on one kind of company \u2014 internet service suppliers \u2014 and \u201cpicking winners and losers.\u201dTelecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as common-carrier utility services, which are subject to anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules. They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers.Mr. Spicer remarked on the rollback of privacy rules before he spoke more broadly about regulations on broadband internet services. President Trump, he said, will \u201ccontinue to fight Washington red tape that stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth.\u201dExcerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.Mr. Trump earlier this year appointed Ajit Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon and a minority Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, as chairman of the agency. Mr. Pai voted against the net neutrality rules as a commission member in 2015.Since becoming chairman, Mr. Pai has indicated that he plans to either roll back or decline to enforce many consumer protection regulations created during the Obama administration, including those regarding net neutrality.Getting rid of the net neutrality rules, policy experts said, will be more difficult than peeling away the privacy regulations. Congress, in a vote mainly along party lines, and by a narrow margin, overturned the privacy rules enacted last fall, using a streamlined process under the Congressional Review Act.But that faster procedure will not apply to the net neutrality rules, which were approved by the F.C.C. two years ago, beyond the timetable for such reviews.Another path to repeal would be for Mr. Pai, who now leads a Republican-majority commission, to revisit the issue at the F.C.C.Politically, net neutrality might be a bigger challenge as well. When it was weighing the rules in 2014 and 2015, the F.C.C. received more than one million public comments. The vast majority of them endorsed strict nondiscrimination rules that supporters viewed as necessary to preserve the democratic ethos of an open internet.That wave of response influenced the Democratic-majority commission. \u201cNet neutrality could be a volatile and explosive issue,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Trump administration appreciates that it addresses nondiscrimination for all kinds of speech, as much for Breitbart and Newsmax as it is for MSNBC and CNN,\u201d referring to news sources that are staunch backers of the Trump administration and ones often seen by Republicans as harsh critics.Opponents of the net neutrality rules say the rules were mainly the result of a very effective lobbying campaign by powerful internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. They have deep pockets and could pay more for fast lanes for their services, they say, but used the net neutrality campaign to avoid that expense.\u201cRegulations result in the allocation of wealth by the government,\u201d said Jeffrey Eisenach, an economist and visiting scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who was also an adviser to the Trump transition team. \u201cThey are often an opportunity for one group of firms to grab an advantage over another group.\u201dAdvertisement"}
