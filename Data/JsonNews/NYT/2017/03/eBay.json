{"Headline": "A Rare Venture Capitalist \u2014 Female and Retail-Focused", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kirsten Green had only dabbled in investing in start-ups before she began a venture capital fund in 2012. What she had instead was years of experience covering the retail business as an analyst on Wall Street.So Ms. Green, 45, parlayed that retail knowledge into her venture capital endeavors and used it to bring specialized advice to her companies. In one of her first moves as a venture capitalist, she was part of a $1 million investment into Dollar Shave Club, then a tiny company, which sells razors to consumers online. Later, she invested in Jet.com, an e-commerce start-up that was vocal about wanting to take on Amazon.Thinking about \u201cthe acquirers, the state of the public markets, how a business is being valued \u2014 that\u2019s an essential way to understand the overall ecosystem\u201d of start-ups, said Ms. Green, whose little-known venture firm, Forerunner Ventures, is based in San Francisco.That means the venture capitalists who nurtured those businesses can finally reap some cash. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re seeing more exits, and a stronger opportunity for exits, is a good thing,\u201d said Theresa S. Hajer, a managing director at Cambridge Associates, an investment advisory firm.Knowing when to sell a start-up or take it public remains as important as deciding to sell. Founders Fund, a venture firm started by the investor Peter Thiel, had put money into Stemcentrx, which makes a cancer-fighting drug. Last year, Stemcentrx agreed to sell itself to the drug maker AbbVie for $5.8 billion, an amount that generated returns exceeding the $625 million fund that Founders Fund had used to invest in the company.These 20 venture capitalists \u2013 the investors who unearth the tiny start-ups that turn into tomorrow\u2019s behemoths \u2013 are on the winningest streaks.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly important to generate realized returns, but the question is still when,\u201d said Brian Singerman, the Founders partner who oversaw the Stemcentrx investment and who is No. 5 on the list of top 20 venture capitalists.CB Insights put together the list using criteria such as the size of a return an investor was able to generate when his or her investments went public or were acquired. The firm focused on the performance of investors since 2009 for the list.Ms. Green is an unorthodox venture capitalist for several reasons. Apart from having never worked at a venture capital firm before starting her own in 2012, she is also a woman in a male-dominated field. (Of the top 20 venture investors this year, only two were women.) And unlike many generalist venture investors, who work in a range of areas, Ms. Green focuses specifically on commerce and other retail-related start-ups.Ms. Green\u2019s roots in retail run deep. She began her career as an accountant auditing retailers. In the late 1990s, she covered those companies as a stock analyst for Montgomery Securities, studying wonky measurements like customer traffic in retail locations and a store\u2019s profitability per square foot. She also observed the rise of brands like Abercrombie & Fitch, Coach and Ugg.\u201cRetail is now totally propelled by consumers and their needs,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can buy what they want in any way that they want it. That trend started a long time ago, and it has really changed everything.\u201dIn 2003, Ms. Green decided to jump from analyzing this shift to investing in it. For a time, she worked as a consultant to a private equity firm before turning to venture capital because of her interest in young companies. In 2010, she raised an angel investment fund to make one-off investments in companies like Birchbox, a cosmetics subscription service, and Warby Parker, an eyeglasses retailer, while she studied how to raise a venture fund.In 2012, Ms. Green raised a $40 million venture fund. The investment firm Cendana Capital contributed $10 million, despite the fact that she had never worked as a traditional investor or tech entrepreneur.\u201cWhen we talked to founders she had worked with, they all said that she had the best expertise and gave the best advice,\u201d Michael Kim, a managing partner at Cendana, said of Ms. Green.With that fund, Ms. Green helped lead a $1 million investment into Dollar Shave Club when the start-up was valued at just $5 million. She also joined the company\u2019s board.After Ms. Green invested in Jet.com in 2014, she chatted with Jet\u2019s executives almost weekly about matters including strategy and potential acquisitions, said Katie Finnegan, who was the online retailer\u2019s head of corporate development. Ms. Finnegan said Jet still consults with Ms. Green even after the company\u2019s sale to Walmart.Ms. Green has \u201ca real instinct for brands,\u201d said Rachel Blumenthal, the founder of the children\u2019s apparel start-up Rockets of Awesome, which sends subscribers a customized box of clothing for every new season. Ms. Blumenthal got to know Ms. Green from Warby Parker, which was founded by Ms. Blumenthal\u2019s husband, Neil.Ms. Green invested in Rockets of Awesome last year and has brought her opinions about consumer behavior to the start-up. At a recent company board meeting, Ms. Green argued that the online retailer\u2019s subscription box needed to remain distinct from its other packaging. Ms. Blumenthal agreed, saying that making the box \u201cthe crown jewel of the customer experience\u201d was the right decision because it was one of the most powerful ways to reach consumers and to learn about them.Ms. Green currently serves on more than 10 company boards, including for the men\u2019s clothing company Bonobos, the makeup brand Glossier and the women\u2019s vitamin company Ritual.As for exits, Ms. Green said she tells entrepreneurs that she expects them to take the companies public or sell to a buyer as soon as appropriate. Of the 30 companies in her first fund, eight have been acquired. In her second $75 million fund, which she raised in 2014, two companies have been acquired, including Jet.com.\u201cNow that people are bombarded with information, we are in a golden age where brands matter,\u201d Ms. Green said. \u201cI want to be part of this new era.\u201dAn article on Monday about the venture capital investor Kirsten Green overstated her investment in Dollar Shave Club. Ms. Green was one of the investors in a $1 million financing round for the company; she did not invest the entire $1 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Icahn Raises Ethics Flags With Dual Roles as Investor and Trump Adviser", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Since Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, was named by President Trump as a special adviser on regulatory matters, he has been busy working behind the scenes to try to revamp an obscure Environmental Protection Agency rule that governs the way corn-based ethanol is mixed into gasoline nationwide.Mr. Icahn, known internationally for his pugnacious and persistent approach to activist investing, has brought that same technique to his new role. He quizzed Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general, about the ethanol rule when Mr. Icahn helped interview Mr. Pruitt for the E.P.A. job. Mr. Icahn later reached out to Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, to raise the issue. Mr. Icahn said he even had a telephone conversation in February with Mr. Trump himself.The blitz has already generated at least one clear outcome: Since Mr. Trump was elected president with Mr. Icahn\u2019s very vocal support and nearly $200,000 in political contributions to Republican causes \u2014 the stock price of CVR Energy has soared. By late December, it had doubled. It is still up 50 percent from the pre-election level, generating a windfall, at least on paper, of $455 million as of Friday.Mr. Icahn, 81, in a series of interviews in the last week, was unapologetic. He said he was not subject to conflict of interest rules because he is an informal, unpaid adviser to Mr. Trump, not an official government employee.\u201cI\u2019m not making any policy,\u201d Mr. Icahn said. \u201cI am only giving my opinion.\u201dThe company, as that pressure from Mr. Icahn and other investors has intensified, has been asking for help from the State Department, Commerce Department and White House, Mr. Adkerson said.\u201cYou are robbing refineries so that gas station owners and other players can make windfall profits,\u201d Mr. Icahn said in an interview Friday, barely able to contain his anger at the arrangement.\u201cWe were not persuaded that the program would be appreciably better at accomplishing its goals, with the approach that he was advocating,\u201d said Janet McCabe, the E.P.A. administrator who oversaw the program.So after Mr. Trump won, Mr. Icahn took up the campaign again, this time gaining much higher access. First, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Icahn to help him screen candidates for the E.P.A. job, so when Mr. Icahn interviewed Mr. Pruitt, he asked him specifically about his position on the ethanol rule.The White House, in a statement, said no policy change was imminent.Not uncharacteristically for Mr. Icahn, he shows no sign that he intends to back down in his push for the policy change.Advertisement"}

(The company has already seen its stock soar since the election.)And he has provided input to the White House on the selection of the new head of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, while being a major investor in companies that have been targeted for enforcement action or investigation by the agency.Kelly Love, a White House spokeswoman, dismissed the criticism, saying that Mr. Icahn was simply \u201ca private citizen whose opinion the president respects.\u201d\u201cAll my life I have fought the establishment \u2014 from U.S. Steel, to eBay, to Apple,\u201d he said last week, referring to his battles to force management changes at different companies. \u201cI have never shied away from it.

{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, a Voice of Caution Guides a High-Flying Uber", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Travis Kalanick, the famously combative chief executive of Uber, took the stage at a Vanity Fair conference in San Francisco last October and quickly faced a prickly question. Why all the blunders at the company, Vanity Fair\u2019s editor, Graydon Carter, asked. And had Mr. Kalanick learned anything?Off in the wings of the auditorium, Bill Gurley appeared to tense.Mr. Gurley has a lot riding on Uber. His venture capital firm, Benchmark, bought into Uber six years ago, when the ride-hailing company was a mere pipsqueak. Today, what was a 20 percent stake in Uber is worth billions.Mr. Gurley is a rare figure, a Silicon Valley habitu\u00e9 who chides some of the biggest start-up stars to show some discipline and drop their arrogant behavior. That day in October, Mr. Kalanick passed Mr. Gurley\u2019s test. He answered calmly, saying that he could learn from leaders who had failed in the past. \u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said. \u201cWe always find a way to learn and to get better.\u201dMr. Gurley relaxed visibly.Helping to right the ship at Uber is a somewhat fitting role for Mr. Gurley, who for years has warned about excessive risk-taking on the part of start-ups. Going against the Silicon Valley orthodoxy, the venture capitalist has urged technology start-ups to go public as soon as they are able, instead of continuing to take venture capital funding: Taking on too much venture funding, he has said, can fuel a lack of discipline.\u201cBill was the one who pushed hard for my company, Net Gravity, to be profitable at the height of the dot-com boom\u201d in the late 1990s, said Thuan Pham, a tech entrepreneur who joined Uber in 2013 and is now chief technology officer. \u201cIt was a very unpopular stance. At Uber, he is willing to speak up too.\u201dMr. Gurley, 50, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on Uber. In one of three interviews last year, he said of his warnings for start-ups that \u201cI say these things because the longer bad behavior goes on, the worse things end up.\u201dUber declined to comment on Mr. Kalanick\u2019s relationship with Mr. Gurley.Mr. Gurley, who cuts a distinctive figure in Silicon Valley in no small part because of his lanky 6-foot-9 frame, went against conventional wisdom even before he became an investor.The son of a NASA engineer, he grew up in Houston, obtained a computer science degree from the University of Florida, and worked at Compaq before joining the investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston in 1993 as a stock analyst.A student of behavioral economics, markets and technology, Mr. Gurley became known on Wall Street for his nonconformist calls. In 1997, after joining Deutsche Bank, he downgraded Netscape Communications, then the wildly popular company behind the Navigator web browser, because he feared it was overvalued. The stock fell about 18 percent after his report. A year later, Netscape was acquired by AOL.\u201cHe\u2019s not pessimistic,\u201d said Rich Barton, the founder of the real estate site Zillow, which Mr. Gurley also invested in. \u201cHe\u2019s simply ahead.\u201dIn 1999, Mr. Gurley joined Benchmark Capital, as the venture firm was known at the time. Benchmark was then on a hot streak, having initially invested $5 million in eBay in 1997 and reaped a more than 50,000 percent return after the online auction marketplace went public in 1998.Among Mr. Gurley\u2019s main concerns are Silicon Valley\u2019s growing self-importance, which he has said is expertly captured in \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d the HBO show that lampoons the misadventures of several entrepreneurs who hope to strike it rich.\u201cThe Valley reeks of entitlement,\u201d he said in an interview last year. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the industry.\u201dAnother of Mr. Gurley\u2019s concerns relates to the way entrepreneurs have delayed initial public offerings. By staying private for as long as possible, these companies often operate without rigorous financial and operational controls, which is to their detriment, he said.Mr. Gurley\u2019s starkest warnings have been directed at the venture industry, now flush with more cash than at any time since the late 1990s. The flood of capital has allowed both good and bad companies to stay afloat, which Mr. Gurley said lets entrepreneurs engage in unsound business practices.For example, start-ups are encouraged to compete with one another with price cuts and discounts when investors are willing to subsidize them. In the long run, however, price cuts are not a sustainable way to keep customers.Thanks to all the easy money in the start-up system, \u201cit could take years to know which business models really work,\u201d Mr. Gurley said. For investors, that could depress returns, he added.Such opinions have sometimes made Mr. Gurley less than popular in Silicon Valley. Marc Andreessen, a founder of Netscape who is now a venture capitalist and who has been optimistic about the start-up boom, once called Mr. Gurley his Newman, a reference to the annoying postal worker in the sitcom \u201cSeinfeld.\u201dMr. Gurley\u2019s bearish outlook has also opened him to teasing. At his 50th birthday party last spring, his family poked fun at his distaste for unicorn companies with a slide presentation showing the investor secretly tending to a herd of the mythical creatures.Some said they appreciate Mr. Gurley\u2019s speaking out. Mr. Gurley is \u201ccalling B.S. on the relentless, blind confidence,\u201d said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley investor, adding that it was \u201cbrave.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s respected because of how he behaves when he\u2019s wrong, and when he\u2019s right, he makes the point in a way that makes everyone laugh,\u201d Jon Sakoda, a partner at the venture firm New Enterprise Associates, said of Mr. Gurley. The firm was one of the backers of Jet.com.Of all the investments that Mr. Gurley has made in tech start-ups, none are set to be as lucrative as Uber.When Benchmark invested in Uber in 2011, the company was just two years old and its service had barely gotten off the ground. At the time, Mr. Gurley put $12 million into the company, which was then valued at $60 million. He also joined its board of directors.Today, Uber is valued at close to $70 billion \u2014 about 1,100 times as valuable as it was when Benchmark invested \u2014 and has become the world\u2019s most valuable privately held tech start-up.Benchmark is known as one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most founder-friendly venture capital firms, meaning that it doesn\u2019t carve out special deals for itself at the expense of entrepreneurs and employees. With Uber, Benchmark agreed to let Mr. Kalanick and two of his colleagues have significant voting control over the company.That has left Mr. Gurley with few levers he can pull for influence, though he is known for his deft touch with big personalities. Whether in a boardroom or around a poker table, \u201che ribs people and tells jokes,\u201d said Nirav Tolia, the founder of Nextdoor, a local social networking company that Benchmark funded in 2011. \u201cHe loves people, and he has your best interests in mind.\u201dWith Mr. Kalanick, Mr. Gurley is said to have a tight relationship. He is Uber\u2019s most engaged board member and the closest thing Mr. Kalanick has to a consigliere, according to two investors who have spoken with both men. Mr. Gurley has helped guide Mr. Kalanick with Uber\u2019s breakneck expansion into 72 countries in six years.Worse, Uber has been spending prolifically, using price cuts to compete with rivals and barreling into new markets at a rapid rate. Mr. Kalanick has said that after the company entered China in 2013, Uber burned through about $2 billion in three years fighting a price war against the local ride-hailing incumbent, Didi Chuxing.Mr. Gurley\u2019s thinking has occasionally held sway at Uber. Last year, with its spending in China showing few signs of abating, many investors agreed that such losses would squash any hopes of a public offering, according to four people who participated in those conversationsThe experience was humbling for Mr. Kalanick. During the Vanity Fair conference, he told the crowd that he had been forced to rethink how he had done everything in China.\u201cYou have to start from scratch,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said. He called the foray an amazing corporate and personal journey that reinforced the Uber belief \u201cin always improving\u201d and \u201cbecoming a better version of yourself.\u201dIn the shadows, Mr. Gurley smiled.Advertisement"}

As in, literally underground, in mountain caves, driven into secrecy by the Reconquista.What moves you most in a work of literature?The feeling that the writer is putting him- or herself at risk, either by excavating something uncomfortable or embarrassing, or just by scrupulously trying to tell a difficult truth.Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?Perhaps I\u2019d own an e-reader if they didn\u2019t track what you were doing. I find that an intolerable invasion of privacy, a red line. I read PDFs on an iPad, but otherwise it\u2019s all paper, several books at a time. I am always surrounded by teetering \u2018to-read\u2019 piles. I have small children, so I get a fraction of the reading time I used to, mostly after they\u2019ve gone to bed.How do you organize your books?What is acceptable New York Times style for conveying hollow cackling laughter?What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?I have a small collection of mystical U.F.O. and spiritualist ephemera, such as a series of pamphlet interviews with the ghosts of famous dead people (Rembrandt, Einstein, etc.) and a record of a conversation between Jesus and \u201can Earth person\u201d which took place \u201chundreds of miles from Earth in the purple magnificence of star-studded Space\u201d in 1959. I recently bought a lot of old nurse-romance paperbacks on eBay.

It\u2019s a beautiful object, and a hard book to find.If you could require the prime minister to read one book, what would it be? The American president?Theresa May strikes me as the kind of Tory who has read too much Trollope and not enough of anything else. It might be nice to give her a book that shows England from an outsider\u2019s perspective, perhaps Sam Selvon\u2019s \u201cThe Lonely Londoners.\u201d Or something by Victor Serge, though that would just be trolling.

Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?I start a lot of contemporary novels and don\u2019t finish them. Often I don\u2019t get beyond the first couple of chapters. I used to force myself to finish everything I started, which I think is quite good discipline when you\u2019re young, but once you\u2019ve established your taste, and the penny drops that there are only a certain number of books you\u2019ll get to read before you die, reading bad ones becomes almost nauseating.What do you plan to read next?Advertisement"}

Schmidt, a computer crime expert who advised two presidents and drafted cybersecurity safeguards that were approved by Congress in 2015, died on Thursday at his home in Muskego, Wis. He was 67.The cause was brain cancer, his wife, Raemarie, said.The legislation, which evolved from precautions Mr. Schmidt proposed several years earlier, enabled government and industry to share information about potential risks from attackers\u2019 codes and techniques, shielded companies from liability lawsuits for trading data and provided privacy protections for consumers.By the time the legislation was finally approved, though, critics complained that it had been diluted in response to corporate concerns and was already technologically anachronistic.Recruited by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Mr. Schmidt returned to the White House under President Barack Obama.He also oversaw the creation of the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, an online authentication program less vulnerable than ordinary passwords to hackers engaged in identity theft or in stealing secrets from private industry or government.Mr. Schmidt won the trust of much of the business community, which was fending off a barrage of cyberattacks but which also feared government intrusion and a damper on innovation. At the same time, he suggested that the threat of full-scale cyberwarfare between governments was exaggerated and that any such conflict would be unwinnable.With the United States portraying itself as a victim of cyberwarfare and much of the world viewing Washington as a perpetrator \u2014 citing attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program as examples \u2014 the White House proclaimed its first formal international cyberspace strategy during Mr. Schmidt\u2019s tenure.That strategy mirrored the planned response to other security threats, in which the United States reserved the right to use all necessary diplomatic and military means to defend itself in the event of a hostile cyberincident. Meanwhile, Mr. Schmidt said, nations were already acting defensively.He said hackers exploited the fear that if one buyer failed to pay for secret information about a computer coding flaw, another would.\u201cIf someone comes to you with a bug that could affect millions of devices and says, \u2018You would be the only one to have this if you pay my fee,\u2019 there will always be someone inclined to pay it,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, dancing with the devil in cyberspace has been pretty common.\u201dFor much of his 40-year career, Mr. Schmidt was in the forefront of information technology and computer security for the military, government agencies and private industry. Most recently he was a partner with Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security secretary, in Ridge Schmidt Cyber, a security consultancy.In the mid-1990s, while working for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Mr. Schmidt was credited with helping to establish the federal government\u2019s first full-time computer forensic laboratory. He also served as chief security officer at Microsoft and chief information security officer at eBay.Mr. Schmidt was the president\u2019s special adviser for cyberspace security in the Bush administration from late 2001 to 2003. He was also chairman of the president\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.The Obama administration recruited him in late 2009 to be its computer security adviser. He reported to the National Security Council.Howard Anthony Schmidt was born on Oct. 5, 1949, in Philadelphia to Anthony and Edith Schmidt. He served three tours in the Air Force in Vietnam from 1968 to 1974; was a police officer in Chandler, Ariz.; and worked for the F.B.I. at the National Drug Intelligence Center.He graduated from the University of Phoenix in 1994 with a bachelor of science degree in business administration and earned a master\u2019s degree from that university.In addition to his wife, the former Raemarie Lange, a forensic scientist, Mr. Schmidt is survived by his mother, Edith Curtis; his stepmother, Gloria Schmidt; his sons, Kyle, David, Andrew and Anthony; and eight grandchildren.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "12 Are Accused of Selling Stolen Electronics on eBay", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byA criminal network made over $12 million stealing flash drives, headphones, ink cartridges and flea collars from big-box stores and selling them on websites like Amazon and eBay, according to an indictment on Wednesday.Twelve people were indicted on 41 counts including conspiracy, enterprise corruption, money laundering and criminal possession of stolen property, in one of the most sprawling retail crime operations ever investigated.\u201cThe ring, we allege, consisted of four theft crews that operated all across the country stealing valuable merchandise from major retailers like Staples, Office Depot and Best Buy,\u201d Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, said at a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday.\u201cThis is not shoplifting,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is organized crime.\u201dThis week, investigators said they seized more than $1 million in stolen goods and over $7.7 million from the defendants, some of whom could face sentences of up to 25 years.Richard Rimbaugh, 64, of Manhattan, and George Athanasatos, 62, of Brooklyn, were accused of leading the ring. When investigators entered Mr. Rimbaugh\u2019s apartment to arrest him, Mr. Schneiderman said, they found piles of electronics and witnessed firsthand the arrival of a new delivery: five more packages of stolen merchandise.Mr. Rimbaugh, known as The General within the ring, requested specific items and resold them on Amazon and eBay, while Mr. Athanasatos, who was called the Field Marshall, closely managed the crime teams and issued credit cards to cover their travel expenses, according to Mr. Schneiderman.Mr. Athanasatos was also indicted on a separate charge of welfare fraud conspiracy.Mr. Schneiderman, whose Organized Crime Task Force led the investigation with support from state police, stood in front of an array of electronic equipment in unopened \u2014 if slightly battered \u2014 packages. Behind him was a map of the United States that he said was removed from Mr. Athanasatos\u2019 apartment. The map had colored stickpins that investigators said represented targeted stores.Those stickpins were not only clustered along the eastern corridor; they were scattered as far north as Minnesota, as far South as Texas, and as far West as California.The sprawling operation covered 28 states and was \u201cextremely sophisticated and complicated,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said. But the thefts themselves were decidedly low-tech.The lower-level operatives, the authorities said, walked into big-box stores with tailor-made denim vests full of hidden pockets. They used shortwave radios to listen in on security workers, and carried bulky electronic devices to deactivate security alarms.The ten-month investigation, \u201cOperation Sticky Fingers,\u201d used surveillance, wiretaps, security camera footage and financial records analysis. It gave the authorities \u201cthe best glimpse perhaps we\u2019ve seen in a very long time into how massive nationwide multi-million-dollar retail theft rings operate,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.New York police superintendent George P. Beach said in a statement that the operation victimized \u201cboth retailers and the public,\u201d and commended the work of the state police\u2019s Special Investigation Unit.The National Retail Foundation reported last year that organized retail crime is on the rise, and costs the industry $30 billion annually.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Over a Century Later, an Irish Painter\u2019s Brooklyn Renaissance", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byWalking along Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn, Geoffrey Cobb stopped at Noble Street and pointed to a corner building where, above what is now a Japanese restaurant, John Mulvany, an Irish-born painter, lived more than a century ago.Mr. Mulvany enjoyed a prosperous career in the late 1800s that made him famous in both America and Ireland for his paintings depicting the Civil War, the American West and Irish history.He influenced painters including Frederic Remington and William Merritt Chase, yet he was largely forgotten, partly because he spent the last decade of his life living in decline in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a poignant coda to more glorious years of artistic acclaim and popularity.But this Greenpoint period has taken on new importance as many of his lost paintings are being rediscovered and commanding high prices.Mr. Cobb, a local historian and New York City schoolteacher who lives in Greenpoint, gathered old newspaper clippings reporting that Mr. Mulvany had been found in May 1906 floating in the East River, after weeks of wandering the streets in rags.\u201cEnds Famous Career in Mystery,\u201d read a headline in The New York Evening Telegram.\u201cTook Own Life, Maybe\u201d was the headline on a front-page article in The New York Press positing that the artist might have \u201cdropped off the end of a ferryboat in the darkness.\u201dDespite struggles with alcohol, Mr. Mulvany had vied for painting commissions and exhibitions to try to rejuvenate his career.He was befriended by George Rowe, a local newspaper editor, who recalled finding the once prominent artist working as a handyman painting angels for a business that made church pulpits.That factory stood on what is now McGuinness Boulevard, said Mr. Cobb, who is originally from County Armagh, Northern Ireland.In a 1906 New York Times article, Mr. Rowe recalled meeting Mr. Mulvany at the factory and providing him commissions and connections to prominent subjects.Mr. Rowe offered the artist studio space in his newspaper\u2019s building on Greenpoint Avenue, Mr. Cobb said, standing in front of the location, which is now an entertainment venue called the Brooklyn Bazaar.Mr. Cobb said he first came across a mention of Mr. Mulvany while researching \u201cThe King of Greenpoint,\u201d Mr. Cobb\u2019s recent biography of the charismatic political power broker Peter J. McGuinness.A restless and sociable genius, Mr. Mulvany set up short-term studios in more than 20 cities during his career, but his longest stint was in Greenpoint, said Anne Weber, 74, a great-grandniece of the artist.He was born in 1839 to tenant farmers in County Meath, Ireland, Ms. Weber said. He fled the Great Famine, immigrating to New York in 1851 as a stowaway when he was 12.Mr. Mulvany worked on the Erie Canal before becoming a student at the National Academy of Design in Manhattan. He then worked for the prominent Civil War-era photographers Mathew Brady and Alexander Gardner, and was sent by a patron to Europe to study painting.He returned to Chicago in 1871, but his studio was destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire that year, so he traveled westward and began gaining a national reputation for his paintings of the American West.His 1881 masterpiece \u201cCuster\u2019s Last Rally,\u201d a 20-foot-wide depiction of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, toured the country for years before joining the collection of the food mogul Henry J. Heinz, who had Mr. Mulvany paint a replica of it in 1900 in Greenpoint.Charles Trois, an investor and collector in Texas who now owns what he calls the original Custer painting, said this week that he was close to completing a deal to sell it for around $25 million, a sum that he called ironic, given how Mr. Mulvany was viewed in his final years.\u201cHe was a has-been\u201d by then, Mr. Trois said. \u201cIf he only knew what his work was going for today.\u201dThe Irish counterpart to the Custer painting was Mr. Mulvany\u2019s 1885 \u201cBattle of Aughrim,\u201d a vivid depiction of a pivotal, bloody fight in Ireland in 1691 that many Irish nationalists believe contributed to centuries of British dominance of the Irish.Exhibited in Dublin, the painting was heralded as a call to arms against the British and extolled by prominent Irish nationalists like Michael Davitt, who said Mr. Mulvany deserved \u201cthe thanks of the entire Irish race.\u201dThe painting disappeared for nearly a century, until an art historian in Dublin, Niamh O\u2019Sullivan, spotted it on eBay in 2010, misidentified as an American battle scene. Ms. O\u2019Sullivan contacted Ms. Weber, who flew to the seller in San Francisco to confirm the painting\u2019s authenticity.The Gorry Gallery in Dublin bought the painting, listed it for 100,000 euros \u2014 about $130,000 at the time \u2014 and sold it to a private collector in Ireland.In 1897, his fame and fortune ebbing, Mr. Mulvany moved to Greenpoint, where his sister, Alice Muldoon, lived on Leonard Street.He was troubled by career disappointments and sadness over the loss of an old flame, Lucy Deere, an artist and John Deere tractor heiress.In Greenpoint, Mr. Mulvany sold his paintings quickly and relatively cheaply. His sister had to keep him from pawning a prestigious medal he had received years earlier from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich.In May 1906, several weeks after being evicted for not paying rent, he was pulled from the river near Sixth Street in Williamsburg. He was 66. In his pockets were clippings extolling his achievements, some recent rejection letters and a sad love poem, according to newspaper reports, most of which presumed suicide.Other theories suggested that Mr. Mulvany might have been killed as revenge for having revealed the identity \u2014 by working it into a painting \u2014 of a man who murdered his friend.Mr. Rowe blamed himself, saying that an offhand suggestion to a desperate, ragged Mr. Mulvany had been darkly misinterpreted.\u201cThe story goes that Rowe told Mulvany to jump into the river, to clean himself up,\u201d Mr. Cobb said, \u201cbut Mulvany took it the wrong way.\u201dMs. Weber said that Mr. Mulvany had learned that he had throat cancer, \u201cwhich was then incurable.\u201dAnd so the life of a painter-adventurer that began in Ireland and flourished in the American West ended dramatically in Brooklyn. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Queens.\u201cHe was an Irishman through and through,\u201d Ms. Weber said. \u201cThe whiskey, the language, the history and a love of Ireland that he kept with him to the end of his days.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Designer Tom Dixon Unveils His \u2018Secret\u2019 Project With Ikea", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byDressed in a charcoal suit, Mr. Dixon was trying to make a radical point: that Ikea, the Swedish furniture giant known for beds and dressers that are so inexpensive they are often perceived as being disposable, could manufacture a collection of affordable, heirloom-quality pieces to last a lifetime.To demonstrate the strength of the bed\u2019s extruded aluminum frame, he challenged the students to crush it. They teetered on its metal edges (the mattress was removed) like acrobats on a high wire, until no more people would fit. End result: barely a wiggle. Even more remarkable, the bed has built-in channels that allow it to be modified by users and customized with headboards, night stands and other non-Ikea add-ons.\u201cIt\u2019s very much something that can mutate according to your changing conditions,\u201d said Mr. Dixon, 57, who has a tight mess of curly hair, a polished gold tooth and a pout that conceals a crackling dry wit. \u201cYou could put on a lamp, a phone charger, a side table. You could raise or lower it, or put it on wheels. It can easily go from being a student bed to a really posh couch, and then back again when you have kids.\u201dThe project is Mr. Dixon\u2019s moon shot for the future of furniture \u2014 the latest gamble from a college dropout turned designer who has become one of Britain\u2019s foremost tastemakers.The prototype bed from Ikea\u2019s Delaktig collection, designed by Tom Dixon to be hackable and durable.\u00a0Mr. Dixon was born in Tunisia, where his father taught English, but was raised mainly in England after his family moved there when he was 4. With little patience for academia, he lasted just six months at the Chelsea College of Arts after high school, and channeled his energy into music. In the early 1980s, he played bass for the band Funkapolitan, which appeared on the BBC show \u201cTop of the Pops,\u201d opened for the Clash and recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York.His first flirtations with design came when he and a few partners started the London clubs Language Lab and Titanic, and he would weld sculptures on stage as experimental performance art. A broken arm from a motorcycle accident put an end to his music career, but the welding stuck.\u201cIn the club world, I knew lots of people, and they would turn into hairdressers and photographers who would all need a little bit of metal welded,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. \u201cIt was really through the joy of metalwork and resolving problems that I became a designer.\u201dImpressed, Mr. Cappellini worked to put a number of Mr. Dixon\u2019s designs into production, catapulting the designer\u2019s name beyond Britain. Most successful was the S-Chair, which is now in the permanent collections of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; the Museum of Modern Art; and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\u201cThe S-Chair, which is a favorite of our curators, is rethinking a chair form \u2014 one continuous gesture,\u201d said Cara McCarty, the curatorial director of the Cooper Hewitt. \u201cHe\u2019s not a fussy designer, but he excels in the craft of making beautiful, enduring forms.\u201dAs his design practice grew, Mr. Dixon remained a maverick in both design and business.\u201cThe furniture industry tends to think in a very homogeneous way, with everyone repeating each other,\u201d said Todd Bracher, a Brooklyn-based designer who worked for Mr. Dixon from 2003 to 2005, just as Mr. Dixon was getting his brand off the ground. \u201cSomehow, Tom was able to cut through all that.\u201dHe also skewered norms as a businessman. Most designers license their creations to manufacturers and then get out of the way, but Mr. Dixon reveled in the production, marketing and selling of his products.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t march to anyone\u2019s drum but his own,\u201d said Bradford Shellhammer, the head of personalization and engagement at eBay. (He is also a singer in Mr. Dixon\u2019s band Rough, which occasionally plays at design events). \u201cHe does what he wants.\u201dGiven Mr. Dixon\u2019s history of doing the unexpected, his collaboration with Ikea isn\u2019t that shocking. What\u2019s more surprising, perhaps, is the focus on longevity.\u201cNobody wants to do throwaway objects \u2014 nobody,\u201d said Marcus Engman, the head of design at Ikea, which began working with Mr. Dixon a year and half ago. \u201cThe thing that is a little bit nagging in people\u2019s minds about mass production is that everything looks the same. But could you mass-produce uniqueness? That\u2019s the perfect crime.\u201dTo give it a push, Mr. Dixon and Ikea held workshops like the one at Parsons, where students developed concepts for accessories that would allow Delaktig to become a dining table with storage compartments; a foosball table; a protective shelter with flotation aids for natural disasters; a self-contained pet cemetery; and an all-in-one nursery unit with a mobile, crib, changing table and nursing pillows.Mr. Dixon plans to make upscale components under his own brand, which may include marble side tables and headboards, Moroccan-style pillows, lamps and a kit for a curtained four-poster bed. \u201cThe measure of success is if you manage to get a whole ecosystem around this platform,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it takes on a life of its own.\u201dIkea aims to start selling Delaktig next February, and Mr. Dixon hopes it will have a starting price of about $400.There, Mr. Dixon will offer film screenings, talks and a Johnnie Walker bar, and present his many creations in a series of shops, including a haberdashery with his first collection of pillows and throws, a chandelier store with his latest lighting collection, a perfumery of scented goods for the home and an antiques shop where his now classic designs will mix with other vintage goods.He will also reintroduce a number of his earliest designs for Cappellini under his own brand, including the Pylon chair, a skeletal composition of metal wire inspired by power transmission towers and a new version of the S-Chair based on his first prototypes.\u201cI\u2019m doing a prequel,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Star Wars.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nintendo Switch: Unconventional Hype for an Unusual Game Console", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byEvery few years, one of the big video game companies comes out with a new box that it wants consumers to make space for in their living rooms.These systems, known as game consoles, invariably promise wondrous new twists that enhance the experience of playing games \u2014 better graphics, online matches, innovative methods of interacting with games. Thunderous hype machines accompany these new devices. The boxes that hit all the right notes become spectacular hits that often are nearly impossible to find in stores, creating lines whenever new shipments turn up.Here\u2019s the anatomy of a typical game console launch and how Switch compares.This is the big moment when a new console is first shown, usually at a special event put on by the console maker during the giant E3 games convention in Los Angeles or a couple of months before it, like the event below by Microsoft in 2013.Technical details of the hardware are shared with an audience of industry insiders and gamer press who build buzz for new products among fans. Retailers fiddle with their marketing and merchandising plans.At this stage, game publishers have already privately gained access to crucial details that allow them to begin developing games for the new consoles. A handful of them usually show short demonstrations of those games, as do in-house studios that the console makers control. This kind of eye candy, not the hardware on its own, is what gets gamers excited about buying a new system.The trailer raised almost as many questions as it answered. What were the technical specs for the system? How much would it cost? What games would be available for it and when? Nintendo stayed mum, though it said Switch would be released in March \u2014 missing the holiday season last year.Instead, the video showed the basics of how Switch can alternate between being played at home, where it can be plugged into a television through a dock, and on the go, where it functions more like a tablet with dedicated controls.Console makers will also do grass-roots marketing to get their new systems into the hands of consumers. Nintendo is a big believer in this approach, in part because the twists it introduces with its new consoles often involve how games are played rather than improvements in graphics, the forte of Microsoft and Sony.All of the hype is designed to make a big splash on the day a new console finally goes on sale. This is also when one of the most persistent conspiracy theories about game console launches gathers steam.If the teams at console makers have done their job by designing a compelling product and marketing it effectively, Day 1 demand for the systems is very high. Millions of die-hard gamers who are willing to take risks when buying new technology are begging console makers to take their money.As companies start to make new boxes, manufacturing is at its most inefficient, said Robbie Bach, a former senior Microsoft executive who oversaw the introduction of the first two Xbox consoles. There may be new chips and other parts that are in short supply because they\u2019ve never been made before.Testing of new consoles can turn up manufacturing defects that require tens of thousands of units to be reworked. Finished units usually have to be sent from Asia on ships across the ocean because faster air shipments are too costly, Mr. Bach said.According to a former Nintendo executive, who asked for anonymity to avoid conflict with the company, Nintendo was cautious about making new systems because its prior console, the GameCube, had not sold well.With the March launch of Switch, Nintendo has missed peak shopping season. And while a new game in the popular Zelda series is being released for Switch at launch, a new Mario game \u2014 always a big draw for Nintendo fans \u2014 will not be available until the holidays.\u201cSupply and demand should be closer to being balanced,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.On the other hand, the company has less competition from other game companies at the moment. Nintendo has promised to make two million Switches available for sale this month, a big number but still possibly not enough.While it may seem like a coda to the spectacle of a console\u2019s initial launch, a new system\u2019s second year on the market is the one that really matters. By the second holiday season, companies have hopefully ironed out most of their manufacturing issues and supplies of new consoles are better in stores.More important, the games are better and more plentiful. It\u2019s a truism in games that the first wave of titles is not of equal measure to those that come later, after game makers have learned how to harness the technology.This is also the moment when game consoles move from early adopters to a bigger audience. There tends to be greater variety \u2014 more genres catering to different tastes \u2014 in Year 2. The unusual timing of Nintendo\u2019s release of Switch may change this pacing slightly, making its first holiday season more important.\u201cThey certainly have an independent streak,\u201d Mr. Bach said.Advertisement"}

Cloobeck, the gregarious founder and former chief executive of Diamond Resorts, vaulted into popular culture on the TV show \u201cUndercover Boss.\u201dWhat do they have in common? Like the man who became president of the United States, all three are finding that wealth and fame can go only so far in fulfilling overwhelming personal ambition. Chasing the greater riches of power and prestige, each is considering a campaign for high office.Politics may have once struck the ultrarich as a ponderous, ladder-climbing pursuit for stiffly programmed former class presidents, but President Trump has demonstrated that it can at least be tried on one\u2019s own terms. If nothing else, the newest occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is proof positive that money, fame and an outsider\u2019s profile can matter more than experience, basic legislative expertise and the other traditional qualifications thought to represent barriers to entry.\u201cA lot of people are saying, \u2018My God, if Donald Trump can get elected, anybody can get elected,\u2019 \u201d said Steve Westly, a former eBay executive who ran for governor of California in 2006.Spurred by Mr. Trump\u2019s election \u2014 or at least encouraged by it \u2014 a contingent of rich, fairly famous and largely Democratic neophytes has begun to line up for some of the most important elections of 2017 and 2018, including for governorships in Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Nevada and New Mexico, and a mayoral race in New Orleans.Similar messages may also be heard in the coming months in New Jersey, where the comedian and former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Joe Piscopo is weighing a run for governor this year, and in Maine, where Adam Lee, who runs the largest car dealership in the state and is a familiar face thanks to television advertising, is mulling a 2018 bid for governor.Mr. Trump did not invent the practice of running for office as a rich, or celebrated, amateur. Both parties have fielded such aspirants over the years. Republicans had notable success with figures like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger.But Mr. Trump, many strategists believe, has opened a wider path for wealthy candidates who resemble localized versions of, well, Mr. Trump: unapologetic self-promoters who relish publicity and have no inhibitions about flaunting their wealth.And adapting the \u201cany press is good press\u201d Trump axiom, some of them talk freely about their aspirations, answering personal emails or speaking at length on their cellphones while eschewing the protective shield of public relations consultants that surrounds conventional politicians and is often quickly erected around first-time candidates.\u201cI gave away $6.8 million last year, and my taxes are paid current,\u201d said Mr. Cloobeck, 55, a major Democratic Party donor, taking a swipe at Mr. Trump\u2019s reportedly parsimonious philanthropy and his mysterious tax returns. \u201cThat\u2019s two things that are different between Trump and myself.\u201dTaking a page from President Trump\u2019s playbook, the rich, famous and newly political boast of their enormous private sector success and vast fortunes while venting fury at \u201ccareer politicians.\u201d Mr. Cloobeck attacked his state\u2019s political establishment with a broad, Trump-like brush: \u201cRight now in Nevada, the entire state\u2019s in disarray.\u201dThey may only selectively embrace the comparison, but Mr. Trump\u2019s precedent-shattering win has served as an accelerant for the dreams of wealthy political novices across the country, a group now asking themselves the same question posed to the mirror by so many ambitious officeholders contemplating reaching for another rung up: Why not me?Armed with an immense fortune and an easy, boastful manner, Mr. Cloobeck, whose former company promotes resort timeshares with the credo \u201cVacations for Life,\u201d said he was still deciding whether to run to be Nevada\u2019s governor in 2018. He is already testing out his anti-establishment message, slinging criticism like Mr. Trump at both parties.Mr. Torres offers a similar indictment of New Orleans, which is suffering through a spike in murders.\u201cIf we get the same-old, same-old politicians to take a same-old, same-old approach, I just don\u2019t see how that benefits the people of New Orleans,\u201d he said.The 41-year-old star of a new CNBC real estate show, \u201cThe Deed,\u201d Mr. Torres has made a name for himself locally by creating a crime app and a private security force for the French Quarter. Beginning an interview with a boast about his standing in the polls, he said he would spend $4 million of his own money if he runs for mayor this year and offered a Trump-like vow: \u201cI\u2019m not going to do things that are politically correct. I\u2019m going to do things that are right.\u201dMuch the way Mr. Trump dismissed questions about his checkered private life, Mr. Torres, who sports a man bun, predicted few voters would care about his having had a child out of wedlock with a model or recoil at an Instagram account that is heavier on images of his Gulfstream jet than of gumbo. In fact, Mr. Torres readily volunteers that he was asked to relocate his private jet when Mr. Trump used a local hangar for a rally last year.\u201cI believe everybody should have the opportunity to have nice things,\u201d he said.Jeff Apodaca, a former Univision executive who is likely to run for governor of New Mexico, is a comparatively buttoned-up figure. Even though his father was governor in the 1970s, Mr. Apodaca said the state\u2019s political class had failed the state\u2019s economy. Asked if he meant Democrats as well as Republicans, Mr. Apodaca repeated the broad-brush criticism.\u201cThey\u2019re more worried about their political careers than the people of New Mexico,\u201d he said.Mr. Apodaca said he would have explored a campaign regardless of the outcome in the presidential race. But he said he believed the Democratic Party establishment had been more open to him as a candidate because of Mr. Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign.\u201cI think the establishment, the people who are now encouraging me, they might have come on board a little more since Trump has won,\u201d Mr. Apodaca said. \u201cWe have to do something different in New Mexico.\u201dMr. Morgan, whose Morgan & Morgan advertising is ubiquitous across Florida, said Mr. Trump had exposed the power of a populist message and the comparative ineffectiveness of traditional political methods, like television advertising.A champion of drug decriminalization with a penchant for unfiltered Twitter posts and artful profanity, Mr. Morgan, 60, said he was considering a run for governor in 2018 on a virtually single-issue platform of raising the minimum wage to $14 or $15 per hour, from $8.10. He said he would pledge to serve one term only and then go home.Unburdened by the typical politician\u2019s sense of restraint, Mr. Morgan, having just returned from a winter sojourn on the Caribbean playground for the rich, St. Barts, offered a rapid-fire preview of his campaign in a series of emails. He said Mr. Trump had done \u201cenlightening\u201d things in his race, described his own public profile as \u201chuge\u201d and repeated the pledge to serve just one term.\u201cMost politicians are so insincere and phony you can\u2019t watch it,\u201d Mr. Morgan wrote. \u201cAnd most never made a payroll and don\u2019t really understand.\u201dSimilar messages may also be heard in the coming months in Maine, where Mr. Lee, who runs the largest car dealership in the state and is also a familiar face thanks to television advertising, is mulling a bid for governor.Other political newcomers with identities outside the political realm are also considering governor\u2019s races, including J. B. Pritzker, heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, in Illinois, and Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach, in Alabama.It is difficult to forecast how relatively untested outsiders will fare in difficult elections, and few wealthy newcomers turn out to be political prodigies like Mr. Trump. But national Democrats have largely welcomed the emergence of deep-pocketed, well-branded candidates: Party strategists see Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Apodaca as among the most promising contenders in their states, and view Mr. Morgan and Mr. Cloobeck as formidable, albeit more unpredictable, contenders for their party\u2019s nomination.Mr. Morgan, Mr. Cloobeck and Mr. Apodaca all said they would expect to spend substantial sums of their own money on any campaign, and also to raise a good deal more than that through their extensive personal and business connections.Yet the presence of Mr. Trump in the White House is not just leading some unlikely figures to envision themselves in governor\u2019s mansions or city halls \u2014 it is also offering food for thought to a group of business executives and celebrities who may harbor their own White House fantasies.This group includes the Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who has sought to raise his profile and has a cadre of people around him with experience in politics and journalism. Aides to Mr. Schultz are trying to schedule a meeting between him and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who pioneered an earlier, more costly and tightly controlled model for moguls to jump into politics.Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and gleeful Trump troll, gladly engaged on his own political ambitions via email, even praising Mr. Trump for recognizing that the nature of communications in campaigns had changed. (Though when asked directly if he was thinking of running for president, Mr. Cuban sounded more like a politician: \u201cNice try,\u201d he wrote, adding a smiley face.)Mr. Trump did not invent the practice of running for office as a rich amateur. Both parties have fielded wealthy newcomers over the years. Republicans of late have had somewhat more success electing business executives to high office, including Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida and Senator David Perdue of Georgia.But Mr. Trump may have established a precedent for wealthy candidates with quirky, even controversial r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Tad Devine, a Democratic consultant who advised Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016 during his presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump had \u201clowered the threshold for running for president\u201d and opened a way for other self-funded candidates up and down the ballot.\u201cA lot of people, particularly wealthy individuals, are going to think: If he did it, why can\u2019t I?\u201d Mr. Devine said, citing potential celebrity candidates in 2020 like George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey.Yet Ace Smith, a veteran California Democratic strategist who has witnessed many a wealthy, first-time candidate lose in his state, cautions that those contemplating a run should keep in mind that Mr. Trump was unique.\u201cHe was a seasoned veteran of the back-and-forth of politics, he knew how to get covered on TV, and he knew how social media now flows into traditional media,\u201d Mr. Smith said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the current relationship of Stephen J. Cloobeck to the company he founded, Diamond Resorts. He is its former chief executive, not its current one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Darwin Evolved: 25,540 Paper Fragments Tell the Story", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe love cool problem-solving under the dinosaur tail,\u201d said Jin Chung, a software engineer at eBay. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a piece of history. We\u2019re even touching the Darwin artifacts themselves.\u201dInstantly explosive when it was published in 1859, the book is still viewed as the keystone of evolutionary biology. Legions of scientists remain devoted to its text and to the observations that went into its preparation.Against this backdrop, the manuscripts project is reassembling Darwin\u2019s notes as he originally wrote them. To speed the process, the computer experts use superfast computers to match up the rough edges of the disassembled notes, many in nearly undecipherable handwriting.A chronic reorganizer, Darwin arranged his notes according to topics that interested him at the time. One page, for example, might be observations made about bees visiting flowers in 1840, originally placed in a portfolio on the behavior of bees. Perhaps 10 years later, he tore or cut that page, moving some of the observations into a portfolio on the pollination of flowers. By reassembling the original pages, researchers hope to understand fully the long arc of Darwin\u2019s research and the gradual maturation of his thinking.Before the manuscripts project began 10 years ago, Dr. Kohn tried to crack the code of Darwin\u2019s handwriting. He would sit for hours at the Cambridge University Library, where the original manuscripts are stored, and focus on the slopes and curves of the botanist\u2019s scrawl. In 2007, a five-person team embarked on the task of transcribing thousands of pages of Darwin\u2019s scientific papers, drawings and book research.Working from the transcriptions, the computer experts then began trying to reassemble the manuscripts digitally. Their work will accomplish in months what would take years to do by hand.Darwin, an experimenter extraordinaire, might have appreciated the efforts.A wealthy landowner, he used Down House, his property of 20 acres or so in England, for hands-on testing of his theories. His laboratory included five greenhouses and a vegetable garden, and his initial experiments consisted of observing 1,000 flowering plants over three summers in the gardens on his relatives\u2019 grounds.Darwin also enlisted some of his 10 children to gather flowers or collect moths at night. They even drew enchanting pictures of flowers on the backs of his notes. Darwin himself \u201cwas a terrible drawer,\u201d Dr. Kohn said.\u201cI was, however, surprised at the depth of involvement with his family,\u201d he added. \u201cDarwin had a network to gather and test his theories.\u201dDuring the 24-hour hackathon, Dr. Kohn inspired the computer experts with some of these stories about Darwin\u2019s exploits in experimentation. For example, Darwin would put vegetable or flower seeds in little bottles with salt water to see how long they could float. That way, he could test his theories about how far seeds could travel and survive.To sort through the notes, the computer experts used coding and image processing to differentiate pages with ragged, fuzzy or sharp edges. Then they matched curves by performing a shape analysis. The project is expected to be completed by the end of March.Luis Ibanez, a software engineer from Google who helped with image-processing functions, found out about the manuscripts project at his company, which promoted it internally. He said he had taken part in 15 hackathons for various projects and enjoys picking up \u201cnew tricks\u201d from other hackers.Mr. Ibanez was especially impressed that Darwin was able to experiment at his own pace over the decades. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do that at Google,\u201d he said.For her analysis of the manuscripts, Ms. Chung applied tools like the Fourier transform, which breaks wave forms into alternate representations. \u201cI got more exposure to image-processing tools during the hackathon,\u201d she said.Dr. Kohn suggested that Darwin would be tickled with the new technology tools.The naturalist kept up his research until the day he died in 1882. His manuscripts were stored in steel trunks that remained in a son\u2019s house until the 1940s, when they were transferred to the Cambridge University Library. In the 1950s, they were finally cataloged, prompting a cottage industry of historical research, Dr. Kohn said.With the notes newly assembled digitally, Darwin\u2019s work can now move into the 21st century.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Platform Companies Are Becoming More Powerful \u2014 but What Exactly Do They Want?", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyDuring a February ride in San Francisco, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was recorded arguing with and eventually berating an Uber driver from the back seat of his car. The driver, who had been working with the company since 2011, accused Kalanick of undercutting drivers of high-end cars like his, plunging him into bankruptcy. Kalanick responded with a lecture about the basic economic logic of his company: Soon, the supply of luxury cars on the app would be reduced, causing demand to increase. Besides, he went on, if the company hadn\u2019t added a lower-priced tier, it would have been beaten by competitors. This did not satisfy the driver, which seemed to enrage Kalanick, who erupted into a moralizing tirade. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own [expletive],\u201d he said, before leaving the car.Uber, like so many other successful tech companies in 2017, is a \u201cplatform business,\u201d one built around matchmaking between vendors and customers. If successful, a platform creates its own marketplace; if extremely successful, it ends up controlling something closer to an entire economy. This is intuitive in a case like eBay, which connects buyers and sellers. Airbnb, too, resembles an age-old form of commerce, connecting property owners with short-term lodgers. TaskRabbit and Fiverr connect contractors with people looking to hire them. Some of the largest platforms are less obviously transactional: Facebook and Google connect advertisers with users, users with one another, software developers with users. But while the transactions that happen on their platforms largely take a different form \u2014 taps, shares, ads served and scrolled past \u2014 the principles are essentially the same, as are the benefits. These businesses are asset- and employee-light, low on liability and high on upside. They aspire to monopoly, often unapologetically, and have been instrumental in rehabilitating the concept. (The logic is seductive and often self-evident: Facebook is more useful if everyone is on it, therefore everyone should be on Facebook.)Predictably, platforms have long been intoxicating to investors. They\u2019ve also been the subject of rapturous popular business writing. In their 2016 book \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms,\u201d the economists David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee cast the subject in revolutionary terms, calling for a \u201cnew economics\u201d to account for businesses that are \u201ctransforming economies\u201d around the world, \u201cmaking life easier and better for billions of people\u201d \u2014 the sort of broad and ideological claim previously reserved by economists for capitalism as a whole.Amid the cheerleading, a comprehensive criticism of the platform model has been slow to emerge. Nick Srnicek\u2019s \u201cPlatform Capitalism,\u201d published in December, tries to situate the rise of platforms in a broader history of capitalism and to project those lessons forward. Srnicek recasts a few features of platform businesses as potentially problematic. Among them is their tendency to metastasize from transaction enablers to, with sufficient success, participation gatekeepers. A food-delivery app like Seamless begins its life with promises of liberation, connecting customers with nearby restaurants, taking care of payments and eliminating phone calls. But in the cities where it has been most successful, its customer base becomes too big to ignore, even for restaurants that struggle to afford its steep commissions. In other industries, the stakes are much higher. An insurgent Airbnb feels as if it\u2019s enabling new types of transactions between previously unconnected people. A dominant Airbnb might come to resemble something between a superintendent and a landlord for millions, not to mention a force reshaping cities in its image.Platform companies have themselves hired economists to help conceptualize and manage the economies they\u2019ve created. Google, Airbnb, Uber and Amazon have aggressively recruited professors and researchers to help understand what, exactly, they have on their hands, and how to expand, regulate and exploit it. Within a rigidly structured platform like Uber, for which the company sets prices, the economic problems are somewhat akin to those of a command economy: How low can we push the cost of a ride before drivers stop participating? (Quite low, for now.) How do we deal with sudden increases in demand? (Surge pricing, controversially.) How might new drivers be both induced to join the platform and more deeply compelled to stay? (Through the introduction of vehicle-financing programs and short-term loan services.)Platforms are, in a sense, capitalism distilled to its essence. They are proudly experimental and maximally consequential, prone to creating externalities and especially disinclined to address or even acknowledge what happens beyond their rising walls. And accordingly, platforms are the underlying trend that ties together popular narratives about technology and the economy in general. Platforms provide the substructure for the \u201cgig economy\u201d and the \u201csharing economy\u201d; they\u2019re the economic engine of social media; they\u2019re the architecture of the \u201cattention economy\u201d and the inspiration for claims about the \u201cend of ownership.\u201dBut the tensions that platforms like Uber create with their customers, their workers and the world that surrounds them will soon become harder to ignore as these companies foment economic and social change, the consequences of which will increasingly be thrust into spectacular display. The Kalanick video was a P.R. nightmare not just for Uber but also for the platform economy in general, posing grand questions about the world it promises, or threatens, to create. The zeal for platforms, combined with the technology industry\u2019s internalization of their merits and inevitability, will push them into areas where the tensions they create become starker and the ideologies they carry become more apparent.Nowhere is that ideological dimension more clear than in the Kalanick video from February. Driver and founder sat inches apart, alienated from each other by the system over which one presides and within which the other toils: the founder explaining to the driver how the platform works and must work; the driver appealing to this person for better pay. It resembles nothing more than one man remarking on the rain while the other thinks, \u201cDon\u2019t you control the weather?\u201d Platforms seek total control even as they abdicate responsibility. In other words, they\u2019re perfect.For now, the tensions that platforms can breed have been obscured \u2014 or at least ignored \u2014 in large part because platformized labor has arrived first in sectors where employment was already widely precarious and contract-based, like taxi driving. As the model expands, these tensions may become more visible as workers with more political and social capital are subjected to them. The recent history of platforms, however, has been defined by the failure of all but a few smart or lucky people to imagine just how successful and powerful they can be.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
