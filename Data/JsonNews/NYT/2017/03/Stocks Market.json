{"Headline": "In Snap\u2019s I.P.O., Evidence of Bankers\u2019 Strategy", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorSnap\u2019s bankers deserve more than the commissions they will receive for a successful, perhaps flawless, initial public offering.Not bad for a pair of twentysomethings. (Yes, be jealous \u2014 what did you do in the first half of your 20s besides drink beer?)The key to a successful I.P.O., after all, is to get that first-day pop, as Facebook learned to its chagrin in 2012. And Snap\u2019s shares will most likely rise on Thursday even after exceeding the previous range.The bankers played another tried-and-true trick: limit the supply. Only about 19 percent of Snap\u2019s total share float was offered, and a quarter of that amount was sold subject to a one-year lockup. Snap\u2019s remaining capital needs were filled by a $1.2 billion loan from the same bankers underwriting the offering.Finally, Snap played off the simple laws of supply and demand and the strange world of internet valuations. There are only a few big internet companies around, and when one goes public, investors pounce.Here, internet valuation does not depend upon silly things like revenue or, heaven forbid, earnings, but prospects. One way (and there are many ways) to think about this, is the chance that Snap has to hit a certain valuation reflected as follows:Basically, Column 1 is the chance of meeting the valuation in Row 2. You can then value this chance by multiplying column 1 by row 2. So if Snap has a 1 percent chance of reaching a valuation of $100 billion, the value of that chance is $1 billion.That is the price a rational investor with a taste for risk would pay for that chance. Someone without a taste for risk would prefer paying for a 99 percent chance of getting $1 billion which would be valued at $1.01 billion.In this chart, the valuation of Snap is $22.8 billion if you add up the value of all the chances. But the chance of Snap being worth below its pricing valuation of $24 billion is 64 percent.Yet if you are basing this on the prospect of Snap, the valuation set on Wednesday for Snap is a rational bet for a risk taker. You can play with the numbers, but you get the idea that the bigger company you think this might be, the more it adds to the current, risky valuation.And Snap is all about prospects and risk. It will depend on doing something no other social network has done \u2014 which is to invent another product equally successful.So far, Snap has done only ephemeral pictures well. There is yet to be a verdict on its Spectacles, though they will probably go the way of Google Glass, a brief novelty.The bet in Snap as it exists today is in preserving and growing the core business, which already may be plateauing, and finding a new business. Can that happen? The chance of it achieving that is how the valuation works.In this regard, Snap is not Facebook or Twitter, the two most used comparisons. Facebook\u2019s core business was growing at the time of its I.P.O. and has continued to grow since, while Twitter was valued by investors based on what they thought about growth in its main business.For Snap, investors have ignored some big warning signs. In addition to the possibility of declining user growth, there is also the inability of Snap to gain traction outside the United States or outside its core young demographic. And that Instagram and WhatsApp (under the Facebook umbrella) are emerging as real competitors.Then there is the governance issue. The company has chosen to keep all control with its co-founders and gives no vote to the shares held by the public. So in some ways, Snap is more like Shake Shack or Fairway with a touch of Theranos, than it is like Facebook or Twitter.I could, of course, be all wrong about this. There is a chance that Snap will be the next Facebook, churning out products the teenage set loves for the next nine decades of Mr. Spiegel\u2019s life. In a year or two, we should have a good sense of Snap\u2019s direction, and when we do it will be a test not just of the internet I.P.O. model but corporate governance as well.In the meantime, Snap will likely spur more internet market debuts \u2014 after all, there is a drought of them \u2014 as bankers sell this good result to push clients out.And that is really what the Snap offering is about: good deal-making and salesmanship by its bankers at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.Congratulations, of a sorts, are due.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Blockchain: A Better Way to Track Pork Chops, Bonds, Bad Peanut Butter?", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byFrank Yiannas has spent years looking in vain for a better way to track lettuce, steaks and snack cakes from farm and factory to the shelves of Walmart, where he is the vice president for food safety. When the company dealt with salmonella outbreaks, it often took weeks to trace where the bad ingredients came from.Then, last year, IBM executives flew to Walmart\u2019s headquarters in Arkansas to propose a solution: the blockchain.As Mr. Yiannas studied their pitch, he said, \u201cI became increasingly convinced that maybe we were onto the holy grail.\u201dThe blockchain \u2014 the buzzy, bewildering technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin \u2014 is starting to be applied to real-world problems like tracking pork chops, shipping containers and footwear with a speed and security not currently possible. The IBM-Walmart partnership is one of the biggest practical tests to date.At its heart, blockchain simply refers to a bookkeeping method that \u201cchains\u201d together entries so that they are very difficult to modify later. It provides a way for large groups of unrelated companies to jointly keep a secure and reliable record of their transactions.IBM is trying to position itself at the forefront of the heated competition for practical uses of this arcane idea. Walmart is just one of 400 IBM clients testing it out, and IBM now has around 650 employees dedicated to the technology.Yet success is far from assured.\u201cWe believe with 100 percent certainty that it\u2019s going to matter,\u201d Mark Russinovich, the head of Microsoft\u2019s blockchain efforts, said of the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of where\u2019s its going to matter and how it\u2019s going to matter.\u201dIt was Bitcoin that first caught the attention of IBM researchers, and everyone else.Bitcoin, born in 2009, represented a novel idea in the financial world. Unlike, say, dollars or yen, Bitcoins are virtual tokens, unaffiliated with any nation. Anyone can open a wallet and receive Bitcoins \u2014 without providing any identifying information \u2014 and transactions are recorded on a universal ledger that is visible to everyone.Drug dealers have embraced its relative anonymity. And people who live in countries that strictly control their financial systems, like China and Venezuela, have used Bitcoin to store their money beyond the watchful eye of the government.But while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin\u2019s underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into \u201cblocks,\u201d and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction \u2014 a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact.In 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM.\u201cI was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM.But a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM\u2019s central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology.They explained that this was about more than just a currency \u2014 it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it.\u201cThat was the \u2018aha\u2019 for me,\u201d Mr. Krishna said. \u201cThis was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.\u201d He called it \u201ca technology that can change the world.\u201dThere are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers.But blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information.A few months after Mr. Krishna\u2019s aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM\u2019s top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities \u2014 or threats \u2014 to IBM\u2019s business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, gave the green light to.She turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, \u201cYou run with this,\u201d he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months.Her hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM\u2019s eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software.But growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers.IBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, \u201cThe first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.\u201dAfter getting Ms. Rometty\u2019s push on the blockchain, the IBM team\u2019s first move was to make its software \u201copen source,\u201d meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM\u2019s bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology.It was the chairman of IBM Europe, Erich Clementi, who personally pitched the concept to the top technology executive at Maersk. Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe.For Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships \u2014 instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities.While the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world.What\u2019s more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year.Maersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved \u2014 including Maersk and government authorities \u2014 could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged.The first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California.The difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it\u2019s unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system.\u201cYou need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,\u201d said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult part.\u201dIBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark.Not everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach.Many technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains \u2014 like the one being built by IBM \u2014 are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin\u2019s success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM\u2019s.That could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, \u201cit still concentrates power in a handful of entities,\u201d said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems.IBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come.But the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project.\u201cThey have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,\u201d Mr. Behlendorf said. \u201cWe are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.\u201dBut IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. \u201cThis is the most well-thought-out project in the space,\u201d said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor.Now all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work.At Maersk, Mr. Stausholm said it could take five or even 10 years for that to happen, given all the partners \u2014 manufacturers, customs officials and farmers \u2014 that need to come together. \u201cI really do believe in it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how fast it will be able to take off.\u201dAt Walmart, Mr. Yiannas is more optimistic. His company has already completed two pilots with IBM \u2014 moving pork from Chinese farms to Chinese stores, and produce from Latin America to the United States \u2014 and he is confident a finished version can be put together within a few years. \u201cI think this is our one best hope for getting it right,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Booming Markets Are Telling Us About the Global Economy", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe stock market reached yet another new high on Wednesday, the latest development to make a mockery of what savvy economic commentators thought they knew about the world.Consider how things looked one year ago. The world economy seemed hopelessly trapped in a cycle of low growth and inflation. Markets recoiled at the mere possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. Populist political insurgencies seemed to threaten yet more financial market chaos.Now, interest rates and inflation forecasts have risen substantially from last winter\u2019s lows; financial markets are shrugging off \u2014 or even rallying at the possibility of \u2014 imminent Fed rate increases; and it is all taking place during Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency.An economy that seemed locked in some form of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d or \u201cnew normal\u201d is at long last showing some signs of being in something closer to an \u201cold normal.\u201d The United States manufacturing sector is showing strength, and the broader mix of market and economic data from around the world in the last few months also points to a world where a vicious economic cycle isn\u2019t looking quite as scary and may even be ending.There can be no assurance that this pattern will continue, and there are some things to worry about on the horizon, not least that the Trump administration could follow through on some of its threats to disrupt global trade and diplomatic relations. Long-term interest rates remain low by historical standards across most of the world, suggesting that global bond investors aren\u2019t fully buying into a return to stronger, more consistent growth.But the pivot since Election Day is huge. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is up 12 percent since Nov. 8, the London FTSE 100 index reached a new high Wednesday, and other global markets have grown nicely in that span. Ten-year Treasury bonds now yield 2.45 percent, up from 1.85 percent on Election Day, suggesting investors believe higher growth and inflation are more probable than had seemed likely just four months ago.Much of the buoyant optimism on Wall Street is driven by investors\u2019 expectations of corporate tax cuts and deregulation under the Trump administration. But there is also some real improvement in the economic data underneath the shifts, reflecting economic forces that have been underway for years. And this resetting of expectations is evident in market data beyond the always erratic stock market.For years, a theory that the major world economies were stuck in a pit of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d had gained hold \u2014 the idea that low economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and weak productivity growth were all reinforcing one another in a vicious cycle.There\u2019s hardly enough evidence to toss that theory aside, but there are many reasons to think things are now looking up.For example, bond market prices now suggest that investors foresee consumer price inflation in the United States at 2.03 percent a year over the coming decade \u2014 consistent with the 2 percent inflation the Fed aims for. It only recently reached that level, however, after being as low as 1.2 percent in February 2016. And it\u2019s not just the United States. Similar measures of inflation expectations have risen in Germany, Britain and other advanced economies.Fed watchers interpreted that to mean that an interest-rate increase could be on the way in mid-March, just three months after the last increase in December. Yet that did nothing to slow the 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 on Wednesday, and may even have contributed to it, as a sign of the Fed\u2019s confidence in the economy.A year ago, hints that the Fed would move quickly with rates would have sent markets into a tailspin. As 2016 began, Fed leaders were expecting to raise rates four times in that year, plans that helped send the stock market plummeting and measures of economic pessimism soaring. Then they backed off and only raised rates once.Conventional economic theory predicts that if a government tries to increase deficits at a time of full employment, the results will be some mix of higher inflation and higher interest rates, crowding out investment.So if tax cuts, more military spending and other Trumpian policies add to deficits at a time the economy is already running at full blast, rising prices and rising rates are exactly what we would expect to see.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Are Up 5 Percent Under Trump. So How Long Will the Rally Last?", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byStocks have marched higher and higher \u2014 up 5 percent since President Trump took office six weeks ago \u2014 and the rally has become one of his favorite boasts. And there is plenty of economic data to justify the ebullience.So why are some hedge fund managers bracing for a sell-off?It\u2019s all in the details.The economic indicators are certainly heartening, the managers say, and Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious policy agenda \u2014 which includes a market-friendly triad of top priorities in rolling back regulations on businesses, overhauling corporate taxes and spending $1 trillion in infrastructure projects \u2014 looks encouraging, too.That is, if the policies come to pass as they have been described.If deep cuts to regulations and a tax overhaul are pushed off to next year, for instance, or if no clear plan emerges anytime soon to rebuild the nation\u2019s physical structures, there is plenty of room for disappointment.\u201cThe stock market may be currently expecting a best-case scenario for policy implementation,\u201d Alan Fournier, the founder of the multibillion-dollar hedge fund Pennant Capital Management in Summit, N.J., said in an interview shortly before the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 21,000 for the first time, on Wednesday.A closer examination of what it would take to put into effect Mr. Trump\u2019s initiatives, like a proposal to impose new import taxes, suggests that market participants might be overly excited, Mr. Fournier added.\u201cA lot more skepticism\u201d exists in currency and bond markets, said Mr. Fournier, who looks at the prices of those assets, rather than at stocks, when he needs a powerful gut check. He declined to discuss his current investments in detail.The market chatter in recent days has been similarly skeptical.In interviews with more than a dozen money managers in the past week, nine senior investment managers or hedge fund executives predicted that a market decline of at least modest size was likely to occur in the near future.Protecting the stocks, bonds and other positions that money managers hold from unexpected market moves in either direction is their business. It is the very essence of hedging and is critical to preserving investor capital.Some of those money managers are using options \u2014 trades that give their initiator the right, but not the requirement, to buy or sell stocks in the future \u2014 to bet that the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index will fall 1 to 2 percent in the coming weeks. Such positions can be cheap to build and can lock in favorable prices if the market declines.Others, like the Chicago investment firm Citadel, which is known for its aggressive risk management, are adding the effects of Trump policy implementation to their lists of factors that could create market volatility, company officials say. (One example: a meaningful rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul that would improve the share prices of banks and related companies.)A number of the money managers interviewed are looking at online betting websites that allow participants to place wagers \u2014 offbeat as they may be \u2014 on whether Mr. Trump will be impeached before the end of his current term as one indicator of popular perception that could depress stocks in the coming months or years.At Paddy Power, an Irish competitor running hundreds of markets related to the Trump presidency, the implied probability of impeachment was 40 percent. Other betting opportunities ranged from the likelihood of a third Trump divorce before the end of his presidency to the chance that Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would share a Nobel Peace Prize.\u201cOur customers are so interested in Trump that we\u2019ve created, basically, a microsite dedicated to him,\u201d said Lee Price, a Paddy Power spokesman.Of course, some are dubious about those markets, too.The idea of using a theoretical Trump impeachment as a reason to hedge investments is \u201cthe stupidest theory I\u2019ve ever heard in my life,\u201d said Peter DeCaprio, a founder of the $900 million hedge fund company Crow Point Partners in Hingham, Mass., \u201cbecause the odds of it happening are next to zero.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis is why people hate Wall Street. We\u2019re paid to evaluate risk and make investments in risky markets. That\u2019s it.\u201dSome funds have made hedging against risk their primary aim. Known as tail risk investment vehicles because they are on the lookout for highly unlikely market moves, they buy instruments like options and other insurance policies that can pay out when prices move in unexpected directions.\u201cHistoric valuations and record complacency in today\u2019s markets make them extremely vulnerable to shocks, regardless of who is in office,\u201d Mark Spitznagel, the chief investment officer of the Miami-based Universa Investments, one of the best-known tail risk funds, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe current low cost of protection makes a tail hedge an easy decision for asset holders, who are all exposed to the inevitable and increasingly dangerous unwind.\u201dMr. Spitznagel recommended the use of S.&P. options known as puts, which are the right to sell that index at a future point in time at previously determined prices.Other investors, like Citadel, are awaiting further details on events, like a possible government crackdown on drug prices that could hurt pharmaceutical stocks or the lifting of portions of Dodd-Frank that could help financial stocks, that could affect specific sectors.But without knowing more about how such policy measures will look, many hedge fund managers say it is hard to do more than simply wait until they can read the fine print.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans for Single-Payer Health Care", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byWithout a viable health care agenda of their own, Republicans now face a choice between two options: Obamacare and a gradual shift toward a single-payer system. The early signs suggest they will choose single payer.That would be the height of political irony, of course. Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Tom Price may succeed where left-wing dreamers have long failed and move the country toward socialized medicine. And they would do it unwittingly, by undermining the most conservative health care system that Americans are willing to accept.Let me take a step back to explain how we got here and how the politics of health care will most likely play out after last week\u2019s Republican crackup.Trump seemed to understand this during the campaign and came out in favor of universal coverage. Once elected, though, he reversed himself. He turned over health care to Price, a surgeon and Georgia congressman with an amazing record, and not in a good way.Obamacare increased coverage in two main ways. The more liberal way expanded a government program, Medicaid, to cover the near-poor. The more conservative way created private insurance markets where middle-class and affluent people could buy subsidized coverage.Now, think about the political message this would send to Democrats: It\u2019s not worth expanding health coverage in a conservative-friendly way, because Republican leaders won\u2019t support it anyway.Politics aside, private markets in many areas of the economy have substantive advantages over a government program. They create competition, which leads to innovation and lower prices. But private markets in medical care tend to be more complicated and less successful.So if voters like government-provided health care and Republicans are going to undermine private markets, what should Democrats do? When they are next in charge, they should expand government health care.They should expand Medicaid further into the working class. They should open Medicare to people in their early 60s. They should add a so-called public option to the private markets. They should push the United States closer to single-payer health insurance. It will take time and involve setbacks, but they are likely to succeed in the long run.Until then, the future of socialized medicine is in the hands of Dr. Tom Price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dole Case Illustrates Problems in Shareholder System", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe share ownership system in the United States is fraying. And while its shortcomings have been largely behind the scenes, now they are going to cost some innocent shareholders money.Former Dole shareholders will receive $2.74 a share \u2014 a nice chunk of change in addition to the $13.50 a share originally paid in the deal. Still, because of the shareholder ownership system, some of those Dole shareholders may not get that money.The reason is that while shareholders think they own the shares they buy, they don\u2019t in a sense.That may come as a surprise to those who check their online brokerage accounts daily or see traders on a floor of an exchange reacting to price movements. A market that in many ways is open and transparent is underpinned by a system of share ownership that can be anything but.Share ownership in the United States is conducted through the Depository Trust Company, which was formed after the back-office scandal of the early 1970s. At that time, trading volume on Wall Street became too much to handle, and brokerage firms were swamped by paperwork, falling months behind.The idea was to freeze ownership of company shares in one place. Now, when Apple or Microsoft look at their share register they see only the Depository Trust Company. When trading occurred, brokers would now transfer shares among accounts at the trust company. The brokers hold the shares on behalf of customers who were the ultimate beneficial owners.The result was that the Wall Street firms could now more easily track shares by having to deal only with themselves and the Depository Trust Company. Companies were taken out of the process.Because shareholders are actually only beneficial owners, lots of odd things can happen.For example, instead of executing a trade in the market, a broker may just transfer shares among clients and mark the trade as a sale. (The broker is still required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to get the best price.)Alternatively, if a person wants to short a stock by borrowing it and selling it in the market \u2014 betting that the stock price will drop \u2014 the broker may \u201clend\u201d your shares without you knowing it.These issues have been brought to the forefront by the Dole case. In the settlement, 4,662 people and entities claimed 49,164,415 shares at $2.74 per share.There is just one problem: Dole had only 36,793,758 shares outstanding.These are probably not false claims. They go directly to the problems with the share ownership system.The first problem is that the Depository Trust Company sometimes doesn\u2019t keep track of shares. When this happens, it puts a \u201cchill\u201d on the shares, meaning that it stops tracking them because of established procedures for the final three trading days up to the closing of a merger.Instead, the money in a merger is simply paid to the brokers who are supposed to filter it down to the investors. Usually this works, but apparently in the Dole buyout, there may have been some problems with this process.The bigger problem, however, is the shorting issue. Normally, when someone shorts shares, they borrow them and then sell them. When the short position is closed, the investor buys back the shares and restores them to their lender.In a merger, the shorting party simply pays the merger consideration.There seemed to have been many shorts in Dole. Expectations that the company would obtain a higher sale price lifted Dole\u2019s shares above the terms of the buyout offer.Other investors were apparently skeptical that would happen, and more than 2.9 million shares were shorted on the last day that the trust company tracked the trading of Dole shares.For good measure, the judge, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery, noted that \u201cit bears noting for future merger cases that the problems raised by short sales and trades during the three days before closing appear endemic to the depository system and hence likely infect every claims process.\u2019\u2019In other words, this happens every time. It became a problem in the Dole settlement only because with so much money being paid out, more shareholders than usual took the trouble to submit a claim.But there is not enough money. When short sellers borrowed shares they sold them to other shareholders in the market. Under the ruling, those third parties who unknowingly bought shares that were shorted will now not be paid. Instead, the holders of the shares that were lent out will be paid. Those who bought shorted shares will be left to look to the shorters.The Dole settlement highlights that as our capital markets become ever more complex, share trading and ownership are getting harder track. But in an age when computing power is cheap, why can\u2019t we keep track of shares?But is that really necessary? The system might be fixed just by adding some computing power to better trace shares. Of course, this would require the people who control the plumbing of the markets to invest millions and millions of dollars in improvements.Alas, there is no profit to be made on an upgrade. This is an area where the nation\u2019s chief market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, needs to step in.But even this will not solve the shorting issue. When you sign up with your broker you are signing up to short shares, whether you like it or not. People are then buying shares without your knowledge.This is a problem that the brokerage firms have created, and hopefully they will fix. At a minimum, they need to stand behind the shareholders here. After all, they helped create this mess.The Deal Professor column on March 22, about a Delaware court case over shares of Dole Food, described incorrectly the capabilities of the Depository Trust Company, which provides clearing and settlement services to the stock market. The trust company does in fact have the ability to track the ownership of shares; it is not the case that the trust company does not track the shares because it is too hard or too expensive to do so. (In the case of cash buyouts like that of Dole, regulatory processes and practices dictate how payment is made on settled positions and unsettled trades.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murano\u2019s Glass Jewelry: All in the Family", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byMurano, the island of glassblowers across the lagoon from here, is known for producing vases and glasses with swirls of color and ornate chandeliers found in tony hotels and homes. But some businesses on the crowded little island also produce high fashion jewelry found on runways and in exclusive social settings around the world.These are not the machine-made trinkets imported from Asia that tourists find in Venice\u2019s souvenir shops, but rather inventive designs produced from quality materials. Two of the companies best known for such creations have a typically Italian approach: They are keeping alive traditional craftsmanship by applying it to new designs, while keeping it all in the family.The Attombri brothers, Daniele and Stefano, are using the last stocks of a glass bead no longer in production to create jewelry often of sculptural proportions for the catwalks of Dolce & Gabbana and Romeo Gigli, and for fashionable women who view jewelry as art.Their neighbors on Murano, the Sent sisters, Susanna and Marina, are using their grandfather\u2019s glass factory to invent new techniques in bead making. They are turning the results into jewelry collected by, among others, Yumiko Ando, the wife of the architect Tadao Ando, and Monica Armani, a well-known interior designer in Milan. The glass sculptor Dale Chihuly also has bought pieces \u2014 perhaps the ultimate accolade of one glass master for another.When Costantini stopped production about 20 years ago, the Attombri brothers bought the remaining stock. Born just outside Venice, in Mestre, and both trained as architects, the brothers decided to honor their city\u2019s heritage and let their artistic sides go wild.The result: An Attombri piece may contain thousands of minuscule beads, each as small as a grain of sand, laboriously strung on wire rather than the cotton threads traditionally used in jewelry, in multiple strands, or fashioned in the shape of the moon or the sun, more resembling a piece of sculpture than jewelry. A woman could hang the pieces on a wall rather than on her body to equally striking effect.The Costantini site, the size of a two-car garage, stands amid Murano\u2019s warren of canals. It holds some 900 crates, each filled with beads of a different color and size: Bin 882 is filled with deep red corallo beads; bin 778, ambra; 261, mandarino; 115, lapis.There are still significant amounts of some beads, and dipping a hand into a bin containing them is like shoving it into a big sack of rice. Others, however, are scarce. There is only about a half-pound remaining of a pure blue of the kind Andrea della Robbia might have used. \u201cI can make 10 necklaces out of it, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Daniele Attombri said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done.\u201d There are only 300 of one bead that combines blue with yellow, \u201cand it\u2019s mine,\u201d he said.Stefano Attombri said the business was selective. \u201cSometimes big companies ask us to make a production for their department stores, but we can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have to go to China or the Czech Republic for the beads, and we are allergic to them. They\u2019re made by computers: Every bead is the same.\u2019\u2019At Costantini\u2019s, the beads were made a different way. Glass was heated so that tiradors, or master stretchers, could stretch the hot balls of glass into narrow tubes, as if they were making taffy. The tube was then cut by hand into beads, so no two were ever alike.In Venice, the Attombri brothers turn the beads into high fashion jewelry, working in their boutique under the colonnade rimming the Rialto market. Using a technique they invented, they string beads onto metal strands by hand, using the long traditional needles of the beading trade, each slender as a hair.Creating exciting new three-dimensional shapes is key to them, the result of their architectural training. They make a good team: Stefano Attombri enjoys working with the beads while his brother is more interested in the metal, incorporating it as a design element into each piece. \u201cOur work is different from anyone else,\u201d Daniele Attombri said, as his brother worked on a beaded collar that would take 60 hours to complete.They also have created beaded lamps, chandeliers and curtains, and will open a store in the spring to showcase them. The jewelry sells for 180 to 1,000 euros, or $195 to $1,085. The furnishings range from \u20ac450 to \u20ac10,000 and are sold in their boutique, as well as at galleries in Japan.Says Susanna Sent of her sister: \u201cWe are opposite. Marina is calm, reflective and slow, but she astonishes me with fresh solutions.\u201d Says Marina of Susanna: \u201cMy sister is fast in suggesting new ideas and dealing with changes. We are like a car: I am the brake and she is the accelerator.\u201dSusanna Sent said the glass business runs in the family. \u201cFor both of us, glass is a very familiar material,\u201d she said. \u201cOur grandfathers from both sides of our family, our mother\u2019s and our father\u2019s, were glass workers.\u201cOur father inherited the business,\u201d she said. \u201cWe grew up in a family that was always talking about glass. We always had beautiful glasses for the table.\u201dBut the sisters were intent on making jewelry, so they put the knowledge gained around the dining table to work on a new direction for the family business. \u201cOur father gave us lots of freedom,\u201d Marina Sent said. \u201cWe could play and experiment with the glass.\u201d And they did.The sisters used the traditional techniques their family employed to make objets d\u2019art and vases, a process that involves sanding and polishing and decorating the glass, and applied it to making beads. They invented some new techniques, like mixing oxygen with gas, which allowed them to create a bigger bead and statement jewelry unlike what the women stringing beads by the lagoon had been making for centuries. The Sents continued experimenting, mixing existing colors to create new shades, their own versions of purple and teal.\u201cMaking beads became a passion,\u201d Susanna Sent said, explaining that when they used their father\u2019s fishing line to string their big, bold new beads in unexpected colors, friends wanted the results for themselves, and the Sents added jewelry to the family business.One of the Sents\u2019 signature styles comes from a technique they invented that has since been copied: a necklace that looks like a cluster of soap bubbles. They also use glass in other unexpected ways, creating scarves and lampshades while continuing the family tradition of making objets d\u2019art. To their mind, there is no difference between past and present, as they carry on the tradition. \u201cWe like when people consider our jewelry as an objet,\u201d Susanna Sent said. \u201cIt is the most beautiful congratulations we can receive.\u201dPrices for the jewelry range from \u20ac30 to \u20ac500. The jewelry is sold in the three Sent shops in Venice and Murano, as well as the shops of modern art museums in New York, San Francisco and Tokyo, and in boutiques and galleries around the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Has Gone So High, It\u2019s a Problem", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIt\u2019s a nice problem to have, but it\u2019s still a problem.Stocks have soared so high that a cautious person might start worrying about oxygen supply.In January, the Dow Jones industrial average reached 20,000 for the first time. It crossed the 21,000 mark on March 1, and while it slipped on Thursday and then had a late surge on Friday, it still seems to have plenty of power left in it.That means that if you\u2019ve been in the market for a while, you are likely to be perching on a mountain of profits. Should you stay where you are and hope for further gains, or is it time to declare victory and move your money to safer ground? That\u2019s an eternal question, one that returns whenever the market rises spectacularly. The answer depends, of course, on your analysis of two very different issues: the current situation in the markets, and the one in your own life.The raw numbers for the stock market are astonishing: Even without counting dividends, the Standard & Poor\u2019s index has risen more than 6 percent since New Year\u2019s Day, nearly 20 percent in the last 12 months and roughly 250 percent since the start of the bull market in March 2009.Market history shows how remarkable that performance is.The current bull run is now the second longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group, a research firm. It is surpassed in duration only by one that ran from December 1987 to March 2000.In terms of strength, it ranks third, well behind that 1987-2000 bull market, which had an eye-popping gain of 582 percent, but not very far from one that lasted from June 1949 until August 1956, in which the market rose 267 percent.In a telephone conversation, he said that while some of the market\u2019s recent action has been very strong \u2014 \u201ca huge move\u201d upward on Wednesday after President Trump\u2019s speech to Congress, for example \u2014 the stock market\u2019s path since 2009 has generally \u201cbeen a series of slow, grinding moves\u201d with little evidence of irrational exuberance.Clearly, though, market fundamentals are less auspicious than they were eight years ago, when stocks had been battered in the ferocious downturn of the great financial crisis, and investors with foresight and audacity could buy at rock-bottom prices.For example, one widely followed metric, the price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 which tells you how much money is being paid, on average, for $1 of corporate earnings \u2014 has become much less favorable. It has climbed to 22, well above its five-year average of 18.2, according to data from Bloomberg. Consider that in February 2009, the ratio plummeted to 12.1, a paltry level reflecting widespread fear that both corporate earnings and stock prices would plunge. That moment was a turning point for the market, which has surged upward ever since. It may not be at a peak now, but investors are inhaling rarefied air, whether they know it or not.Yet it can be argued, as Mr. Birinyi does, that corporate earnings are rising, the economy is expanding nicely, and investors have been reacting fairly cautiously, keeping valuations within reasonable, if not optimal, bounds.The increasing likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase would have been a problem a year ago, Mr. Birinyi said, but it is a positive portent at this stage, because it signals that the central bank is convinced that the economy is in good shape and will keep expanding.That said, he also warned that in the current market, restraint and agility are important. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go all in on stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be careful.\u201dMr. Birinyi sits in front of a terminal all day, trading individual stocks whenever the prices tell him it makes sense to do so, which most people couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t attempt. \u201cWe get out of a stock if the price is no longer right,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will buy it again when it\u2019s better. We\u2019re ready for whatever happens.\u201dMost of us aren\u2019t steady stock traders, and need to be prepared for downturns in other ways. And if little is accomplished in Washington to fulfill investor expectations \u2014 or if there is an external shock, such as an international crisis \u2014 the market could fall sharply, Mr. Birinyi acknowledged. Furthermore, if the economy falters in such situations, the long rally in stocks could end violently.But even if you\u2019re a very long-term investor, it\u2019s smart to take inventory. If, for example, you will need a chunk of your portfolio for a down payment on a house or to pay a tuition bill or to replace a roof or buy a car, you may want to liquidate some of it now, congratulating yourself on your gains. In addition, even if you don\u2019t need to use the money, selling securities that have incurred losses may be a good move, Mr. Birinyi said. Losses will offset gains when it\u2019s time to pay your taxes, and many investors these days are fortunate in having plenty of gains.In any case, it is surely wise to make sure, after a remarkable run in the stock market, that you will be able to handle a sharp downturn when it eventually comes. Personally, I\u2019ve salted away my savings in broad stock and bond indexes with money that I don\u2019t expect to need for years, and I\u2019m careful to limit my own stock allocation. I don\u2019t ignore the market. I examine it daily, and if I become convinced that it is shaky, I will reduce my own holdings \u2014 and say so \u2014 but haven\u2019t taken much off the table lately. We all have to live with our own choices. I\u2019m choosing to celebrate but also to be very careful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eton Park to Shut Down as $3 Trillion Hedge Fund Industry Faces Turmoil", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byA well-known money manager is shutting down his firm after a year of disappointing results \u2014 the latest sign of turmoil in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry.Eric Mindich, 49, was once a Wall Street wunderkind, becoming the youngest ever partner at Goldman Sachs more than 20 years ago. He launched Eton Park Capital Management in 2004, expanding it to manage as much as $14 billion.But on Thursday he said he was throwing in the towel. In a letter to investors reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Mindich said a mix of challenging market conditions and Eton Park\u2019s poor performance had led to the decision. The firm\u2019s assets under management have fallen by half since 2011.\u201cA combination of industry headwinds, a difficult market environment and, importantly, our own disappointing 2016 results have challenged our ability to continue to maintain the scale and scope we believe necessary to pursue our investment program,\u201d Mr. Mindich wrote.At the same time, state pension funds led by the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System are dumping their hedge fund portfolios, contending many strategies are too complex and costly \u2014 especially at a time when many firms are underperforming.Eton Park, based in Manhattan, will begin returning its roughly $7 billion in capital to investors, and anticipates returning about 40 percent of its outside money by the end of April.The decision by Mr. Mindich to close the firm comes after a tough year in 2016, when Eton Park\u2019s returns were down about 9.4 percent. So far this year, the fund\u2019s performance has been flat.The firm sent out the letter on Thursday after notifying its roughly 120 employees of the decision to close.Over all, 2016 was one of the worst years for hedge fund closures since the financial crisis, with hundreds of smaller funds closing because of poor performance, investor redemptions and complaints about high fees.In all, 1,057 hedge funds closed or were liquidated in 2016, compared with 729 openings, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc. The number of active hedge funds is at its lowest level since 2012.In a sign of the industry\u2019s continuing struggles, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index \u2014 a broad measure of hedge fund performance \u2014 was up just 2.23 percent for the year at the end of February, compared with a roughly 5 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 during that time.One of the larger hedge funds to shut down last year was Perry Capital, the firm founded by Richard C. Perry, another Goldman alumnus. And one of the notable small hedge fund closures was Eaglevale Partners, a firm co-founded by Marc Mezvinsky, the son-in-law of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\u201cEton Park is in good company,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cOver 1,000 funds returned their investors\u2019 money over the last year, including star-power funds.\u201dMr. Mindich and his wife, Stacey, a theater producer, are prominent philanthropists. In 2015, the couple made a $15 million gift to fund public service initiatives at Harvard. They have also donated to Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York to support children\u2019s health research.Mr. Mindich made his name as a fast-rising star on Wall Street, heading up Goldman\u2019s arbitrage desk at the age of 25. In 1994, at 27, he became Goldman\u2019s youngest partner ever and was a leader of the firm\u2019s equities arbitrage business.The arbitrage desk at Goldman, under the tutelage of Robert Rubin, who would leave Goldman to become Treasury secretary in 1995, spawned a number of hedge fund managers, including Mr. Mindich, Mr. Perry and Daniel Och, founder of Och-Ziff Capital Management.Mr. Mindich was seen as a Wall Street wunderkind when he started Eton Park. The firm started with about $3.5 billion in capital and at the time was among the biggest and splashiest hedge fund launches.And for many years, the firm posted solid returns, investing heavily in stocks, bonds and derivatives. One of the hedge fund\u2019s best years came in 2013, when it returned 22 percent. In 2008, one of the worst years for hedge funds, Eton Park lost 10 percent, but that was far better than most other firms fared.The firm grew to manage about $14 billion, and opened offices in London and Hong Kong. But a week ago, Eton Park quietly closed its London office, a sign of the trouble to come.\u201cAs responsible stewards of your capital, we have been unwilling to compromise on the business model and investment program in which you invested or the way in which we have pursued it,\u201d Mr. Mindich wrote in the letter to investors. \u201cAs a result, we have made the very difficult decision to return your capital, from a position of relative strength.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap Shares Leap 44% in Debut as Investors Doubt Value Will Vanish", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported bySnapchat is a business built in large part on disappearing messages and adding animated dog ears and flower crowns to users\u2019 selfies.As of Thursday, that business is worth about $34 billion \u2014 more than the market value of the old-line media company CBS, and about three times the size of another social media company, Twitter.Snapchat has made paper billionaires of its 20-something founders five times over.In making its stock market debut in spectacular fashion \u2014 its shares rising 44 percent on their first day of trading \u2014 Snapchat\u2019s parent, Snap Inc., has blazed a trail for other technology darlings like Uber and Spotify that remain privately held. It elated Wall Street institutions eager for a prominent initial public offering when few had surfaced for months.The company has entranced investors despite a litany of red flags, like enormous losses that are expected to persist for years, a slowdown in its once-vaunted user growth rates, and an ownership structure that gives Snapchat\u2019s founders control for decades to come.Some analysts have already shown skepticism about the newest publicly traded tech giant. One, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, says the share price should be $10, far below the company\u2019s offering price of $17, which itself was above the initial range predicted. Snap faces competition from larger companies and the challenge of a slow-growing user base, he said.Boosters of Snap\u2019s prospects argue instead that Snap has the potential to become less like Twitter and more like its biggest rival, the $395 billion Facebook. These supporters point to some of the company\u2019s obvious strengths: the 158 million people on average who used Snapchat each day by the end of 2016; the roughly 18 times a day that those users opened the app on average; the $404 million in sales that it collected last year, up from nothing three years ago.For now, investors appeared to focus on the positive. Snap raised $3.4 billion in its market debut, the most by an American tech company since Facebook\u2019s initial offering in 2012, according to data from Renaissance Capital. It was the first significant tech stock sale since at least December. And the 44 percent pop in its stock price was the biggest enjoyed by a company of a billion-dollar I.P.O. since Twitter\u2019s debut in 2013. More than 217 million shares traded on Thursday, as some investors bought and others cashed in, exceeding the number of shares Snap sold in the I.P.O.For investors in other still-private unicorns \u2014 a term for start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 the immense success of Snap\u2019s deal highlights the appetite for a tech darling, even if the company still bleeds money. Count Uber, Spotify and Airbnb within that group.\u201cThe sound you\u2019re hearing today after the Snap I.P.O. is the happy snapping of fingers of money-losing unicorns and their investors,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. \u201cIt looks like Snap has set the path to monetization.\u201dIn countless meetings during a two-week roadshow with investors, Snap executives sought to rebut some of the biggest concerns about the company\u2019s prospects. Slowing growth toward the end of last year stemmed from problems with the service\u2019s Android app. Competition from Facebook, which openly copied some of Snapchat\u2019s signature features at Instagram, would do little to dent user enthusiasm.Unlike newly public companies that seek to celebrate their first day of trading on the stock markets, Snap kept its festivities largely confined to the New York Stock Exchange. The company\u2019s top executives and board members gathered there for a closed-door breakfast, where guests were presented with pins in the shape of Snapchat\u2019s ghost mascot.Major I.P.O.s of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992.But by the time Snap\u2019s shares opened for trading at $24 each \u2014 which was later in the morning \u2014 the company\u2019s top executives had disappeared from the floor, heading to the nearby offices of one of the banks involved in the public offering, Goldman Sachs, to watch the opening. Then many staff members trekked to Snap\u2019s Midtown Manhattan offices to head back to work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap Prices I.P.O. at $17 a Share, Valuing Company at $24 Billion", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byMillennials, those 14 to 35 years old, may be as exuberantly hyped a demographic as any in recent memory.That generation has now helped power one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited stock market debuts in recent memory, making billionaires of the founders of the disappearing-message service Snapchat.Investors, attracted by Snapchat\u2019s hold on its millennial users \u2014 who check the app on average more than 18 times a day \u2014 flocked to the initial public offering, pushing the parent company, Snap Inc., to a valuation of nearly $24 billion.The stock sale sets Snap up as the most valuable American technology company to go public since Facebook nearly five years ago. And it may herald a coming wave of unicorns \u2014 technology start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by private investors \u2014 that are expected to hit the public markets in the next few years.Snap\u2019s offering was priced on Wednesday at $17 a share \u2014 a dollar more than the previously expected pricing range. The pricing came on a day when the stock market surged to another high, fed by raised expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. Shares of the social media companies Facebook and Twitter also rose.Those buying into Snap\u2019s offering did so even as warning signs have flashed over the company, based in California. It lost more than $500 million last year, and its explosive user growth appears to have hit a speed bump. And in a decision that has angered some large investors, the shares will have no voting rights, leaving control in the hands of the company\u2019s founders, who can retain that power for years even after leaving Snap.Yet when Snap begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, under the ticker name SNAP, it will command a lofty valuation multiple even richer than that of Facebook, which earned $10 billion last year.The question beyond this week is whether Snap will prove to be like mighty Facebook or embattled Twitter.Much has been riding on Snap\u2019s offering, including expectations that it will lift a moribund market in new stocks. In going public, Snap has leapt ahead of other technology darlings like Uber, Airbnb and the data-analysis provider Palantir.After a nearly two-week road show for investors that spanned the country and stretched to London, demand for Snap shares proved robust. Bankers for the company received orders totaling more than 10 times the number of shares up for sale.With a market value of almost $24 billion, including unvested stock options and grants, the company is now setting itself up with little room for error.Throughout the presentations to investors, Snap executives and their advisers kept the emphasis squarely on the promise of what first seemed like a technological lark. Instead of focusing on the core product of disappearing messages, Snapchat instead represents a new way of consuming content, largely produced by its users \u2014 laid alongside a fast-growing advertising business.At the end of 2016, Snap reported an average of 158 million active daily users. Revenue totaled about $404 million for the year, up from zero in sales three years ago. The company believes sales could reach $1 billion this year.Snap has come a long way from its beginnings in a Stanford dorm room as a service used largely by young people enamored with sending their friends pictures and video that self-destructed after seconds.Based in the fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice, the company has since introduced ways for users to broadcast \u201cstories\u201d about their days to wider audiences and pioneered the use of computer-generated lenses that transform those users into dogs or Taco Bell tacos.Now, Snap is trying to convey even greater ambitions.In the prospectus for its stock sale, the service declared itself a \u201ccamera company.\u201d So far that has included selling Spectacles, camera-equipped sunglasses that let users upload 10-second videos directly to Snapchat, which briefly captured the fancy of the tech cognoscenti. And Snap has worked on prototypes for products like drone-mounted cameras.But Mr. Spiegel and his fellow shareholders are still hoping that investors will help lift their company to Facebook-type heights. Since Mr. Zuckerberg took his business public just under five years ago, Facebook\u2019s shares have climbed more than 254 percent.The cautionary tale is that of Twitter, which celebrated a lofty stock market debut in 2013, only to have its share price tumble amid questions about its ability to grow. Twitter\u2019s stock is down about 62 percent from its initial public offering, and the company has had to fend off questions about whether it can remain an independent and publicly traded business.Analysts also raised the specter of lower growth with Snap, given that the company\u2019s user growth slowed last year.Then there is the copycatting of Snapchat\u2019s most recognizable features, from its Stories to its animated lenses and filters. Chief among the imitators is Facebook, whose Instagram service has forthrightly adopted those elements. Even smaller social networks like Medium, a blog-posting service, have rolled out similar offerings.Executives contended during the investor presentations that Snapchat\u2019s slowdown was largely due to technical issues with its Android app. And they argued that the bigger issue to look at was engagement, or, put another way, how much its audience loves the app.And Snap, under Mr. Spiegel, has argued that it will continue to roll out innovations.Regardless of whether Snap soars or sinks, its offering will significantly enrich its earliest investors, notably Mr. Spiegel and the company\u2019s other founder, Robert Murphy.With 227 million shares each, the two men are each worth more than $3 billion on paper, well ahead of their 30th birthdays.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Market Dip Bucks a Streak of Trump-Inspired Optimism", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byIt had been one of Wall Street\u2019s more confounding streaks.Until Tuesday morning, the stock market\u2019s benchmark, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, had gone 64 consecutive trading days without declining more than 1 percent at any point in a trading session.Making the streak even more remarkable, such extraordinary composure from investors had occurred in a period of political volatility as fresh controversies dogged the Trump White House and Europe braced for elections in France and elsewhere on the Continent.This optimism was tested Tuesday as the major market indicators ended down more than 1 percent, led by a sell-off in financial stocks.\u201cThere is a saying that the market makes fools of us all,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, director of research at Pension Partners, an investment advisory firm. \u201cAnd that is true here because we have been in one of the most peaceful, calm periods in the history of the stock market.\u201dThe question now is whether, after months of mostly ignoring political headlines, investors will weigh the possibility that problems with repealing the Affordable Care Act and the uproar over the Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties with Russia could weaken the president\u2019s ability to pass market-friendly laws.On Tuesday, the S.&P. 500 closed down 1.24 percent, its sharpest daily decline since October. At 161 days, it was the longest period between closing declines of 1 percent or more in the index since June 1985.In terms of intraday trading, the period without big drops in the index was the longest since 1962, beating by a wide margin the previous record of 34 days in mid-1995.For the day, the narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended down 1.14 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index finished off 1.83 percent.Large financial stocks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase led the way down on Tuesday as investors began to show concern that President Trump\u2019s daily political battles might harm his ability to push through an ambitious economic agenda. The S.&P. financials index had its biggest fall since late June, in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.The value of the dollar slipped against the euro and other major currencies.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.41 percent, generally an indication that investors were selling riskier assets and piling into safer securities like government bonds.Since November, the stock market rally has been fueled by expectations that President Trump, helped by Republican majorities in the House and the Senate, would be able to push through tax cuts, roll back regulations and kick-start a round of government-backed infrastructure spending.No signs indicate those expectations have fundamentally changed. A one-day, 1.24 percent decline three months into one of the better starts to an investment year in recent memory is no indication that a correction could be imminent, market specialists said.And many observers remain convinced that the combination of fiscal stimulus, a strong economy and low but gradually rising interest rates will remain a powerful lure for investors.\u201cThis will be the first time since the mid-1960s that the federal government may provide a positive impulse to an economy that is at full employment,\u201d said Bob Miller, a senior bond investor at BlackRock.Because interest rates are so low, a round of rate increases from the Federal Reserve is not likely to harm growth assets like stocks, Mr. Miller said.It has been precisely this type of optimistic outlook that has kept the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX \u2014 also known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge \u2014 at such historically low levels.Low volatility readings are generally seen at the end of an economic expansion as confidence, wages and markets rise in unison.Such is the case now, Mr. Bilello said, which ought to be a warning to investors that good times do not last forever.\u201cThis would be the ninth straight year that the S.&P. finishes the year higher than the year before,\u201d Mr. Bilello said. \u201cAnd if you combine that with very high valuations, it means that investors should expect more volatility going forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Motors: A Brand Is a Terrible Thing to Waste", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBut any benefit of the $2.9 billion sale is worrisomely short-term, an unwelcome skid away from the passenger-car technology. Any gain for G.M. in selling off the divisions known for building some of its most sophisticated small- and medium-sized passenger cars is outweighed by the real hazard to the corporation\u2019s longer-term health as well as that of the world\u2019s population, who most clearly don\u2019t benefit from greater emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants associated with larger, less fuel efficient cars. Along with G.M.\u2019s decision to join other car companies that have pleaded for a rollback of pending fuel economy regulations, the sale raises the question of how much G.M. learned from previous energy crises and its 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout.But if anything seems shortsighted about the sale, it is the self-inflicted loss of passenger- and small-car engineering smarts that Opel represents. With the Trump administration\u2019s avowed intention of rolling back Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards and frontal assaults on the Environmental Protection Agency and other air-quality regulators, G.M. has seemingly forgotten all the earnest statements it made back in 2009 when it was seeking a federal bailout. Back then, it just couldn\u2019t wait to get the Chevy Volt into production, and it promised it was going to be a responsible partner in cleaning up the environment it helped pollute. Now it wants to sell more gas-guzzling Chevy Suburbans, which are so much cheaper to make and more profitable to sell than ordinary-size Chevy Cruzes and Buick Regals that, well, they just can\u2019t help themselves.The last time gas prices soared, G.M.\u2019s lack of competitive passenger cars helped, along with a failing economy, push it into bankruptcy. And giving up on Opel (whose models are rebadged as Vauxhalls for the British market) is a big step in the direction of not having competitive passenger cars. Opel is a key center of G.M. excellence, competing with high credibility in the tough German market, where cars with superior safety, economy and driving dynamics are expected, unlike in the United States and China. In Opel therefore one finds what is arguably G.M.\u2019s finest assemblage of experience, knowledge and smarts in the world of passenger and small car design. Many of today\u2019s most dynamic G.M. passenger-car offerings \u2014 its best Buick sedans, for instance \u2014 are rebadged Opels. Moreover, the loss figures claimed for Opel and Vauxhall in Europe don\u2019t account for the revenue generated by these vehicle designs worldwide when sold under G.M. nameplates.Walking out on Europe and its European workers may be a recipe for short-term profit, but in the long term it could sting. The nativist impulse to quit the world\u2019s third-largest car market may suit the mood in Washington. But as G.M. ought to know by now, it\u2019s easier fixing a brand than starting a new one.Jamie Lincoln Kitman, a lawyer, is the New York bureau chief for Automobile Magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Immigration Crackdown Is Great for Private Prison Stocks", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byStrategiesNightmarish as the last two months have been for immigrants threatened by detention or deportation, it has been a marvelous time for two companies that stand to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.The worse the news for immigrants and their lawyers, the better it has been for the two companies. When a member of the Trump administration issues a memo or executive order, gives a speech or tweets about the crackdown on immigrants, shares of the two companies rise: Since the election, CoreCivic\u2019s stock price has climbed 120 percent, and Geo\u2019s has gained 80 percent.Already in 2017, CoreCivic is up about 30 percent; Geo has gained about 20 percent. \u201cWe are strongly opposed to the Trump administration policies on immigration,\u201d said Carl Takei, staff lawyer for the A.C.L.U.\u2019s national prison project. \u201cBut those policies are great for these companies.\u201dInvestor expectations that the actual business of incarceration and detention will expand under Mr. Trump have fueled their levitating share prices. \u201cIt looks as though Geo and CoreCivic have several years of sharp growth ahead of them,\u201d said Michael Kodesch, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. \u201cBased on that, they still look undervalued.\u201dIn her August memo, Ms. Yates said the private prisons \u201ccompare poorly to our own bureau facilities\u201d on financial grounds, adding that they lagged in rehabilitative services like educational programs and job training. Ms. Yates also pointed out that the federal prison population had begun to decline, thanks to revised sentencing guidelines and other reforms.But in a terse refutation of the Obama administration, Mr. Sessions said the Yates memo had \u201cimpaired the bureau\u2019s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system. \u201cTherefore,\u201d he said, \u201cI direct the Bureau to return to its previous approach.\u201d That reversal helped bolster the prison stocks.\u201cThe deportation crackdown is doing very good things for these companies,\u201d said Terry Dwyer, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors. \u201cOn a personal level, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth, but I guess business is business.\u201dWhen the companies\u2019 executives reported earnings in February, it was too early for hard numbers on how the shifts in United States policy were affecting their companies\u2019 bottom lines, but their excitement was evident.What the country is seeing, he said, is \u201creally an escalation of capacity need for all three federal agencies as a result of the president\u2019s new executive orders.\u201d Geo, he said, is prepared to help meet those needs.Mr. Zoley spoke in detail about the probable impact of one change ordered by Mr. Trump, the end of the so-called catch-and-release program. Under that effort, as Mr. Zoley put it, \u201cAs people were caught illegally crossing the border, they were held very temporarily and just let go instead of being detained.\u201dMr. Zoley said the federal government had been conducting \u201ca national canvassing of the available capacity of the entire country to help assist ICE in this new, expanded, more aggressive border security program.\u201dThe beauty of this, for Geo, is that it could expand its business in three ways. Initially, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement will need more places to detain immigrants \u201cbecause the border patrol will catch the individuals and then send them to an ICE facility,\u201d Mr. Zoley said.But that\u2019s only part of the picture. \u201cSubsequently, there will be a need by the U.S. Marshal Services for those people that have committed criminal acts and need to be detained for adjudication,\u201d he added.And further down the line, Mr. Zoley said, the federal prisons will need to incarcerate \u201cthose people who have been sentenced and need to serve their time.\u201dGeo has room to detain roughly 5,000 additional people, said Mr. Kodesch, the Canaccord Genuity analyst. And if the company is able to fill that capacity, it will mean a hefty increase in its earnings.Both Geo and CoreCivic are real estate investment trusts, and Mr. Kodesch estimated that the detention surge could result in an increase in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of $50 million, or more than 12 percent. CoreCivic has about 8,700 \u201cidle beds,\u201d he said, and if it manages to fill them, it would mean an increase of $76 million in Ebitda, a gain of about 20 percent.Eventually, the companies could also build prisons and detention centers, Mr. Kodesch said.Mr. Takei of the A.C.L.U. pointed out that the president\u2019s various policies have a \u201ccountervailing impact\u201d on the companies. Apprehending more people increases the supply of detainees, while deporting them more rapidly reduces that supply. \u201cObviously, the A.C.L.U. will fight for these people\u2019s rights and make sure there is due process,\u201d he said. This could slow the pace of deportations and, ironically, help the companies.The prison companies are intimately tied to the government, and major setbacks for the Trump administration could derail them. For now, though, the market loves them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Snap, Caterpillar\u2019s Tax, Masayoshi Son, Harvard Donor", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byInvestors seem to think Snap Inc. will stick around for longer than the messages on its app, Snapchat.You may be wondering how it could be worth that much. Certainly, there were analysts pointing out that it looked overvalued.Caterpillar, a manufacturer of heavy equipment, has been dogged by accusations that it slashed its domestic tax bill by shifting corporate profits from the United States to a subsidiary in Switzerland.A 2014 congressional investigation concluded that a scheme to move cash between the company\u2019s subsidiaries cut its United States tax bill by $2.4 billion over 13 years. A report from the investigation said that Caterpillar worked with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, now PwC, to use sham transactions to transfer $8 billion in profits to a Swiss subsidiary from 1999 to 2012.The transfers were not legitimate business transactions, but done solely to take advantage of a lower tax rate.The 2014 inquiry did not draw conclusions about whether Caterpillar had broken the law, but it appears to have piqued the interest of federal investigators. Caterpillar later received a grand jury subpoena for documents related to these transactions and it said Thursday that the search warrant was related to the investigation into its tax practices.Masayoshi Son, the billionaire technology entrepreneur who promised President Trump 50,000 new jobs in the United States, has grand plans for Sprint.The billionaire and his financial advisers are considering several possible major deals for Sprint, the struggling wireless operator that he controls through SoftBank.One possible deal is a tie-up with T-Mobile U.S., Sprint\u2019s closest competitor. Another is a merger with Comcast, the cable colossus, which would allow him to fulfill a long-held ambition to invest aggressively in wireless networks and next-generation mobile technology in the United States.SoftBank\u2019s pitch could be helped by a possible push for infrastructure investing by the Trump administration, but there are still some questions over how closely regulators would scrutinize potential deals.The donor, Charles C. Spackman, is an entrepreneur known for generous donations to the university, his alma mater.He is based in Hong Kong and leads the Spackman Group, a global investment holding company with $1.5 billion under management.The ruling was part of a long-fought quest by an aggrieved investor to collect on a judgment against Mr. Spackman involving a South Korean business deal.The case could have far-reaching implications for the college, said Douglas A. Kellner, a Manhattan lawyer specializing in recovering hidden assets worldwide.\u201cIf he diverted funds to Harvard when he should have been paying his judgment, that\u2019s a fraudulent transfer,\u201d Mr. Kellner said. \u201cThey could sue Harvard to get the money back, and they\u2019d be entitled to get it back if they can show that it was fraudulently transferred.\u201dThe lawyer handling the investor\u2019s case, however, said he had no plans to sue Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gripes About Obamacare Aside, Health Insurers Are in a Profit Spiral", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byStrategiesOver the last few years, big managed care companies like UnitedHealth Group have contributed to the furor over the fate of the Affordable Care Act by saying that important parts of it are fundamentally flawed.But Obamacare hasn\u2019t been a curse for the managed care companies. Over all, based on their share performance, it has been something of a blessing.Since March 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, the managed care companies within the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 UnitedHealth, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana and Centene \u2014 have risen far more than the overall stock index. This is no small matter: The stock market soared during that period.The numbers are astonishing. The Standard & Poor\u2019s stock index returned 135.6 percent in those seven years through Thursday, a performance that we may not see again in our lifetimes. But the managed care stocks, as a whole, have gained nearly 300 percent including dividends, according to calculations by Bespoke Investment Group.UnitedHealth, the biggest of the managed care companies, with a market capitalization that is now more than $160 billion, returned 480 percent, dividends included. An investment of $100 in the company\u2019s stock when Obamacare was signed into law would be worth more than $580.50 today.\u201cIf Obamacare has been bad for the managed care stocks, why have they performed so well under it?\u201d asked Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cAnd do they really need to be rescued by Congress?\u201dThe answers are complex but boil down to this: Basically, several analysts on Wall Street and in Washington said, the underlying businesses of the big managed care companies have actually done extremely well under Obamacare. They have run into some problems but are hardly in need of a rescue.The companies have notched profits \u2014 from expansion of Medicaid, for example, and from services aimed at cutting medical costs \u2014 while learning how to insulate themselves from parts of the law that have crimped their income. They have diversified, earning money from businesses that include data management, outpatient clinics and surgical services, as well as traditional health insurance.\u201cThe successful managed care companies, and UnitedHealth in particular, have figured out how to prosper in almost any environment \u2014 and to insulate themselves from issues that become a problem,\u201d said Gary Claxton, director of the health care marketplace project for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to health care policy. \u201cThey are making a lot of money from government programs like Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 and they are likely to keep doing so,\u201d he said, regardless of what happens in Washington.UnitedHealth, the industry bellwether, has reduced its exposure to what was its biggest problem in Obamacare: money-losing insurance that it sold in public exchanges to individuals, who often received government subsidies.With those kinds of problems, you might think that the stock market has looked with disfavor at UnitedHealth and its competitors, and that investors have been counting on Congress to repeal Obamacare and replace it within something more palatable for the insurers.But that assumption, which I made before looking at the performance of the companies\u2019 shares, couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.UnitedHealth has bolstered its position, first by abandoning those profit-sapping exchanges wholesale. That move may have troubled the stock market, because it may seem to suggest that the company was giving up on what had been an important growth opportunity.But a second maneuver, an accounting one, helped its standing in financial markets immensely, said Sheryl Skolnick, director of United States equity research for Mizuho Securities. In November 2015, UnitedHealth made an adjustment on its balance sheet, setting aside an initial \u201cpremium deficiency reserve\u201d of $200 million for expected losses in those marketplaces.Those losses have cumulatively swelled to more than $1 billion, Ms. Skolnick said, but because they have been segregated in the company\u2019s accounting, and because the company has been leaving those markets, investors have been able to easily assess the company\u2019s value \u201centirely separately from the problems it\u2019s had with the exchanges,\u201d she said. Other managed care companies have made similar provisions.Wall Street has rewarded companies like UnitedHealth for steadily increasing profits in other businesses, and generally hasn\u2019t penalized them much for the public exchange losses, Ms. Skolnick said.In Ms. Skolnick\u2019s view, the Affordable Care Act could indeed use some modifications, but the fundamental problem with the public exchanges is one of \u201cadverse selection,\u201d in which relatively sick people have occupied an outsize part of those markets, making it difficult for insurance companies to come up with profitable pricing. But the root cause is that the \u201cmandate,\u201d the requirement that everyone buy health insurance, is too weak, she said, not too strong. The House legislation would make matters worse by imposing a surcharge for people who have let their insurance lapse. \u201cI think that\u2019s weaker,\u201d she said.There are plenty of good things in Obamacare for these companies. The expansion of Medicaid has been a boon for them, said Lance Wilkes, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cIt\u2019s not a high-margin business for the managed care companies, but it\u2019s a steady one and it has been a growing one,\u201d he said. The companies offer insurance to low-income residents in various states under Medicaid, he said, while Medicare plans for older people have also been a growth area.Mr. Claxton of the Kaiser Family Foundation said, \u201cAs the baby boom population ages, people are leaving their workplace health care plans, which have been steady and profitable for the managed care companies but aren\u2019t growing, and going on Medicare in big numbers, and companies like UnitedHealth see this as an opportunity.\u201dThe Strategies column last Sunday,19 about how the stocks of managed care companies within the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index have fared since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, misstated, at one point, the surname of a director of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to health care policy. He is Gary Claxton, not Clarkson.Advertisement"}

What else is less certain? Tax reform? Infrastructure investment?After sagging last week, stocks opened lower on Monday but recovered to end the day little changed. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which fell as much as 1 percent during the day, closed down just 0.1 percent. Since Election Day, the S.&P. 500 is up more than 9 percent.Of course, the questions about changes to American tax rates still remain.Mr. Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. That number was modified to \u201canywhere from 15 to 20 percent\u201d after he was sworn in as president.It could even be as high as 28 percent.That would mean the investments that companies had been planning, based on an expectation of a lower tax rate, would become much harder for them to justify.More government news:No stranger to controversy, Carl C.

It falls when investors think a growth-damaging \u201chard Brexit\u201d is more likely, and rises when they expect a more benign outcome.When the former occurs, the pound typically weakens and the domestically focused FTSE 250 index of midcap companies is apt to underperform the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies, which tend to be more global.Investors also tend to push up the cost of insuring against a British debt default relative to Germany, and compress the gap between the yields of two- and 10-year British government notes.As a result, the Breakingviews index fell sharply in the months after the referendum in June 2016, in which Britons voted to leave the European Union. The index has since clawed back some ground, though, not least because growth has proved far more resilient than most investors and policy makers expected.Yet the chances are that the gauge will fall in the months ahead.Mrs. May wants to clamp down on immigration from other countries in the European Union, but has so far been able to avoid tricky questions about what sort of trade restrictions others will want to impose. The economic price that Britain may pay will become increasingly clear now that negotiations can start.And even before any trade barriers are erected, growth could slow. Rising inflation is eroding the spending power of households. And jobs and business investment may be more vulnerable if talks start to look rancorous.Indeed, investors may be underestimating how closely political divorces can match real ones for bitterness and damage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Physicist\u2019s Crash Course in Unpeeling the Universe", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Making theoretical physics accessible to the lay reader is no easy feat. The best popular science books welcome the novice while engaging and informing the more scientifically savvy. Compounding the author\u2019s challenge is the need to distinguish between speculation, ideas that might be verified in the future, and what is just fanciful thinking.In \u201cReality Is Not What It Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity,\u201d first published in Italy in 2014, the physicist Carlo Rovelli explains how he thinks about physics and his research on loop quantum gravity. He covers important ideas and developments, and readers with a basic curiosity about modern physics will find much to pique their interest. The book tours many of the crowd-pleasers of modern physics literature \u2014 quantum mechanics and general relativity, attempts at creating theories of quantum gravity and even time \u2014 as well as more speculative quantum gravity ideas. It is peppered with the usual names: Einstein, Newton, Plato, Aristotle, Democritus, Galileo, Dante and Lucretius.Rovelli explains that he wrote \u201cwith a particular reader in mind, someone who knows little or nothing about today\u2019s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don\u2019t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world \u2014 and where we are searching.\u201d This latest offering will attract readers to many important and relevant physics developments, some of which Rovelli presented in his earlier book, \u201cSeven Brief Lessons on Physics.\u201d He nicely conveys the magnificence of the changes in physicists\u2019 worldview that have emerged in the last century as well as ideas that motivate his more recent research.However, Rovelli takes on some challenging issues \u2014 and reality is not always the way that he sees it.The science as presented isn\u2019t always correct, and interpretations are misleadingly presented as facts. Explaining quantum mechanics, Rovelli says: \u201cElectrons don\u2019t always exist. They exist when they interact. They materialize in a place when they collide with something else. The \u2018quantum leaps\u2019 from one orbit to another constitute their way of being real: An electron is a combination of leaps from one interaction to another.\u201dStocks may not achieve a precise value until they are traded, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t approximate their worth until they change hands. Similarly electrons might not have definite properties, but they do exist. It\u2019s true that the electron doesn\u2019t exist as a classical object with definite position until the position is measured. But something was there \u2014 which physicists use a wave function to describe.At a time when people can disagree about the sizes of the crowds before their eyes, it should come as no surprise that they can disagree on scientific theories that are even harder to discern. But in today\u2019s toxic political climate, when deliberate ambiguity and \u201calternative facts\u201d stand in for knowledge, it\u2019s never been more important for scientists and academics to be accurate in their presentation of what we know. I admire Rovelli\u2019s goals, but they would be better served if he were more careful.\u201cReality Is Not What It Seems\u201d is \u201ca travel book,\u201d Rovelli writes, \u201cdescribing one of the most spectacular journeys that humanity has taken: a journey out of our limited and parochial views of reality, toward an increasingly vast understanding of things. A magical journey out of our common-sense view of things, far from complete.\u201d His many historical and philosophical digressions can be amusing, and anyone unfamiliar with the characters in the book will find much to enjoy here. Yet oversimplifications devalue these references too. It\u2019s a leap to say \u201cthe connection between problems posed by the scientists of antiquity and solutions found by Einstein and quantum gravity is, as we shall see, surprisingly close.\u201dWedging old ideas into new thinking is analogous to equating thousand-dollar couture adorned with beads and feathers and then marketed as \u201ctribal fashion\u201d to homespun clothing with true cultural and historical relevance. Ideas about relativity or gravity in ancient times weren\u2019t the same as Einstein\u2019s theory. Art (and science) are in the details. Either elementary matter is extended or it is not. The universe existed forever, or it had a beginning. Atoms of old aren\u2019t the atoms of today. Egg and flour are not a souffl\u00e9. Without the appropriate care, it all just collapses.Science provides a systematic method of building up from the measured and tested ideas and equations we agree on to realms that we don\u2019t yet understand because measurements are not yet sufficiently precise or are too far outside our limited perspective. If presented correctly, the scientific view of reality clarifies many of the spurious controversies we often encounter by separating what we know from what we are still trying to understand.The beauty of physics lies in its precise statements, and that is what is essential to convey. Many readers won\u2019t have the background required to distinguish fact from speculation. Words can turn equations into poetry, but elegant language shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of understanding. Rovelli isn\u2019t the first author guilty of such romanticizing, and I don\u2019t want to take him alone to task. But when deceptively fluid science writing permits misleading interpretations to seep in, I fear that the floodgates open to more dangerous misinformation.A great chef once told me that many of his most talented colleagues had at one point been smokers and, as a result, tend to use a bit too much salt. This turns out in any case to be what many palates prefer. \u201cReality Is Not What It Seems\u201d is a bit oversalted in an intellectual way. It isn\u2019t junk food. It\u2019s more akin to P.F. Chang\u2019s. Everything on the menu looks enticing and perhaps even a bit exotic, and the service and ambience are pretty good. But the end product, though tasty, isn\u2019t always as nourishing and sustaining as one might have hoped.Lisa Randall is a professor of theoretical particle physics at Harvard University and the author of \u201cDark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life Agree to Merge", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byTwo big British financial firms, Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management, are joining forces, in a $4.7 billion deal that reflects the rising pressure on money managers that try to beat the markets.The deal would create a combined company with roughly 660 billion pounds of assets under administration at a time when investors are favoring low-cost index funds over portfolios that actively trade bonds and stocks. Actively focused firms like Aberdeen and Standard Life are facing increased competition from behemoths like the Vanguard Group and BlackRock that specialize in index funds.It often comes down to fees. Firms like Vanguard offer ultralow expenses on funds that try to match stock and bond benchmarks. Active managers typically charge more, with the goal of trying to beat the index, although they do not always live up to the promise.Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management said on Monday that they had agreed to an all-share deal to create Britain\u2019s largest asset manager, worth about $13.5 billion based on their stock market value. The transaction, in which Aberdeen investors would exchange their holdings for shares in Standard Life, valued Aberdeen at \u00a33.8 billion, or about $4.7 billion. Standard Life shareholders would own two-thirds of the combined company.The company has developed an expertise in emerging markets, but in recent years, investors have pulled back from that area. The company had \u00a310.5 billion in net outflows in its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December.Standard Life, which is based in Edinburgh, was founded in 1825 as a life insurance company and moved into dedicated asset management with the creation of Standard Life Investments in 1998. It has remade itself broadly as an investment company, buying asset managers and expanding internationally, while reducing the size of its insurance unit.Its biggest business is Standard Life Investments, followed by its pensions and savings business in Britain. Those two lines accounted for 95 percent of its operating profit last year.The combined company would be based in Scotland and use branding from both Standard Life and Aberdeen, the companies said. Standard Life\u2019s chairman, Gerry Grimstone, would serve as chairman of the combined company, while Simon Troughton, the Aberdeen chairman, would serve as deputy chairman. Mr. Skeoch and Mr. Gilbert would become co-chief executives of the combined company.The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Goldman Sachs and the law firm Slaughter and May are advising Standard Life.

{"Headline": "Stocks Briefly Tumble After Health Care Overhaul Falters", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byFor a time on Monday, one question appeared to haunt stock market investors from Tokyo to Manhattan: Will President Trump be able to live up to his promises to reduce taxes and cut regulation?Belief in such business-friendly, pro-growth measures has been driving a rally in stocks since the November election. But a weekend\u2019s worth of second-guessing over Washington\u2019s failure to move forward on health care legislation has injected some skepticism into the market.\u201cFriday\u2019s health care outcome was a reality check for investors,\u201d Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer at the Bessemer Trust, a $63 billion private investment company, said in an email.The market had seemed almost immune to political turmoil. For months, declines of 1 percent or more were unknown. Stocks sagged last week, however, amid signs of political obstacles to the replacement of the Affordable Care Act, and they opened sharply lower on Monday. The market recovered to end the day little changed.The health care legislation by itself had not been seen as of huge significance to the markets. But traders and longer-term investors said Monday that the bill\u2019s failure was worrisome. Corporate and individual tax changes, a $1 trillion infrastructure investment and other items on the Trump agenda that have goosed the markets may now prove illusory, they added.\u201cThe inability for him to pass health care reform casts doubt upon his ability to get large-scale tax reform passed,\u201d said Erin Browne, head of macro-investing for the O\u2019Connor hedge fund division of the Swiss bank UBS.Because the health care legislation was needed to help make tax cuts work within the current budget, the market is \u201cnow looking at either a much more modest tax reform or at tax cuts, which are certainly not going to be as economically beneficial,\u201d Ms. Browne said.Other markets suggested that many were unsettled by Mr. Trump\u2019s crash course in political science.The United States dollar, as measured by a Bloomberg index that tracks it against other major world currencies, fell to a level unseen since days after the president\u2019s upset victory in the election. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 which falls when more people buy the notes, often as they gravitate toward lower-risk investments \u2014 sank to its lowest levels in a month.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which fell as much as 1 percent on Monday, ended the day down just 0.1 percent. Since Election Day, the S.&P. 500 is up more than 9 percent.The narrower Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.2 percent lower for its first eight-session losing streak since 2011 and only the third such streak since 1990, the Bespoke Investment Group said.The Nasdaq composite index closed up 0.2 percent.Overseas markets were generally lower, with Tokyo down 1.4 percent and London off 0.6 percent.The truth, Ms. Patterson of Bessemer said in her email, is that \u201clegislation is a tricky, messy process.\u201dIn some corners of the market, that acknowledgment has had a particularly sobering effect. Certain sectors that had reached stratospheric levels of late on hopes of promised regulatory rollbacks and other propulsive policy measures are now tumbling to earth.Shares of Wall Street banks and other financial companies, which have benefited from Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to reconsider the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and are now down sharply since early March, are one example. Energy stocks, which have been harmed by the lack of detail on Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans and by falling oil prices, have also slid.One beneficiary of the failed health care bill? Hospital operators like HCA. Its shares surged more than 5 percent Monday.Some investors, of course, have simply decided to pocket the gains they have already earned in stocks.

Corporate earnings have been solid. Growth indicators in Asia and Europe, and in the United States, have been encouraging, all of which argues for continued optimism in the market.It may even be a good window in which to buy.\u201cAs long as the broader economic trends are intact, which we think they are, these sell-offs are usually a great opportunity for investors looking to put cash to work,\u201d Ms. Patterson said.An earlier version of a graphic with this article misstated the years represented.

{"Headline": "Caution Signals Are Blinking for the Trump Bull Market", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewDespite an eight-day losing streak that ended on Tuesday, the stock market has generally been buoyant in the opening weeks of the Trump administration. The bullish mood could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and lead to continuing gains for a while.Yet important measurements \u2014 some of which I developed \u2014 tell us that the market is quite expensive and that investor optimism is tinged with plenty of worry. None of this tells us where the market is going tomorrow, but it suggests that some caution is advisable, and that returns over the next decade or so are likely to be constrained.Consider first the evidence from what is often called the Shiller CAPE ratio.We found back then that averaging earnings over 10 years smoothed short-run or cyclical fluctuations, providing a better indicator of fundamental value. The CAPE ratio has successfully explained about a third of the variation in real 10-year stock market returns in United States history since 1881.This is the important point: In 1988, we found that CAPE had averaged about 15 since 1881. In years when CAPE was lower than that, subsequent 10-year returns for the stock market tended to be good. In years when it was higher, the 10-year returns tended to be bad.That\u2019s why today\u2019s CAPE is sending a troubling message. The ratio is now almost 30. Using monthly data, it has been higher only in 1929, when it reached 33, and in the few years around 2000, when it reached 44. In both instances, sharp market declines followed those very high readings. The current level of CAPE suggests a dim outlook for the American stock market over the next 10 years or so, but it does not tell us for sure nor does it say when to expect a decline. As I said, CAPE is useful, but it does not provide a clear guide to the future.Investor sentiment is another factor, and current readings also give us cause for concern.Valuation confidence in February was quite low. The only time it has been lower was in the years surrounding the market peak of 2000. In February, crash confidence was quite low too, though it has been slightly lower on a number of occasions since 1989. These two indicators might seem to confirm the apparent signal of the CAPE ratio: trouble ahead. They are certainly saying that investors aren\u2019t confident that current prices are reasonable or that the market is stable.But one metric went the opposite direction. One-year confidence is at a record high for institutional investors, and it is at the highest level since 2007 for individual investors. (That means, by the way, that in 2007, the eve of the Great Recession and financial crisis, most people had no clue that big problems were imminent.)It is hard to reconcile these results. One possible interpretation might be that respondents perceive a stock market bubble: They think valuations are high and there is a non-negligible probability of a crash. At the same time, they are hanging in because they think the Trump boom will probably last for at least another year.That doesn\u2019t provide much reassurance. The high fraction of our survey respondents who think that the stock market is unlikely to fall in the next year may simply reflect a failure of imagination about how a Trump bull market could suddenly end. There are scores of ways, of course. Just because people can\u2019t picture a big decline doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t react very badly if the market comes under real stress.Many people appear to believe that a business-oriented president will preside over a long stock market boom. At a glance, there appears to be some precedent for this, first with the 1920 election that brought in President Warren G. Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge (who took over when Harding died in 1923) and then with the 1980 victory of Ronald Reagan. These elections were followed by the Roaring Twenties of 1921 to 1929 and the Millennium Boom market of 1982 to 2000.But in both cases, during the initial election campaigns the economy was in recession and the CAPE ratio was extremely low \u2014 around 5 in 1920 and 9 in 1980.We are in a very different situation now. The economy has largely recovered from the last recession, and CAPE shows us that stocks are now relatively expensive.There is no clear message from all of this. Long-term investors shouldn\u2019t be alarmed and shouldn\u2019t avoid stocks altogether. But my bottom line is that the high pricing of the market \u2014 and the public perception that the market is indeed highly priced \u2014 are the most important factors for the current market outlook. And those factors are negative.We don\u2019t know where the market will go this month or this year. It could well rise a lot. But investors should not let themselves be tempted to bet aggressively on the Trump bull market.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

Shares opened at $24 on Thursday and closed at $24.48, a 44 percent jump from the offering price the company had set.But industry analysts grew leery of the slowing user growth the app experienced last year.The initial public offering of Snap, which is based in Los Angeles, was the most eagerly awaited arrival since Twitter entered the market in 2013.In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said its app had 158 million daily users in its fourth quarter, up 48 percent from the prior-year period. But Wall Street has become skittish about future growth.The app\u2019s rate of user growth slowed during 2016, with just five million new users in the final quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the app had added 13 million.Snap blamed the slowing growth late in the year on technical problems, saying the launch of several products and the release of multiple updates had hurt the performance of its app.Social media companies have had mixed success since their initial public offerings. Where Facebook has soared, Twitter has struggled to find its way.Facebook, which debuted on Wall Street in 2012, has had its ad revenue and its user base grow quickly. Twitter, which had its initial public offering in 2013, has experienced stalling revenue growth, and since the return of its co-founder Jack Dorsey, the company has cut costs and shuffled its leadership.Twitter is now valued at $11 billion while Facebook is valued at $395 billion.Snap, upon its public offering, became more valuable than stalwarts like American Airlines, Macy\u2019s and Xerox.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Dearth of I.P.O.s, but It\u2019s Not the Fault of Red Tape", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe confirmation hearing last week for Jay Clayton, who has been nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, focused on the continued sluggishness of the market for initial public offerings. Senators pushed the nominee to do something, anything, to revive it.The problem is that there is no magic wand \u2014 including deregulation \u2014 that can fix the decline.The problems were recently documented in a research note by Credit Suisse titled \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks.\u201d The bank documented that the total number of companies listed on the United States stock market plummeted by nearly half, to 3,671 last year from 7,322 in 1996.Such shrinkage has prompted hand-wringing for over a decade. At Mr. Clayton\u2019s hearing, at least five senators brought it up, pointing to the regulatory burdens on companies going public.There\u2019s only one problem with casting regulation as the villain: There\u2019s not much evidence for it.Moreover, the JOBS Act has done nothing to revive the market for small companies, those with a market capitalization of under $75 million. They still number less than a handful each year.And while fingers get pointed at regulation like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the number of initial public offerings fell off the cliff in 1996 \u2014 years before either bill was passed. So there must be something more here.Those who have examined this issue have come up with a number of possible reasons.The Credit Suisse paper also brings up this theory, noting that mergers are the major cause for companies to be delisted from a stock exchange. It appears that this deal activity has spread to the private markets, co-opting the process of taking companies public.For example, Cisco Systems purchased AppDynamics on the eve of its market debut. And acquirers seem willing to pay top dollar in these instances, as research and development by many large corporations now consists largely of acquiring smaller, usually private, companies.This is aptly illustrated by the buying sprees of Google and Facebook, which took candidates to go public \u2014 like Instagram, Nest, Waze and WhatsApp \u2014 out of contention.In 1996, average proceeds for an initial public offering were $85.7 million, and 54 percent of these offerings were considered small, with a market capitalization below $75 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 2014, however, average proceeds were $186.4 million and only 4 percent of offerings were small.The market for new issues has moved toward liquidity and bigger stocks. Mutual funds prefer making big investments rather than small ones for liquidity and administrative purposes \u2014 lots of small investments simply require more people and more monitoring.A third possibility is that companies simply no longer need the public market. The private markets are more efficient, and financing is readily available from venture capitalists and banks.There are even markets and mechanisms that exist not only to allow for financing, but to allow for selling employees\u2019 and founders\u2019 shares in private markets. In addition, the JOBS Act allowed companies to expand the number of shareholders and still be private, a change that encouraged companies to remain private.There are other theories. One of these notes that the 1990s saw a surge in I.P.O. activity and that we are just back to what the activity was in the 1970s and \u201980s. Who is to say what is a normal market?Another possible reason is that companies are shying away from the public markets to avoid shareholder activism, short-termism and the glare of public scrutiny.Yet the growing use of dual class shares and staggered boards by new companies, measures that help founders retain control, argues against this need. And they are tools that can be used by any company \u2014 even Shake Shack went public with dual-class stock.The bottom line is that while there might be rational reasons to reduce regulation on capital raising \u2014 to make it easier and less expensive \u2014 we are kidding ourselves if we think that simply deregulating will bring back initial public offerings.The task is much harder. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, could help build an infrastructure for buying small company offerings. Allowing mutual funds more latitude to buy illiquid small investments and to change their compensation structures if they do would be a big step.Then there is the argument that maybe we shouldn\u2019t do anything, given how hard it will be. The idea behind the public markets is to provide capital funding. But if the private markets are now efficient and capable of providing even less expensive capital at lower cost, maybe we should be fine with the current state of affairs.Still, that overlooks the fact that for most of us, our retirement money is in the public markets. We should be worried about all of this money flowing into a smaller and smaller group of companies.One answer is to allow mutual funds to invest more in private companies. Already 26 mutual fund groups had $11.5 billion invested in late-stage companies in 2016, according to Credit Suisse.That\u2019s one answer, but that will result in yet more intermediaries. The better solution is to push more companies to the public markets. Deregulating is one thing, but the real work will require more innovative thinking from market regulators. That\u2019s your homework, Mr. Clayton.On a personal note, I\u2019ve been writing the Deal Professor column for DealBook for over nine years now, and this will be my last column before I take an extended sabbatical to work on other projects.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "At BlackRock, Machines Are Rising Over Managers to Pick Stocks", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byScore one for the machines.The largest fund company in the world, BlackRock, has faced a thorny challenge since it acquired the exchange-traded-fund business from Barclays in 2009.These low cost, computer-driven funds have exploded in growth, leaving in the dust the stock pickers who had spurred an earlier expansion for the firm. The rise of passive investing \u2014 exchange-traded funds, index funds and the like \u2014 has revolutionized the investment world, providing Main Street investors with greater opportunities at lower fees while putting pressure on even Wall Street\u2019s biggest money managers.Now, after years of deliberations, Laurence D. Fink, a founder and chief executive of BlackRock, has cast his lot with the machines.On Tuesday, BlackRock laid out an ambitious plan to consolidate a large number of actively managed mutual funds with peers that rely more on algorithms and models to pick stocks.The initiative is the most explicit action by a major fund management firm in reaction to the exodus of investors from actively managed stock funds to cheaper funds that track every variety of index and investment theme.Some $30 billion in assets (about 11 percent of active equity funds) will be targeted, with $6 billion rebranded BlackRock Advantage funds. These funds focus on quantitative and other strategies that adopt a more rules-based approach to investing.\u201cThe democratization of information has made it much harder for active management,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview. \u201cWe have to change the ecosystem \u2014 that means relying more on big data, artificial intelligence, factors and models within quant and traditional investment strategies.\u201dAs part of the restructuring, seven of BlackRock\u2019s 53 stock pickers are expected to step down from their funds. Several of the money managers will stay on as advisers. At least 36 employees connected to the funds are leaving the firm.While BlackRock is proceeding gradually, in many ways the new plan is a direct attack on the cult of the brainy mutual fund manager, popularized in the 1980s and 1990s by Peter Lynch, a stock-picking wizard at the fund giant Fidelity.Today, asset managers like Pimco, Franklin Templeton, Aberdeen and, of course, Fidelity continue to make the case that their bond and equity managers can outsmart the broader market \u2014 and charge a premium price for doing so.Since 2009, however, as the performance of these funds has suffered, millions of investors have rejected this proposition, abandoning their expensive mutual funds for better-performing funds that track various indexes at a fraction of the cost.Now the biggest fund companies are Vanguard, the indexing pioneer, and BlackRock, which together oversee close to $10 trillion in assets.BlackRock, with its fleet of iShares E.T.F.s, has certainly benefited from the investor revolution \u2014 one that threatens to disrupt the mutual fund industry in the years ahead.Still, the monster in the mutual fund room by far has been Vanguard, which, via index funds and exchange-traded funds, has had historic inflows.Last year, for example, $423 billion left actively managed stock funds and $390 billion poured into index funds, according to Morningstar. Of that amount, Vanguard captured $277 billion, nearly tripling the amount that went to its nearest rival, BlackRock.Mr. Fink has always professed to be agnostic as to whether a client bought a no-frills exchange-traded fund tracking low volatility stocks or an expensive mutual fund investing in small United States companies.Let the client choose has long been his mantra.Left unsaid has been the reality that at his root Mr. Fink is now a true believer in systematic investing styles that favor algorithms, science and data-reliant models over the stock picking smarts of individual portfolio managers.And since last year, BlackRock\u2019s dyed-in-the-wool stock pickers have worked in the same division as its quants. These managers, many of whom have Ph.D.s, might buy (or sell) Walmart\u2019s stock on the basis of a satellite feed that reveals how many cars are in its parking lots as opposed to an insight gleaned from the innards of the retailer\u2019s balance sheet.Just about any interview or conference call with Mr. Fink bears this out: Invariably, the conversation comes around to technology, with scant mention of what the firm\u2019s stock pickers are doing.But simply going all-in on machine-driven passive investing over active has not been an option for Mr. Fink. While the assets of the firm\u2019s actively managed stock funds have shrunk to $201 billion today from $208 billion in 2009, the business is still very profitable for BlackRock, representing 16 percent of total revenue.According to data from Morningstar, only 11 percent of BlackRock\u2019s actively managed equity funds have beaten their benchmarks since 2009. Since 2012, $27.5 billion has left BlackRock actively managed mutual funds, per Morningstar data.The new push, which is being overseen by Mark Wiseman, a top executive at Canada\u2019s top pension fund whom Mr. Fink hired last year to revamp his equity business, highlights strategies in which a portfolio manager makes big bets on a select group of stocks.Still, there is no mistaking the larger message: Expensive, actively managed funds looking to make a mark picking United States stocks must adapt to the new realities at BlackRock.Take BlackRock\u2019s Large Cap Core fund, which invests in big American companies. Since 2009, the fund\u2019s assets have halved, to $1.5 billion, trailing the index by 1.3 percent over the last three years.The fund\u2019s lead manager will be replaced by three portfolio experts from BlackRock\u2019s quantitative investing team, where all varieties of computer models are crunched in pursuit of stock picking ideas. Fees will also be halved.Of course, none of these moves are likely to immediately halt the outflows of the past years. In fact outflows are likely to increase, as few investors want to stick with a fund undergoing an existential makeover.But as Mr. Fink and his new equity deputy see it, it is better to take the pain now than later.\u201cThe old way of people sitting in a room picking stocks, thinking they are smarter than the next guy \u2014 that does not work anymore,\u201d Mr. Wiseman said. \u201cThese are stormy seas for active managers, but we at BlackRock are an aircraft carrier, and we are going to chart our way through these seas.\u201dAdvertisement"}
