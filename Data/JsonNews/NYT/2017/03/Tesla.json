{"Headline": "Trump Is a Chinese Agent", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byThe big story everyone is chasing is whether President Trump is a Russian stooge. Wrong. That\u2019s all a smoke screen. Trump is actually a Chinese agent. He is clearly out to make China great again. Just look at the facts.Imagine if Trump were negotiating with China now as not only the U.S. president but also as head of a 12-nation trading bloc based on our values and interests. That\u2019s called l-e-v-e-r-a-g-e, and Trump just threw it away \u2026 because he promised to in the campaign \u2014 without, I\u2019d bet, ever reading TPP. What a chump! I can still hear the clinking of champagne glasses in Beijing.But Trump took his Make China Great campaign to a new level on Tuesday by rejecting the science on climate change and tossing out all Obama-era plans to shrink our dependence on coal-fired power. Trump also wants to weaken existing mileage requirements for U.S.-made vehicles. Stupid.O.K., Mr. President, let\u2019s assume for a second that climate change is a hoax. Do you believe in math? There are now 7.5 billion people on the planet, and there will be 8.5 billion by 2030, according to the United Nations population bureau \u2014 and most will want to drive like us, eat protein like us and live in houses like us. And if they do, we\u2019ll eat up, burn up, smoke up and choke up the planet \u2014 and devour our fisheries, coral reefs, rivers and forests \u2014 at a pace we\u2019ve never seen before. Major cities in India and China already can\u2019t breathe; wait for when there are another billion people.That means that clean power, clean water, clean air, clean transportation and energy-efficient buildings will have to be the next great global industry, whether or not there is climate change. The demand will be huge.So what is China doing? Its new five-year plan is a rush to electric cars, batteries, nuclear, wind, solar and energy efficiency \u2014 and a cap-and-trade system for carbon. Trump\u2019s plan? More coal and oil. Hello? How can America be great if we don\u2019t dominate the next great global industry \u2014 clean power?\u201cMore than half the electric vehicles sold in the U.S. are sold in California,\u201d said Hal Harvey, C.E.O. of Energy Innovation. \u201cIf there are two jurisdictions hellbent on transformation, it is China and California. There have been 200 million E.V.s sold in China already. They\u2019re called electric bicycles, which cost about $400 \u2014 quiet, not contributing to congestion or pollution, and affordable.\u201dChina is loving this: It\u2019s doubling down on clean energy \u2014 because it has to and it wants to leapfrog us on technology \u2014 and we\u2019re doubling down on coal, squandering our lead in technology.If you liked buying your oil from Saudi Arabia, you\u2019ll love buying your electric cars, solar panels, efficiency software and batteries from China.Finally, Trump wants to slash the State Department and foreign aid budgets and make it harder for people to immigrate to America, particularly Muslims. This opens the way for China to expand its influence across the developing world and signals the smartest math and science students in the world to start their start-ups overseas and not in America.So you tell me that Trump is not a Chinese agent. The only other explanation is that he\u2019s ignorant and unread \u2014 that he\u2019s never studied the issues or connected the dots between them \u2014 so Big Coal and Big Oil easily manipulated him into being their chump, who just tweeted out their talking points to win votes here and there \u2014 without any thought to grand strategy. Surely that couldn\u2019t be true?Advertisement"}

Despite really knowing a good proportion of the rest, I felt a little petulant, to be honest, upon finishing. I knew there had to be something but I didn\u2019t get the puzzle\u2019s trick until I looked at the solved grid as a whole. You may have glommed onto it quicker but I face-palmed and liked it.This puzzle\u2019s common thread is subtle to the point of a whisper, but it is an appropriately smart, solvable Tuesday construct. There are five across answers that end in five-letter words that are all anagrams of one another, two of which made it into the Tricky Clues below. All but one of the possible one-word anagrams are used, all at the end of the answer phrases.There is a bit of misdirection, I believe, in the case of two sort-of-twinned down answers, 3 and 36, that made me think that something else involving orders or admonitions was going on. In addition, the bottommost anagrammed entry seems to be there for a reason, but not a fully developed one.All in all, an elaborate scheme from Mr. Cheng, as well as a couple of side shoots, intentional or not.\u25a0 1A: I put \u201cbadges\u201d here instead of MEDALS. I was thinking about \u201cRed Badge of Courage\u201d and \u201cBadge of Honor\u201d and paying no attention to most of the down crosses. It worked with 3D and so I held onto it for the longest time. As in life, sometimes there are two good answers to one question.\u25a0 24A: I took \u201cHow cheap!\u201d as an insult and scratched around for something along the lines of stingy, parsimonious, something like that. Instead it\u2019s a more celebratory exclamation and one of the five anagrammed clues, THATS A STEAL.\u25a0 9D: \u201cIt\u2019s just for openers\u201d just has to be some cleverness, right? I got KEY pretty quick, and suspected ASPCA for 21A (\u201cWe are their voice\u201d did ring a bell but not hard enough to fill it in), but I got fixated on KEYNOTE instead of KEYCASE.The impetus for this one came from seeing the sign \u201cNikola Tesla Corner\u201d on my way to work, at Fifth Avenue and 40th Street next to Bryant Park in Manhattan. The sign commemorates Tesla\u2019s labs nearby, at 8 West 40th Street, as well as his time spent feeding pigeons in Bryant Park. As a former electrical engineer, I am pleased to introduce his full name into the puzzle.Theme is pretty straightforward, featuring the full set of the non-esoteric TESLA anagrams, ending with LAST BUT NOT LEAST. Favorite nontheme entry is definitely DON\u2019T SPEAK, which was a massive hit for No Doubt. More personally however, I liked it more because it\u2019s a phrase that stuck in my mind from the Woody Allen movie \u201cBullets Over Broadway\u201d, where Dianne Wiest\u2019s character uses the phrase repeatedly on her opposites, with much comical effect. Not laugh-out funny, but I just found it very amusing and memorable for some reason. Not surprisingly, she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for that role.Constructor logs: This was submitted way back in November 2013, and accepted in April 2014.What did you think?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars Can\u2019t Cure Traffic, but Economics Can", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byThe CommuteIt\u2019s easy to get giddy about self-driving cars. Older people and preteens will become more independent and mobile. The scourge of drunken driving will disappear. People will be able to safely play video games while on the freeway to work.But there is one problem autonomous driving is unlikely to solve: the columns of rush-hour gridlock that clog city streets and freeways. If decades of urban planning and economic research are any guide, the solution is unlikely to come from technology but from something similar to Uber\u2019s surge pricing: charging people more to use driverless cars at rush hour.These various technologies share a common theme. One way or another, they promise to expand the nation\u2019s roads \u2014 literally, in the case of Mr. Musk\u2019s tunnels, figuratively, in the case of flying cars, and efficiently, in the case of self-driving ones. While it is possible that one or all of these technologies will increase road capacity to the point at which no amount of traffic will fill them, history gives us reasons to be skeptical.Decades\u2019 worth of studies show that whenever cities add roads, new drivers simply fill them up. This isn\u2019t because of new development or population growth \u2014 although that\u2019s part of the story \u2014 but because of a vicious cycle in which new roads bring new demand that no amount of further roads can satisfy.Economists call this latent demand, which is a fancy way of saying there are always more people who want to drive somewhere than there is space for them to do it. So far anyway, nothing cities have done to increase capacity has ever sped things up.That\u2019s where charging people during busy times comes in. \u201cMaybe autonomous cars will be different from other capacity expansions,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cBut of the things we have observed so far, the only thing that really drives down travel times is pricing.\u201d\u201cThere will be so many cars on the streets, and freight deliveries and buses and everyone else will be so slowed down, that people will get fed up and demand a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have a solution in pricing.\u201dMayor Michael R. Bloomberg met abject failure with his attempt at congestion pricing in New York. Yet London, Singapore and Stockholm have all put in such systems effectively.In the United States, the most common objection is that road pricing is regressive: Rich people get to drive alone while the masses huddle on a bus. Also, people just don\u2019t like paying for things that they are used to having free.\u201cThis idea of congestion pricing is not completely dismissed the way it once was,\u201d said Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Winston said the eventual introduction of self-driving cars would probably lessen consumer opposition to paying more to use roads during peak periods. Ride-hailing apps have taught consumers to accept surge pricing, and people are generally less resistant to paying for something new. The result would be something like variably priced lanes dedicated to fleets of robot vehicles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Roundup: Why Regulation Benefits (Yes, Benefits) Electric Cars", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byBitsA common piece of wisdom in business circles is that regulation is bad and stifles innovation.\u201cThere are lots of reasons for this, but one above all: The whole industry is being pushed by regulation, both at the federal level and in the nine states that have adopted a zero-emission plan created by regulators in California,\u201d Mr. Manjoo writes.Not surprisingly, many auto companies disagree with that sentiment, arguing that gradual acceptance of the technology and more affordable prices have contributed to the cars\u2019 popularity.So what prompted the initial investments? There is a theory: Regulations prodded companies to invest in technologies they might otherwise have ignored. This led to the commercialization of the technology.Would shifts in technology occur if companies did not get a shove? Sure. But regulation can force change to happen more quickly than if it were left to the market.More tech news:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says Regulations Impede. Perhaps Not in the Electric Car Business.", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThat\u2019s one possibility. We also have to consider another scenario: Loosening the fuel-economy rules could remove a primary incentive for big carmakers to catch up with innovative upstarts like Tesla and leave the American car industry out of step with a future ruled by electric motors rather than the internal combustion engine.This might happen because the effects of regulation are not as simple as Mr. Trump argues. The president\u2019s view that rules almost always hurt businesses is not supported by history. Researchers who study regulation and its effects on business said there have been numerous instances in which regulation speeds along, rather than impedes, technological progress. It has happened in the energy business, the electronics industry and health care.\u201cHaving long-term targets is driving investments in innovative technologies,\u201d said Don Anair, who studies the auto industry for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group. \u201cMaintaining those standards is critical for maintaining that progress.\u201dCar manufacturers disagree. A spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that represents automakers on policy issues, said that regulations themselves are not spurring sales.You might wonder why electric cars need help. If more efficient cars are so clearly better than their predecessors, shouldn\u2019t the market ensure their success?But that\u2019s not how technological progress typically works. New technologies \u2014 even ones that, on paper, look much better than old ones \u2014 usually start out at a severe disadvantage to the stuff they\u2019re up against. The first personal computers were costlier and less powerful than early mainframes, for instance, and early digital cameras were not as good as film cameras.Sometimes these technologies do not need a regulatory helping hand to get ahead. They merely get better with scale; the more that people bought digital cameras, the more manufacturers could invest in making better sensors, which became less expensive and offered better resolution, which in turn spurred sales, and on and on.Electric cars also depend on scale. Like the production of camera sensors and microprocessors, batteries and other components for electric cars also get less expensive when there is a mass market for these vehicles.But the process is slow, and it faces lots of hurdles. Switching to an electric car isn\u2019t like switching to a digital camera. Gasoline engines are entrenched in the transportation economy. To make your electric car work correctly, you need an infrastructure to support it \u2014 you need ways to charge it, repair it, maintain it, resell it. In the absence of that ecosystem, switching to a car based on a fundamentally new tech platform, even if might offer benefits in the long run, is going to be hard \u2014 which means that car companies won\u2019t have much incentive to build it.That\u2019s where regulation comes in. Traditionally, economists thought of regulation as a cost imposed by the government on companies. But in the 1990s, the economist Michael Porter argued that government rules could sometimes push industries to pursue technological innovations that they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise considered.In 2018, about 4.5 percent of a company\u2019s sales in the covered states must be zero-emission vehicles (the cars can be fully electric, plug-in hybrids or powered by hydrogen fuel cell). By 2025, that rises to 22 percent. But the requirements are flexible. To meet the standards, car companies can decline to make electric vehicles and instead buy \u201ccredits\u201d from other manufacturers; companies that sell more electric cars than the minimum standard can sell their extra credits.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that the standard itself is creating an environment of competition, which is leading to rapid advances in electrification over the last seven years,\u201d said Mr. Anair of the Union of Concerned Scientists.But the California rules under which we\u2019ve seen these advances were made possible by a federal waiver granted by the Obama administration. Some environmentalists now worry that the Trump administration could attempt to revoke that waiver \u2014 and with it, the nation\u2019s best shot at moving beyond gas engines.Advertisement"}

Immelt, General Electric\u2019s chief executive, says climate change is real, a position at odds with the Trump administration.As a member of a White House manufacturing advisory council, he also has President Trump\u2019s ear. And environmentalists are counting on Mr. Immelt, and other executives close to the president, to use that access to argue for policies to combat global warming when the White House is rolling them back.\u201cMr. Trump says the business perspective is especially important, so hearing the business voice is critical,\u201d said Kevin Moss, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington.\u201cThe companies are demonstrating that it\u2019s in their business interest to take action on climate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more they\u2019re willing to say that and take action, the stronger the message comes across.\u201dThose hopes have become increasingly urgent as Mr. Trump \u2014 against the warnings of scientists, environmentalists and even the government\u2019s own research \u2014 has moved to nullify the Obama administration\u2019s efforts on climate change.In a joint statement after the order, a group of technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, urged Mr. Trump to stay the course.\u201cStrong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change,\u201d they said.That action also spurred Mr. Immelt to write a blog post to G.E.\u2019s 300,000 employees in which he criticized the rollback.Jennifer Friedman, a General Electric spokeswoman, declined to say whether Mr. Immelt intended to relay his thoughts to Mr. Trump personally. Many other companies also declined to commit their executives to intervening with the president on climate-related policies.But Ms. Friedman emphasized that Mr. Immelt was outspoken, and she cited G.E.\u2019s focus on clean energy, including Current, a subsidiary that focuses on products and services in energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage to large customers.\u201cHe\u2019s pretty out there and clear,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s his position in every conversation he has.\u201dA PepsiCo spokesman, Jay Cooney, said the company believes that \u201ccombating climate change is critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers and our world.\u201d Kevin Gardner of Walmart, said its environmental commitments were \u201cembedded in our business.\u201dThomas Hushen, spokesman for Campbell Soup, said the company supported \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in the Paris agreement and the continuation of low-carbon policies and investment in a low-carbon economy.\u201d Campbell\u2019s chief executive, Denise Morrison, participates in Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory council because \u201cwe believe it is important to have a voice on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees.\u201d Mr. Hushen said.Corporations, especially those with strong consumer brands, have been increasingly responsive to customer and shareholder concerns about climate change. And the global nature of their businesses means many of their customers are in countries where there is a greater acceptance of the science behind climate change, and the need to tackle it.Walmart, Intel, General Motors and Lockheed Martin \u2014 all of which have senior executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business councils \u2014 have signed on to the principles of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofit groups working to make corporate purchases of renewable energy easier. Last year, General Motors said it would generate or procure 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050.Dell, another company with the president\u2019s ear, says it expects to reduce the energy intensity of its products by 80 percent by 2020.\u201cIn many cases, I think businesses disagree with the administration,\u201d said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder resolutions to advocate for greater corporate environmental and social responsibility.\u201cPeople still care about climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cThe administration may not, but they do have consumers and employees and reputations to uphold.\u201dAn Intel spokeswoman, Katie Lewallen, said, \u201cRegardless of regulatory changes, we intend to continue our commitment to environmental stewardship, including working to fulfill the climate change pledge we made in 2015.\u201dEnvironmentalists also worry about the influence of companies that have opposed climate regulations. General Motors and Ford, for example, successfully advocated a review of stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution.Businesses are pushing for policies to fight climate change \u201cbecause of a well-balanced economic judgment of whether or not they should,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group.He added that sentiment among corporate executives had, after the 2009 global climate conference in Copenhagen, shifted away from the belief that fighting climate change would be too expensive.\u201cIn Paris, there was a very significant number of business leaders that had changed their minds and considered that it was going to hurt the economy if we don\u2019t do something,\u201d he said.Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building a Road Map for the Self-Driving Car", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byWheelsHow do you create a map showing every road in the United States, with the precise location of every stop sign, all the lane markings, every exit ramp and every traffic light \u2014 and update it in real time as traffic is rerouted around construction and accidents?That\u2019s a challenge that automakers and technology companies are confronting in their race to develop self-driving cars, the kind that someday will let you sit back and read or watch TV on the way to work each morning.The need for highly detailed, three-dimensional, computerized maps \u2014 which pinpoint a car\u2019s location and understand its surroundings \u2014 is often overlooked amid all the hype about autonomous vehicles. The chatter tends to focus more on the various sensors that enable cars to \u201csee\u201d the road and any obstacles in front of them. Those sensors include radar, cameras and a laser-based kind of radar known as lidar.But digital maps are an equally critical piece of the puzzle.Waymo creates the maps by driving around cars equipped with spinning lidar units mounted on their roofs that shoot out laser beams, creating images of the road and the surroundings. Human engineers, in a time-consuming process, then go over the images and tag the objects that are found, like stop signs, buildings, stoplights and do-not-enter signs. The laser equipment needed to do this scanning is expensive \u2014 it can cost $100,000 or more to outfit just one car to do this job.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.The effort may soon shift into higher gear, thanks to an idea borrowed from the internet that has helped in other fields: crowdsourcing.Mobileye supplies front-facing camera systems that enable cars to detect obstacles and brake to prevent or mitigate collisions. Starting with 2018 models, both Volkswagen and BMW will outfit their vehicles with Mobileye systems that can also transmit their precise locations and images of the roads they are traveling, which can be synthesized into one giant digital map.Mr. Shashua said his company expected to sign on many other automakers to do the same. \u201cYou can leverage the fact that you will have millions of cars with cameras \u2014 almost all the new cars that hit the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a force multiplier.\u201d\u201cFor full autonomy, we believe we need to have a high-definition map of the area we\u2019ve been operating in, a map annotated with what are the permanent fixed objects in that area,\u201d said Raj Nair, the global product development chief at Ford, which has vowed to begin producing a fully autonomous car \u2014 with no steering wheel and no pedals \u2014 by 2021.Mobileye envisions assembling its data into a giant map called Road Book, and plans to share it with Here. The idea is that Here at some point will license the mapping information for use by self-driving cars and Mobileye will get a share of that, Mr. Shashua said. Some of the money will go back to automakers like VW and BMW that add the mapping capability to their cars.\u201cThere is a revenue-sharing model between us and the carmakers,\u201d he said, noting that map services are a future business. \u201cConsumers would be paying for map services for their autonomous cars.\u201dThe reason digital maps are so important is that even the most advanced sensors, like radar and cameras, are not enough to enable a car to navigate a chaotic and changing world safely enough to allow occupants to lean back and take a snooze.Digital maps ease the burden by helping give foresight to a car\u2019s computers, and adding redundancy to the car\u2019s understanding of the situation it faces, said Civil Maps\u2019 chief executive, Sravan Puttagunta. Radar and cameras cannot always recognize a stop sign if pedestrians are standing in the way or the sign has been knocked down, he explained.\u201cBut if the map knows there is a stop sign ahead, then the sensors just need to confirm it,\u201d Mr. Puttagunta said. \u201cThen the load on the sensors and processor is much lower.\u201dThe need for data that can complement radar and camera readings was made clear last year when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died in a crash in Florida when his 2015 Tesla Model S was operating under control of the electric car\u2019s Autopilot system.As the car was traveling on a state highway at 74 miles per hour, a white tractor-trailer was crossing the road, but Autopilot\u2019s sensors had trouble recognizing it against a bright sky. Tesla has said Autopilot may have thought the truck was an overpass.A digital map could have shown that there was no overpass in that location and that an obstacle was blocking the road. As it was, neither the car nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes.Last fall, Tesla updated Autopilot, and one upgrade is a basic use of digital mapping. Cars that have the new software, known as Version 8, note the positions of road signs, bridges and other objects, and send the data to a Tesla database that other Tesla vehicles can draw on to make safe driving decisions. Tesla calls this \u201cfleet learning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Last year, for example, Calpers re-endorsed its ban on tobacco stocks, though staff recommended the opposite.The concept has made its way to exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which have been popular with mom-and-pop investors because they are a low-cost, tax-efficient way to invest in a broad index \u2014 more often than not, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. As a category, exchange traded funds have ballooned in recent years, amassing $2.6 trillion. And the opportunity to create niche products seems to be boundless.\u201cThe minority are a success, and the majority are flops,\u201d said Ben Johnson, the director of E.T.F. research at Morningstar. \u201cIt\u2019s spaghetti slinging.\u201dThe new funds would hardly be the first religion-oriented investment products. An earlier group of funds tracking Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and, more generally, Christian, values came out in 2009 but folded in 2011 with just $2 million, Morningstar said.There are also the $790 million iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF and the $500 million iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF, which look for stocks of companies with good labor policies or sustainable and renewable products. There are also longstanding mutual funds, such as the $927 million Domini Impact Equity fund.The benefits off exchange traded fund investing \u2014 getting cheap exposure to a broad universe of stocks \u2014 can be diminished by eliminating companies based on subjective criteria. And academic studies have concluded that sin stocks perform better as a group than stocks of virtuous companies, at least before factoring in the extra risks to investing in companies that are frequent targets of litigation and boycotts.Greg Richey, who lectures on finance at California State University San Bernardino, developed a portfolio of 65 sin stocks and tracked them from 1996 to 2016, finding an average annual return of 11 percent.Once taking variables like litigation and boycott risk into account, the gains disappear, he said. Also, \u201cthe definition of vice keeps changing.\u201dPensions and other institutions are asking fund companies for ways to invest that avoid these risks, said Jay Jacobs, the director of research for Global X Funds, which has $4.5 billion under management.Last year, Global X introduced a fund that adheres to the values of the Roman Catholic Church, and it has taken in $87 million in assets, according to Morningstar. The idea came from conversations with clients that invest on behalf of Catholic groups and foundations, which follow the guidelines set out by the church, he said.This week, Inspire Investing, based in Hollister, Calif., introduced the two biblically responsible funds, a small- and medium-size company fund and a large-company fund called Inspire Global Hope Large Cap ETF.The large-company fund tracks an Inspire-created index of 400 companies it screened to match its investment criteria, which follow conservative Christian values, Mr. Netzly said.Shares of Berkshire Hathaway, whose chief executive, Warren E. Buffett, has been a major donor to Planned Parenthood, would not make the cut, he said. Nor would Apple, Mr. Netzly said, claiming that pornography can be purchased through iTunes. (An Apple spokesman said pornography is not permitted.)Companies like Amazon that have publicly supported gay marriage also would not pass muster. \u201cAny company that takes a hard-line approach\u201d to the issue would not pass the test, Mr. Netzly said.On the other hand, shares of Tesla Motors and Under Armour would.Advertisement"}

The electric-car company run by Elon Musk will sell stock and notes worth a bit over $1 billion. Tesla is burning cash, and investing heavily to gear up for production of its coming Model 3. Unexpectedly small dilution pleases investors, but may miss the more important goal of capital sufficiency.Tesla has shown it can make beautiful cars and build a rabid fan base, but it has lost money three years in a row. The firm hopes production of its first mass-market vehicle, set to begin in July, will turn things around. At a cost of $35,000 before subsidies, the new model promises to kick-start demand. Tesla plans to produce 5,000 of the cars a week by year end, and double that in 2018.Yet Tesla has a habit of missing its goals. It will come as little surprise if the production timetable slips, the ramp-up in output proceeds more slowly and the vehicle ends up costing more than expected. There\u2019s also no assurance that volume will result in a gusher of \u2014 or any \u2014 black ink.Tesla had over $3 billion in cash on its balance sheet at year end. It reached this figure by selling stock, tapping its revolving credit and increasing cash owed to suppliers. An additional $1 billion helps, but it may not recharge the balance sheet sufficiently.Tesla plans $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capital expenditure in the first half of the year.

{"Headline": "Behind the Quiet State-by-State Fight Over Electric Vehicles", "Date": "2017-03-11", "News": "Supported byWhen Georgia repealed its generous $5,000 tax credit on electric vehicles in July 2015, and instead slapped a $200 registration fee on electric cars, sales quickly tumbled.In the month before the repeal, nearly 1,300 electric vehicles were sold in the state. By August, those sales had all but evaporated \u2014 to just 97 cars.It was a hint of what would come.Today, the economic incentives that have helped electric vehicles gain a toehold in America are under attack, state by state. In some states, there is a move to repeal tax credits for battery-powered vehicles or to let them expire. And in at least nine states, including liberal-leaning ones like Illinois and conservative-leaning ones like Indiana, lawmakers have introduced bills that would levy new fees on those who own electric cars.The state actions could put the business of electric vehicles, already rocky, on even more precarious footing. That is particularly true as gas prices stay low, and as the Trump administration appears set to give the nascent market much less of a hand.In coming days, the Trump administration is widely expected to roll back stringent federal regulations on vehicle emissions, one of the biggest environmental legacies of President Barack Obama. The changes would give American carmakers less incentive to produce more battery-powered cars. There are also concerns among advocates of electric cars over the fate of a $7,500 federal tax credit on the vehicles, a major catalyst for sales.But while the battle in Washington gets much of the attention, the most direct attack against electric vehicles, and in some cases hybrid vehicles, is quietly being waged at the state level.A handful of other states, including Illinois, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, have already let their incentives expire. That has brought down to 16 the number of states that offer financial support for buyers of electric vehicles. That number once approached 25.\u201cIt\u2019s baffling,\u201d said Matt Jones, a Democratic state senator in Colorado, who opposes the move to repeal the tax credit. \u201cIt\u2019s very counterproductive.\u201dEven with the incentives, overall sales of electric vehicles are only about 1 percent of the American market. To start making a real dent in the market, Ms. Caldwell said, \u201celectric vehicles still need to be subsidized for a significant amount of time.\u201dA slowdown in the country\u2019s shift toward battery-powered vehicles could leave the American auto market a global laggard, electric vehicle proponents warn. They say a similar situation played out a couple of decades ago, when American car companies stayed away from small cars, leaving a big opening for Japanese companies.A slower transition could also have big consequences for the United States\u2019 carbon emissions.That makes switching to cleaner vehicles imperative in further reducing America\u2019s carbon footprint, environmentalists say.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the environment,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThese vehicles are also about being a leader in this new technology that everyone agrees is coming. If the U.S. isn\u2019t a leader in this technology, we\u2019ll be buying them from someone else.\u201dAdvances in battery technology, both in quality and price, have allowed companies to bring more affordable battery-powered cars to market.General Motors\u2019 Bolt EV has a 238-mile range for less than $30,000, after the $7,500 federal income tax credit. Tesla plans to introduce the Model 3, a 215-mile-range car, for under $30,000 after federal tax credits.For these lower-cost models, which seek to attract buyers beyond the comfortably wealthy, those incentives are critical to sales. But each automaker has a 200,000-vehicle allotment for the federal tax credits, a limit that Tesla and GM will reach by 2018, according to some estimates. It is unclear whether that limit will be extended, making the state credits even more important.Laura Toole, General Motors spokeswoman, said that incentives were \u201cstill necessary to help build the E.V. market to greater volumes.\u201dA Tesla spokesman declined to comment. But its chief executive, Elon Musk, has said that he supports getting rid of incentives, but only if other subsidies are repealed, including support for fossil fuel industries.Electric vehicles alone could reduce oil demand by two million barrels a day by 2025, the study forecasts. That would be about the same dip that caused the oil price collapse in 2014 and 2015.In general, though, the projections underscore the threat that electric vehicles pose to the oil and gas industries \u2014 and those with big investments in those areas \u2014 and those who back a rapid shift away.The bill in Colorado, which would end income tax credits of up to $5,000 for buyers of electric cars and as much as $20,000 for commercial trucks, cleared its first barrier in a senate committee Feb. 28.They argue that the government should not be choosing between technologies or companies. They also argue that electric vehicle owners tend to be wealthy and do not need financial help.In testimony before Colorado lawmakers, Rudy Zitti, deputy state director at Americans for Prosperity, said, \u201cBy allowing these subsidies to continue, you are unfairly choosing to use our tax dollars to benefit a finite group of individuals and corporate interests.\u201dGeorgia offers an example of how some of these arguments played out. For a few years, attempts to repeal that state\u2019s electric vehicle incentive, first introduced in the late 1990s, went nowhere. Then in 2015, the repeal was rolled into a larger transportation bill, which promised freshly paved roads and shored-up bridges.The bill passed, together with the repeal, with little debate on the incentive itself; amid a budget shortfall, legislators were more interested in securing money for infrastructure projects.In a close vote, also Feb. 28, Utah\u2019s House of Representatives voted against extending the state\u2019s tax credit for electric vehicles after legislators there argued that those credits cost too much.The $1,500 credit for buyers of long-range electric vehicles \u201cdoes not make sense economically to me,\u201d Scott Sandall, a Republican representative, argued. A bill to extend that credit for five more years failed by one vote in the chamber.Kevin Emerson of Utah Clean Energy called the defeat disappointing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t reinstate it, it sends a message that Utah is no longer open to business for E.V.s.,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is so important for Utah. We\u2019d seen it as important in the long term.\u201dSeveral other states have imposed new registration fees on electric vehicles. Lawmakers pushing for the fees say that because owners of battery-powered cars do not pay gasoline taxes, they should help pay for infrastructure in some way.Since 2011, 10 states have adopted special fees of up to $200 a year for electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid owners. At least nine more states are considering similar charges.Despite the setbacks, a broad coalition between environmentalists, electric vehicle manufacturers and some electrical utilities has redoubled efforts to keep the electric car momentum going.Nissan said that the incentive programs are \u201cinstrumental\u201d to building acceptance among American drivers.Some states are bolstering their support for electric vehicles. In a long-awaited move, buyers of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in New York are set to receive a $2,000 rebate.She said the steady growth in electric vehicle sales despite lower gas prices, and the proliferation of electric and plug-in models now available, showed both consumer and industry interest in the technology.\u201cAre we worried about what the federal government will likely try to do? Yes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re concerned that many similar bills are coming out in many states at the same time.\u201dShe added: \u201cBut do we think that\u2019s going to kill electric vehicles? Absolutely not.\u201dStill, electric vehicle owners in states pulling back on incentives are left in the lurch.Alfred Richner, a financial services worker in Atlanta, vowed to go electric over a decade ago, when oil prices in the city spiked after Hurricane Katrina.\u201cIn 2005, I promised myself my next car would not use gas,\u201d he said.It took seven more years for Mr. Richner to find an electric car he was happy with \u2014 a new 2012 Nissan Leaf. And he got a great deal \u2014 $26,000 before sales tax \u2014 from a local dealer desperate to get rid of the car, he said.With the federal and state subsidies, he paid $15,500 out of pocket.\u201cIt was solid, it was comfortable, it was futuristic,\u201d Mr. Richner said. \u201cAnd the dealer was willing to negotiate, because he couldn\u2019t sell it. And then the dealer said Georgia had a $5,000 tax credit. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dA year later, he bought Mitsubishi\u2019s i-MiEV electric car for his wife, again using federal and state incentives.

But that plan was foiled when he couldn\u2019t track one down in Georgia before the tax credit expired.\u201cIt\u2019s a great car,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess by then, everyone wanted it.

{"Headline": "Uber Case Could Be a Watershed for Women in Tech", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtStill, the Uber scandal feels different. It feels like a watershed. For gender-diversity advocates in the tech industry, Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations, and the public outcry they have ignited, offer a possibility that something new may be in the offing.What could happen? Something innovative: This could be the start of a deep, long-term and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women \u2014 not just at Uber but across the tech business, too.But precisely for those reasons, Ms. Kapor Klein argued that if Uber mounted an honest investigation into its culture and pledged to transparently remake what ails it, it could become a model for the industry.\u201cThey did ask me, \u2018Has anyone gotten it right in tech?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said not yet. And that means an opportunity for Uber.\u201dUnlike many aggressive start-ups that have come before it \u2014 Amazon and Facebook, for instance, were no pushovers \u2014 Uber is not a natural monopoly. It sells a service that has ready substitutes, and it has well-funded competitors in many of its major markets. Its rivals have put their supposedly friendlier brands at the center of their competitive strategy. They are all waiting for Uber to fail, and every time Uber finds a way to lower its reputation even further, competitors can peel off customers, drivers and engineers.Finally, there\u2019s the Trump factor. Ever since the presidential election, people in the tech industry have been amped up. Employees and customers have learned to take up arms against companies that don\u2019t espouse their values, and companies have started to listen.\u201cLeft-leaning Silicon Valley has been embracing the Women\u2019s March and had this heightened awareness about issues that women face due to misogynistic men,\u201d said Karen Catlin, a former software engineer who is now an advocate for women in the tech industry. Now the same social-media energy aimed at President Trump is being marshaled against Uber, better known on Twitter as #deleteUber.Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, and others at the company appear to understand the gravity of the threat. The company moved swiftly to open an investigation into Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations. Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur who sits on Uber\u2019s board, were among those it appointed to find out what\u2019s going wrong at the company.All of this could be for show. To a lot of people, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s word no longer carries much weight. But you don\u2019t have to just trust him. If Uber is serious about remaking its culture, we can watch for concrete action.Ms. Kapor Klein is looking for several steps. She wants Mr. Holder\u2019s report to detail for the public everything he\u2019s found at the company. She wants to see new policies for how Uber hires people, ones that put more weight on the diversity of its work force. She wants the company to offer more formal and informal ways for employees to report problems to management, including allowing them to do so anonymously in order to avoid retribution. She also wants Uber to offer more training for employees, and better workplace surveys to get a sense of what\u2019s going wrong.Finally, Ms. Kapor Klein said, she would be scrutinizing Mr. Kalanick\u2019s own actions.\u201cYou need unequivocal commitment from the top,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone does something abhorrent, do you fire your best performer? That is the litmus test.\u201dAn Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the outcome of Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation, which is just beginning, but said that all of Ms. Kapor Klein\u2019s recommendations were on the table.Whatever Uber does in the next few weeks will only be a start. People who fight for diversity in the tech industry point out it is a hard problem to solve; it could take years of careful and publicly embarrassing actions for Uber and other companies to become more hospitable to women.\u201cThis stuff is deeply entrenched,\u201d Ms. Kapor Klein said, relaying a story she had recently heard about a group of programmers at a different tech company. \u201cI heard about this engineer who said that what he and his friends do at work for fun is rate women job applicants according to who they wanted to marry, or who they wanted to kill, and there was a third thing.\u201d Suffice it to say the third thing was not the women\u2019s qualifications for the job in question.\u201cThat just goes to show you the backdrop we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d she said. \u201cFixing this will be a marathon, not a sprint.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Take on Corporate Tax Rate Could Look Very Much Like Obama\u2019s", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byDealBookHe repeated the 15 percent figure over and over again.However, when Mr. Trump spoke to the C.E.O.s that morning, he shifted the goal post slightly: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get it down to anywhere from 15 to 20 percent.\u201dInside the White House, until last Friday, according to people involved in the conversations, the target rate had been bumped up again, to a minimum of 20 percent and very likely a bit more.And now, given that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is off the table \u2014 and with it the $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years that the administration needed to help make its tax plan deficit neutral \u2014 there is a good chance that any tax package would include a corporate rate that is even further from Mr. Trump\u2019s initial pledge, perhaps as high as 28 percent.Now, Republicans may end up negotiating a tax package with a corporate tax rate that looks a lot like the one they rejected out of hand for the last five years.Why is the rate so important?Because almost all those on Wall Street \u2014 and in corner offices throughout corporate America \u2014 have been baking into their models a tax reform plan that they say will jump-start additional investments, leading to higher growth in the economy.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who oversaw the effort to repeal Obamacare, acknowledged that the bill\u2019s failure would \u201cmake tax reform more difficult.\u201dHe has yet to publish a new set of corporate tax rates, but his original plan called for a rate of 20 percent. That plan depended not only on Obamacare\u2019s repeal, to save $1 trillion, but also on another plan that seems increasingly unlikely to gain support: a so-called border adjustment tax \u2014 a euphemism for an import tax on all goods \u2014 that was expected to raise another $1 trillion over 10 years.The border adjustment tax, an obsession of Mr. Ryan\u2019s, has divided Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. Stephen K. Bannon has been a proponent, seeing it as an incentive for more companies to make goods here in the United States. Others, like Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin, have been more ambivalent, people involved in the discussions say, in part because other countries could retaliate, making it harder for United States manufacturers to export goods.Many American retailers, like Walmart, and even some manufacturers \u2014 including Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which make some car models in Mexico and Canada and import them into this country \u2014 have expressed their anxiety about how a border adjustment tax would affect their business.Given the squabbling within the Republican Party over the repeal of Obamacare, it\u2019s hard to imagine that a congressman with constituents including big retailers \u2014 retail jobs outnumber manufacturing jobs in the United States by about four to one \u2014 would vote in favor of a border adjustment tax.\u201cThe border adjustment tax, the most controversial piece of current tax-reform discussions, is less likely to pass,\u201d Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale wrote in a note to clients over the weekend. \u201cIf Congress fails to approve tax reform ahead of August, confidence is likely to slip. Congress could still pass a bill by the end of the calendar year, but even that could slip.\u201dWithout the $2 trillion in revenue and tax savings that the border adjustment tax and Obamacare repeal would generate, it is virtually impossible to see how the Trump administration could find a path to a corporate tax rate anywhere near what it originally promised. (Of course, the administration could pull back on its pledge to lower taxes for the middle class, but that seems unlikely.)The trillion-dollar question is whether lowering corporate taxes would ultimately have the desired effect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Automakers Near a Victory on Rollback of Fuel Standards", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Automakers appear to be on the verge of a rare victory in their long-term effort to reduce government regulations on new cars and trucks.Any decision by the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department to reopen a review of the regulations could ease the pressure on the industry to meet the current target of 54 miles per gallon for vehicle fleets by 2025.Individual carmakers may react differently to a rollback of the federal standards. Some companies, for example, will continue to pursue electric car programs, while others may scale back their plans. And over all, the industry is likely to continue to make incremental fuel-economy improvements as new models are introduced, primarily as a selling point to consumers.But the aggressive targets of the Obama administration, which signed off on the current rules in January, would no longer loom as an escalating cost for automakers, which estimate that fewer than 4 percent of today\u2019s vehicles would meet the 2025 standards.Instead, auto companies will be given an opportunity to argue for less stringent standards during a government review period that could stretch into 2018.Environmental groups are already crying foul that car companies are now opposing the standards many of them agreed to during negotiations with the Obama administration in 2012 \u2014 when gasoline prices were much higher, increasing demand for smaller cars, and after the administration had rescued General Motors and Chrysler in carefully choreographed bankruptcies.\u201cAuto manufacturers are attempting to backpedal on vital climate and consumer protections,\u201d said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. \u201cA new administration is no reason to go in reverse.\u201dAutomakers are also hopeful that the new E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, will begin legal action to revoke California\u2019s ability to enforce its tailpipe standards.At least some of the administration\u2019s moves to roll back regulations could face court challenges on environmental grounds.While executives are reluctant to publicly discuss efforts to pare environmental regulations, the topic was reportedly addressed during President Trump\u2019s initial meeting in January with the chief executives of the three Detroit automakers: General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler.An executive of one of the Detroit companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was confidential, said they had pressed Mr. Trump to abolish \u201cdueling standards\u201d for state and federal governments and to better align rules covering fuel economy and carbon emissions.It is unclear how far the new leadership at E.P.A. will go toward dismantling the rules that were so integral to former President Barack Obama\u2019s program to cut pollution that contributes to global warming.Automakers say the 2025 target is unrealistic given the shift by consumers away from more fuel-efficient small cars to bigger pickups and S.U.V.s.\u201cNo agency ever had set standards so far into the future,\u201d Mr. Bainwol said. \u201cNo one could accurately project the circumstances affecting the technological and economic feasibility of these standards.\u201dWith prices below $3 a gallon, the companies are eager to capitalize on the demand for larger vehicles. About three in five new vehicles sold in the United States are pickups and sport utilities, and analysts expect the trend to continue and expand into global markets as well.The outlook for electrified vehicles, however, would be affected by weaker long-term standards.Some automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, have devoted few resources to electrified vehicles. Others are placing strategic bets on projects that tailor autonomous-driving technology to a new breed of electric cars.G.M.\u2019s new electric Chevrolet Bolt, for example, will be the preferred platform for the company\u2019s self-driving systems. And industry analysts doubt that any change in fuel-efficiency rules would reduce the momentum at G.M. and rivals such as Tesla for self-driving, electric models.But companies will be under less pressure to take dramatic steps to improve fuel economy on mass-market vehicles, such as shifting to lighter, more expensive materials or adding technology that improves performance without requiring more gasoline.Environmental activists fear that any pause in the efforts to improve fuel economy would stall the momentum toward cleaner cars.\u201cThese vehicle efficiency and emissions rules have helped us cut oil use, reduce pollution, save money at the pump and reduce the risk of climate change,\u201d said Ken Kimmell, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.Industry analysts have suggested that relaxing fuel-efficiency targets is only the first in a series of policy changes by Mr. Trump directed at the auto industry.His vow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement has drawn concern from automakers that rely on factories in Mexico to help supply the United States market.Reducing fuel-efficiency targets would save money for the car companies and usher in an unusual era of cooperation between the industry and Washington.By giving the automakers the relief they are clamoring for on fuel regulations, Mr. Trump could then prod them to expand investments and add jobs in their American operations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sleepy Behind the Wheel? Some Cars Can Tell", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byWheelsIt\u2019s something that many of us have experienced while driving, though we may not like to admit it.It\u2019s called a microsleep, a brief state of drowsy unconsciousness that can happen even if your eyes remain open.Drowsy driving kills. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drowsy driving caused 824 deaths in 2015, the last year for which figures are available.Several manufacturers, including Audi, Mercedes and Volvo, currently offer drowsiness detection systems that monitor a vehicle\u2019s movements, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation, time driven and road conditions. When drowsiness is detected, drivers are typically warned with a sound and the appearance of a coffee cup icon.But manufacturers and automobile suppliers are now working on advanced technological solutions that go beyond visions of coffee cups.Algorithms developed by the company indicate when breathing changes to patterns that are typical of someone who is sleeping, giving a warning before someone actually feels tired.\u201cWe could see this in a vehicle in five years,\u201d said Keith Strickland, chief technology officer of the company, which is based in Plymouth, England.When such a system is used in vehicles that allow for limited autonomous driving, the vehicle could take over once drowsiness is detected \u2014 either coming to an emergency stop or pulling itself off to the side of the road, said Kay Stepper, Bosch\u2019s head of driver assistance and automated driving.In addition, sensors on the outside of the vehicle will monitor the state of traffic in which the fatigued driver is engaged. Once vehicles can communicate with each other \u2014 a capability expected in the next few years \u2014 other cars will be able to take appropriate maneuvers to avoid the drowsy driver.Checking body temperature and even how the driver is dressed, the system will also be able to customize the interior temperature for each driver, said Guillaume Devauchelle, the company\u2019s innovation director.The system will eventually learn a driver\u2019s standard posture, head position, eye-blink rate, facial expression and steering style, among other indexes. Based on a vehicle\u2019s capabilities, the driver will be warned or automatically driven to a safe spot when conditions warrant.Until vehicles can drive themselves, it will be up to drivers to pull over once they feel drowsy. But drivers tend to make excuses, believing there is no danger because they are just a few minutes from home, or they are not really as tired as they may feel.To encourage drowsy drivers to take a break, Volvo, with a grant from the European Commission, is studying the effects of offering drivers free coffee once erratic steering wheel movements, lane departures and other signs detect that they are falling asleep, using the navigation system to direct them to the nearest coffee stop.Through its Driver Availability Detection system, sensors will scan the head and face to ensure that the eyes are open and the driver is alert before the car turns over the steering wheel.The system can currently detect drowsiness with 80 percent accuracy, said Christoph von Hugo, head of active safety for Mercedes-Benz. If drowsiness is detected, the driver is alerted to the nearest rest stop.The system detects drowsiness with 97 percent accuracy, Mr. Aust said.While N.H.T.S.A. reported 824 deaths in 2015 because of drowsiness, that number is likely to be considerably higher, the agency said. Drowsy driving can only be self-reported and not measured like drunkenness. Also, drowsiness is not reported when it is a complication of other factors like excessive drinking.\u201cWe\u2019re a nation of tired drivers. People talk about sleep deprivation as if it\u2019s a badge of honor,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cAs a society we have to realize that drowsy driving is really dangerous.\u201dUntil fully autonomous vehicles are a reality, \u201cdrowsiness is something everyone needs to worry about,\u201d said Mark R. Rosekind, former head of N.H.T.S.A. and an expert on human fatigue. \u201cOur tendency is to say we\u2019re wide-awake when in reality we can fall asleep in a second.\u201dStill, the obvious solution for a driver who feels fatigued is to pull over and rest. According to Mr. Rosekind, studies with airline pilots show that those who took a nap for 26 minutes improved their performance by 34 percent and alertness by 54 percent, compared with those who did not.Regardless of how good technology is at detecting drowsiness, fighting off sleep is futile. Because sleep is a biological need, the best solution for drivers is still a low-tech one: Pull over and take a nap.Advertisement"}
