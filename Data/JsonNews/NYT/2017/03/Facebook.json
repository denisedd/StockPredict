{"Headline": "Women\u2019s Day, Afghan Style: Head Scarves and Flowers", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byReporter's NotebookKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 In Afghanistan, women are not celebrated on just a single day like the rest of the world. International Women\u2019s Day starts March 8, and is celebrated here day after day through the end of the month.Judging by the quantity of Women\u2019s Day events here \u2014 parties, awards ceremonies, conferences, panel discussions and concerts \u2014 it would appear that women in Afghanistan were doing quite well.Women are allowed to work, study and go out of the house \u2014 all of which was completely prohibited during the Taliban era. But in practice, in most places outside big cities, such freedoms are still very limited or even nonexistent.This year International Women\u2019s Day began a week before March 8 with a speech by the first lady, Rula Ghani. \u201cI am happy to be a witness of women\u2019s empowerment in different aspects of their lives: social, political and economic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are joyful that day by day and slowly, Afghan women are relying economically on themselves.\u201dLast Wednesday, some of the Western embassies held parties to celebrate the day, and on Thursday and again on Saturday there were events for Afghan women organized by everyone from the presidential palace to the Afghanistan journalists council. Our bureau received at least 10 invitations to different events and there were many we were not invited to. Parliament held its own Women\u2019s Day event on Monday.One of the invitations I received was from a group I had rarely heard from, the Afghanistan journalists council, which was honoring 30 women \u2014 mostly journalists, including me. The council does not have a website, just a not-very-active Facebook page, but it holds occasional conferences.The ceremony was a little disappointing; the presenter could not pronounce the name of my news organization or the names of many of the female journalists. Many of the \u201chonorees\u201d did not attend. The organizers handed out red flowers and head scarves, though few women in Afghanistan need more.Nooria Ashraf, in charge of women\u2019s issues for the council, complained about how hard it was to raise money to buy the head scarves, and how concerned she was about people on local television who she said sometimes dress \u201cinappropriately.\u201dThe Afghan Journalists Safety Committee, which does important work advocating for the security of Afghan reporters, also wanted to honor me \u2014 and 99 other women in journalism. They gave us red flowers as well, along with notebooks instead of scarves.Few people in Afghanistan know about the real meaning and history of Women\u2019s Day, which is meant to acknowledge the long history of women\u2019s struggle for emancipation. Many here think that it is a day like Mother\u2019s Day and that they should give gifts to their mothers, wives and even their female colleagues \u2014 especially head scarves.For many women in Afghanistan, the day is a reminder not so much of how far they have come, but how much further there is to go.The other day I was on the street reporting on a suicide bombing. Policemen and even some of the male journalists at the scene kept asking what I was doing, as if I were engaged in work unbecoming of a woman. The nicer ones were worried I would be scarred by the experience, and couldn\u2019t handle it. The ruder ones felt I was stepping out of my lane.One official suggested that it was dangerous for me to be out that late at night.It isn\u2019t easy being a woman journalist in Afghanistan; it isn\u2019t easy being a woman here, for that matter.But for many Afghan women, that is not what comes across in all these celebrations.It often appears that many institutions use Women\u2019s Day to show a liberal face, but just for a day.\u201cOn every International Women\u2019s Day, I keep thinking more of how suppressed we are within this patriarchal society,\u201d said Sahar Fetrat, a filmmaker and women\u2019s activist. \u201cThe symbolic celebrations, flowers, gifts and some words of empathy and sympathy are always given to women every 8th of March while on the same day, sexism, inequality, harassment and violence against women screams from all the streets and corners of this country.\u201dWomen\u2019s activists say that donors find it easy to give money for celebrations, which no one criticizes, while it\u2019s much harder to support programs that produce real \u2014 and therefore controversial \u2014 change.\u201cWe do not want to get flowers and head scarves,\u201d said Zubaida Akbar, an advocate for women\u2019s rights. \u201cInstead, respect us as humans.\u201dStill, while many women scoff at the gift of head scarves, at least, they acknowledge, they are not being given burqas.Zahra Nader is a reporter in the Kabul bureau of The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Definitely if you\u2019re young, increasingly if you\u2019re old, your day-to-day, minute-to-minute existence is dominated by a compulsion to check email and Twitter and Facebook and Instagram with a frequency that bears no relationship to any communicative need.Which is why we need a social and political movement \u2014 digital temperance, if you will \u2014 to take back some control.No, not like Prohibition. Temperance doesn\u2019t have to mean teetotaling; it can simply mean a culture of restraint that tries to keep a specific product in its place. And the internet, like alcohol, may be an example of a technology that should be sensibly restricted in custom and in law.So a digital temperance movement would start by resisting the wiring of everything, and seek to create more spaces in which internet use is illegal, discouraged or taboo. Toughen laws against cellphone use in cars, keep computers out of college lecture halls, put special \u201cphone boxes\u201d in restaurants where patrons would be expected to deposit their devices, confiscate smartphones being used in museums and libraries and cathedrals, create corporate norms that strongly discourage checking email in a meeting.Then keep going. The age of consent should be 16, not 13, for Facebook accounts. Kids under 16 shouldn\u2019t be allowed on gaming networks. High school students shouldn\u2019t bring smartphones to school. Kids under 13 shouldn\u2019t have them at all.

During the next three years, Yeram\u2019s husband, James, was deployed twice in Iraq, while she stayed in the Marines, stationed at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, N. C. In 2006, after giving birth to a son, Yeram decided to leave the military. Shortly thereafter, James was reassigned from New River, N.C., to China Lake, Calif. In her new home, she suddenly found that \u201cI had no connections, no sense of community,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a hard time relating to nonmilitary families around me.\u201dIt took her 10 months to find a job. Then, shortly after her daughter was born, her husband received another posting, to Camp Pendleton, Calif. \u201cThe struggle started again,\u201d Yeram said. \u201cI was stuck both emotionally and financially. I got really depressed because I was used to providing for my family and couldn\u2019t any more.\u201dShe began as a volunteer and now is on staff, serving as as the organization\u2019s business operations manager. She has learned how to effectively assist others \u2014 including military spouses and disabled veterans \u2014 and how to organize events and build a community around herself and others.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the military, you move so often and you\u2019re remote from family and friends, and what you\u2019re thinking about is so different from your nonmilitary neighbors,\u201d said Kathy Roth-Douquet, Blue Star Families\u2019 co-founder and chief executive, who is married to a retired Marine, and whose family moved nine times in 15 years. \u201cBecause of these things, you don\u2019t have the kinds of bonds with a diverse set of people that are natural to how we solve our problems.\u201d\u201cThat isolation is very fixable,\u201d she added.The Blue Star Families survey is known for the level of detail it goes into and the candor it draws from military personnel. \u201cThe research is granular enough that it allows you to think of how we can strategically improve the well-being of military families without just throwing money at it at a time of constrained budgets,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, who co-directs the Center on 21st Century Security and Intelligence at Brookings.The survey has intensified attention to issues that military analysts and the Pentagon say lacked a sense of urgency until recently. Here are some important findings of the 2016 survey, which was released in December:\u00b7 72 percent of military families feel the current \u201coptempo\u201d \u2014 the rate of military deployments, training and base duties \u2014 \u201cexerts an unacceptable level of stress for a healthy work and family life.\u201d\u00b7 42 percent of military families experienced more than six months of family separation in the previous 18 months.\u00b7 88 percent of military families feel the general public \u201cdoes not understand sacrifices made by service members and their families.\u201d\u00b7 52 percent of military spouses are not employed.\u00b7 57 percent of military families would not recommend military service to their children.\u00b7 66 percent of military families cannot obtain reliable child care.The data on family stress has also caught many by surprise. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve cut back the troop presence in Afghanistan by 90 percent relative to peak, and in Iraq by 95 percent relative to peak,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said, \u201cthere\u2019s still enough little deployments \u2014 in Europe, Korea, Okinawa, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Syria, Turkey, naval deployments \u2014 that families are still feeling stressed and fatigued by the pace\u201d of deployments.Today\u2019s military families think differently than those in the past. Roth-Douquet noted: \u201cThis year\u2019s survey was the first time that family issues\u201d like spousal employment, family stability and quality of life, and the impact of deployments on children \u201cwere top-five concerns for service members. It\u2019s an important thing to understand about millennials.\u201dAnd it revealed a vulnerability. Since the military has been an all-volunteer force, recruitment has drawn heavily on families with histories of service. In the Army, 83 percent of recruits have a close family member who served. What happens if military families are reluctant to recommend service to their children?We may soon find out. The Blue Star Families survey reports that 19 percent of service members plan to leave the military within two years and another 25 percent plan to leave within three to five years. Last year, 57 percent of active-duty military families said they would not recommend military service to their children, almost triple the figure of a generation ago. \u201cEighty percent of military spouses say that being a military spouse has hurt their careers,\u201d said Roth-Douquet. \u201cAnd for those who feel military service has hurt them, only a third are willing to recommend it.\u201dBlue Star Families seeks to help in two important ways: first, by getting more Americans to understand, through its survey, what military life is really like for families; and second, by fostering stronger communities around military families to mitigate their isolation and other challenges.\u201cWhen our warriors are sent overseas, whether it\u2019s ISIS or to solve Ebola in Africa, we need our men and women to have their heads in the game, and they can\u2019t be worried about their spouses or kids at home,\u201d said Murphy, the former under secretary of the Army. \u201cWhen I was in Baghdad in Iraq in 2003 and it was 138 degrees, when these soldiers came in with divorce paperwork or their car was getting repossessed, they were not in the frame of mind they needed to be. And I had to make sure I got them straight and we took care of them. Having a team like Blue Star Families who are constantly checking where the heads and hearts of our military families are is critically important to our national security.\u201dSome ideas being considered to help military spouses include introducing more stability in assignments, making it easier for them to get Department of Defense jobs, streamlining professional certification across state lines, and opening contracting opportunities. \u201cThese are not big-ticket items,\u201d said Talent. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of making the system more responsive. The department needs to refocus itself on the long term quality of life of the families who serve.\u201dAmanda Yeram\u2019s husband, James, is currently on a six-month deployment in Japan, but her experience is very different than in the past. \u201cI could pity myself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t hide inside anymore and build up that emotion. I go out and connect. Whether it\u2019s deployment, a caregiving issue, depression, unemployment, we need to understand that we\u2019re all going through something similar, and we need to build trust and cohesion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Robert B. Neller, the Marine Corps commandant, during a Pentagon news conference. \u201cThe only way that there\u2019s going to be accountability in this, is if somebody comes forward and tells us what happened to them.\u201dAs reports spread that illicit images may have also been shared on other social media sites, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has harshly criticized such violations of privacy and betrayals of trust, and has signaled that he will hold military and civilian officials accountable for cracking down on the abuses.\u201cThe purported actions of civilian and military personnel on social media websites, including some associated with the Marines United group and possibly others, represent egregious violations of the fundamental values we uphold at the Department of Defense,\u201d Mr. Mattis said in a statement.\u201cThe chain of command is taking all appropriate action to investigate potential misconduct and to maintain good order and discipline throughout our armed forces,\u201d he added. \u201cLack of respect for the dignity and humanity of fellow members of the Department of Defense is unacceptable and counter to unit cohesion. We will not excuse or tolerate such behavior if we are to uphold our values and maintain our ability to defeat the enemy on the battlefield.\u201dMost of the focus has fallen on the Marine Corps \u2014 not only because of the Facebook group, but also its warrior culture and the fact that it has the smallest percentage of women among the services.The Naval Criminal Investigative Service has begun an investigation into the site.Investigating the abuse, however, will require the Marines to win the trust of women whose photos and personal details were posted in the group. So far, fewer than 10 women have taken their complaints to the Marines, General Neller said.And despite General Neller\u2019s call for cooperation from the victims, it remained unclear how many women were even aware their photos were posted, since the site was members-only and now has been taken down.General Neller said he was establishing a task force to examine what institutional changes need to be made to training and policy to combat the \u201csubculture that may have given rise to this.\u201d He said the task force would include female Marines.\u201cI\u2019m not going to lay this off on anybody else, on the society or anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our problem and I own it. We own it.\u201dHe also pledged to any women who lodged complaints that \u201cthe chain of command is obligated and required by order, rule and regulation and by my direct directions to make sure that they\u2019re protected.\u201dGeneral Neller has a long military record, including service in the invasion of Panama, operations in Haiti and in the war in Iraq. But he has little familiarity with Facebook or direct experience with social media \u2014 which he acknowledged might have made him slow to respond to the problem of misogynist websites.\u201cI don\u2019t have a Facebook page; I don\u2019t do social media,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m generationally challenged here, all right.\u201dOn Friday, the service announced that it would hold a preliminary hearing next Thursday to determine whether charges should proceed against a gunnery sergeant in relation to the death of a Muslim recruit.Raheel Siddiqui, 20, died last March after falling three stories from a stairwell at the training depot at Parris Island.An earlier investigation into the case found that on March 18, Mr. Siddiqui gave a note to an instructor before breakfast, asking to go to sick call because he \u201ccoughed blood a few times last night\u201d and \u201ccompletely lost his voice and can barely whisper.\u201dThe instructor yelled at Mr. Siddiqui and made him do sprints the length of the barracks, which are known in the Marine Corps as squad bays.Mr. Siddiqui, crying, collapsed, holding his throat, at which point the instructor slapped him in the face loud enough that it could be heard throughout the squad bay, according to the report. After being hit, Mr. Siddiqui got up, ran out of the barracks, and jumped into a stairwell, falling 38 feet. He was pronounced dead a few hours later.While investigators ruled his death a suicide, they noted a pattern of abuse and hazing in training.The sergeant\u2019s name has not been released.Advertisement"}

I can relate more to the working-class people, and I feel street artists represent more that type of people.\u201dThe plan had been to reopen the house as a restaurant, but after renovations were delayed, Mr. LaPadula\u2019s imagination ran a little wild.Up went an outcry, and a Facebook page, where aghast commenters poured in.

Flanagan, a Republican, has called the idea a \u201cnon-starter.\u201dLikewise, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has seemed uninterested in helping out Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat. \u201cThat proposal was made in January,\u201d the governor said on Monday. \u201cIt never went anywhere in January and it hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. de Blasio has persevered, eagerly playing the snowball to Albany\u2019s hell.He has dismissed those who say it cannot get through the state capital, and compared it to universal prekindergarten, one of his signature initiatives as mayor, which initially met resistance in Albany. But whereas that effort ultimately succeeded, the main sticking point was in fact a new tax on high-income earners that Mr. de Blasio wanted to levy, to pay for it. The tax component quickly fell by the wayside, but not before the mayor\u2019s stubborn insistence, still near the outset of his term, set him permanently on the wrong foot with Mr. Cuomo and Republicans in the State Senate.Building a coalition in support of tax increases now could also help offset what are expected to be deep cuts in federal funding to the city and state when President Trump and the Republican Congress enact their budget this year.\u201cThe $15 minimum wage was once declared dead on arrival,\u201d said Bill Lipton, the New York State director of the Working Families Party, which backs the mayor\u2019s effort. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the next few days or over the coming months, working families are going to demand that new taxes on the rich be part of the solution to Trump.\u201dMr. de Blasio was able to count a win on Tuesday in another area of housing policy: a state court judge preserved a freeze on rents in regulated apartments that had been championed by the mayor and opposed by landlords.Mr. Cuomo, for his part, is negotiating with State Senate Republicans to extend a tax on those earning $1 million or more; if it were to lapse, the state would see its revenue fall by about $4 billion over two years. But the governor has not been open to tax increases. \u201cI don\u2019t want to raise taxes,\u201d he said on Tuesday.The median price of a home affected by the mayor\u2019s proposed tax would be $3.4 million, according to the Independent Budget Office. This is not so much the price range in the new residential towers high above midtown; it is closer to that of the Queens home that once belonged to Mr. Trump\u2019s family that was sold this month. Under the mayor\u2019s proposed tax, that sale, for $2.14 million would have generated about $3,500 in new revenue.Along the way the mayor has managed to step on the toes of a natural ally on the issue: older citizens.In Albany last week. Mr. de Blasio said that AARP, the advocacy group for people 50 and older, was helping to lobby legislators for his tax proposal. He repeated the assertion at his New York news conference.But the group later put out a statement saying it was not true, and while it favored the goal of rent relief for older tenants, it had not taken a position on how that relief should be financed. In his weekly radio appearance on WNYC last Friday, Mr. de Blasio acknowledged the flub, saying, \u201cI certainly will take responsibility for my team if we misunderstood that particular nuance in their position.\u201dBrad Lander, a Democratic City Councilman who often stands shoulder to shoulder with the mayor, lamented on Tuesday the stranglehold that the state legislature has on many issues affecting the city, saying of the proposed tax: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a chance of passing and that\u2019s been clear from Day 1.\u201dAsked why the mayor was spending so much time pushing an idea that not even his allies thought was viable, Mr. Lander shrugged and said, \u201cPolitics?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Advertiser Exodus Highlights Perils of Online Ads", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byWhen Google acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion, it was considered a pricey gamble, one made with the belief that an online service known for pirated videos and vapid user-generated content could appeal to major advertisers.The bet paid off. YouTube is now one of the pillars of Google\u2019s advertising business and the most valuable video platform on the internet. In recent years, advertisers, unable to ignore its massive audience, flocked to YouTube to reach younger people who have started to shun traditional broadcast television.\u201cThis is beyond offensive,\u201d a Lyft spokesman, Scott Coriell, said. \u201cAs soon as we learned of it, we pulled our advertising on YouTube.\u201dThe pullback from advertisers strikes to the core of YouTube\u2019s appeal. Unlike television, with specific programming during which brands choose to run their advertising, YouTube mirrors the internet\u2019s sprawl, specializing in niche content that may not appeal to a mainstream audience but attracts engaged viewers. This provides YouTube with an enormous audience watching one billion hours of videos a day, perfect for new ad technology that minutely slices and dices an audience so that companies can target specific viewers.That technology, known as programmatic advertising, allows advertisers to lay out the general parameters of what kind of person they want to reach \u2014 say, a young man under 25 \u2014 and trust that their ad will find that person, no matter where he might be on the internet. This approach plays to the strengths of tech giants like Google and Facebook, allowing advertisers to use automation and data to cheaply and efficiently reach their own audiences, funneling money through a complicated system of agencies and third-party networks.But more than 400 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and while Google has noted that it prevents ads from running near inappropriate material \u201cin the vast majority of cases,\u201d it has proved unable to totally police that amount of content in real time. And that has advertisers increasingly concerned.Marketers have seen programmatic advertising as a groundbreaking development in media \u2014 a technologically efficient way to leverage the expanse of the internet so that, for example, Pampers can reach a new mom on a local blog or an instructional video about how to deal with a newborn\u2019s baby acne. This has opened up the whole of the internet to brands, which typically opt to remove their ads after they have appeared on unsavory sites, rather than restrict the ads to a list of preapproved locations.\u201cI distinctly remember doing presentations years and years ago, and there was some stat at the time that there were a million ad-supported websites and I thought that was mind-blowing,\u201d said Eric Franchi, co-founder of Undertone, an ad technology company. \u201cNow fast-forward to 2017, and Google\u2019s display network alone has two million sites. It\u2019s a lot harder to maintain brand safety today than what it was because of the sheer number of sites coming into these exchanges every day.\u201dThat sheer scale, coupled with its reliance on algorithms rather than humans to filter out the objectionable content after it appears, has been Google\u2019s main defense. More than two million websites are a part of its display advertising network \u2014 the equivalent of one for every resident of Delaware and Rhode Island combined.Google has pledged that YouTube will tighten safeguards against ads showing up alongside \u201chateful, offensive and derogatory content\u201d while reviewing guidelines for what type of content is allowable on the platform.\u201cWhile we recognize that no system will be 100 percent perfect, we believe these major steps will further safeguard our advertisers\u2019 brands, and we are committed to being vigilant and continuing to improve over time,\u201d Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said in a statement on Thursday.There\u2019s a lot at stake for YouTube and Alphabet. Search advertising is not growing as fast as it once did, and television ad budgets are still larger than total spending on digital advertising. YouTube and Facebook have made no secret of their desire for television advertising funds. Internet ad revenue in the United States, which is growing quickly, reached about $60 billion in 2015 while television accounted for about $66 billion, according to a study from IAB and PwC.James Dix, a senior media analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that YouTube accounted for revenue of about $13 billion, or roughly 20 percent of all advertising revenue on Google\u2019s internet properties in 2016. Alphabet does not disclose YouTube revenue.\u201cIf this company is going to look for new growth at scale, it has to pull money from television,\u201d Mr. Dix said. \u201cPeriod.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aleksei Navalny, Russian Opposition Leader, Receives 15-Day Sentence", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 A day after the largest antigovernment protests in more than five years, a Moscow court on Monday slapped the opposition leader behind the outburst, Aleksei A. Navalny, with a 15-day prison sentence for resisting arrest.The police responded by beating protesters and arresting more than 1,000 in Moscow alone, though by Monday many had been released.As Mr. Navalny was led into the courtroom for a hearing that lasted much of the day, he told reporters that he was \u201camazed by the number of cities that took part in this and by how many people came out.\u201d After the judge ordered him jailed, Mr. Navalny was whisked away without being allowed a chance to comment further.Mr. Navalny, 40, a charismatic opposition figure, has long been caught up in multiple court cases that he calls politically motivated. He has vowed to run against President Vladimir V. Putin for the presidency in 2018, even though a previous conviction, widely viewed as trumped up, makes that technically illegal.The government has usually avoided jailing him, however, apparently fearful of turning him into an even bigger political martyr. The court on Monday also fined him about $350 for organizing an illegal demonstration.The protests provoked surprise and wonder among analysts and activists, many of whom had written off the public as politically apathetic. The high number of young people in the crowds struck many as particularly impressive.\u201cRight now it looks like a major new phenomenon in Russia that there are young people who are active and have agendas,\u201d Maxim Trudolyubov, a columnist, said. \u201cOne important factor is that these people all grew up under Putin. They don\u2019t remember any other leader.\u201dMr. Putin, as the \u201cgood czar,\u201d enjoys a status that the rest of the government falls short of. Mr. Navalny, however, in calling for people to come out to protest high-level corruption, rather than the president, appears to have tapped into a popular sentiment.The aftermath of the rallies will show whether there is a political thaw or not, wrote Oleg Kashin, another columnist. If there is a new Bolotnaya case, he said, then it is not a thaw; otherwise, it is, even if no substantial policy changes follow.There were no independent numbers available for the turnout for the rallies. The liberal radio station Echo of Moscow estimated that more than 60,000 people had participated.Analysts cited a number of factors for the surprising strength of the protest: pent-up anger over government suppression of peaceful demonstrations; some rankling over the dreary economy; and the weather, because Sunday was sunny and relatively warm for March.But overwhelmingly, they cited the youthfulness of the crowds, with many presumably participating in their first political protests.\u201cA milestone event occurred in Irkutsk today \u2014 a new politically active class was born,\u201d Aleksei Petrov, a longtime election monitor in the Siberian city, wrote on Facebook. \u201cAlmost a thousand young people of student age have taken to the streets.\u201dThe young are less likely to watch state television, which endlessly exalts Mr. Putin and government policy. Indeed, all of the state-run channels ignored the rallies. Instead, young Russians tend to turn to independent voices who broadcast their own shows on YouTube.\u201cI am glad and happy that a new generation grew up in the country that will not accept such attitudes from the government and wants to feel that they are citizens,\u201d Mr. Navalny told reporters in court. \u201cThis was news to many yesterday, including me.\u201dVictor Zadorozhnyi, 26, a real estate broker who was attending his first political rally in Moscow, said: \u201cHave you noticed that only young people are around? Why so?\u201dHe predicted, accurately, that none of the events would appear on Channel One, a main government mouthpiece.\u201cYounger people have smarter eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cElder people, they have rigid brains; watching Channel One is a routine for them \u2014 they switch it on to see what is Channel One telling us. Everything\u2019s good, Mashka the cat had kittens yesterday.\u201dFor its part, the Kremlin denounced what it called illegal rallies, though the organizers maintained they had permits for 21 of the protests.\u201cThe Kremlin respects the civic stance of the people and their right to voice their position,\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Mr. Putin, told reporters. \u201cWe can\u2019t express the same respect for those who consciously misinformed people.\u201dMr. Peskov accused the opposition of jeopardizing and exploiting \u201cchildren\u201d by promising them some manner of reward for attending. It was not clear what he was referring to, though Mr. Navalny had offered to help anyone arrested to seek redress and compensation through the European Court of Human Rights.Mr. Peskov defended the actions of the security forces, who often grappled with demonstrators and seemed to cart off some who had not been participating in the protests. \u201cLaw enforcement was acting in a totally correct, highly professional and lawful way,\u201d he said.He denied that the Kremlin had ordered a news blackout on state-run channels, even though none of them reported on the rallies. \u201cWe don\u2019t shape the editorial policies of TV channels,\u201d Mr. Peskov said.The spokesman said the Kremlin was aware that the protests had not been concentrated in the main cities alone, another phenomenon not seen for years. \u201cThe Kremlin is quite sober when analyzing the scale of yesterday\u2019s protests,\u201d he said, adding that it would neither \u201cdiminish, nor exaggerate the numbers.\u201dThe fate of all the arrested protesters in Moscow and other cities was not clear. The police put the figure at 500 arrests in Moscow alone, but an independent organization that tracks such detentions put the number at closer to 1,000. Most were released overnight.Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The donations, Mr. Navalny said, were bribes and the network an elaborate scheme to disguise Mr. Medvedev\u2019s ownership.The claims made by Mr. Navalny and his team could not be independently verified, though Mr. Navalny has established his credibility with past corruption investigations that have stood up to scrutiny.Mr. Medvedev\u2019s spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, dismissed the report as propaganda.\u201cApartments, dachas, mansions, entertainments, everything is there, but something is missing,\u201d Mr. Navalny says close to the end of the video. \u201cOf course, yachts.\u201dTwo yachts are listed as belonging to the same Cyprus company and are both named Fotiniya, the Orthodox name for Svetlana, the name of Mr. Medvedev\u2019s wife.Despite the criminal conviction, Mr. Navalny still plans to run for president.

{"Headline": "Brands Try to Blacklist Breitbart, but Ads Slip Through Anyway", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported bySince the presidential election, hundreds of companies have decided to block their advertisements from running on Breitbart News, the alt-right website closely tied to President Trump\u2019s administration. But several of those brands, from the Nordstrom department store chain to small start-ups, have appeared on the site anyway, another example of how little control companies often have over where their ads are seen online.Nordstrom, which said it moved to prevent its ads from running on Breitbart several months ago, was on the site as recently as two weeks ago, puzzling employees and others online, who were quick to take screenshots and question the company on Twitter. Other advertisers, including BMW of North America and Scribie, a transcription service, also appeared on Breitbart after blocking their ads from the site, a practice known as blacklisting.\u201cIf a brand doesn\u2019t want to be associated with a particular publisher for whatever reason, it\u2019s kind of crazy that they request for it to be blacklisted and still spend money on it,\u201d said Andrew Casale, the chief executive of Index Exchange, an online advertising exchange. \u201cThis is all evidence of gaps in our supply chain, which are becoming visible to the mainstream.\u201dBreitbart and fake news have become the focal points for advertiser awareness around \u201cbrand safety\u201d domestically, said Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research. A spokesman for Breitbart did not respond to requests to comment.Fewer advertisers seem to be appearing on Breitbart, which may be a result of some ad networks and brand safety companies blocking it in recent months, citing hate speech violations or deeming the content too inflammatory.Breitbart had about 1,300 advertisers on its website last month, showing about 2,600 display ads, according to data from Moat Pro, a digital ad intelligence product. That was down from 3,300 advertisers and 11,500 display ads in November. It is not clear if the boycott has had a financial impact, although the top thousand domestic advertisers accounted for 73 percent of display advertising spending last year, Kantar Media said.Brands are finding that the mechanics of online ads, typically placed through a complex system of agencies and third-party networks that resemble a stock exchange, can be difficult to explain to consumers.\u201cAt this time, Nordstrom doesn\u2019t block those types of advertising opportunities because many prominent, well-respected and legitimate websites choose to use these tactics,\u201d Emily Sterken, a spokeswoman, said by email. \u201cOur teams are looking into how we might address this situation.\u201dBen Winkler, the chief investment officer at the agency OMD, said other brands that showed up on Breitbart in spite of blacklists probably had several parties handling their digital ad spending, including local marketing affiliates, publishers and public relations agencies. For a major company, \u201cthere are probably, at any given time, 100 different campaigns being run by a dozen different departments across a thousand websites and a dozen agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think that every single one of those players is religiously and slavishly using the approved site list or is blacklisting Breitbart is unlikely.\u201dBMW of North America has encountered that issue because its marketing plan does not extend to dealerships. While the company does not buy ads on Breitbart, Phil DiIanni, a spokesman, noted that \u201cdealerships are independent businesses and decide for themselves on their local advertising.\u201dJustin Oliver, who oversees digital marketing for Scribie, a start-up in San Francisco, blocked Breitbart from the sites it may advertise on through Google after Sleeping Giants contacted the company in late February. He assumed the issue was resolved but then learned through several messages on Twitter that Scribie was still appearing on Breitbart by way of Facebook\u2019s audience network, which places ads on sites outside Facebook.\u201cThe next thing I know, I\u2019m getting more of these screenshots, and more people saying, \u2018You\u2019re on a white-pride site,\u2019 and it\u2019s the worst thing you can see when you\u2019re a marketing manager,\u201d Mr. Oliver said. He added that he had not chosen to turn on the extended option for the Facebook ads, which allowed for the ads to be placed on Breitbart, and that he shut it off after fielding complaints.The New York Times has also inadvertently run ads on Breitbart. The Times started limiting its ads in the United States to a list of preapproved websites on Jan. 1, said Jason Sylva, vice president for media at the company. But since then, the company has been spotted on Breitbart by people accessing the site from countries like Finland and Canada. The Times is in the process of developing an international preapproved list, Mr. Sylva said.Perversely, because so much online advertising follows people wherever they go on the web, the attention on Breitbart and, separately, more extreme sites has increased their traffic, making the problem even bigger, said Joe Barone, managing partner of digital ad operations for GroupM, the media buying arm of the ad giant WPP.\u201cAs we become more aware of these extreme news environments, they\u2019re actually gaining more traction in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cThey generate more inventory going on exchanges, and the likelihood of showing up on these sites even if blacklisted goes up.\u201dFollow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter @Sapna.Advertisement"}

When it comes, the answer may feel somewhat contrived, but on the way to it readers will enjoy this full-bodied novel about a family of vintners.A haunted family manse overlooking the majestic moors of the British countryside, an orphaned young woman at the mercy of heartless relatives, a Jekyll-and-Hyde doctor \u2014 these are among the strikingly familiar elements of Ward\u2019s debut novel. A Gothic tale that spans 80 years, from 1839 to 1919, \u201cThe Girl From Rawblood\u201d chronicles the downward spiral of the Villarcas, a Spanish-British clan whose ancestral home, Rawblood, is stalked by a ghost, known only as \u201cher,\u201d who rains misery on this benighted family.Under Rawblood\u2019s roof, Mary Villarca flies into rages and stabs out her own eyes with a poker. (Found on the floor beside her, \u201cthe tip still glowed red.\u201d) Her son, Alonso, becomes \u201caddled with opiates,\u201d and his daughter, Iris, the novel\u2019s central narrator, impales him with his own hypodermic needle during a bloody fight. Even the family dog dies of \u201cfear.\u201d Alonso, once a budding immunologist like his idol and contemporary Pasteur, likens \u201cher\u201d to a disease. As he explains it, \u201cshe travels in our blood, passed down.\u201d She is \u201ca biological inheritance, as much as a spiritual one.\u201dBlood-borne pathogens, both real and metaphoric, figure prominently in \u201cRawblood.\u201d The most interesting chapters are set in the 1880s, a time when superstitions about the connection between physical and mental illness were giving way to the emergence of a \u201cbright landscape of science.\u201d If only \u201cRawblood\u201d cohered around the notion of illness as metaphor. Instead, the narrative rambles off to sunny Italy, then back to misty England, where Iris, heeding a message her father sends her in a dream, sets Rawblood afire.The novel is told from the perspectives of five characters: Iris Villarca, the last of the line; Charles Danforth, her maternal uncle; her mother, Meg Villarca; her grandmother, Mary Hopewell Villarca; and Tom Gilmore, a stableboy who serves as Iris\u2019s romantic interest. Adding to the confusion, the timeline zigzags back and forth over the decades for no apparent reason. In the end, this multigenerational saga strains not only the storytelling talents of the author but the patience of the reader.This first foray into adult fiction by a young adult novelist has a family tree worthy of Greek tragedy. Yates Roanoke, a Kansas oil baron and family patriarch, is a predator who has had sex with his sisters and female descendants, creating a monstrous genealogical heritage in which daughters might be nieces, sisters cousins and granddaughters actually daughters. As the narrative moves back and forth in time, the secrets of these tangled relationships are gradually revealed \u2014 most notably when Yates\u2019s adult granddaughter Allegra goes missing and he summons home her cousin Lane, who left Roanoke as a teenager, to help in the search.As vile as Yates\u2019s transgressions are, their repugnance pales in comparison to Engel\u2019s portrayal of the Roanoke girls, who seem to crave his attention. Even Lane, the novel\u2019s central narrator and seemingly the least emotionally scarred, fondly recalls the time when, as a teenager, she churned ice cream with Granddad as he gripped her thigh, his \u201cpinkie slipping under the edge of my jean shorts.\u201d Upon her return to Roanoke, Lane feels \u201cdismayed by how much my body wants to keep moving in his direction, sit beside him, rest my head on his shoulder.\u201d Worse, in a flashback chapter, Lane\u2019s mother, Camilla, pictures her organs \u201cturning black and rotten, even as she keened with pleasure\u201d during a \u201cdark, twisting horror show of love.\u201dThe novel\u2019s grotesquerie is somewhat mitigated by the banality of its prose.

But even as individual women continued to break records and barriers in recent years, the engine began to stall.Pay inequity festers. The rolling scandals at Uber remind us that the frat clubs of Silicon Valley are often rife with sexual harassment.Women in the military are beleaguered by so-called revenge porn and sexual assault.The United States still ranks with Swaziland, Lesotho and Papua New Guinea as the last countries on earth, \u201cadvanced\u201d or not, that don\u2019t mandate paid maternity leave.In corporations, it\u2019s turned out that the trouble isn\u2019t the glass ceiling; it\u2019s the sticky floor.Male chief executives of Fortune 500 companies brag at Davos, Switzerland, about their healthy pipeline of women headed for the C-suite. (But the boast is undermined by statistics that show a paltry 4 percent of Fortune 500 companies have women in the top job.)And a woman who commanded nearly three million more votes than her opponent did not become president.Women who took steady, linear progress for granted are experiencing an unfamiliar and unsettling sensation \u2014 a wary, scary feeling of real and present danger. Meanwhile, it\u2019s dawning on millennials who thought a tweet was the same as a vote that activism means showing up. Hillary Clinton\u2019s ultimate loss in the Electoral College is motivating women in a way her campaign never really did.It was a hopping-mad Pantsuit Nation granny in Hawaii who first planted the idea on Facebook of a Women\u2019s March on Day 2 of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency. In sheer numbers of participants \u2014 up to four million in at least 500 marches across the country \u2014 it turned out to be the largest day of protest in American history.It was good-humored, confident and marked by determination, not anger, and utterly nonviolent: not a single arrest. In short, it was a triumph of organization and mobilization.In its wake, women are packing local forums offering information on how to run for office. Millennials are assertively organizing support groups and protests on behalf of immigrants and refugees. The new energy has edge \u2014 and it suggests that the resistance to the young administration\u2019s signature policies is going to be led and (as it were) manned largely by women.The greatest gift that President Trump may end up bestowing on the women of America could be to purge trivial umbrage from feminist discourse and force renewed energy on big priorities.There has been too much focus on mildly offensive asides by male professors, on clueless comments by chief executives. Annoying as those things are, they don\u2019t compare to a federal budget proposal that slashes support for victims of domestic violence.The marches in January and the activism since have demonstrated the breadth of women\u2019s concerns. They encompass criminal justice reform, immigrant protection, L.G.B.T. rights and gross economic inequality, as well as equal pay and reproductive rights.Tamika Mallory, one of the four energetic young women who headed the Women\u2019s March, is a leading voice for African-American involvement in the feminist resurgence. Exasperated over the years by white women\u2019s lack of recognition of the deeper inequity in black women\u2019s lives, she said that the January protest was an education for her in working with others.\u201cMy work is mainly on criminal justice reform and police accountability, and I had to, for a moment, focus on climate justice and social justice and economic justice. It was a way for us to build power by bringing everyone together. We all come from different experiences, but we all feel and bleed the same, which is why this movement is growing in the way it is.\u201dAnd it would be more powerful still if the new buzzword of intersectional feminism \u2014 which advocates greater racial, economic and religious inclusiveness in the women\u2019s movement \u2014 could intersect across the political and cultural aisle.Cutting after-school programs for kids is calamitous to working mothers, but it isn\u2019t just a women\u2019s issue. It\u2019s a family issue and an education issue. Defunding Planned Parenthood means millions of hard-pressed women will be denied cancer screenings as well as birth control. \u201cThe average woman in America spends five years trying to get pregnant and 30 years trying not to,\u201d Cecile Richards, Planned Parenthood\u2019s president, told me wryly. \u201cThis is a bread-and-butter economic issue.\u201dEight years ago, I started the Women in the World Summit at a small Midtown Manhattan theater to give voice to a rising global women\u2019s movement that hadn\u2019t gotten much attention in the United States.I was inspired by the female firebrands I\u2019d met through my service on the board of Vital Voices, a Washington-based NGO that mentors emerging women leaders from developing countries. I was stunned by the courage of resourceful women from Pakistan, Guatemala, India and sub-Saharan Africa.They had risked their lives in repressive cultures to act against child marriage, honor killings, genital mutilation and systemic domestic violence, and to advocate for basic freedoms American women (and men, of course) take for granted, such as the right to get an education or own property or win child custody in a divorce.There was Chouchou Namegabe of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who defied death threats and kept broadcasting rape testimonials on her radio show, breaking the taboo of silence. There was tiny, fearless Sunitha Krishnan, beaten up by corrupt Hyderabad cops for rescuing little girls and their mothers trafficked in brothels. There was Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian force of nature who, in 2003, united Christian and Muslim women in a protest movement that helped topple the brutal dictator Charles Taylor. There was nothing \u201cmicro\u201d about the aggressions these women confronted.The women we have brought to our stage to tell their stories are living proof that feminism is a movement of basic rights for all human beings. Yet they understand that women bring something different to the debate, the table and the street. Their gender is their glory. They don\u2019t just lean in. They rise up.It is a question many women in America are asking anew.Tina Brown is chief executive of Tina Brown Live Media and founder of Women in the World.

In my mother\u2019s town, winter blizzards were so savage that cows froze to death. Which is to say, my parents are tough people.\u201d\u201cMy psychiatrist sat beside me on the couch and handed me nude photos of a female patient of his. I didn\u2019t know what to say. My shrink was a handsome man in his 70s \u2014 curly hair, a large, ingratiating face. He had a huge and curiously graceful frame, which had always made me feel protected. And he was kind and wise. But his wife died months before, after a long battle with cancer. And he was cracking up.\u201d\u201cOn my last day of work at the Stanford admissions office, a student worker motioned me over. \u2018Nancy, I got a reaction call for you,\u2019 she said, giving me a paper with a name and number on it. It was July. Reaction-call season \u2014 those hairy weeks after the decision letters are mailed \u2014 was long over.\u201d\u201cI was walking the way most of us do in New York, unseeing, following the same path down Eighth Avenue I did every Saturday after my tennis lesson. It\u2019s a way of preserving the illusion of solitude in a teeming city, this sort of traveling on cruise control, oblivious to all around us. It was raining heavily that evening. I peered out from under my umbrella as I approached the crosswalk. The glare of headlights caught a small figure, clutching a polka-dot umbrella. And then a van smashed into her, throwing her forward.\u201d\u201cI always thought it would be bullets that would kill me, or a land mine \u2014 but now it\u2019s this disease, a silent enemy. War and AIDS often go together, I suppose. It is painful to be in a hospital in a foreign country. I am here in Kampala, in Uganda, because I escaped the civil war in my homeland of Sudan. I participated in this war for many years. Leaving it was difficult, and dangerous too \u2014 desertion is treason. But I had to leave.\u201d\u201cThere is only one acceptable way to own a Ramones T-shirt. This is to have attended a Ramones concert, sweated, bled, transcended and then purchased one at a merchandise table en route to the concert-hall exit. (Preferably at the Rainbow Theatre, London, New Year\u2019s Eve 1977, but that\u2019s not a deal breaker.)\u201d\u201cLast year, I had the extreme displeasure of calling my father to let him know that his son, my brother, had killed himself. Getting in touch with my father was, at first, comical. I called the assisted-living home where he has been ever since he was evicted from his last place.\u201d\u201cI was so young when my father died that I don\u2019t exactly remember him, but I do dream about him, and I wish for him to return, and I seem constantly to be in some sort of uncompleted dialogue with him in my head. I was having one of those inner dialogues a number of years ago when I sat down with my wife at the Sunshine Cinema on Houston Street in New York to watch \u2018American Splendor.\u2019 The movie was about my cousin, the underground comic-book writer Harvey Pekar (played by Paul Giamatti), and I somehow got it into my head that the film might mention my father, Norman Gordon, who had cancer like Harvey and, unlike Harvey, died from it.\u201d\u201cLast winter, in the middle of my intern year, I became Facebook friends with a young man who was dying in the intensive-care unit. An investment banker in his mid-20s, he thought he was healthy until a fluttering in his chest and swollen ankles took him to a doctor. Now he was in the I.C.U. with a rare cardiac condition and the vague possibility of a transplant.\u201d\u201cI live in northwest Montana, and I have a teenager, and my teenager plays sports. That means a lot of driving \u2014 over-the-Rocky-Mountains-and-back-in-one-day kind of driving. I think about Meriwether Lewis every time I cross the Continental Divide, usually with sleeping soccer players wearing headphones in the back of my Suburban.\u201d\u201cAs tourists in Vietnam, my friend Vince and I ate coconut candy and rode bicycles around the Mekong Delta. We lunched on a fish that looked like Harry Dean Stanton and joked uneasily about Agent Orange. Now, as part of the same package tour, our no-name bus took us to the Cu Chi Tunnels, the infamous Viet Cong network that snakes below the jungle northwest of Ho Chi Minh City. We were going to slot our bodies into a hole in the ground and try not to entomb ourselves.\u201d\u201cThe summer of 1971 was drawing to a close, and I had a large and growing problem: Kosher, my pet pig. I was 16, and the pig had been a poorly-thought-through joke gift from my father. When he brought her home to our Manhattan apartment in June, Kosher \u2014 the name was also his idea \u2014 was a (sort of) cuddly pinkish-white football who fit into a shoe box and drank from a bottle.\u201d\u201cI grew up a black boy who looked like a white one. My parents divorced when I was 4, and I was raised mostly by my black mom, in a black neighborhood of Philadelphia, during the Black Power movement. I put my dashiki on one arm at a time like every other black boy, but I was haunted by the moments I\u2019d be out with my mother and other black people would look at me as if I were a cuckoo egg accidentally dropped in their nest.\u201d\u201cWhen my sister, Maryan, came to Kenya to visit us in the Dadaab refugee camp last spring, it had been 11 years since we had seen her. Our family arrived a quarter-century ago to escape the war in Somalia and has been here since. I was born in the camp, 21 years ago. But in 2005, when I was 9, Maryan and her husband and son were accepted for resettlement in the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Egypt\u2019s Activists Became \u2018Generation Jail\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "FeatureSix years after the Arab Spring, the country\u2019s democracy activists live under constant threat of prison \u2014 or worse.Supported byMaher and I were sitting in his small, dark apartment at 3 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon in February, waiting for his children to return from their first day back at school after a two-week vacation. A television played a soccer match in a corner, and a coffee table was strewn with textbooks from Maher\u2019s studies at Cairo University, where he is pursuing a second degree, in political science, this one begun behind bars.It was just six years ago that Maher was celebrated around the world as a symbol of freedom and democracy. In January 2011, as the leader of a social-media-savvy network of young activists called the April 6 Youth Movement, Maher mobilized hundreds of thousands of Egyptians in demonstrations in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square and across the country that took down President Hosni Mubarak. The movement was considered for a Nobel Peace Prize, and Maher traveled across Europe and the United States talking about the Arab Spring and Egypt\u2019s future with the likes of Ban Ki-moon and Lech Walesa. But the hopes that were raised by the revolution dissolved into sectarianism and chaos, and Maher\u2019s aspirations were extinguished within two years. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the defense minister and commander in chief of the armed forces, seized power in July 2013 and outlawed protests. Five months later, a judge found Maher guilty of illegal demonstration, rioting and \u201cthuggery\u201d and sentenced him to three years in jail. Another judge added six months to Maher\u2019s sentence for \u201cverbally assaulting a public officer while on duty\u201d after he demanded that the police remove his handcuffs while in court for a 2014 appeal. Maher spent almost all of that period sealed in a small cell in a solitary-confinement wing at Tora Prison, a notorious complex on the outskirts of Cairo, built during British rule, that houses about 2,500 political prisoners and common criminals. Hidden behind 25-foot-high walls, the vast compound encompasses seven prison blocks, ranging from a minimum-security facility for policemen and judges convicted of taking bribes to the supermax \u201cScorpion Prison,\u201d a labyrinth of cells largely reserved for Islamists and April 6 leaders.Today Maher is nominally a free man, but the restrictions on his movements are stifling. The regime is deeply concerned that he could revive the social-media network that brought his followers to the streets six years ago. As it was explained to Maher, \u201ctweets can lead to demonstrations, and demonstrations can lead to revolution, and that will bring down the regime and create martyrs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you are tweeting, you are like a terrorist.\u201dThe front door opened, and Maher\u2019s wife, Reham, their daughter, Meral, 9, and their son, Nidal, 5, spilled into the room. Nidal raced to the television, switched it from the soccer match to a cartoon and then snuggled up to his father. \u201cI missed these moments,\u201d Maher said. During his incarceration, his contact with the children was limited to short visits twice a month. The encounters left his kids perplexed and disturbed. \u201cAt first I lied when they would visit me,\u201d Maher recalled. \u201cMy daughter asked, \u2018Why you are not in our home?\u2019 and I said, \u2018This is my job.\u2019 She said, \u2018So why are you wearing blue?\u2019\u2009\u201d Reham, who met Maher at Cairo University 16 years ago and married him in 2007, told me that after a year they decided to explain the situation to their daughter. \u201cI tried to make her grasp the difference between being detained for political reasons and being a common criminal,\u201d Reham said. \u201cI explained what the revolution was and how people protested. And I told her that when the current regime took over, it didn\u2019t allow people to express their opinions. Sisi knew what happened to Mubarak, so he didn\u2019t want them to speak out again.\u201dIn prison, Maher earned a reputation as a defiant figure, repeatedly sending antigovernment criticism and vivid descriptions of his ordeal to the Western and Egyptian news media. \u201cWhen I heard the president talk about the rule of law and human rights in Egypt, I said, \u2018What is this bullshit?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cThat made me want to write about the reality.\u201d Denied pens and paper, he scribbled messages on tissues, using pens smuggled into his cell, and managed to smuggle the notes out. After they were published, guards would tear apart his cell, removing bricks from walls to search for hiding places. They confiscated his books, radio and clothes, leaving him with only his thin prison uniform. At one point, they covered the open exercise yard with a tarpaulin, blotting out the sunlight, suspecting that Maher might somehow be smuggling messages through the air. Still he continued devising acts of rebellion. A year into his confinement, Maher grew an extravagant handlebar mustache and a long beard and then braided it. \u201cIt bothered them \u2014 it seemed like I was making fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prison officials complained to my father. They said, \u2018Please tell him to shave.\u2019\u2009\u201dAfter getting out of jail, Maher decided to keep wearing facial hair; it helped disguise his identity. Maher\u2019s face is widely recognized in Egypt, and other April 6 Youth Movement leaders have been physically attacked by regime loyalists who blame them for plunging the country into instability and violence. When his wife enrolled their children in private school after Maher was sentenced to prison, she told the administrators that their father was \u201cout of the country on business.\u201d The school never connected their father\u2019s name to the famous activist, and even now, Maher said, when he picks his children up from their school, the staff has no idea who he is.Maher had to be careful with what he told me; the regime might send him back to prison if he criticized Sisi too harshly. \u201cEven if it was something minor, they would jail him,\u201d Reham said. \u201cIt would be a catastrophe for us.\u201d Yet Maher\u2019s reluctance runs against all his instincts. Since his release, he has sensed a deepening anger toward the regime, and he believes that the political climate may be changing. \u201cPeople tell me that they can see through the lies,\u201d he said, \u201cand that they are supporting us.\u201dMany Egyptians have accepted Sisi\u2019s argument that another prolonged round of protests could invite radical Islamists to capitalize on the chaos. \u201cHe\u2019s positioned himself as the sole leader who makes decisions because he knows what\u2019s best for the nation, and he\u2019s saving us from the fate of Syria and Libya,\u201d Khaled Dawoud, a prominent Egyptian journalist and the leader of a small opposition party, told me. Egyptians are proud that the first Arab leader to whom President Trump spoke after his electoral victory was Sisi, a sharp contrast to Barack Obama, who had suspended military aid to Egypt for two years after the police massacre of 1,000 Muslim Brotherhood supporters in August 2013 at Rabaa, a Cairo encampment. Obama never invited the Egyptian president to the White House. \u201cThe thinking is, Egypt is returning to its rightful place as a player,\u201d said a veteran political observer in Cairo, who like many officials I spoke to feared retribution for discussing even innocuous-seeming elements of Sisi\u2019s policies.Sisi\u2019s crackdown has unfolded amid one of the most expansive overhauls of the legal system in Egyptian history. After declaring a state of emergency and disbanding Parliament in 2013, he issued a series of presidential decrees that granted him unprecedented power to silence his critics. A protest law enacted in November 2013 requires three days\u2019 notification before a demonstration can take place and gives the Interior Ministry the right to \u201ccancel, postpone or move\u201d the protest if it determines protesters will \u201cbreach ... the law.\u201d Broad new counterterrorism laws have expanded the definition of terrorism to include civil disobedience; this gives prosecutors latitude to roll over 15-day pretrial detention periods, in many cases without limit. And once a case gets to court, a compliant judiciary, long regarded as hostile to the opposition, has been unforgiving in its sentencing. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily conservative institution,\u201d one official told me, explaining that judges tend to favor a \u201cmaximalist approach\u201d to eliminate threats to the public order and safeguard their own interests. \u201cThey are overwhelmingly the children of judges, like gondoliers in Venice. It is a family business.\u201d According to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, a watchdog group in Cairo, the minister of justice has fired almost half of the 75 judges who called for more democracy in an open letter to Sisi and replaced them with hard-liners. Two hundred others have been sidelined with administrative chores or have left the country.One of the most notorious magistrates, Mohammed Nagy Shehata, known as the \u201cexecutioner judge,\u201d a holdover from the Mubarak era, has handed out hundreds of lengthy prison terms and death sentences to pro-democracy activists. In early 2016, Shehata sentenced three young members of April 6, who were attending a memorial service for a murdered comrade when they were arrested, to life terms for protesting without a license, possessing fireworks and spreading false information. (The sentences were later reduced to 10 years.) In June 2014, another Cairo judge sentenced 25 peaceful demonstrators, some of them teenagers, to 15 years for violating the protest law, blocking roads and attacking public institutions. \u201cKids are going to jail for four or five years,\u201d Dawoud said, \u201cbeing portrayed as anarchists and terrorists. No country in the world jails its young people for that long for demonstrating peacefully.\u201d During the Mubarak era, he said, \u201cI would take part in demonstrations and spend three days in a police station. We got released because we were students, and they were not going to destroy our future. There is no more of that kind of thinking.\u201dSameh Samir, a lawyer with the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a nongovernmental organization that defends many protesters, told me that his office has been overwhelmed by the caseload. \u201cThey are making random arrests, just sweeping people off the streets,\u201d he said. The regime has hampered the ability of human rights groups like Samir\u2019s to defend protesters, freezing their bank accounts and making it increasingly difficult to accept foreign funds, often a lifeline for such organizations.Ten and a Half Kilometers Camp, a collection of concrete bungalows surrounded by a fence just off the Cairo-to-Alexandria highway, typifies the prisons of the Sisi era. Built under Mubarak to house violent Islamists, the camp today serves as a pretrial detention facility for Islamists and a handful of secular political prisoners. A founding member of April 6 named Ayman, who did not want his last name mentioned, landed there in December 2015 after participating in an illegal protest. Thrown into a 26-foot-by-13-foot cell with 35 Islamists, he slept amid a crush of other prisoners on a blanket on the concrete floor. They defecated in a hole surrounded by curtains and were never permitted to leave the cell. \u201cYou need to take the word \u2018privacy\u2019 out of your dictionary if you are going to survive,\u201d he told me.After two weeks, Ayman was moved into a tiny disciplinary cell with 11 other prisoners to await interrogation. They shared a few thin blankets, drank unpurified water from a rusty pipe and survived on one piece of stale bread and cheese each day. A fluorescent light in the 10-foot ceiling shone day and night. \u201cWe learned how to get it unscrewed by standing on each other\u2019s shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to use a little acrobatics.\u201d Twice during his 26 days in the unit, he was shaken awake in the night, blindfolded, taken to an interrogation room and questioned for hours. \u201cThey asked me how the hierarchy of April 6 worked, how do we communicate,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t give them any names.\u201d The authorities finally moved him to Al Kanatar Prison, 15 miles from Cairo, where, after 20 days, a judge ordered his release.Ayman said that many of the prisoners he met were from the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political organization that briefly held power after Mubarak. The group formally renounced violence in the early 1970s, but Ayman watched his cellmates grow hardened in prison. \u201cThe torture and unjust imprisonment for long periods without clear charges or trial dates created human bombs,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one of them was just waiting to get out. They are so thirsty for revenge.\u201d Last April, when he heard that the authorities were again looking for him, Ayman sought refuge in South Africa, where his wife and two young daughters eventually joined him.Days after the Feb. 11 resignation of Mubarak, one of the world\u2019s longest-serving tyrants, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, a transitional military body, sent a bus to pick up Maher and three other protest leaders and took them to a villa owned by military-intelligence officials. Sisi, then the intelligence chief, and two other generals greeted them respectfully, Maher recalled. \u201cSisi said: \u2018You are heroes. You did miracles. You brought down Mubarak. You did something we failed to do for years. But now we need you to stop demonstrating.\u2019\u2009\u201dMaher and the others rejected Sisi\u2019s request. \u201cWe said: \u2018The revolution is not complete. We need to change the cabinet, change the structure of the government.\u2019 We kept sending them demands.\u201d Over the next six months, Maher met with Sisi three times. \u201cWe said the same, and he said the same. \u2018We need to stop demonstrating; stand together against the enemies.\u2019 Sisi always hated the protests.\u201dAfter Mubarak\u2019s downfall, Maher traveled to the United States and captivated students in gatherings at New York University, Harvard, M.I.T. and American University, and met with leaders of the Arab-American community. In Europe, he talked politics and revolution with the first vice president of the European Commission, Catherine Ashton; officials from the United Nations Human Rights Council; and Green Party and Social Democratic representatives to the European Parliament in Brussels. Western diplomats and politicians underestimated the structural weakness of the secular democrats, the grass-roots appeal of the Islamists and the entrenched power of the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 military intelligence and the state security apparatus.Back in Egypt, the April 6 leaders searched for a strategy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a vision,\u201d admitted Walid Shawky, a dentist and a member of the April 6 Political Committee. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an answer for what comes next.\u201d Maher struggled to articulate an ideology, vaguely describing the group\u2019s leanings as \u201csocial democratic, social liberal\u201d \u2014 somewhere between unfettered capitalism and Soviet-style communism. There were debates between those who wanted to transform April 6 into a secular political party that would challenge the Muslim Brotherhood and those, like Maher, who believed that such a transformation was too ambitious. The Brotherhood \u201coutnumbered us 10 to one,\u201d he told me. \u201cI thought that being a pressure group to write a new Constitution would be a better role for us.\u201d April 6 began an awareness campaign throughout the country. \u201cWe used to go out with slide projectors in rural areas, teaching people of all the [human rights] violations made by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces,\u201d recalls Mamdouh Gamal, one of tens of thousands of youths who joined the movement in the immediate aftermath of the revolution. He has since left it.While April 6 members continued their activism, the Islamists cemented their political advantage. The Muslim Brotherhood won parliamentary and presidential elections but enraged much of the population when it tried to draft a Constitution based largely on fundamentalist Islamic principles. By the end of 2012, Egypt was in chaos. \u201cThere were street fights, people at one another\u2019s throats, a real possibility of civil war,\u201d remembered Dawoud, the journalist. April 6 gave its support to Tamarod, a grass-roots movement that gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures favoring early elections that, they believed, would remove the Muslim Brotherhood from power. Maher believed that they had the military\u2019s support. Instead, on July 3, 2013, Sisi went on television and announced that he was deposing President Mohammed Morsi and seizing power. He suspended the Constitution, disbanded Parliament, declared a state of emergency, ordered the arrests of Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and then in August began the deadly attack on the Brotherhood protest camp at Rabaa. After nearly two years of turmoil, many Egyptians were desperate for stability, and April 6 suddenly found itself lacking any popular support. \u201cAt that time, there was not one person in the street who was against Sisi,\u201d recalled Amal Sharaf, the April 6 spokeswoman for the foreign media. After the killings, Sharaf said, \u201cwe tried to make protests, and we got beaten. People with hammers and knives were chasing us. There was a lot of ugliness.\u201dDays after the coup, the interim president, Adly Mansour, a former Constitutional Court chief justice who was appointed by Sisi as a figurehead civilian leader, summoned Maher to the presidential palace. \u201cHe was asked to go on trips to Western countries and say, \u2018This was not a coup, but something the people had asked for,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Ayman, the April 6 founding member. \u201cMaher and the whole leadership of the movement refused to do it. We said, \u2018This is a military coup \u2014 people asked for an early election.\u2019\u2009\u201d (Maher won\u2019t comment on the incident.) The movement\u2019s leaders publicly denounced the Rabaa killings as a \u201cmassacre,\u201d further antagonizing Sisi and sealing the group\u2019s fate. Maher was arrested on Nov. 30 and sent to Tora Prison.In 2014, as Maher and other April 6 leaders languished in jail, Egypt\u2019s Court for Urgent Matters, one of Sisi\u2019s favored tools for stifling dissent, banned the group\u2019s activities, accusing it of espionage and defaming the state. Last winter, Amr Ali, who succeeded Maher as the April 6 general coordinator, received a three-year sentence for conspiring to overthrow the government and joining an illegal organization, another crippling blow to the movement. \u201cThe case against us is not finished,\u201d said Mohammed Samy, the acting coordinator of the outlawed movement. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to capture that many people now, so they put this case in the drawer, and when they want to recapture us, they will open it again.\u201dThe government remains resolute. \u201cApril 6 was not at all a peaceful organization,\u201d said a top Egyptian official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cIt was an anarchist movement that used violence against the security forces and incited violence. They said, \u2018We have to topple the government.\u2019\u2009\u201d When I pressed him for an example of such violence, he cited, without offering proof, an April 6 member who, during the revolution, \u201cseized a gun from a police officer and threw it in the Nile.\u201dI met the school administrator at an evening soiree, attended mostly by gay Egyptians, including my translator, and hosted by a European diplomat at his elegant apartment in a building a few blocks from the Nile. The atmosphere was festive but rife with anxiety: In a sweeping crackdown, the police have been shutting gay bars and nightclubs, entrapping gay people using online dating sites, even raiding private homes in the name of debauchery and prostitution laws.The persecution has gone far beyond the Mubarak regime\u2019s sporadic attacks on the gay community. Over cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Egyptian red wine, I chatted with a towering bearded man who had spent four years as a closeted member of a Salafist sect in Alexandria. \u201cI hated myself, and I thought being a Salafist would cure me of being gay,\u201d he told me. He had fallen in love with another fundamentalist, a Syrian who jilted him and joined the refugee flood to Europe. The man had returned to the gay scene in Alexandria and Cairo \u2014 but the oppressive atmosphere has made it nearly impossible for him to mix socially with other gay men. \u201cWe have never seen anything like this in Egypt,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople are terrified.\u201d (A few days after I left Egypt, my translator would seek, and eventually gain, humanitarian asylum in Germany, claiming that the crackdown on gay Egyptians had endangered him.)Around midnight, the host cleared furniture from the salon, and the crowd gathered around the perimeter of the room to watch the evening\u2019s entertainment. A lithe, bare-chested man danced erotically around another man swathed in a black burqa, prying apart the second man\u2019s legs and removing a beach ball, a teddy bear and other objects and tossing them around the salon. The lewdly choreographed show, taking place out of sight of Sisi\u2019s ubiquitous security forces, seemed an act of defiance. Yet I was asked repeatedly not to identify the location of the party or anything else that might compromise those in attendance.The country\u2019s security forces have displayed their unbridled power in other startling ways. Last year, Ziad Hassan Qenawy, a 3-year-old from the Cairo exurb of Al Shorouk, was detained at Cairo Airport with his father and hauled into court to face sentencing for six guilty verdicts handed down in absentia, ranging from theft to \u201cresisting the authorities.\u201d Each was punishable by a year in prison. The boy\u2019s lawyer, Mahmoud Al Shinawy, calls the case a revenge plot against the father, an affluent businessman who had refused to submit to a police shakedown. In the courtroom, Shinawy told me: \u201cI had to lift Ziad up so the judge could see him. When the judge saw me carrying the boy, he asked me, \u2018Why are you bringing your son to the court?\u2019 I said: \u2018This is not my son. This is the defendant.\u2019\u2009\u201d Ziad was given suspended sentences, \u201cbut he now has a criminal record,\u201d Shinawy said. \u201cIt will last for his entire life, and he will lose many rights.\u201dEgypt\u2019s byzantine justice system seemed to be assiduous in sweeping up toddlers. Last February, a military court found 3-year-old Ahmed Mansour Qorani Sharara and 115 others guilty of killing three people and damaging private and public property during a pro-Muslim Brotherhood demonstration. Ahmed was sentenced to life in prison, but the verdict was later thrown out of court. The police insist that it was a case of mistaken identity and that the real culprit, a teenager, is still being sought.My translator and I walked through the downtown streets, past stray dogs and cats feasting on piles of garbage in alleys, past derelict century-old buildings that looked dangerously close to collapse. After 15 minutes, we arrived at the Eish and Malh bistro, a high-ceilinged pizza-and-salad joint. The April 6 organizer, a skinny 33-year-old with square wire-rim glasses, a white Tour de France shirt, a thin beard and a mop of curly black hair, was smoking furiously at a round table in the center of the large room. He insisted on being quoted anonymously, only to change his mind, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone who reads this to feel it\u2019s a fabrication,\u201d before anxiously changing his mind again.He recounted how plainclothes security men had jumped out of five cars at the April demonstration, punched and pistol-whipped him, then pushed him inside one of the vehicles and blindfolded him on the way to the security headquarters. He spent the next five months in pretrial detention, before a judge ordered his strictly supervised release.\u201cI know that I am always being observed, and it drives you to an obsession,\u201d he said. \u201cI have thought about going abroad, but I need to be more psychologically stable first. I need to have the safe feeling, so that I can organize my life again.\u201d (His anxieties about being rearrested proved well founded. In February, the police detained him without explanation for six hours; when he arrived late for that day\u2019s scheduled detention, he was sent back to prison for 18 days.) As he stood up to leave the pizza parlor, I asked him if the campaign for democracy had accomplished anything. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it was a waste,\u201d he told me after a pause. \u201cIt created a feeling, a space, even if we don\u2019t have that now. Even if the people are afraid again, that experience was so important. In spite of everything, I believe it was worth it.\u201dIn February, I returned to Cairo to meet Maher, who was released from prison on Jan. 5. As the April 6 leader prepared to report for his own far stricter surveillance, I asked him whether this routine, a constant reminder of the unyielding power of the state, demoralized him. Maher shrugged. He had recently finished reading Samuel Huntington\u2019s 1991 book, \u201cThe Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th Century,\u201d and he believed that history would prove his efforts worthwhile. \u201cHuntington wrote that waves of revolution are greater than waves of counterrevolution,\u201d Maher said. \u201cSo it\u2019s three steps forward, two steps back.\u201dA friend picked up Maher at his home, and I followed them in my car to the station. The sun was sinking low over the desert as I drove down the wide street leading from Maher\u2019s home, past shabby apartment blocks with laundry drying on every balcony and stunted palm trees lining the meridian. I parked at the bottom of a hill, across the street from the gated police compound, an Egyptian flag fluttering over the entrance. The wail of a muezzin wafted across the neighborhood; four officers stood inside a corrugated-roof guard post just before the gate. The driver embraced Maher and then motored away. Maher wore his woolen ski cap and carried a black satchel containing a novel and a dinner that Reham had prepared for him. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he told me, hoisting the bag over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll find out what it is when I get inside.\u201d Then he crossed the road, walked past the four unsmiling policemen and disappeared into the shadows.Advertisement"}

I was never fully accepted by either group.\u201d\u201cIt was a rough transitional time in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI was helping my mother fight breast cancer after ending a long-term relationship, and I was also in the midst of leaving a law career in Connecticut to start my own business in New York.\u201d\u201cHe seemed like an easygoing person willing to try new things,\u201d she said, \u201cand that was something that was missing from my previous relationships.\u201dThey had overlapped academically for two years at Harvard, where she had graduated before earning a law degree and a master of public health degree, and where he received an M.B.A.Mr. Liang, also 34, who was born and raised in Strongsville, Ohio, said he never viewed Ms. Wang as being caught between cultures.In his eyes, there was nothing 1.5 about her \u2014 she was simply a perfect 10.\u201cAll I saw was a great smile, a really pretty face and a very intelligent person,\u201d he said.Though they never crossed paths at Harvard, they had several mutual Facebook friends from their alma mater, \u201cwhich certainly planted the seed for our fated meeting,\u201d Ms. Wang said.It also enabled them to better research each other while trading online messages and clicking their way to a first date at a bar in SoHo, where she learned that Mr. Liang was born to Taiwanese immigrants, Sue and James Liang, and that his father is a pediatrician in Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. She was impressed that Mr. Liang was only 29 when he began his business.He learned that while Ms. Wang is known as Sally, her real name is Yuanheng, and that she loves watching ballet or going to the symphony as much as she loves visiting \u201cdifferent dessert joints around New York.\u201dWhen they met, she was living in Connecticut, having completed a one-year clerkship for Judge Charles S. Haight Jr., a Federal District Court judge with chambers in New Haven, and was planning to move to Manhattan. \u201cShe was artsy and quirky, which I really liked,\u201d Mr. Liang said. \u201cThe best thing about her was that she allowed me to be myself and never made me feel like I was being evaluated; it was nice to finally be able to let my guard down.\u201dShe also told him about her mother, Yaling Chen, a cancer survivor who is president of SRS Holdings, a real estate investment firm in Norwich, Conn., and her father, Jianshi Wang, who retired as an international civil servant at the United Nations in New York.\u201cThere were certainly strong cultural similarities between our two families,\u201d Mr. Liang said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s one of the reasons why our first date was so comfortable, and didn\u2019t feel like a job interview, which was always the case with me and other women before I met Sally.\u201dRachel Morehouse was one of the first of Mr. Liang\u2019s friends to hear about Ms. Wang.\u201cI had never seen Jason as happy, or heard him talk about a woman the way he talked about Sally when they first met,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could tell from the very start that she was someone special in his life.\u201dMs. Wang knew she had finally found that someone special in Mr. Liang.\u201cIt was pretty close to love at first sight,\u201d she said. \u201cThings just fell into place, and we grew close very quickly.\u201dIndeed, five months after meeting online, and just two months after Ms. Wang moved to Manhattan, she and Mr. Liang decided to move in together, \u201csqueezing ourselves into my tiny Murray Hill apartment,\u201d she said.Sharing a home, however, magnified a few of the imperfections that neither had noticed while living apart.\u201cWe would go to the Met and other museums, and I was shocked as to how little Jason knew about art,\u201d Ms. Wang said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t his thing.\u201dHis thing, she soon found out, was sports. Sure, he loved her, but he also loved LeBron James. \u201cBeing from Ohio, he almost never missed a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t believe he was O.K. with spending entire Sundays watching football.\u201cBut even though he had little interest in art museums and other things I enjoyed, he always made an effort to go along with me to those places.\u201d Ms. Wang admitted that she was not without her own shortcomings.\u201cWhenever I\u2019m writing,\u201d she said, \u201cI have a tendency to whisper the words out loud, and sometimes Jason says he can\u2019t work in the same room as me. I\u2019m also a person who has always struggled with being on time, which annoys him. But I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve gotten better about it.\u201dIn the larger scheme, Ms. Wang said that Mr. Liang \u201chas made my life much less complicated and much more stable and complete from the very beginning.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s true to his Midwestern roots in terms of being very relaxed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, he\u2019s well aware as to how East Coast people think, and cosmopolitan enough to engage with someone like me, who is more in line with Northeast culture.\u201dShe also said that Mr. Liang\u2019s successful founding of his food delivery company, which has since expanded nationwide, influenced her decision to start DocFlight.\u201cI was very impressed and inspired by the business that Jason had created,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was someone I could lean on for business advice, which was just another aspect of our relationship that seemed to fall perfectly into place.\u201dMr. Liang, who proposed to Ms. Wang with a custom-designed pink diamond ring while they vacationed in the Azores islands in May 2016, said that \u201cwhile being an entrepreneur comes with a lot of struggles and challenges, Sally and I can empathize with each other when things go wrong.\u201cWe can relate to situations that might be hard to explain to someone who is not a business owner,\u201d he continued, \u201cand that helps to stabilize us emotionally.\u201dThey were married March 11 at the 3 West Club in Manhattan.Before walking down the aisle, the couple and their families participated in a traditional Chinese ceremony in which the bride and groom served tea to their parents as a sign of gratitude and respect. It also symbolized the union between the two families.In return, the couple received red gift envelopes of cash and a pure gold bracelet, a traditional Chinese wedding gift.The bride wore a strapless silk dress and silver heels, and the groom an Italian wool black suit, tuxedo shirt and black Fifth Avenue oxford shoes.At the reception, the bride\u2019s father, choking back tears, told his daughter and son-in-law that marriage calls for patience and compromise. \u201cMay both of you be always true to each other, sharing joys and burdens,\u201d he said. \u201cMay you live each day like your last, and each night like your first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the 2000s, it slipped significantly. Although the numbers have inched up in the last couple of years, labor\u2019s portion has not risen above 59 percent since before the recession.Some economists argue that technological advancements are to blame as employers have replaced workers with machines. Others point to trade powered by cheap foreign labor, a view championed by President Trump that particularly resonated among voters.Over the last 15 years, for example, labor productivity has grown faster than wages, a sign that workers are not being adequately compensated for their contributions. And some industries have fared worse than others. Slices of the pie going to mining and manufacturing narrowed the most, while service workers (including professional and business services) had the biggest gains.From manufacturing to retailing, giant companies have managed to gobble up a larger and larger share of the market.Think about the retail sector, where mom-and-pop stores once crowded the landscape. Now it is dominated by a handful of giants like Walmart, Target and Costco.\u201cThey\u2019re very sophisticated and efficient and they don\u2019t use as much labor,\u201d said Mr. Autor, who worked on the research with a team of economists that included David Dorn, Lawrence F. Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen.With efficiencies come advantages.Software platforms and online services, for example, may be expensive to install, but not so costly to expand. Technology can make it easier to exploit smaller competitive advantages. And there is no need for duplicate payroll, shipping or human resources departments.The idea of superstars vacuuming up a majority of goodies is perhaps more obvious on the individual level. Because of technology like cable and satellite television and the internet, music luminaries like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift or sports phenoms like LeBron James or Cristiano Ronaldo can reach a much larger audience and gain a greater proportion of the revenue generated.What was once true of pop stars can now be seen in more mundane industries. \u201cOver the past several decades, only the highest earners have seen steady wage gains,\u201d a report from the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers concluded late last year. \u201cFor most workers, wage growth has been sluggish and has failed to keep pace with gains in productivity.\u201dLarger companies tend to pay better than smaller ones, Mr. Autor and the other researchers say, and in the technology sector especially, salaries can be impressive. Workers there are sharing in the larger pie \u2014 there are just fewer of them to do so.The researchers examined six industries that account for 80 percent of private employment in the United States. In each one, they discovered \u201ca remarkably consistent upward trend in concentration.\u201d In manufacturing, for instance, the top four companies controlled 43 percent of sales in 2012, up from 38 percent in 1982. In finance, the figure grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, and in retail trade it went to 30 percent, from 15 percent.The faster concentration grew, the bigger the drop in labor\u2019s share.\u201cWhat\u2019s different about new superstar firms is they don\u2019t have the cadre of middle-class jobs for nonelite workers,\u201d said Mr. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard.\u201cThat\u2019s very worrisome,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe trend is going on in country after country.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the effect large companies may have had on a decline in workers\u2019 share of income misspelled the surname of an author of the study on such \u201csuperfirms.\u201d He is John Van Reenen, not Van Reenan.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C., in Potential Sign of the Future, Halts New Data Security Rules", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byAfter a 2-to-1, party-line vote by the Republican-led commission, Ajit Pai, the chairman, announced that a portion of privacy rules passed in October would be temporarily stayed.The rules, which were to take effect on Thursday, required high-speed internet providers like AT&T and Comcast to secure their customers\u2019 data against hacking and other unauthorized uses.Mr. Pai, in a sign that additional swipes at privacy rules may be in store, also said the commission should not be engaged in any policing of broadband providers over online privacy. He said the Federal Trade Commission should instead oversee the broadband and web industries.\u201cAll actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, enforced by the same agency,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a joint statement with Maureen K. Ohlhausen, the trade commission\u2019s acting chairwoman.During Mr. Wheeler\u2019s tenure, the F.C.C. created numerous regulations meant to protect users of broadband internet, including the privacy rules passed in October that required strong data-security measures and allowed internet service providers to collect data on web browsing and app usage only with the permission of customers.The commission has moved swiftly to dismantle those regulations since Mr. Pai\u2019s appointment as chairman in January.The agency has closed an investigation into claims that internet service providers may have been violating net neutrality provisions ensuring equal access to all websites, and has pledged to revoke the regulatory classification of broadband service under which it is treated like a telephone-style utility.Under Mr. Pai\u2019s leadership, the commission has also halted nine broadband providers from giving subsidized service to low-income users, putting in limbo reforms to a subsidy program known as Lifeline.The vote to stay the new data security rules came in response to petitions filed by broadband providers and advertising trade groups that said the rules would give web companies like Google and Facebook an unfair advantage in the online advertising market. Mr. Pai said the F.C.C. might create a weaker version of the privacy rules.Mignon Clyburn, the F.C.C.\u2019s lone Democratic commissioner, voted against Mr. Pai\u2019s order on Wednesday. She has objected to many of his actions, including a decision to abandon the commission\u2019s legal fight to lower how much prisoners pay to make phone calls, which Ms. Clyburn has called a civil rights issue.The F.C.C. is halting the security rules even as data breaches have become routine, Ms. Clyburn said in a statement, adding that the decision opened the door to further reductions in consumer protections.The F.C.C. decision, Ms. Clyburn said in the statement, \u201cfells a tree to ostensibly prune a branch.\u201dConsumer advocates had hailed the privacy rules as a watershed development. There are currently no privacy laws for web firms, and the United States trails many nations in Europe in protecting consumer\u2019s online data.\u201cInternet service providers have a unique, all-access view into consumers\u2019 daily online lives,\u201d said Laura MacCleery, a vice president at Consumers Union. \u201cWe urge the F.C.C. to focus on acting in the public\u2019s interest \u2014 rather than the industry\u2019s \u2014 and to maintain these critical rules.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Foreign Hacking. The Big Surprise Was a Candid F.B.I.", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cThere was a willingness to speak with us about this case,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. \u201cI was somewhat pleasantly surprised, and I rarely have that feeling when trying the F.B.I. for help on stories.\u201dThe bureau was so obliging, Mr. Goldstein said, in part because Evgeniy M. Bogachev is a fugitive. The attention generated by a widely read newspaper report can spur those who might have knowledge of his activities to come forward in hopes of reward money. (In this instance, the amount \u2014 $3 million \u2014 is the most ever offered in a computer-crimes case.)After the Obama administration placed sanctions on Russia following election-related hacking, Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Schwirtz set out to fill in what they saw as a hole in news media coverage of the issue: No one had attempted to profile Mr. Bogachev, one of two private Russian citizens named in the sanctions.In fact, throughout their reporting, Mr. Schwirtz and Mr. Goldstein were struck by the information hiding in plain sight and by the detail it contained \u2014 unusual for cybercrime and espionage cases.Even Mr. Bogachev\u2019s Most Wanted poster was surprisingly rich.Mr. Goldstein compared the poster with one released by the State Department promising a $10 million reward for information leading to the capture of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Officials offered \u201cvirtually nothing beyond that he was the spiritual leader of the Taliban,\u201d he said.Not so with Mr. Bogachev: \u201cThe wanted poster here described where he has real estate, his birthday, where he likes to sail his boat,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said.They obtained the remarkable lead photo for the story \u2014 of Mr. Bogachev posing, in leopard-print pajamas, with a Bengal cat \u2014 from a Powerpoint presentation put on, at a conference, by an F.B.I. agent and cybersecurity researchers.(\u201cMike pinned down the breed of cat,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said, in a testament to the power of reporting in tandem. \u201cI would have just written \u2018cat.\u2019\u201d)Though Mr. Schwirtz traveled to Ukraine to conduct some interviews, the two tracked down a number of sources online. They spoke to several hackers linked to Mr. Bogachev, one of whom is in prison in Kentucky and was reachable by email.And as today\u2019s story explains, under the Russian government\u2019s patronage, Mr. Bogachev has spurned the anonymity of a dark web hacker in favor of a flamboyant lifestyle in a beachside resort town \u2014 a lifestyle that leaves behind a digital trail.After a source tipped them off to Mr. Bogachev\u2019s involvement in a lawsuit with a real estate company, Mr. Schwirtz took an unconventional shot: He contacted the man listed in court documents as Mr. Bogachev\u2019s lawyer, via Facebook.Still, it was intelligence operatives \u2014 current and former, in both the United States and Ukraine \u2014 who proved the most indispensable sources.They shared, for instance, screen names Mr. Bogachev has used as a hacker \u2014 and the method they had used to isolate them. The trick, they explained, \u201cis to go back in time as far as possible, to a point where an individual was not as security-conscious as he or she would come to be later in their career,\u201d Mr. Schwirtz said.(Mr. Bogachev was initially identified thanks to an email \u201cthat was not nearly as secure as he eventually made all of his communications,\u201d he elaborated.)In the end, agents were forthcoming with leads on nearly every aspect of the Bogachev case \u2014 with a single exception. \u201cThe one area that became quite fraught was the discussion of the espionage, at which point most of the agents started breathing heavily and changed the subject,\u201d Mr. Schwirtz said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s understandable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Snap\u2019s I.P.O., Evidence of Bankers\u2019 Strategy", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorSnap\u2019s bankers deserve more than the commissions they will receive for a successful, perhaps flawless, initial public offering.Not bad for a pair of twentysomethings. (Yes, be jealous \u2014 what did you do in the first half of your 20s besides drink beer?)The key to a successful I.P.O., after all, is to get that first-day pop, as Facebook learned to its chagrin in 2012. And Snap\u2019s shares will most likely rise on Thursday even after exceeding the previous range.The bankers played another tried-and-true trick: limit the supply. Only about 19 percent of Snap\u2019s total share float was offered, and a quarter of that amount was sold subject to a one-year lockup. Snap\u2019s remaining capital needs were filled by a $1.2 billion loan from the same bankers underwriting the offering.Finally, Snap played off the simple laws of supply and demand and the strange world of internet valuations. There are only a few big internet companies around, and when one goes public, investors pounce.Here, internet valuation does not depend upon silly things like revenue or, heaven forbid, earnings, but prospects. One way (and there are many ways) to think about this, is the chance that Snap has to hit a certain valuation reflected as follows:Basically, Column 1 is the chance of meeting the valuation in Row 2. You can then value this chance by multiplying column 1 by row 2. So if Snap has a 1 percent chance of reaching a valuation of $100 billion, the value of that chance is $1 billion.That is the price a rational investor with a taste for risk would pay for that chance. Someone without a taste for risk would prefer paying for a 99 percent chance of getting $1 billion which would be valued at $1.01 billion.In this chart, the valuation of Snap is $22.8 billion if you add up the value of all the chances. But the chance of Snap being worth below its pricing valuation of $24 billion is 64 percent.Yet if you are basing this on the prospect of Snap, the valuation set on Wednesday for Snap is a rational bet for a risk taker. You can play with the numbers, but you get the idea that the bigger company you think this might be, the more it adds to the current, risky valuation.And Snap is all about prospects and risk. It will depend on doing something no other social network has done \u2014 which is to invent another product equally successful.So far, Snap has done only ephemeral pictures well. There is yet to be a verdict on its Spectacles, though they will probably go the way of Google Glass, a brief novelty.The bet in Snap as it exists today is in preserving and growing the core business, which already may be plateauing, and finding a new business. Can that happen? The chance of it achieving that is how the valuation works.In this regard, Snap is not Facebook or Twitter, the two most used comparisons. Facebook\u2019s core business was growing at the time of its I.P.O. and has continued to grow since, while Twitter was valued by investors based on what they thought about growth in its main business.For Snap, investors have ignored some big warning signs. In addition to the possibility of declining user growth, there is also the inability of Snap to gain traction outside the United States or outside its core young demographic. And that Instagram and WhatsApp (under the Facebook umbrella) are emerging as real competitors.Then there is the governance issue. The company has chosen to keep all control with its co-founders and gives no vote to the shares held by the public. So in some ways, Snap is more like Shake Shack or Fairway with a touch of Theranos, than it is like Facebook or Twitter.I could, of course, be all wrong about this. There is a chance that Snap will be the next Facebook, churning out products the teenage set loves for the next nine decades of Mr. Spiegel\u2019s life. In a year or two, we should have a good sense of Snap\u2019s direction, and when we do it will be a test not just of the internet I.P.O. model but corporate governance as well.In the meantime, Snap will likely spur more internet market debuts \u2014 after all, there is a drought of them \u2014 as bankers sell this good result to push clients out.And that is really what the Snap offering is about: good deal-making and salesmanship by its bankers at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.Congratulations, of a sorts, are due.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

I wondered whether I was allowed the joy of arrival as the memorabilia of horror stared at me.I boarded the subway heading toward Taksim Square in the center of Istanbul. The aboveground train rushed past ugly high-rises and megamalls built as a result of the aggressive urban transformation policy of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P. Changing lines at Yenikapi, a new transportation hub on the southern shore of the Bosporus, I found the subway station decorated with tall cylindrical columns displaying photographs of policemen and soldiers who died fighting the coup plotters last July 15. Below each photograph was an account of where and how the person was \u201cmartyred.\u201dPresident Erdogan had turned Istanbul into a giant site for propaganda calling upon the citizens to support his plans to replace Turkey\u2019s parliamentary system with a presidential system that would give him sweeping powers. The plan has already been approved by the Parliament, where the A.K.P. holds the majority of the seats, and its fate will be decided by a referendum on April 16.The train stopped at Taksim Square. I looked up at the towering Ataturk Cultural Center. Originally commissioned as an opera house in 1946 as part of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk\u2019s project of European modernity, and once home to the Turkish State Theater and State Opera and Ballet, it is now the focus of disputes over reconstruction of Turkey\u2019s public spaces, with residents protesting the government\u2019s effort to replace green spaces and historical buildings with expressways and shopping malls. Now it was covered with a banner displaying sunrise over the Bosporus and the Turkish flag \u2014 a reference to the morning of July 16, when President Erdogan appeared on television at dawn and announced that the attempted coup had been thwarted.Over the next few days, every journey through Istanbul provide more examples of the government\u2019s enthusiasm to monumentalize tragedy. A short walk from the Taksim Square, Besiktas Soccer Stadium was draped with Turkish flags and banners mourning victims of an attack by a Kurdish terrorist group. One said: \u201cWe Won\u2019t Kneel Down.\u201d Another read: \u201cMy Martyr, We Are On Your Path.\u201dI went over to the Bosporus Bridge. Ottoman-era mansions lined both sides of the strait; ferries and cargo ships made thin white lines on the water. The Bosporus was blue, shimmering under the sun, a constant source of solace in Istanbul. During the coup, tanks and soldiers had blocked the bridge until a civilian crowd and the police had disarmed them. Now police cars were parked on both sides, beneath the bridge\u2019s legs \u2014 one in Europe, the other in Asia. The bridge had been renamed July 15 Martyrs Bridge.Every time I walked into a store, I found the shopkeepers glued to a television set. Turkish state television had taken to broadcasting live the funerals of those killed in terrorist attacks. The networks would stay in touch with the families of the deceased and construct sentimentalized narratives on the aftermath of the tragedies. A cult of martyrdom reminiscent of that in post-revolution Iran was being manufactured in Turkey.His eye on the April referendum to establish a monarchical presidential system, Mr. Erdogan made an unmistakable choice to blow up, rebrand and capitalize on the collective anxiety instead of soothing it.One of my favorite things about Istanbul is its ever-changing walls. What is plastered and painted tells you the city\u2019s mood. After protests in 2013 against President Erdogan\u2019s plans to build a shopping mall in Gezi Park, the walls were alive with humor and dissent. This time around, every flat surface \u2014 a rooftop, a billboard, a blank wall \u2014 had A.K.P. propaganda on it. It was uninteresting and repetitive: \u201cWe Are the Nation. We Won\u2019t Let Turkey Fall Victim to Coup and Terrorism\u201d and \u201cMy Martyr, I Celebrate Your Martyrdom.\u201d\u201cSovereignty belongs to the nation,\u201d a line from the Turkish Constitution, which Mr. Erdogan has taken to mean that his electoral victories enshrined the national will in his person, was displayed on almost every bus and subway stop. One morning, I saw some electricity and water bills dropped at my doorstep. On the lower part of the bills, the A.K.P.-run distribution companies had printed a thumb-size Turkish flag and the sovereignty line. . Growing up in Kemalist Turkey, I was taught that the Turkish flag, the Quran and bread were equally holy, and were never to be put on the floor. Instinctively I picked up the electricity bills and placed them on my landlady\u2019s dining table.In the once-bustling cafes and restaurants of Istanbul, people are paying equal attention to potential new terrorist attacks and the decibel of their voices when they speak of the government. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s crackdown has moved far beyond the supporters of Fetullah Gulen, the cleric blamed for the coup, to include almost every dissenting voice across the political spectrum. In early February, 330 university faculty members, united only by their opposition to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s policies over the years, lost their jobs.On one of my last days in the city, I took the ferry across the Bosporus to the Asian side. I looked out of the window, at Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia from the distance. On the wall at the far end of the ferry, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s face appeared on a LCD screen. I observed how those who don\u2019t agree with him resist with an act of learned muting, looking away and putting their headphones on \u2014 even when they don\u2019t have anything to look at or listen to.I looked back at the Bosporus in the dusk, my gaze lingering on the Byzantine walls surrounding the Old Peninsula, toward the fish-sandwich shops under the Galata Bridge, turning their lights on. The water seemed to be the only surface free of government propaganda.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this essay mistakenly described viewing the Ataturk Cultural Center from a train at Taksim Square. The train is underground at that point, not above. It also referred incorrectly to the founder of modern Turkey. He is known as Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, not Ataturk Kemal.Busra Erkara is a writer based in New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When a Few Bucks Can Get Students to the Finish Line", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byFixesKalif Robinson is a star at Georgia State University in Atlanta. He\u2019s a straight-A senior, majoring in economics and minoring in Arabic. In the fall he\u2019ll start a two-year Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Graduate Fellowship, studying foreign affairs in Washington, training to be a diplomat.It nearly didn\u2019t happen. Robinson has stitched together his Georgia State tuition and fees with loans, a federal Pell grant, Georgia\u2019s Hope Scholarship and two jobs. He\u2019s worked nearly full time since his freshman year; today he\u2019s a waiter and works at the campus advising center. His father is a musician and music teacher. \u201cMore often than not, I\u2019ve had to give my parents money,\u201d he said.There was: a Panther Retention Grant. Named after Georgia State\u2019s mascot, the program offers students an immediate few hundred dollars, sometimes as little as $300, without bureaucracy. Most recipients are seniors whose financial aid has run out. For many, the grant gets them over the finish line, instead of being left just short of graduation \u2014 saddled with debt but denied the degree that could have helped pay it down.Robinson was not a senior and was not dropping out. But the grant saved his course of study.Let\u2019s contemplate how unusual this is. Georgia State was the first school to use these grants, in 2012. Now perhaps a dozen schools use them.The assumption behind them is also fairly new: that a university can and should do things to help students graduate. Until 10 or 15 years ago, American universities and colleges paid a lot of attention to recruiting students, and shockingly little attention to helping them succeed while there.Only in 2000 did the government begin requiring community colleges to submit graduation rates in order to receive federal financial aid. That requirement was applied to four-year colleges in 2003. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important enough before that for the Department of Education to include it in their eligibility criteria,\u201d said Thomas Bailey, a professor at Teachers College, Columbia University.And those rates were appalling. \u201cAll of sudden a publication says that this college has a 20 percent graduation rate,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cWell, that seems pretty low.\u201dEven so, the rates were indefensible. Some states began to include graduation rates in their funding formulas for public universities; today, about seven do this seriously, said Howard. That gives schools a direct incentive to help students succeed.Another factor has been much slower to change: That is a fatalism on the part of colleges and universities about low-income students, minorities and students who are the first college-goers in their families. These students tend to emerge from weaker high schools and are less academically prepared. They have less family and social support than they need in college. They sometimes feel they don\u2019t belong.But by far most important, they lack money. In the book \u201cPaying the Price,\u201d Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education at Temple University, relates studying 3,000 college students and finding that even with financial aid, the cost of college derailed them over and over. Some even went hungry or became homeless.Most institutions don\u2019t see how they can handle these overwhelming problems. \u201cThere\u2019s been this view that there\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d said Tim Renick, vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success at Georgia State. The idea is still widespread that demography is destiny.Except at some institutions, one of which is Georgia State. In 2008, Georgia was hit hard by the recession, and over the next four years the school lost $40 million in state money, said Renick. The student body has changed \u2014 becoming poorer, more first-generation and less prepared. SAT scores dropped. Today, 80 percent of Georgia State\u2019s students are low income, minority or first-generation \u2014 or all three.There is no evidence that Georgia State lowered standards to achieve the higher graduation rates. \u201cGraduation requirements have gotten a little more rigorous,\u201d said Renick. The school has moved away from traditional remedial classes, instead drawing less-prepared students into regular classes with extra tutoring, which has produced huge increases in retention rates. It has changed math instruction, moving to a flipped model (watch lectures outside class on video, do problems in class) that has helped many more students do well. The fastest-growing majors \u2014 computer science and biology \u2014 are tough ones, said Renick. And record numbers of minority students have been getting science, math and tech degrees each year.Panther Retention Grants originated after Mark Becker, the university\u2019s president, gave the scholarship fund a personal donation of $40,000 in 2011. \u201cDo something different with it,\u201d he said.Many colleges have small pots of money to help students in emergencies such as eviction from their homes. Retention Grants, by contrast, focus on students who are just short of the finish line.As with all of Georgia State\u2019s new programs, the idea emerged from a big push to use data to measure everything and allow the school to intervene rapidly with students.The data showed that many students got to their senior year (often a little late) on track to graduate, but couldn\u2019t scrape together the money to finish.\u201cWe were dropping a thousand students a semester because they couldn\u2019t cover tuition and fees,\u201d said Renick. Georgia State was graduating about 4,500 students a year, so the dropouts were significant. \u201cSome were thousands short, but others needed just a few hundred dollars,\u201d according to Renick. For some, $300 would have been enough.The first semester, the school chose 40 students who needed a little bit of money and deposited it in their school account. Now Georgia State gives out about 2,000 such grants each year, more than any other school. The grants average $900. Most, but not all, go to seniors. (Grantees must also attend financial counseling.) \u201cIt turns 70 percent of them into immediate graduates,\u201d said Renick.The grants are easy on Georgia State\u2019s balance sheets, since they not only retain the students, but also return all of the outlay in the form of payments to the school. By keeping each student, the university also continues collecting their tuition, fees and aid, which in the 2012-13 academic year averaged $3,000 per semester for each student.Does that mean the grants work? Not so fast. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet whether they\u2019re betting on winners who would have already completed, or whether they\u2019re changing the odds,\u201d said Goldrick-Rab.Garmise said that for some schools, the study opens a larger issue: Is financial aid just for giving students access to college? Or can it be used to help them complete it? \u201cWe have a problem to solve,\u201d she said. \u201cThe deeper question is how do we rethink financial aid as part of the total student journey.\u201dIn my next column, I\u2019ll look at another strategy Georgia State and many other schools are using to help students graduate. Students say they want flexibility and choices, more part-time options, night classes. But according to this strategy, what will actually help them graduate is exactly the opposite.An earlier version of this essay misidentified, in one instance, the name of the university that is its focus. It is Georgia State University, not Georgia Tech.Advertisement"}

The remark, which came as part of a 40-minute address on the theme of America as \u201ca land of dreams and opportunity,\u201d was met with swift outrage online.Mr. Carson turned his attention to slavery after describing photographs of poor immigrants displayed at the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration. These new arrivals worked long hours, six or seven days a week, with little pay, he said. And before them, there were slaves.\u201cThat\u2019s what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less. But they too had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters, might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land.\u201dThe comparison was first reported by USA Today and quickly drew the ire of social media users who attacked the secretary, who is African-American, for what they saw as racially insensitive comments. On Twitter, the comedian and actress Whoopi Goldberg recommended Mr. Carson watch the 1980s mini-series \u201cRoots.\u201dThe Department of Housing and Urban Development was stunned by the uproar and spent part of the afternoon responding to the news media on Twitter. In a statement, it said critics were watching only a short clip from a 30-minute speech and were viewing the remarks in bad faith.\u201cThis is the most cynical interpretation of the secretary\u2019s remarks to an army of welcoming HUD employees,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cNo one honestly believes he equates voluntary immigration with involuntary servitude!\u201dA spokesman for the department said Mr. Carson\u2019s speech appeared to cause little upset among the employees who had gathered to hear him speak. Several hundred people attended the event and many lingered afterward to snap selfies with Mr. Carson, who was sworn in last Thursday.On Monday night, following a radio interview in which he defended his remarks earlier in the day, Mr. Carson also did so on Twitter. \u201cYou can be an involuntary immigrant,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cslaves didn\u2019t just give up and die, our ancestors made something of themselves.\u201d He continued, \u201cAn immigrant is: \u2018a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country.\u2019\u201dBut later that night, on Facebook, Mr. Carson drew a clear distinction between immigrants and slavery: \u201cThe Immigrants made the choice to come to America. They saw this country as a land of opportunity. In contrast, slaves were forced here against their will and lost all their opportunities. We continue to live with that legacy.\u201dMr. Carson\u2019s speech was not the first time that a newly minted Trump official has caused offense with their handling of African-American history.Mr. Trump himself has described \u201cinner city\u201d neighborhoods as a crime-ridden \u201chell\u201d in need of a tough police response, a vision of urban life that has been received unfavorably by many minority leaders.She later backtracked, saying in a statement that the history of black colleges and universities \u201cwas born, not out of mere choice, but out of necessity, in the face of racism, and in the aftermath of the Civil War.\u201dJack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reports of Sexual Assault Increase at Two Military Academies", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Reports of sexual assaults increased at two of the three national military academies \u2014 the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis and the United States Military Academy at West Point \u2014 last year, according to a new military study.The Defense Department said that reports of sexual assault at all three academies decreased over all, but that is because the number of reports at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado dropped.At West Point, there were 26 reports of sexual assault in the 2015-16 academic year, up from 17 the year before. At the Naval Academy, the number rose to 28 reports from 25. By comparison, reports dropped steeply to 32 from 49 at the Air Force Academy.The Defense Department acknowledged that even as reports of sexual assaults increased, many young men and women who are assaulted do not report it. \u201cResults from this year\u2019s report demonstrate that estimated instances of sexual assault and sexual harassment greatly outnumber reports made to authorities,\u201d Anthony M. Kurta, who is performing the duties of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said in a letter to Congress submitting the report.The Defense Department did try to put a positive spin on the latest numbers, saying that more people were feeling emboldened to report sexual abuse.The new study comes as the Marine Corps has been rocked by disclosures that an all-male, invitation-only group on Facebook called Marines United shared thousands of nude and other private photos of Marine Corps women. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has harshly criticized such violations of privacy and betrayals of trust, and has signaled that he will hold military and civilian officials accountable.At a congressional hearing on Tuesday, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee sharply rebuked the Marine Corps commandant, Gen.

And the thing is, there was a movie that I did consider my favorite for many years, but I\u2019d parked it on some side ramp in my mind. I\u2019d seen this movie 10 times by the end of college, then took a break. A long break. Long enough that I became anxious about revisiting it.What if it didn\u2019t hold up? What if my obsession had been a sign of callow youth? Some respected critics considered it sappy. I\u2019d outgrown sap, hadn\u2019t I?It\u2019s dicey business to set up your older self to pass judgment on your younger self. My younger self was a passionate guy who wouldn\u2019t shut up about his favorite movies and bands.I couldn\u2019t slowly back away from Supertramp. I had to disown it. Sorry, Supertramp.Would \u201cHarold and Maude\u201d become my cinematic Supertramp?I first saw Hal Ashby\u2019s 1971 cult classic while in middle school, taken by a mischievous babysitting cousin, the same one who introduced my little brother and me to \u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail.\u201dPreviously, my idea of movie funny was Inspector Clouseau karate-kicking himself into a dish-filled cabinet in \u201cThe Return of the Pink Panther\u201d or cowboys farting around the campfire in \u201cBlazing Saddles.\u201d \u201cHoly Grail\u201d introduced me to the hilarity of a knight losing his arms and legs in battle. (\u201cIt\u2019s just a flesh wound.\u201d)\u201cHarold and Maude\u201d went even darker.Cut to present day, and I have my own middle-school- and high-school-age daughters and reason not to consider suicide a laughing matter. Yet I still felt the tug of this movie, like an old pal you suddenly realize is on Facebook.Instead of watching it on a TV screen, I wanted to recreate the conditions under which I\u2019d originally enjoyed this movie, so I booked it at Chicago\u2019s Music Box Theater as part of my film series, \u201cIs It Still Funny?\u201d It was a packed house, and as Harold embarks on that first fake suicide, I could feel my own tension building.Then his mother addresses her hanging child with a droll \u201cI suppose you think that\u2019s very funny, Harold,\u201d and the dam burst: laughter, release, a crowded theater in sync in the dark.Holy Toledo, what a great movie. I mean, that shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise given that it used to be my favorite, but still \u2026 me of little faith.It wasn\u2019t just that it still makes me laugh at big moments and small. It wasn\u2019t just that the movie still guts me at the end. It wasn\u2019t even how impressed I was by the tightness of Ashby\u2019s direction and Colin Higgins\u2019s screenplay, how expertly the film establishes a tone that balances the macabre and some literal cheerleading for life \u2014 and how it anticipates the deadpan yet emotionally penetrating works of Wes Anderson and other American indie filmmakers.What I hadn\u2019t expected was how \u201cHarold and Maude\u201d would connect me to sensibilities that have become part of my core. Maybe this is why I loved the movie so much, because it dramatizes a way of seeing the world that looks directly into darkness but also emphasizes humor, creative thinking and kindness while concluding that cynicism and despair are dead ends.As twisted as the movie is, it feels the way I often have felt, that push-pull of amusement and horror, curiosity and withdrawal, with songs heightening the emotions. Music plays a key role in almost all of my favorite movies, and \u201cHarold and Maude\u201d addresses the why.What does Maude do to lift Harold out of his morbid spiral? She gives him a banjo because everyone should be able to make some music. As someone who plays guitar more enthusiastically than skillfully for soul-restorative purposes, who regards his record collection as an encyclopedia of moods and who has songs constantly running through his head, I relate.Time hasn\u2019t treated all of \u201cHarold and Maude\u201d with such grace. The whimsy and political humor can get thick, and our feelings about age and vitality have evolved. But nothing is perfect, and the movie\u2019s errors, if you\u2019d call them that, are on the side of its big heart. I\u2019d like to say the same about myself. I was so concerned about how my older self would judge my younger self that I didn\u2019t consider something more powerful: I\u2019m not just seeing how the movie was but how I was and still am. This is what great art can do.I\u2019m sorry, \u201cHarold and Maude,\u201d for denying you for so long. You\u2019re my favorite movie once again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump-SoftBank-Saudi Connection", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byDealBookAs camera lights flashed, President-elect Donald J. Trump strode across the lobby of Trump Tower with Masayoshi Son, the colorful Japanese entrepreneur, in December.The photo op was intended to be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign.This is not a secret to anyone who has been paying even a modicum of attention to the news that has dribbled out about the fund.While Mr. Son has pledged to provide a quarter of the fund himself, hardly any of the money comes from investors in the United States \u2014 with the exception of several nominal $1 billion investments, including from Apple, Qualcomm and Larry Ellison of Oracle.Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Mr. Son, and therefore Saudi Arabia, to take over some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most promising companies and intellectual property could be seen as being at odds with his nationalistic talk.\u201cWould you take money from the Saudis?\u201d Sean Hannity of Fox News asked him last year.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, without missing a beat.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Riyadh. \u201cCrooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Facebook. \u201cI am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!\u201dThose references were made in the context of politics, but should they also extend to business?This column isn\u2019t taking a position on the politics or the morality of taking money from Saudi Arabia. But it is a conversation that is worth having.Just as the United States has tried to become energy independent from the Middle East for economic and political reasons, we may be on the verge of taking the opposite tack when it comes to our innovative start-ups.While Mr. Trump wants to stimulate foreign investment in the United States, he has also talked tough about the Middle East and terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were citizens of Saudi Arabia.In true Trumpian style, he has made somewhat contradictory statements about Saudi Arabia: \u201cSaudi Arabia \u2014 and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a campaign stop. \u201cThey spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\u201dSaudi Arabia\u2019s laws are antithetical to many Americans and even to Mr. Trump\u2019s most conservative views: Women are not allowed to drive, homosexuality is punishable by stoning to death, and freedom of religion is not permitted.Which makes it all the more surprising that when Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince, came to California last year, a who\u2019s who of technology and venture capital chief executives lined up to meet with him. The tour included meetings with Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and venture capital investors like Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel.Or maybe it is not surprising if you take the view that an influx of cash from Saudi Arabia will most likely lift the valuations of all Silicon Valley companies. Cash is cash.In fairness to Mr. Trump, if he does want to bring huge investment sums to the United States, it is hard do that without involving some countries with which we have had complicated relationships. Some of the largest money is tied up in vast sovereign wealth funds.Not all of the $50 billion investment that Mr. Son pledged to make here is likely to come from SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, the one backed by Saudi Arabia. Some of it may come directly from SoftBank, which owns Sprint and is hoping to merge it with T-Mobile.All that said, can you imagine if Mr. Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower with Prince Mohammed talking about a $50 billion investment in the United States from Saudi Arabia?It\u2019s hard to see \u2014 but then again, we live in strange times.Advertisement"}

Her working materials were simple pop songs and standards \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rarely blues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but her medium was her body itself: her voice, her back story. The past imprinted its lines on her skin; the future seemed to be running out. Few voices in America have announced themselves as unmistakably as hers, and few have carried as fully formed a narrative load. In April 1957, the freelance photographer Jerry Dantzic, working for Holiday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record company, Decca, drew the assignment of finding a new chapter in her story during an Easter Week engagement at the Sugar Hill club in Newark. Holiday was 42 at the time and had been singing professionally for about 27 years, coming off a successful concert at Carnegie Hall and a new marriage to Louis McKay, with whom she shared a heroin habit. Newark in the late 1950s was a thriving jazz hub, but more than that, it was a place where she could work \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she had been barred from singing in New York nightclubs after a 1947 drug conviction. For Mr. Dantzic, who died in 2006, Newark was a place to capture her away from the pressures of her home city, including the unsparing scrutiny from law enforcement. Holiday had opened much of her life to the public with her lurid autobiography, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLady Sings the Blues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which came out the previous year. With Mr. Dantzic, she revealed homier sides of her life, which needed no explanations and invited no judgments: at home with her husband or her dog, or visiting her co-author, Bill Dufty, and his son, Bevan, her godchild. In these images and in Mr. Dantzic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance shots, she is not the tragic torch singer of myth but a middle-aged woman finding simple comforts from the maelstrom, no longer as sharp in her voice but undiminished in her ability to command a stage. Holiday died two years after these images were taken, under arrest on yet another drug charge. In Mr. Dantzic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs, the end seems not inevitable but a cruel fate from which she did her best to hide. That she could not makes the unclouded climate of these images all the more welcome. "}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": " How does flying a drone add to your visual storytelling ability? One of the first things that attracted me to drone photography and videography was the ability to easily photograph scenes that in the past would have cost us thousands of dollars. It democratized the skies. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say that every assignment demands aerial photography, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice to be able to have it as a tool.  Not only is it less expensive, it also gives a different view.  Movement becomes really key with drone video, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult to do with a helicopter at some altitudes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a unique experience to be able to navigate like a bird. I try not to use automated flight patterns because I feel that the rigidity of the curves that automation gives you isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very pleasing to the viewer. More organic movement that shows there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a human behind this helps to bring people into these somewhat complex stories we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to tell. New research could yield groundbreaking information on the rate at which the Greenland ice sheet, the fastest-melting chunk of ice on the planet, is seeping into the ocean. As a child did you want to fly planes?  When I was in fifth grade, we did a project on how to spend a million dollars. I figured out how much it would cost to buy a plane so that I could fly to Scottsdale, Ariz., to see  spring training games with the San Francisco Giants. I found out how to get my pilot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license so that I could commute from San Francisco to spring training games in Arizona.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny. The New York Times never said to you, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you figure out how to spend a million dollars?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  No, but in 2012, when inexpensive drones first came out, I expensed a little $60 hobby quadcopter to figure out how to use it. I spent a few months in my tiny apartment trying not to hit the walls and ceiling while I flew it around, trying to get a sense of how to control movement. If you can control one of these tiny hobby quadcopters that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have GPS and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have obstacle avoidance, you can pick up the finesse that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed to manually control the bigger, more steady ones.  What have you learned about composition, both in stills and in video, using a drone? One of my initial projects with a drone was in the Marshall Islands. Before I went, I loaded up Google Earth to look at the islets that I could possibly travel to. I actually picked Ejit Islet to go to based on the Google satellite imagery. It allowed me to pre-envision where I was going to fly, so that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste time on a location that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. Since then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become a lot more confident in knowing what the situation can yield when I see it for the first time in person. Most of the time I am looking at the screen and making my compositional choices, which takes some of my attention away from actually being able to fly the craft. Most of the Marshall Islands rise less than six feet above sea level. For the Marshallese, the destructive power of the rising seas is already an inescapable part of daily life.I try to have a reporter, fixer or translator act as my visual observer so that I can spend some more time on the actual composition and not have to worry if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m coming too close to a power line.  I assumed that you were watching the drone the whole time.  At all times I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking back and forth between the drone and my screen. A lot of the times I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m flying to a place and then stopping the craft and looking down at my screen to judge the composition and make microscopic changes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very easy with still photographs to focus on both at once, but once you transition to motion, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to have a second person with you.  How do you decide whether stills or videos are the best approach, or do you do both? I try to start recording video as soon as I take off so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a mistake and fly a perfect pattern only to realize that I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit the record button. With about half of our stories in this series, we actually ran screen grabs from the 4K drone video. You can barely discern a difference on the web and in print as long as you keep your motion slow. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m shooting 30 frames a second at 4K. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting stills out of my video captures that are plenty large enough to use for anything we want. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another reason why I can prioritize video footage instead of stills.  Can we talk a little bit more about the Carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Casualties series, which recently took first place for Documentary Project of the Year in the Pictures of the Year International awards. How did you envision it from the start? At the end of 2015, I got the opportunity to travel to Greenland to accompany the U.S. ambassador to Denmark, taking a tour of some of the climate research happening. I decided that was a good place to bring the drone that I had been practicing with. While there, the reporter, Coral Davenport, and I found another story \u2014 a research group trying to measure the size of \u00e2\u0080\u0098meltwater\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rivers on top of the second-largest reserve of frozen freshwater in the world. They were flying helicopters out over the ice sheet, setting up camp and staying for several nights in freezing cold temperatures. I joined them. While I was there, we discovered that the researchers themselves were doing drone mapping. They were flying a very high-elevation drone to get middle-range drone imagery that was between the satellites and what I was getting with my drone. Later, we were able to seamlessly transition scenes from ground-level drone footage to middle-range drone footage mapping the watershed that they were in, all the way up to NASA satellite imagery.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be done before.  After Greenland I went to the Marshall Islands. By the time I got there and started talking to people on the islet I had identified from Google Earth, it became clear that residents were starting to prepare to have to move off this islet. When we got back to New York, there was a meeting of foreign editors and reporters tasked with trying to look for other places around the world where people were having to deal \u2014 right now \u2014 with the effects of climate change.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finished that particular series, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now brainstorming how we want to approach our visual coverage to climate change in the future. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very conscious of the fact that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done an entire series that follows the same visual rhetoric.We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily just want to continue repeating these visual cues. We want to keep pushing the envelope, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in the process of identifying new technologies we might be able to use for the next set of stories about climate change and its impact on people. How do you compose for stills with a drone? For still photos I try to use the drone to create very formal, or very graphic composition. I think that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to not shoot at a 45-degree angle with the horizon line in every photo. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been focused on shooting straight down as much as I can, or at semi-oblique angles so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite show your horizon line. When I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m filming from a helicopter, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very stressful, dangerous angle to take, because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really hanging outside of the helicopter. With a drone, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot easier to shoot straight down. The disappearance of Lake Poop\u00c3\u00b3 has not only destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of fishing families, but also added to a new category of climate refugees. What is the role of changing technologies like the drone in visual journalism? One of the things that I think working photojournalists need to do is constantly adapt. It would have been very easy to do these Carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Casualties stories from a purely still photographic perspective. And I think the still photographs I took on the ground would have been greatly improved had I been able to spend three times as much time on just the stills. But I think that it is a service to our readers to constantly experiment and figure out how to integrate new technologies into our storytelling in successful ways. It was important for me to be one of the first to use this technology. Luckily, The Times prioritized it and sent three of us to a drone training workshop under the F.A.A. at Virginia Tech to practice with this technology before we could even use it. And what was unique about the time period we chose to do this series is that many countries still hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t formalized their drone laws. In some ways it was the golden era for drone exploration. Even six months later when I tried to do an assignment in Canada, I had to fill out an 80-page application and wait weeks to be able to find out if I was certified to fly in their airspace.  You had to take an exam in the United States to get a pilot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license?  In the past, you had to be a licensed pilot in order to fly a drone. But the F.A.A. announced a new rule so people who understand the drone laws can be certified to fly in certain airspaces under a very strict list of rules. So I took the test the first day that it was offered.  In five years, will there be drones everywhere and an oversaturation of drone imagery? Definitely. I was lucky to be able to use this technology so early on because millions of drones were sold for last Christmas. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique about our drone laws in the United States is that hobbyists can fly in many more situations under more relaxed restrictions than commercial operators, and the law considers media organizations commercial operators. Just like the influx of digital cameras and camera phones created a saturation of imagery, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to adapt and figure out how we can bring our creativity to these new technologies. With this series, I tried to be thoughtful about how we employed the drone and not just fly it everywhere \u2014 to make sure that this is the right technology for the right story. Just because you have a drone, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you have to use it. People on the edges of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vast seas of sand are being displaced by climate change. What new technology is next?So in similar ways that the United States is conducting drone warfare from an office building in Las Vegas, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a matter of time until that technology gets small enough to put in a journalist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pocket. We need to plan for a world where that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible and decide how we want to treat storytelling should that happen.  But perhaps the photographer is also the reporter.  Hopefully as we think through the newsrooms of the future, photojournalists will be able to maintain the journalist part of our job title. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be recognized for the breadth of both the visual journalism and the text journalism that we can bring to each story. One story we did that was purely visually driven was called \u00e2\u0080\u009cLiving in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Expanding Desert.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was a new type of storytelling that we championed for this one particular piece in the Carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Casualties series. It was a story that the reporter Ed Wong and I conceptualized from a purely visual standpoint along with Hannah Fairfield, Jeremy White and Derek Watkins. The way our industry categorizes things hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t caught up to the type of visual journalism that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to do with all of these new technologies. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still honoring separations between still photographs, multimedia, documentary and video reporting. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settled on an overall visual journalism category. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunate that we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figured out a way for all these tools to integrate and work with one another. "}

Together with their nimble brethren, the octopus and cuttlefish, they make for an agile invertebrate armada.But that was not always the case. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the ancestors of the tentacled trio were slow, heavily armored creatures, like the coil-shelled ammonites and the cone-shelled belemnites.So Mr. Tanner conducted a genetic analysis of 26 present day cephalopods, including the vampire squid, the golden cuttlefish and the southern blue-ringed octopus.During the revolution, underwater life underwent a rapid change, including a burst in fish diversity. Some predators became better suited for crushing shellfish, while some smaller fish became faster and more agile.\u201cThere\u2019s a continual arms race between the prey and the predators,\u201d said Mr. Tanner. \u201cThe shells are getting smaller, and the squids are getting faster.\u201dThe evolutionary pressures favored being nimble over being armored, and cephalopods started to lose their shells, according to Mr. Tanner. The adaptation allowed them to outcompete their shelled relatives for fast food, and they were able to better evade predators. They were also able to keep up with competitors seeking the same prey.Today most cephalopods are squishy and shell-less. The biggest exception is the nautilus. But though there are more than 2,500 fossilized species of nautilus, today only a handful of species exist.Squid and octopus species number around 300 each, and there are around 120 species of cuttlefish. The differences in number, compared with the nautilus, indicates the advantages that these cephalopods may have gained over their shelled relatives, according to Mr. Tanner.\u201cIt became a much more successful strategy to be a really high metabolism, very rapid moving animal,\u201d Mr. Tanner said, \u201cand they evolved into these really quite amazing things we see today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mosque Is Blocked in New Jersey, but Dispute Is Far From Over", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byBAYONNE, N.J. \u2014 They thought they had found the perfect place to build the first mosque and Islamic community center in this city\u2019s history: an empty 8,500-square-foot warehouse at the end of a dead-end block, with room on its lot for 37 parking spots.But since paying $1 million for the property in 2015, Waheed Akbar and his nonprofit group, Bayonne Muslims, have faced an angry campaign by local residents, graffiti slurs outside their temporary prayer hall and numerous zoning and planning hurdles.But the federal Justice Department has since contacted the Bayonne Muslims group and said it would investigate the matter, Mr. Akbar said. The group is also planning to file a federal lawsuit to contest the denial.The Justice Department declined to comment on the existence of an investigation.The case is the latest of many nationwide in which a local municipality has blocked the construction of a mosque or Islamic school, ostensibly because of traffic, parking or zoning concerns. When federal investigators have looked deeper into these cases, however, they have often discovered evidence of discrimination.A federal court has the power to order a municipality to nullify a zoning decision, and require it to redo the land use approval process. Often, however, municipalities are willing to settle once the Justice Department begins an investigation into whether religious discrimination was involved.With Donald J. Trump as president, some in the civil rights community are now worried that the Justice Department will be less active in its protection of mosques because of what Ms. Patel described as the administration\u2019s \u201cvery anti-Muslim stance.\u201dOmar T. Mohammedi, a lawyer who has represented Muslim groups in such cases, said he was expecting the government to pursue some enforcement of religious land-use claims because Mr. Trump has said he will be strong on religious freedom issues. \u201cBut not to the level that Obama was doing it,\u201d he said.In Bayonne, a working-class city of some 63,000 people, Muslims lived for decades without their own mosque. In 2009, a diverse coalition from the community decided it was time to change that. They formed a nonprofit organization and rented a 1,500-square-foot room in the basement of a former Roman Catholic school, St. Henry\u2019s, on a main street across from City Hall.For years, said Mr. Akbar, 38, a founder and secretary of the group, \u201cwe never got any negativity from the neighbors. Everyone was very helpful,\u201d But that changed when the group bought the two-story warehouse at 109 East 24th Street with the intent of renovating it into an Islamic center. The center would host prayers five times a day, religious classes for children, and a soup kitchen open to all.The warehouse, which had been used by a roofing company and a marine supply business, seemed out of the way, tucked into Bayonne\u2019s quiet, residential East End, which is isolated from the rest of town by Route 440 on one side and a set of train tracks on the other.But what seemed to Mr. Akbar an advantage was a huge issue for some locals.\u201cIt\u2019s quiet and peaceful, that\u2019s what we moved here for,\u201d said Eric Loarte, 48, who lives a few doors down from the proposed mosque and was primarily worried about traffic. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be taken away from us.\u201dBut he also had other concerns. \u201cThey are trying to take over the block and the neighborhood,\u201d he said of the Muslim community. And neighbors, Mr. Loarte said, were also afraid of what might be preached at the mosque. He noted that Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind sheikh who masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, had preached at a mosque in nearby Jersey City.\u201cYou never know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened before.\u201d\u201cI thought it was very relevant, because I believe you cannot hold to Shariah law and the U.S. Constitution at the same time,\u201d he said.While he\u2019s not sure how many local residents agree with him, \u201cI don\u2019t think a day has gone by in the past few months if I\u2019m outside walking on Broadway that somebody doesn\u2019t come up to me and say, \u2018Thank you\u2019 and I have no idea who they are,\u201d he said.On Monday, a group of Muslims stood to pray at the opening of the zoning meeting. In response, a group of Christians started reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer, witnesses said. Later, a woman began quoting verses from the Quran that she said condoned violence against non-Muslims, video of the meeting showed. She spoke for several minutes before zoning board members shut her down.In the end, the vote was 4-3 in favor of the variance that the mosque needed to function in the residential neighborhood. But the measure needed five votes to pass.\u201cI do believe there is a place for a community center for our Muslim friends,\u201d said Commissioner Louis Lombardi, who voted no. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe that it is this one.\u201dSince then, Mayor Davis has called for civility and patience. Bayonne Muslims is speaking with lawyers and other congregations who have faced similar challenges.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Downsides of an Early Spring", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byNew York TodayUpdated, 9:32 a.m.Good morning on this bright Monday.Spring, of a sort, has arrived in New York.For those keeping tabs, that\u2019s about three weeks before March 20, when spring first appears on our calendars.We asked Jake Weltzin, the executive director of the National Phenology Network, to explain what\u2019s happening.How is the start of spring determined?Mr. Weltzin\u2019s team uses a model that combines weather data with historical data on the leafing and flowering of lilacs and honeysuckles to create a biological map of the onset of spring. Lilacs and honeysuckles are used because they are early indicators of spring, behave similarly to other plant species and grow across the United States.Why did spring arrive early in New York City?\u201cAll of the recent heat has pushed the biological spring forward,\u201d Mr. Weltzin said.But it\u2019s not only here: The early spring moved up the country from the South \u201clike a green wave\u201d until it stalled over our city, he said. It\u2019s spring in most of Brooklyn, but the season hasn\u2019t really started in much of Manhattan, according to the National Phenology Network. \u201cThe biological spring will pick up and continue north soon,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cassuming we don\u2019t get more cold.\u201dIs this part of a trend?\u201cThis is an exceptional year,\u201d Mr. Weltzin said. The model doesn\u2019t predict climate change, but a study last year, which used the model, found earlier springtimes at 75 percent of 300 national parks studied over a span of more than 100 years, evidence that the \u201cclimate is changing,\u201d Mr. Weltzin said.What are the downsides of an early spring?There are plenty, he said.When a hard frost follows a period of early flowering, plants can be damaged and crops can be lost.Mosquito season and tick season start earlier, possibly spreading more disease, and pollen season can be longer and more intense.And migratory species, like birds, arrive during the \u201cfalse spring\u201d and can have trouble finding food, Mr. Weltzin said. (To help, he suggests stocking your bird feeder or installing a bird shelter now.)Are there benefits to an early spring?\u201cWell, yeah. I think people have really enjoyed the beautiful weather.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Which is why New Yorkers who live alone seem to have it made. Not only can they escape other people, they have the freedom to do whatever they want \u2014 inside their homes \u2014 without the judgment of others.So we\u2019d like to know, roommate-less New Yorkers:What is a quirky or odd behavior you engage in at home?

Bell, resigned Wednesday, and its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, lost her 2016 bonus after a board investigation of the 2014 theft of information on more than 500 million user accounts.The board \u201cdid not conclude that there was an intentional suppression of relevant information.\u201dThose hackers, which Yahoo believes were connected to a foreign government, used the stolen information to forge a type of software called a cookie that could be used to access 32 million Yahoo accounts, the company said.Under Ms. Mayer\u2019s employment agreement, her annual target bonus is $2 million a year and her annual stock award is supposed to be no less than $12 million a year. Her base salary is $1 million a year.The company\u2019s filing, which it said concluded its investigation, avoided naming any individuals responsible for Yahoo\u2019s security woes, and it left many important questions unanswered.The board offered no new information about the company\u2019s apparent failure to notice a separate theft in 2013 of the account information of one billion users.That theft \u2014 which was discovered last year by an outside security expert who noticed the information for sale on the black market \u2014 was so serious that Yahoo forced all affected users to reset their passwords. \u201cWe have not been able to identify the intrusion associated with this theft,\u201d the board said.Mr. Bell, a longtime lawyer at Yahoo, appears to be taking the blame for the company\u2019s security failures. Yahoo said he resigned on Wednesday and would receive no payments in connection with his departure. The company\u2019s chief information security officer at the time of the 2014 breach, Alex Stamos, left for Facebook in 2015 after repeated battles with Ms. Mayer over security priorities.Yahoo said that 43 consumer class-action lawsuits related to the breaches have been filed against the company in federal, state and foreign courts. It also faces a stockholder class-action suit.The company said that it is also cooperating with federal, state and foreign government officials and agencies seeking information about the incidents, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York and two state attorneys general.Yahoo said it had revised its procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents, including the reporting of such incidents to senior executives and the board.The company has incurred $16 million in direct costs so far related to the breaches.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Trump in White House, Some Executives Ask, Why Not Me?", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseHaving reached the top of a major corporation and amassed a fortune, chief executives often wonder: What\u2019s next?After Donald J. Trump, the answer may well be a run for the White House.Mr. Trump had no political or military experience, the traditional routes to high political office. Virtually his only qualification was his business career, and a checkered one at that, considering his own brush with personal bankruptcy.\u201cThere is this sense that if Trump got it, why shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d said David Gergen, co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School and an adviser to four presidents. \u201cThey\u2019ve been more successful, they have more experience, and they\u2019ve run a public company, which is more equivalent to what a president does than a private company\u201d like the Trump Organization.Stu Loeser, once the press secretary for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who considered a presidential run last year, concurred. \u201cIf you run a company that has employed tens of thousands of people, and generated lots of profit and been undeniably successful, and you look at a sitting president who, to be honest, a lot of business people don\u2019t have much respect for, you think, why not me?\u201d he said.Mr. Loeser now runs his own strategic consulting firm, and told me he has clients who are business executives considering a run for high public office. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you their names, obviously,\u201d he said.Boldface corporate names widely discussed as contenders for the next Democratic presidential nomination include chief executives like Howard Schultz of Starbucks, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com, along with Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer, and Oprah Winfrey, chairwoman and chief executive of Harpo Inc., which owns half of the Oprah Winfrey Network.All deny they\u2019re running, or even seriously considering it. But everyone demurs so far ahead of the first primaries, as did Hillary Clinton four years ago, and it hasn\u2019t stopped anyone from speculating. That\u2019s especially the case for people who, appalled by the Trump administration, can hardly wait for the next campaign.\u201cI feel many of these chief executives are responding to a public longing for a strongman, or woman, a strong leader,\u201d Mr. Gergen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that\u2019s why Trump got elected. You\u2019re seeing the same thing in Europe, in Asia, in a long list of countries. People are dissatisfied with standard politicians. Military types and business people with a strong track record offer an attractive alternative.\u201dApart from proven business experience, they have widespread name recognition or identification with major consumer brands. And they have enough money to finance their own campaigns.I\u2019ve spoken this week to multiple people who have at least discussed the possibility of running for office with Mr. Schultz and Mr. Iger. (All declined to be named discussing what were private conversations.)Mr. Schultz, 63, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $3 billion, came close to making a bid last year, but backed out after concluding it would be very difficult to defeat Mrs. Clinton, who seemed to have the Democratic nomination all but locked up and at the time seemed likely to win the presidency.Those circumstances have obviously changed drastically. With Mr. Trump in office, the next Democratic race appears wide open, and many friends and potential donors are urging Mr. Schultz to run.Mr. Schultz seemed to pave the way in December, when he announced he\u2019d step down as Starbucks\u2019 chief executive this April. But he continues to be actively involved in the expansion of the company\u2019s high-end \u201croasteries\u201d as well as its social-impact initiatives.\u201cHoward Schultz is definitely being pursued,\u201d Mr. Gergen said. \u201cHe has a powerful social conscience. He comes from a very different place than the kind of chief executive with a big ego who wants the trappings of presidential power.\u201dMr. Schultz declined to comment.Last year Mr. Iger, 66, told The Hollywood Reporter that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office,\u201d and last week the entertainment publication fueled renewed speculation when it reported that Mr. Iger had discussed the possibility with Mr. Bloomberg.People who have discussed a possible presidential run with Mr. Iger told me that his discussion with Mr. Bloomberg, some years ago, focused more on a possible run for mayor of New York City, where Mr. Iger has an apartment. New York has long welcomed nonresident candidates like Mrs. Clinton, so Mr. Iger\u2019s California residency isn\u2019t seen as an obstacle.Both Mr. Iger and Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment.Whether any of those jobs, including the presidency, would actually be better than being chief executive of Disney remains an open question. After earlier announcing his retirement, Mr. Iger recently said he was willing to extend his contract, which would eliminate the need for any high-profile exit strategy, at least for the next few years.Campaign buttons emblazoned with \u201cVote for Benioff\u201d and \u201cMarc Benioff for President\u201d circulated two years ago at Salesforce\u2019s annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, which draws hundreds of thousands of participants and has been viewed by some as a likely launching pad for any Benioff campaign.Like Mr. Schultz, Mr. Benioff has pursued an ambitious social and philanthropic agenda. He started \u201cPledge 1%,\u201d the Salesforce model of donating 1 percent of their product, 1 percent of their equity and 1 percent of employees\u2019 time to help nonprofits achieve their missions \u2014 a practice that Salesforce says is now followed by 1,400 companies. Mr. Benioff was an outspoken defender of gay and lesbian rights and helped create a network of corporate leaders to oppose bills limiting L.G.B.T. rights in states like Indiana, Georgia and North Carolina.Mr. Benioff, 52, whose stake in Salesforce alone is worth over $3 billion and who has a net worth estimated by Forbes at over $4 billion, has also written three books, including the best-selling \u201cBehind the Cloud.\u201d Still, he\u2019s hardly a household name, and is best known in business and technology circles.Asked for comment, Mr. Benioff said, \u201cBusiness is the greatest platform for change.\u201dMs. Sandberg\u2019s coming nationwide tour to promote the new book she co-authored, \u201cOption B,\u201d which describes coming to terms with her husband\u2019s sudden death in 2015 and other stories of coping with adversity, has fueled speculation (and possible wishful thinking) that the book could be a springboard for a presidential campaign.As a billionaire ($1.47 billion, Forbes estimates) and a key executive of the hugely successful Facebook, Ms. Sandberg already has enormous name recognition. Her previous book, \u201cLean In,\u201d was a best-seller and inspired a rallying cry for women. She has worked in politics before, as an assistant to the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, and was a donor to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. She was considered a candidate for a top post in any Clinton administration.Ms. Sandberg has denied any immediate presidential ambitions, insisting that she loves her job at Facebook. At age 47, she\u2019s under no pressure to run this election cycle.(Widespread reports that the Facebook founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would run for president seem even more far-fetched. The speculation appears to have been set off by a Bloomberg News report that Mr. Zuckerberg would retain voting control of Facebook even if he sold his shares and served in a government position for up to two years. Mr. Zuckerberg has denied any interest in running.)Then there\u2019s Ms. Winfrey, 63, who for many Democrats might amount to the dream candidate: She has unrivaled star power, is an African-American woman, has run a successful business, and has a fortune estimated by Forbes at $3 billion.\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Ms. Winfrey replied. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh gee, I don\u2019t have the experience, I don\u2019t know enough.\u2019 And now I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Oh! Oh.\u2019\u201dBut when Mr. Rubenstein began to ask, \u201cAs you consider whether you are going to run for president of the United States or not. ..,\u201d she interjected, \u201cNo, that won\u2019t be happening.\u201dWhile some may disparage Mr. Trump\u2019s credentials for the presidency, he did bring to his campaign a level of recognition that will be hard for other executives to replicate, with the possible exception of Ms. Winfrey.\u201cTrump spent decades building his brand and his image as a successful businessman,\u201d Mr. Loeser said. \u201cHe was the star of one of the most-watched television shows in America. If you landed at La Guardia, you saw the Trump jet. If you went to Las Vegas, the tallest building in town has Trump\u2019s name emblazoned on it.\u201dMr. Gergen agreed. \u201cTrump has been a performer for years,\u201d he said. \u201cMost chief executives aren\u2019t performers.\u201dAnd chief executives \u201caren\u2019t prepared for the scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Gergen said. \u201cIt\u2019s especially tough to work with the press. They\u2019re used to having layers of people around them, but in politics you\u2019re out there dealing with reporters every day.\u201d\u201cLook at Rex Tillerson,\u201d he added, referring to the Exxon chief turned secretary of state. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely well regarded in corporate circles, but he\u2019s having trouble with the press.\u201dMr. Loeser said he was helping clients assess the kind of attacks they could expect in a hard-fought campaign.\u201cYou have to anticipate how they\u2019ll come after you, because they will,\u201d Mr. Loeser said. \u201cOprah is one of the most beloved people in America. But has anyone gone through every minute and every hour of every show she\u2019s ever done to see if there\u2019s anything controversial? Because someone will.\u201dMr. Gergen suggested that some chief executives might want to lower their sights. \u201cI think business chief executives tend to make better governors or mayors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be more pragmatic and less ideological. Some of the names you\u2019re hearing, I have trouble picturing them with the Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders wing of the party.

The figures destroy the myth that a majority of Germans opposed the Third Reich. Unfortunately the same can be said for the eager collaborators in conquered nations, who not only assisted the SS but participated in the Holocaust.Anti-Semitism was not forced on Germans and the inhabitants of conquered nations but was welcomed, with the resultant murder of six million Jews.NELSON MARANSNEW YORK\u2b25Flavors Of Fiction To the Editor:In his essay \u201cLiterature by Degree\u201d (Author\u2019s Note, March 12), Benjamin Markovits sends a frightening message when he asserts as a matter of fact that how teachers judge their writing students \u201cis based almost purely on taste.\u201d To be sure, those of us who teach writing have preferences, but all teachers worth their salt bend over backward to make sure they don\u2019t produce clones, don\u2019t dictate one style of writing to a class.

Spruill\u2019s \u201cDivided We Stand: The Battle Over Women\u2019s Rights and Family Values That Polarized American Politics\u201d (March 12) gives no context for the successful rightist war on women. That context is the sharp decrease in democratic traits. In 1980, there were 13 billionaires in the United States; in 2016, there were 540. In 1965, the income ratio of C.E.O.s of the top 350 firms to that of their workers was 20 to one. By 2014, it had mushroomed to 296 to one. Nearly one-third of workers were unionized in the 1960s, but only some 10 percent are so today.The attack on democracy was led by the rule of money, the war on labor unions, voter suppression \u2014 and the war on women. The most democratic countries (the Nordic ones), in contrast, had the strongest labor unions and the best women\u2019s rights.

{"Headline": "Facebook Reports BBC to Police Over Investigation Into Child Sex Images", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 When Angus Crawford, a journalist at the British Broadcasting Corporation, started reporting on sexualized images of children on Facebook, he knew he had to proceed with caution.His original work in 2016 prompted the police to investigate, leading to a man being jailed over the issue. Months later, when Mr. Crawford found that other inappropriate images of children were still being posted on Facebook, he raised the issue with the company directly.But to his surprise, the Silicon Valley giant reported him and the BBC to the police.Facebook argued that it was just following established industry-standard procedures \u2014 and British law \u2014 by alerting the authorities to images of child exploitation, something it said it does with all such pictures.Google and Twitter, notably, are grappling with similar issues. Experts say these tech giants are blurring the lines between mere neutral online platforms for digital content and active media companies that must monitor what is posted online.\u201cThere is an expectation, particularly following the fake news controversy, that platforms have a responsibility as media companies rather than neutral tech companies to ensure that what goes on their platform is appropriate, tasteful, just like a broadcaster or a newspaper,\u201d said Adam Rendle, a London lawyer specializing in copyright and media at the law firm Taylor Wessing.Mr. Crawford, the BBC reporter, began investigating the presence of obscene images of children on Facebook last year. He had sought to highlight the difficulty of monitoring content on the social network, and his original investigation found that pedophiles were using secret pages to share images of children. A subsequent police investigation led to one man being imprisoned for downloading indecent images.He then contacted the social network directly to query the discrepancy, and was asked to provide examples of images that he had reported. But when he provided examples last week, the company reported Mr. Crawford and the BBC to the police.Facebook, however, said it had followed established procedures, and insisted it had removed all content that was illegal or breached its standards.\u201cWhen the BBC sent us such images we followed our industry\u2019s standard practice and reported them,\u201d Simon Milner, Facebook\u2019s policy director in Britain, said in a statement.\u201cIt is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation,\u201d Mr. Milner said. \u201cWe also reported the child exploitation images that had been shared on our own platform. This matter is now in the hands of the authorities.\u201dFacebook has said it is improving its system for reporting offensive content, but the incident has raised questions about exactly how it polices its site.Mr. Crawford, for example, noted an apparent contradiction between the view of Facebook\u2019s moderation system, which determined that the photos were not in breach of the social network\u2019s guidelines, and the company\u2019s decision to report the BBC to the police.\u201cIs it that it\u2019s illegal and their moderation isn\u2019t working?\u201d he asked, \u201cor is it that actually it\u2019s perfectly legal content?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The police said Ms. Reynolds, 27, was among a group of women who \u201cjumped\u201d a woman at 10:30 a.m. in St. Paul.She was freed on bail after a court appearance on Monday. Her lawyer, Michael Padden, said she intended to plead not guilty at her next court appearance on April 3.The woman, who is 24 but whose name was not included in the criminal complaint, told the police that while waiting at a stop sign, she saw a white S.U.V. make a U-turn to follow her. She said she drove to a parking lot and got out of her car, at which point Ms. Reynolds ran up and punched her in the head while another woman, Chnika Blair, 18, grabbed her by the hair, the police said.At one point, Ms. Reynolds struck the woman in the head with a hammer, knocking her to the ground, the police said. Ms. Reynolds then struck the car\u2019s windshield with the hammer, smashing the window, the police said.A third woman, Dyamond Richardson, 25, got out of the car, chased the woman down and sprayed her with mace, the police said. Ms. Blair and Ms. Richardson were also arrested.The woman identified Ms. Reynolds, Ms. Blair and Ms. Richardson out of three separate photo lineups, the police said. The woman showed officers a Facebook post by Ms. Reynolds in which she threatened to \u201ccome after\u201d her, the police said. Ms. Richardson told investigators there was an ongoing conflict between her and a friend of the unnamed woman, according to the complaint.The death of Mr. Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria worker, was one of several shootings last year that focused the nation\u2019s attention on police treatment of African-Americans.

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s office said he died about 20 minutes after he was shot.The encounter was made even more chilling by Ms. Reynolds\u2019s anguished but calm commentary during her 10-minute Facebook video, which began soon after Mr. Castile was shot. As her 4-year-old daughter watched in the back seat, she walked viewers through her account of what happened, saying she informed officers that he had a gun and that he was reaching for his driver\u2019s license and registration when the officer opened fire.Her account was laced with emotion \u2014 \u201cStay with me,\u201d she pleaded to Mr. Castile \u2014 but she also had the wherewithal to repeatedly call the officer \u201csir.\u201d The video was viewed millions of times, serving as a window into the personal effects of violence not often seen.Advertisement"}

The Times\u2019s fashion director and critic discusses the tech she uses.As a fashion critic, what\u2019s your favorite tech product that helps you spot and keep track of fashion trends?My iPhone 5, embarrassing as that is to say, and my laptop. I am stuck with my iPhone 5 because I have a keyboard attachment for it that turns it into a BlackBerry, and which I love because during fashion shows I file reviews on my phone and they can be 1,000 words long. I can\u2019t do that on a touch screen. I hate lugging anything bigger than the phone around since I carry so much else.I also use the gadgets mostly to surf around Instagram and Facebook and various news sites to see what regular people are wearing during their everyday lives in places I am not. For runway trends, I just use my eyes.You\u2019ve written a lot about wearable technology. Are smartwatches ever going to be fashionable enough to replace normal watches?I am sure they will be at some point, but who knows when that will be. The problem is they just look too much like gadgets \u2014 or like wannabe traditional watches. Someone has to come up with a third paradigm. Then whoever does that will be in clover.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?My Kindle. It\u2019s really the only other tech product I use. I have gone through iPad and tablet phases, and smartwatch moments, but they all end up in the back of a drawer somewhere or my kids take them. I am really interested in tech that is efficient and functional and solves problems that are real problems, not theoretical ones. After that, I find it hard to get worked up.What do you and your family do with it?Read! Plus a Kindle is very good to take to shows, because I am lugging a heavy bag full of stuff all day, and it is light and takes up almost no room. And it gives me something to occupy my mind during the endless minutes I spend waiting for shows to start.What could be better about it?The light. Shows have very complicated lighting plans and sometimes that makes it hard to read.What is your children\u2019s favorite piece of technology and why?The favorite app for my 16-year-old and 14-year-old daughters are Snapchat and SoundCloud. That\u2019s because they can use Snapchat to connect with their friends and stay in touch with those that are far away, and SoundCloud because it is easy and a good way to find new music and fun remixes.For my 11-year-old son: Spotify, because he loves listening to music.Favorite piece of technology (from all of them): their iPhones.

{"Headline": "A Friend Lied About Dylann Roof\u2019s Massacre Plan. Now He\u2019ll Go to Prison.", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Joseph C. Meek Jr., a friend of Dylann S. Roof\u2019s who spent time with him in the weeks before nine people were killed at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church here, was sentenced Tuesday to 27 months in prison for hampering and misleading the federal authorities in the aftermath of Mr. Roof\u2019s racist massacre.The punishment, handed down by Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court, was at the low end of the sentencing guidelines, which called for Mr. Meek to spend from 27 to 33 months in prison. The months that he spent in a county jail after his arrest will count toward his federal sentence.Before the sentence was announced, a tearful Mr. Meek said he was not sure whether he would survive prison, and he apologized to family members of Mr. Roof\u2019s victims, some of whom had gathered for the hearing. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry a lot of innocent lives were taken,\u201d said Mr. Meek, who had previously expressed remorse in handwritten letters in which he asked for forgiveness.But Judge Gergel, speaking at a hearing that lasted more than two hours, said Mr. Meek\u2019s crimes warranted prison. \u201cThe danger he exposed to the community is extraordinary,\u201d he said.Mr. Meek\u2019s lawyer, Deborah B. Barbier, expressed concern that her client would be forced to spend his sentence in solitary confinement because of security risks. Judge Gergel said the federal Bureau of Prisons could be trusted to protect him.\u201cIt\u2019s an odd, inverse logic that I should not incarcerate him because inmates think so lowly of him,\u201d the judge said.The government did not prosecute Mr. Meek for failing to disclose knowledge of Mr. Roof\u2019s plans to attack the church, although it asserted in court filings that his silence \u201cdid deprive law enforcement of the opportunity to intervene.\u201dDuring a night of drinking and drug use about a week before the shootings, Mr. Roof told Mr. Meek that he wanted to kill black people at a historic African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston in order to start a race riot, according to F.B.I. summaries of interviews with him. Mr. Meek was concerned enough to hide Mr. Roof\u2019s handgun after he fell asleep but later returned it and did not report the threat to law enforcement.\u201cCertainly defendant\u2019s failure to make an earlier report is tragic and deeply regrettable, but his failure to report was not a violation of federal criminal law,\u201d Judge Gergel wrote last week in an order that denied prosecutors\u2019 request to give Mr. Meek a longer term than recommended in sentencing guidelines.Ms. Barbier said in a presentencing filing that it was \u201chypocritical and disingenuous\u201d for prosecutors to suggest that Mr. Meek was somehow to blame for the killings. \u201cJoey\u2019s failure to appreciate the seriousness of Roof\u2019s statements is not unusual in today\u2019s shock value culture,\u201d she wrote.In court on Tuesday, a defense witness said Mr. Meek\u2019s connection to the Charleston massacre would make him a \u201chigh-value target\u201d in prison. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to be kept separate from other inmates \u2014 not because of what he did, but because he has some relationship to a heinous crime,\u201d said the witness, James Aiken, a former warden for the South Carolina prison system.Joseph C. Meek Jr., who took Dylann S. Roof in before the shooting rampage that killed nine church members, apologized to the families of victims at his sentencing. Here are the letters that Mr. Meek, who received 27 months in prison, wrote to family members.Mr. Meek has said in various law enforcement interviews and court appearances that he first met Mr. Roof, who grew up near Columbia, S.C., in middle school. They largely lost touch when Mr. Roof moved away but reconnected via Facebook on May 22, 2015, less than a month before the massacre. Mr. Roof began hanging out at the trailer where Mr. Meek lived with his girlfriend and other family members.One night in early June, after consuming vodka, marijuana and cocaine, Mr. Roof told Mr. Meek of his support for segregation and his desire to \u201cdo something big and put South Carolina on the map,\u201d Mr. Meek told the F.B.I. He said that he had been planning the attack for six months and that he hoped to carry it out on a Wednesday because fewer people would be at church. He told Mr. Meek he would then kill himself.Mr. Meek dismissed the seriousness and did not notify the authorities.Mr. Meek learned about the shootings soon after Mr. Roof opened fire and discussed his fears with a friend, Dalton Tyler, telling him not to contact the police. Mr. Tyler held off that night. But the next morning, as a photograph of Mr. Roof from a church security camera began circulating, Mr. Tyler became the first person to call a police tip line and identify the gunman, according to a search warrant. Mr. Roof was arrested later that morning in North Carolina with the murder weapon in the back seat.In his initial F.B.I. interview, Mr. Meek denied having known of Mr. Roof\u2019s plans and said Mr. Roof had not spoken of a target for his attack, according to Assistant United States Attorney Julius N. Richardson.Several states are considering a ban on capital punishment for people with mental illnesses or brain injuries.But in a second interview, Mr. Meek admitted that he had lied, according to an F.B.I. synopsis of the session. He also admitted that on the night of the shootings, after concluding that Mr. Roof was responsible for the attack, he told others not to contact law enforcement.In his conversations with investigators, Mr. Meek described Mr. Roof as a shy former altar boy who did not have many friends but was not a social misfit. His parents, who were divorced, lived in houses with swimming pools and gave him most anything he wanted, Mr. Meek said. He did not perceive Mr. Roof as depressed or as having an anger problem.When Mr. Meek was first charged and agreed to a plea deal, the expectation was that he would testify in Mr. Roof\u2019s trial about the killer\u2019s premeditation and planning. But the government\u2019s case on that score was strong without Mr. Meek, and neither side called him as a witness. Mr. Richardson declined to comment on Tuesday, as did the relatives of Mr. Roof\u2019s victims who attended the sentencing.Mr. Meek, who will remain free on bond until he reports to prison, has told the authorities that he thinks about the carnage every day and that he has trouble sleeping nearly two years after Mr. Roof\u2019s killing spree.\u201cI truly in my heart didn\u2019t take him seriously and I wish I would have,\u201d Mr. Meek, a 10th-grade dropout who worked in construction, said in a written statement. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe he could do something so awful and cruel.\u201dChris Dixon reported from Charleston, and Kevin Sack from Atlanta.

Being a doctor and a father, we come from this incredible mystery out of nothing, when all of a sudden this consciousness, this person, arrives and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so happy when that baby is born. Why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t our passing be as wondrous?\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhich could explain why the idea of a machine with lingering self-awareness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlade Runner\u00e2\u0080\u009d aside, can be unnerving. Will robots have rights? How will we use them?

The move could bolster the profits of the telecommunications industry by billions of dollars.Republican lawmakers, like Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and the chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, say that the commission\u2019s privacy rule is unfair because it applies only to broadband companies and not to internet businesses like Google and Facebook. This is highly disingenuous. Congress has only given the commission authority over telecommunications companies, so the F.C.C. couldn\u2019t have come up with rules that applied to other businesses even if it wanted to.Telecom companies know a lot about what people do online because they are the gatekeepers through which people connect to the internet. And as people link household devices like thermostats, light bulbs and security cameras to the internet, these companies will have even more intimate knowledge about their customers. By comparison, people can more easily evade tracking by businesses like Google and Facebook by not using those services or by deleting the cookies those websites leave on their computers and phones.In the absence of strong privacy rules, people will have to rely on encryption to prevent service providers from tracking them. But broadband companies would still know what websites people visit. And the companies would be able to see all of the communications between users and websites that do not use encryption. Sophisticated users might increasingly rely on virtual private networks, which are used by corporations to let their employees log into secure systems remotely, and other tools to mask their activities, but most Americans are unlikely to be conversant with such tricks of the trade.Mr. Trump promised voters during the campaign that he would protect the working class.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Master of Low Expectations", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byFirst as a candidate, and now as president, Donald Trump has drawn fire for promising the moon and stars without giving the slightest hint of how he intended to obtain them. In fact, as Tuesday night\u2019s speech to Congress demonstrated so clearly, the president is actually a master of the art of diminished expectations.On Tuesday night, we are told, he looked sober and presidential, when all he actually did was read a speech from a Teleprompter without veering off into one of his incoherent rants. It\u2019s hard to believe that even the ill-disciplined and narcissistic Trump would have stood in the well of the House of Representatives and tried to lead a chant of \u201clock her up\u201d or slapped journalists with the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d label that has been a favorite of dictators for more than a century.Americans are supposed to be delighted, or at least relieved, that Trump began his speech by denouncing anti-Semitic threats and attacks, which have proliferated since he took office. But it took the president long weeks to make that simple statement, and just a few hours before his speech in the Capitol, he was suggesting to a group of state attorneys general that anti-Semitic attacks might actually have been carried out by people who want \u201cto make others look bad\u201d (in other words, his political opponents).At one point, Republican lawmakers in the chamber leapt to their feet, cheering in sycophantic approval, when Trump announced that he was going to put an end to the \u201cuncontrolled entry\u201d into the United States of people \u201cfrom places where proper vetting cannot occur.\u201dThis is a classic Trumpian stunt, inventing a problem and then promising to fix it. There is no free access for refugees to this country \u2014 it takes about two years to clear the vetting process \u2014 and none of the fatal terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 have been committed by people from the seven countries Trump targeted with his anti-Muslim visa ban.If Trump did nothing about immigration, he could cross \u201cuncontrolled entry\u201d off his list because it\u2019s not happening and it never has. Under Trump\u2019s leadership, there won\u2019t be any flying pigs, either, and Bigfoot will finally be prevented from tracking his muddy footprints through the Capitol Rotunda.The Republicans dutifully roared their approval when Trump announced that he had \u201cdirected the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS.\u201d Apparently it had never occurred to President George W. Bush or President Obama to do that.And he announced with a self-satisfied smirk that he had chosen a nominee for the Supreme Court \u201cwho will defend our Constitution.\u201d All Supreme Court justices, from the most liberal to the most conservative, strive to defend the Constitution, and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous. The question is how the justices interpret the country\u2019s founding document.Trump cited the fact that there are 43 million people on food stamps and living in poverty in the United States. That is indeed a shameful truth, but Trump didn\u2019t actually promise to do anything about it.Trump can keep on railing about law and order and promising to bring down the crime rate without worrying too much about it, because it\u2019s coming down anyway. These days, Trump lies about record crime rates around the country when actually they are at historic lows. In a year or two, he\u2019ll be taking those same numbers and claiming credit for them.The president talked a lot about national unity on Tuesday night, although I suspect that what he meant was that we should all unite behind his policies, behind his philosophy and, most important, behind him personally.Trump declared that the \u201ctime for small thinking is over,\u201d presumably referring to his predecessor\u2019s small ideas, like reforming health care, fighting racism and poverty, giving all Americans the right to marry the person they love and rallying allies who had been alienated by President Bush.And Trump said the time for \u201ctrivial fights is behind us.\u201d He just didn\u2019t say which trivial fights he meant.Protecting the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender people? Safeguarding voting rights? Investigating whether members of the Trump team had colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election? Or maybe finally getting him to release his tax returns, as every other modern president has done?Advertisement"}

Travelers might call it a highway exit, a pleasant pit stop between two of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most popular cities, and leave it at that. Stephanie Calabrese, a documentary photographer, sees it differently. Under her gaze, this quintessential Southern town \u00e2\u0080\u0094 technically a city, though no one calls it that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is endlessly fascinating. From its Civil War re-enactments to its culture of four-wheeling, fishing and hunting or its old mill buildings reborn as antique shops and 21st-century businesses, the Monroe Ms. Calabrese began documenting five years ago is historic, homely, handsome, even  bucolic in places \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and well worth attention for its unique contribution to the American story.She also calls it home. Her black-and-white project, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHometown: A Documentary of Monroe, Georgia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d makes it clear that this is no dispassionate portrait, but a loving, cleareyed view from inside, sort of. Monroe is the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adopted hometown. She moved there some 20 years ago after marrying a native son whose family runs one of the oldest and largest Hereford cattle ranches in Walton County. Her son and daughter were born there. They attend their father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high school and church, and claim roots in town that go back several generations.After a childhood in Saddlebrook, N.J., and teenage years in North Augusta, S.C., (where her family relocated when her father took a position at a local plant), Monroe offered Ms. Calabrese not so much a culture shock but culture awe. She fell for the racially diverse town that refused to die along with the cotton industry. The mills may be gone, but as \u00e2\u0080\u009cHometown\u00e2\u0080\u009d reveals, the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old world commingles with the new; storefront churches and beauty parlors with cafes and vintage shops; homecoming parades with the restored buildings on Broad Street.Yet it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until after she divorced and moved to a house near downtown in 2012 that she began documenting Monroe. The turn in life provided a fresh opportunity to examine the place she had plunged herself into as a young adult and mother. She became hooked on capturing the reality around her. She was always ready to snap a moment in time with her latest camera of choice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a smartphone. The most extraordinary part of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHometown\u00e2\u0080\u009d may be that she created the entire project using an iPhone. While the list of professional photographers using mobile phones, and crucially, their apps, to create extraordinary images continues to grow, seeing the promise of mobile phone\u2019s cameras realized is still fresh, still stunning to viewers used to the here today, gone tomorrow snaps on social media.  Indeed, she made many, if not most, of the images while driving, on the way to here or there.Her embrace of the technology is full-hearted. In 2010, she wrote \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Art of iPhoneography: A Guide to Mobile Creativity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d published by Ilex Press in Britain and Sterling Publishing in the United States. The book has sold more than 100,000 copies and has been translated into 10 languages. She also teaches iPhone photography to both children and adults. She has been shooting with her iPhone (whatever the latest incarnation) for her documentary work, both personal and client, ever since.Her tips? \u00e2\u0080\u009cI always shoot with the native camera app on the iPhone to get the highest resolution possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of the black-and-white conversion was done using the Photoshop app. All shooting and editing for these images was done on my iPhone. Portraying this series in black and white felt right as it helped me connect a variety of scenes and subject matter to give the viewer a cohesive look at this place. I like that it feels timeless and gives a nod to our past. Between black and white, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find many shades of gray.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Inspiring photographers, from wannabes to professionals, to explore the possibilities of mobile camera technology is rewarding.

Alas, no more.\u201cI don\u2019t want to make this personal,\u201d Ms. Naim said, dramatically covering her eyes while passing through a bar-lined piazza, \u201cbut these horrible lights, mamma mia!\u201dRome, more than 2,700 years in the making, is of course ever evolving. Its layers of archaeology attest to that. Barely a hole can be sunk without hitting bone or ruin. Yet for some, the beloved, timeless, romantic beauty of the city is not to be tinkered with.Even a plan to replace the city\u2019s yellow sodium streetlights with cheaper, more environmentally friendly, white LED lamps is, for some, not simple modernization, but sheer heresy.If nothing else, the new bulbs have lit up social media, where the illumination has been compared to that in a hospital, a morgue or a cemetery.Not everyone is bothered, and to some, the switch is more smoke than light. \u201cIt\u2019s how you live the city, not the lighting, that makes it romantic,\u201d said Cosimo Barnaba, the salon manager of a hipster-friendly hairdresser just off the main square in Monti.Mr. Barnaba said the benefits of the new lighting \u2014 the lower environmental impact and cost savings \u2014 outweighed the polemics. \u201cRome is always beautiful, even with a white light,\u201d he said.\u201cIllumination is atmosphere,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cThey are assassins of the beauty of Rome, of its history.\u201dOfficials from the company responsible for the plan declined to be interviewed. A company spokesman offered a defense not likely to appease angry Romans: The change was inspired by the lights of Los Angeles, a city not often associated with Rome, perhaps for good reason.In fact, critics say the very problem is that the modern glow dims the Italian capital\u2019s Old World charm.Mr. Zamboni pointed out that 20 percent of the world\u2019s energy consumption was used up by lighting, public and private, and that costs could be significantly reduced by replacing old-style bulbs.The new lights are cost-effective and efficient, he said.\u201cBut are we sure we want to put them in historic centers without taking into account aesthetic coherence?\u201d he added. \u201cPerhaps this is an issue for architects, because there are solutions.\u201dThe utility company spokesman, who asked not to be identified, as is common with Italian companies, said there were also public safety reasons for the brighter light, noting that some parts of the city were deemed to be too dark.But he said that a warmer tone of light was being used in the city center, after consultation with the cultural authorities, which normally painstakingly monitor even the slightest changes to the country\u2019s patrimony.Residents in some neighborhoods have complained that the cast-iron tops of many old-style lampposts have been changed to look more modern, and that many dome-shaped lamps that hang over city streets have been replaced with drab, rectangular lights. Many wonder why Italy\u2019s culture officials have not intervened.Municipal culture officials in Rome did not return calls for comment, and the national authorities charged with protecting and preserving Italy\u2019s cultural heritage said that urban lighting had never fallen under their mandate.\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that when something doesn\u2019t work, people think that the superintendency is a sort of constitutional court to avoid messes when it comes to culture, but it doesn\u2019t have that role,\u201d said Luca Del Fra, a spokesman for one of Rome\u2019s state cultural authorities.Technically, it was out of their jurisdiction, Mr. Del Fra said.

{"Headline": "Depressed by Politics? Just Let Go", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byWhen is politics like a tree?If you study and write about happiness as I do, you become attuned to patterns. For instance, when I walk into a workplace, I can usually tell, based on my first few conversations, if the environment is happy or not. And in the past couple of years, I have noticed a happiness pattern that relates to politics. Namely, the people most in the know tend to be unhappier than those who pay less attention.I subjected this observation to a bit of analysis, and sure enough, the numbers bear it out. I analyzed the 2014 data from the General Social Survey collected by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago to see how attention to politics is associated with life satisfaction. The results were significant. Even after controlling for income, education, age, gender, race, marital status and political views, being \u201cvery interested in politics\u201d drove up the likelihood of reporting being \u201cnot too happy\u201d about life by about eight percentage points.My results did not prove causality: People who pay close attention to politics might also tend to have some latent source of unhappiness. But behavioral science shows that the link might just be causal through what psychologists call \u201cexternal locus of control,\u201d which refers to a belief that external forces (such as politics) have a large impact on one\u2019s life.Incidentally, the researchers also found that this external locus of control has been increasing among students since the 1960s. No surprise here, as young people have been increasingly exposed to trigger warnings, sensitivity about microaggressions and safe spaces. Awareness of oppression is crucial, of course, but the research suggests that today\u2019s campus trends carry tangible academic and psychological costs.To be sure, an external locus of control is not necessarily inaccurate. If someone is directly affected by a political action (having her immigration status changed or losing her health insurance, for example), her attention will naturally be occupied by events outside her control. However, the external locus of control can also be based on an illusion that something affects us \u2014 meaning that the resulting unhappiness is unnecessary.Which brings us back to the opening question of this essay: When is politics like a tree? In his classic book \u201cLiving With the Himalayan Masters,\u201d the Hindu guru Swami Rama recounts the day his master taught him the nature of \u201cmaya,\u201d or illusion. Without warning, his master tightly grabbed hold of a tree and cried out: \u201cHelp me! My body has been caught by this tree trunk.\u201d Swami Rama exhausted himself trying to pry his master off the tree, but to no avail. Finally, his master let go, and said, laughing, \u201cThis is maya.\u201d He explained that we needlessly attach our fate to external things, bringing misery. The simple solution: Just let go.The question today is how much of our political consumption is like the tree, and thus expendable in order to raise our happiness. We all have political opinions \u2014 some of them strongly held. But much of what actually happens in politics is far beyond our individual influence. That doesn\u2019t mean it is intrinsically unimportant, but let\u2019s be honest: Many of us consume political news and commentary in a compulsive, concupiscent sort of way, voluntarily subjecting ourselves to gratuitous information and stimuli, particularly on social media.The unhappiness results speak for themselves. A friend of mine \u2014 a well-known journalist with a large social media following \u2014 once confided in me that there is little that brings him more anxiety than checking his Twitter feed. As he clicks on his notifications, he can feel his chest tighten. Maybe you can relate to this.So what is the solution? First, find a way to bring politics more into your sphere of influence so it no longer qualifies as an external locus of control. Simply clicking through angry political Facebook posts by people with whom you already agree will most likely worsen your mood and help no one. Instead, get involved in a tangible way \u2014 volunteering, donating money or even running for office. This transforms you from victim of political circumstance to problem solver.So go ahead, let go of the tree.Arthur C.

{"Headline": "Meet the Introverted Extroverts of Ribeira Sacra", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byWine SchoolFor a region as ancient as Ribeira Sacra, it may seem odd that we don\u2019t know a lot about the wine.You know how we operate: I recommend three good examples of a particular wine each month. You drink one or as many as you would like at home, in a relaxed atmosphere with food, family or friends, noting your own reactions to the wine. Then we gather to discuss. As always, I welcome hearing your thoughts.The third wine, the 2014 D\u00e9cima, is a bit more mysterious. I don\u2019t know much about the producer, but I really like the wine. It comes from the Amandi subzone of Ribeira Sacra, as does the Vi\u00f1a Caneiro.Amandi is one of the region\u2019s best areas, where the steep terraces rising from the Sil River are studded with chunks of slate, the dominant rock in the soil. Everything must be done by hand, as the hills are too steep to accommodate machines.The Gu\u00edmaro is aged briefly in steel tanks before it is bottled, a technique intended to preserve its fresh fruity flavors. Indeed, it was almost exotically fruity and floral in the glass, with bright raspberry and mineral flavors that linger in the mouth. Despite the exotic flavor, as with so many Ribeira Sacra reds, it was graceful and restrained, drawing you in rather than throwing itself at you.Wild, exotic aromas of fruits and flowers are characteristic of menc\u00eda grown in Ribeira Sacra, as are the underlying earthy mineral flavors and grace. I love this combination, which I often prefer to the denser, more burly menc\u00edas of Bierzo. And I wonder how a wine can be simultaneously exuberant and reticent.I found these qualities, too, in the 2014 D\u00e9cima, as bright, lively, exotic and lithe as the Gu\u00edmaro, but with fine tannins that gave a little more structure to the wine. It, too, had the blend of raspberry and slatelike minerality among its flavors, and it was also aged in steel tanks.The 2012 Vi\u00f1a Caneiro was the outlier among these three bottles, possibly because of its age. Like the Gu\u00edmaro, it was aged in steel tanks, but for nine months rather than six. Did this longer aging contribute to its added depth and richness? Or was that a product of the vintage? Probably a little of both. In any case, the Vi\u00f1a Caneiro was richer and deeper, with herbal flavors to complement the red fruit and mineral components.Despite the differences among these wines, they were easy, accessible and delightful in a way that more ambitious wines may not be. Had these wines been aged in oak barrels for longer periods of time, they may not have been as easy to enjoy in their early years. If the oak barrels were new, the wines could have been marred by woody flavors \u2014 although with a judicious use of older barrels, perhaps they would have aged and evolved in fascinating ways.The reaction to these Ribeira Sacras was mixed, which was surprising to me, as I find them so pleasurable. Many of you enjoyed them. VSB of San Francisco had never heard of Ribeira Sacra. When he bought a bottle of the Gu\u00edmaro, the seller described it as half-pinot noir, half-syrah, which VSB said was a good description.A reader in Northport, Mich., Mario Batali, who happens to be a chef of some renown, said he drank the D\u00e9cima with white-bean-and-venison chili, and called it \u201ca match made in heaven.\u201d\u201cThe light mouthfeel was nearly bursting with freshness, which played well with the toasted serrano chile salsa I spooned over as a condiment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ephemeral structure of the tannins allowed the sweetness of the cornbread served alongside to be a real player in the quartet.\u201dThough he couldn\u2019t find any of the recommended bottles in Poland, Dawid in Warsaw did manage to track down a bottle from another producer, which he said went well with spicy burgers, guacamole and sweet onions. And Roland in Portland, Ore., found an older vintage of the Vi\u00f1a Caneiro, a 2008, which he said was the boldest and deepest of the wines he tried. That response partly answered my question of what the wine would taste like in five years.Not everybody\u2019s experience was as harmonious. Caroline of Eugene, Ore., said her group found that they were \u201cpleasant and reasonable,\u201d and that they paired well with chicken Marbella and other dishes. But the bottom line? \u201cThe wines didn\u2019t knock anybody out.\u201dAnd poor Dan Barron of New York found little to like in his combinations of the Gu\u00edmaro and skirt steak with almond sauce, and the Vi\u00f1a Caneiro with flank steak and tapenade. My recommendation would have been to keep those dishes simple and cut out the sauces. But, he said, he and his wife did enjoy the D\u00e9cima with salmon in a soy-lime sauce.For all of us, these wines were an adventure, complete with delight in discovery and disappointment when they didn\u2019t match our hopes. For me, they are one more option when the occasion calls for nuance rather than power. I hope they at least inspire further exploration.As an aside, the name Ribeira Sacra can be translated as Sacred Riverbanks. That name, the story goes, came about not because the riverbanks themselves were deemed holy or blessed, but because so many monasteries and churches dotted the region. I like to imagine that the name was coined with some irony in mind, even if the breathtaking views of the vineyards do inspire awe.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Releases Diversity Report and Repudiates Its \u2018Hard-Charging Attitude\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported by\u201cEvery strength, in excess, is a weakness,\u201d Liane Hornsey, the recently appointed chief human resources officer, said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco. \u201cWhat has driven Uber to immense success \u2014 its aggression, the hard-charging attitude \u2014 has toppled over. And it needs to be shaved back.\u201dIn recent weeks, Uber has moved quickly to shed that past. The company hired Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and others to conduct an investigation of the workplace. Arianna Huffington, a board member, has repeatedly said that the company would no longer hire \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dMs. Hornsey, a former executive at Google, has also moved into the hot seat. She joined Uber late last year from SoftBank and has essentially been given a blank check \u2014 money, head count, resources \u2014 to revamp the workplace processes and managerial styles put into place when the company was still a fledgling start-up.Along with resources, Ms. Hornsey has embarked on a \u201clistening tour\u201d with employees who wish to share grievances. She is reworking the human resources structure and how Uber rates employee performance, long considered a problem area for insiders. And she spoke on behalf of the company about the diversity report, which covered full-time employees but not drivers, who work as freelancers.The report\u2019s numbers were stark. Only 36 percent of Uber\u2019s work force is made up of women, while the technology jobs at the company \u2014 some 85 percent \u2014 are overwhelmingly held by men. In terms of racial composition, 50 percent of Uber\u2019s employees in the United States are white and 31 percent are Asian, while 9 percent are black and 6 percent are Hispanic.\u201cWe have to build more trust with our employees, and transparency will build that trust,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said of the report.In the past, Mr. Kalanick has resisted publishing a diversity report, current and former employees have said. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Kalanick said, \u201cI know that we have been too slow in publishing our numbers \u2014 and that the best way to demonstrate our commitment to change is through transparency. And to make progress, it\u2019s important we measure what matters.\u201dCompared with statistics at other technology companies, Uber\u2019s diversity figures are not that different \u2014 and are modestly better than some.At Uber, issues of internal culture may have been compounded by its dizzying growth over the past few years. The service is available in hundreds of cities across more than 70 countries and completes hundreds of thousands of trip requests a day. In the last year alone, the company\u2019s employee base has doubled in size to more than 12,000.But that turbocharged expansion has come at a cost, employees have said. Growth, they said, was prioritized above anything else. That skewed the development of the organization into something that embraced the \u201ccult of the individual,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said.Top performers were rewarded and promoted into management positions. Some 63 percent of managers had never previously held a leadership position, and Uber did not provide much training for new managers, some said.\u201cFor the first several years, we had to just focus on executing our operational goals, and that was kind of the be-all, end-all,\u201d said Nicole Cuellar, an operations and logistics manager who has worked at Uber for nearly four years. \u201cThere was never the need to think about our culture like that. And I don\u2019t think it sunk in until we all had this really gut-wrenching experience.\u201dAmong the things that Uber now has on the table to change are its list of 14 corporate values, which include being \u201csuper pumped\u201d and \u201calways be hustlin\u2019.\u201d Mr. Kalanick is open to revising or adding new values, Ms. Hornsey said.She added that Uber was creating a task force to pinpoint major human resources failings, aided by Frances X. Frei, an adviser from Harvard Business School who has helped companies through organizational change. Uber also pledged to donate $3 million over the next three years to groups working on bringing women and underrepresented minorities into the tech industry.Some current and former employees have expressed concern over whether Uber will be able to change, given the deep-seated trait of aggressive individualism that Mr. Kalanick has fostered.But others like Tasneem Minadakis, who is active in Uber\u2019s LadyEng organization, an internal group at the company that supports and campaigns for women, said they have been galvanized by the efforts to fix the culture. In total, Ms. Minadakis said LadyEng has more than 500 employees eager to enact change.\u201cThey really do believe that this company can be a force for good,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said. \u201cIf it could only stop shooting itself in the foot.\u201dKatie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

These are goose-bump moments from seeing something new. At the same time, there\u2019s a subculture of performance artists who are finding weddings as a platform for their art in a broader, mainstream way.\u201dHotels present performances that align with local traditions: for instance, a mariachi band or hula dancers. Couples hire entertainers who speak to who they are: opera singers for the highbrows; poetry pontificators for the romantics; or street and subway acts for the urbanites. Event planners, too, have a bag of tricks filled with techno dancers, synchronized swimmers, stomp troops and aerialists hanging on 40-foot rigs.Here are few ideas about how to add even more life to the party:La Hora Loca, which in Spanish translates to the crazy hour, is an hourlong show in which performers such as stilt walkers, dancers or LED \u201crobots\u201d wear costumes while swinging to Latino music and classic hits.Those who would rather shake their belly than their booty can hire Moroccan belly dancers to perform an authentic Arabian dance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat Pornography to Test Advertisers\u2019 Tolerance for Risk", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byOne of the most powerful advertising-buying firms has been warning its clients about the risks of their corporate marketing inadvertently showing up next to pornography on Snapchat.GroupM, which oversees billions of digital-advertising dollars as the media investing arm of the ad giant WPP, recently sent clients a memo about their ads possibly running before or after \u201cexplicit adult content\u201d on Snapchat\u2019s Stories feature, if a user chooses to follow such accounts on the app. Stories are a collection of videos and images uploaded by users that disappear after 24 hours.This week, however, Mr. Norman said, \u201cA note came to us and said, now we have a situation where one of our lenses we paid for on Snapchat has been appropriated by a porn star, and the porn star has used our lens.\u201dThe lens was not used in an explicit manner, but the brand was concerned that it could be, according to Mr. Norman. He added that GroupM has been having similar conversations recently about risks on YouTube and other platforms, noting the management at Snap Inc., the newly public owner of Snapchat, has been \u201cvery responsive\u201d to its concerns.Snap made almost all of its roughly $400 million in revenue last year from advertising. It has sought to distance itself from Snapchat\u2019s early reputation as an app for \u201csexting,\u201d a perception it acknowledged in its recent filing to go public.\u201cWe now live in an age, having lived through generations of highly curated media like The New York Times and ABC and NBC, to a world of less curated media or not curated media, and advertisers need to learn what their tolerance for risk is,\u201d Mr. Norman said. \u201cIf it\u2019s zero, it leads you down a certain path, and if it\u2019s not there, it leads you down a different path.\u201dThe spotlight on social platforms like YouTube and Facebook will not lessen any time soon, Mr. Norman said. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s an expectation from advertisers and regulators and consumers that these companies, which are fairly rich in revenue and certainly rich in profile and total number of users, should make it an extremely high investment priority to keep their platforms safe.\u201dFollow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter @Sapna.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Cure\u2019 Me? No, Thanks", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byDisabilityYes, S.M.A. is the No. 1 genetic cause of infant death. And the new drug, Spinraza, sold by Biogen and developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, will be a godsend for many. Without it, babies born with this condition, which causes debilitating muscle weakness, have only slightly better than a 50-50 chance of surviving past age 2.According to clinical studies of more than 170 patients who took the drug, 23 percent of infants died and 40 percent achieved an otherwise unlikely or impossible degree of motor function, such as the ability to sit up unassisted and even, in some cases, to stand and walk.Spinraza is supposed to be beneficial for those with a later onset, too, because it works by increasing the body\u2019s production of the SMN protein, which is what\u2019s lacking in those of us with S.M.A. But the long-term effects are unclear. The F.D.A. approved the drug in less than three months under \u201cpriority review.\u201dAs someone born with S.M.A. 54 years ago \u2014 a wheelchair user since the age of 3 who has never walked or stood \u2014 I fear for those like me who may never look at their lives the same way again. I fear that Spinraza, while giving hope, and perhaps a stronger and longer life, to some, may also release a torrent of self-doubt, of pent-up insecurity about our inexorable dependence and emaciated bodies. In some ways, it could make it harder for many of us to live with this type of disability.I know now that it\u2019s not all about me. My disability takes a toll on my family. It\u2019s a drain on my wife\u2019s energy and time, not to mention the wherewithal of our children. It\u2019s a financial burden on my father and stepmother, who help with the bills (my personal-care attendants alone cost $40,000 a year).Yet none of them are urging me to take the leap. It\u2019s not as if Spinraza is truly a cure anyway. It may slow or stop the progression of weakness in some users, but the underlying condition remains. While approved for every age and for every stage of S.M.A., it\u2019s apparently most effective with kids (and adults with a recent onset of symptoms). So although it might restore a modicum of muscle tone, I may already be too far gone.I concede that less deterioration sounds desirable. But what of the risks? Listed side effects include possible respiratory infections, kidney toxicity and blood clots. None of which would faze me if I had nothing to lose, but I do.Equally daunting, the drug has to be injected directly into the spinal column several times a year. So it\u2019s a commitment. It\u2019s also an enormous investment, costing as much as $750,000 the first year and $375,000 annually forever after.To be sure, surmounting fears and obstacles like these is how I\u2019ve lived much of my life. Even Spinraza\u2019s newness \u2014 the sense that those who sign on are being guinea pigs \u2014 wouldn\u2019t stop me if I were hankering for a medical solution to my life\u2019s complications. Furthermore, I recognize that I wouldn\u2019t have survived as long as I have without medical interventions. So it\u2019s not passivity or some kind of technophobia that gives me pause here.My primary objection comes from my hard-won sense of self-esteem. Long ago I decided that if I was going to like myself, I had to make friends with the disability that was inherently part of me. Living with a disability is not easy. That\u2019s why I became an advocate of fair treatment and equal access: I knew deep in my bones that things could be better. It wasn\u2019t that I had to pull myself up by my bootstraps. Rather, society had to change, become more inclusive, more open to and validating of people with disabilities.If instead I\u2019d put my energies into fund-raising for medical development, that would\u2019ve been a betrayal of my core belief \u2014 namely, that I and all my brothers and sisters in disability are O.K. as we are.The organizers of the panel later apologized, but did they truly understand that this is akin to the difference between saying \u201cthe end of racism\u201d and \u201cthe end of race\u201d? One takes aim at the problem; the other, at the victims of the problem.To be clear, I have nothing against any advancement that will help others. Not everyone with S.M.A. (or any other disabling condition, for that matter) has the support I\u2019ve benefited from. But not all of us in the target market are actually seeking this solution. I can\u2019t help feeling there\u2019s a contradiction between taking pride in one\u2019s disability and hankering for a cure. You don\u2019t try to cure something you like about yourself.I acknowledge that as I age with S.M.A., I am troubled by my increasing difficulties with swallowing and breathing and the now complete loss of use of my hands. Yet even if the drug did help head off further debility, I\u2019d have to face feeling like a traitor to the movement, a turncoat to the cause of disability pride.None of this is to say that medical science shouldn\u2019t be pursued or that those who are drawn to this drug and its potential benefits should not take it. It\u2019s just that it will never be the beacon of hope for me that it already is for others. Because I know that even if it did eradicate S.M.A., the disability community will still be plagued by unnecessary and unfair impediments to equality and justice. Those are ailments that medicine can\u2019t do anything about.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Carrots, Striking and Sweet, Have Arrived", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteA few years ago, carrots were like celery and onions, part of many a dish but rarely the star. Maybe you would see them as a side dish, buttered and glazed, or pur\u00e9ed into a soup.Then one day, roasted heirloom carrots in various colors started appearing in trendy restaurants as an appetizer \u2014 or even a main course.The roots had arrived, earning their place in the farm-to-table pantheon next to the burnished cauliflower and crispy brussels sprouts.I\u2019m in full favor of this development, because roasting is one of my favorite ways to cook a carrot. The sweet juices condense in the oven\u2019s high heat, turning honeylike and golden. The flesh slackens, the pointy bits char. They are wonderful eaten steaming hot from the oven, and just as good when allowed to cool to room temperature, making them as convenient as they are enticing.I regularly grab it when I want to give a salad dressing a touch of sweetness, but when honey would be too sugary. With its high acidity level, pomegranate molasses never gets cloying.It\u2019s also lovely drizzled on grain dishes, grilled meats and pretty much any vegetable that comes out of your oven.To further bring out the pomegranate flavor in this salad, I add pomegranate seeds as a juicy garnish.When I\u2019m serving this as a salad course, the garnishes stop there. But to transform it into a light main course, I\u2019ll top it with plain yogurt and either nuts or pita chips for a more assertive crunch.

Two Congressmen Take Debate to the Highway", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byMarriages and longtime friendships have been killed off by long road trips, so it was no certainty that the American political process could survive 24-plus hours in a Chevy Impala. But Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, Democrat of El Paso, suggested to his colleague and congressional district neighbor, Representative Will Hurd, a Republican, that they give it a try.Mr. O\u2019Rourke was not sure his flight would make it either. So he proposed something of a political stunt: Why not rent a car together \u2014 two politicians from opposite parties, from politically pugnacious Texas, of all places \u2014 and broadcast their trip to Washington as a live bipartisan town hall?Mr. Hurd, in a joint interview from the road, emphasized that the whole thing had been Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s idea. \u201cBeto suggested it; he thought I was going to say no,\u201d Mr. Hurd said. He pointed out that in addition to their political disagreements, the two had very different philosophies when it came to road trips: Mr. Hurd liked to make a lot of stops; Mr. O\u2019Rourke would drive nonstop through the night if he could.The commenters threw some real political meat for the congressmen to chew on, as well. A large share of the discussion centered on health care reform: the relative virtues and shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act compared with the Republican plan to replace it. Both agreed that health care delivery needed to work better, though the devil remained in the unworked-out details.Neither congressman sits at his party\u2019s extreme, so their comity was not as surprising as it might have been on a Ted Cruz-Bernie Sanders road trip. Mr. Hurd, for instance, is not a fan of President Trump\u2019s travel ban or his proposed border wall.But they have clear differences of opinion, and in this politically contentious moment, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, high-profile bipartisanship is not always looked upon favorably. He mentioned as an example the scolding he got from a colleague for working on an immigration bill with a Republican, Steve Pearce of New Mexico, whose seat the Democrats want to win back. Mr. Hurd\u2019s border district is another one Democrats are eager to reclaim, and the state Democratic Party sent out a news release on Tuesday declaring that giving the \u201cappearance of bipartisanship is not a hall pass to avoid answering tough questions\u201d about Trump policies.Commenters, for their part, generally seemed to enjoy the trip. \u201cThis bromance makes me so happy,\u201d one wrote. Another added more ominously, \u201cLove the Thelma and Louise vibe.\u201dBut a look at the congressmen\u2019s Facebook pages showed that disagreements were still very much alive.\u201cSteve King is right,\u201d said a commenter on Mr. Hurd\u2019s Facebook page. (Mr. Hurd called Mr. King\u2019s comments \u201cunhelpful.\u201d)But the men would have plenty more time to talk about politics in the many, many more hours on the road, and in the legislative chamber that awaited them on their arrival Wednesday.

In a family, the stakes are only life and death. People you love come into your life. They, and you, will eventually die out of it. Everything between beginning and end is colored by that knowledge.The first season of \u201cThis Is Us\u201d began with a birth \u2014 several, actually \u2014 and a death. Its season finale, surprisingly, did not end with Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia) dying in the 1990s, even though the show had hinted at that for much of the season. Instead, it went further back \u2014 to when Jack met his wife, Rebecca (Mandy Moore), in the 1970s \u2014 and forward to a rough patch in their marriage.\u201cOur love story,\u201d he tells her in his last lines of the season (and maybe some of his last lines on Earth), \u201cI promise you, it\u2019s just getting started.\u201d This may not be true for him; it is for \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d which has been renewed for at least two more seasons of turning on the waterworks.Most subsequent episodes stuck with this four-part story structure \u2014 one for each of the grown triplets in the present, Jack and Rebecca\u2019s in the past. The series fishes through the Pearsons\u2019 lives for heartbreaking, heart-filling moments, shamelessly but effectively, like an extremely well-produced Facebook moments slide show.But the design has also meant that most weeks, \u201cThis Is Us\u201d is about 50 percent of an excellent show. The struggle of Kevin (Justin Hartley) to find fulfillment as an ex-sitcom star on the theater stage has been a continual dud. Only toward the end of the season, as Kate (Chrissy Metz) faced her guilt over Jack\u2019s death, has she had a story line not related to her weight.In general, the series leans too heavily on monologues \u2014 to lovers, to lost spouses, to unborn babies \u2014 on its sentimental folk-rock soundtrack, and on twist storytelling. (Moving as the finale was, I couldn\u2019t help but be distracted by the feeling that Jack might die at any second, as if he were a human time bomb.)Far and away the best story lines have been those built around Randall, an introvert and perfectionist who internalizes his stress and crushes it diamond-hard. The fact that Randall is African-American and that his family is white introduces race in an atypical way for family dramas, which tend to be homogeneous. His being black isn\u2019t his entire story, but it\u2019s not incidental either.At his 10th birthday party, for instance, only three classmates show up. We don\u2019t know, and \u201cThis Is Us\u201d leaves open, whether this is because most of his classmates are white or because of his reserved personality \u2014 or if that personality has been shaped by growing up black in a white community. (Young Randall, played by Lonnie Chavis \u2014 the casting of the young Pearsons is fantastic \u2014 shrugs it off: \u201cI have three really good friends. That\u2019s a lot.\u201d)Randall\u2019s search for identity leads him to his biological father, William (Ron Cephas Jones), who\u2019s dying of cancer. In the series\u2019s best episode, they take a road trip to Memphis, where William succumbs to his illness. Randall eases William\u2019s death by cradling his head in his hands, a technique Jack used to calm Randall as a child.I couldn\u2019t tell you why this family show became a hit where so many others haven\u2019t. Maybe America just needs a good cry this year.But at its best, the flashback-heavy, nonlinear storytelling of \u201cThis Is Us\u201d is more than a gimmick. It represents the way we experience time with the people we love. Your parents, your spouse, your children are the age they are, and they are every age at which you\u2019ve known them, all at once. Every moment of life, \u201cThis Is Us\u201d suggests, is your first and your last, hello and goodbye.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Red-State Utah, a Surge Toward Obamacare", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported bySALT LAKE CITY \u2014 From the moment the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, most elected officials in this sturdily Republican state have been eager to squash it.But something surprising is happening here. Despite deep uncertainty about the law\u2019s future, Utah recorded one of the biggest increases of any state in residents who signed up for coverage under the act this year. Now, the state is seeing a surprising burst of activism against repealing the law \u2014 including from Republicans.\u201cI\u2019m naturally a really quiet person, but if I sit and do nothing and they take it away, how can I live with that?\u201d asked Kim Nelson, 54, a Republican second-grade teacher who buys coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace and was recently treated for breast cancer. She has been calling and writing her congresswoman.Many Utah residents still detest the law, but the activity here, and in other politically conservative states, highlights the challenges Republicans and the White House face as they struggle to come up with a palatable replacement.When Representative Chris Stewart spoke with constituents by videoconference on Wednesday, a woman, who said she had gotten insurance for the first time in her life through the law, asked, \u201cPoor people need it and you\u2019re against it \u2014 why?\u201d Congressional offices have been bombarded with calls, emails and social media messages, including from some constituents who had never been moved to contact them before.\u201cCertainly this is something that\u2019s unusual in Utah,\u201d said Jason Stevenson, who is the education and communications director at the Utah Health Policy Project, a research group that has a federal grant to help people enroll in marketplace coverage. He said he had noticed a change in attitudes and energy.\u201cI would say the phone calls are rattling them,\u201d he said.Many customers of the insurance exchanges here are young, middle-class families who rely on marketplace plans because they are self-employed or students, or they cannot afford the coverage offered through their jobs, Mr. Stevenson said.Other marketplace customers, like Ms. Nelson, took jobs that do not offer health insurance because they could get coverage through the Affordable Care Act.Ms. Nelson said the option had allowed her to work at a job she loved, at a small private school. She has called and written Representative Mia Love, the Republican who represents her district, because she is afraid she will have to change jobs if the law is repealed.Catie Weimer, a record store employee in Salt Lake City who was given a diagnosis of narcolepsy after getting a subsidized marketplace plan last year, said she had joined a group called Utahns Speak Out, which she found on Facebook, as she grew increasingly anxious about the prospect of losing her insurance.Now Ms. Weimer, who is 30 and said she had voted for Hillary Clinton, is helping administer the group\u2019s Facebook page and helped plan a \u201cUtah Town Hall for All\u201d last weekend. Every member of the Utah delegation was invited, but none attended.The health law is by no means perfect in Ms. Weimer\u2019s mind; even with a subsidy, her monthly premium jumped to $95 this year, from $47, and she has a $2,500 deductible. Her insurer, Molina Health, has refused to pay for a drug, Xyrem, that helps her function, so she gets it through a charity program. Still, she said, she would have no diagnosis or access to specialists without her coverage.\u201cI knew Orrin Hatch, but I didn\u2019t even know the name of my other senator before this,\u201d Ms. Weimer said, referring to Senator Mike Lee, like Mr. Hatch a Republican. She said she had called their offices repeatedly in recent weeks, adding, \u201cThe threat of something this bad wasn\u2019t ever there before.\u201dMany Utah voters were deeply uncomfortable with President Trump\u2019s candidacy, though he still won the state with 45 percent of the vote compared with 27 percent for Mrs. Clinton and 21 percent for Evan McMullin, a conservative Mormon who ran as an independent.Mary Wood, a divorced mother of two who works three part-time jobs, none of which offers health insurance, said she had voted for Mr. McMullin as part of \u201cthis movement in Utah of people who had a hard time completely putting themselves behind either Trump or Hillary.\u201d But now, she said, with Mr. Trump pushing for a repeal of the health law and for other policies she opposes, her vote is \u201cone of the biggest regrets of my life.\u201dShe pays $75 a month for a plan that covers her family of three, receives a subsidy of $558 and worries about the type of replacement that was laid out in a draft bill recently published by Politico. That plan would provide age-based tax credits that would be most generous for older people; Ms. Wood, 39, fears it would provide her with far less financial assistance than the income-based subsidies she gets through the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI tried to call Orrin Hatch, and his voice mail box was full,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have told him, \u2018Look, this is going to personally affect me and my children, if you repeal the A.C.A.\u2019\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Hatch said the law was \u201cimploding from within,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Utahns from all over the state and from all walks of life, and the vast majority favor our efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare with patient-centered reforms that lower costs.\u201dAlthough much of the support for the health law here appears rooted in Salt Lake County, which is far more liberal than most of Utah and voted for Mrs. Clinton in November, resistance to repeal also appears strong in regions where a lot of people work seasonal jobs in tourism and recreation and rely on the individual market for health coverage.\u201cDue to pent-up demand, it was like \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 coming out of the woodwork, seeking cures,\u201d said Charles Kulander, an insurance broker in Moab, describing the demand for coverage after the marketplace opened in 2013.Frustration with the law in Moab, he said, is focused on the state\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid to adults earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level, as the health law allowed, and the fact that federal premium subsidies are available only to people earning up to 400 percent of the poverty level.As in all 19 of the states that have not expanded Medicaid, tens of thousands of people in Utah are stuck in a coverage gap, eligible for neither Medicaid nor premium assistance under the law. Many still rely on charity care offered by places like the Volunteer Care Clinic, a busy free clinic run by doctors and nurses in Provo two nights a week.Even the most conservative parts of the state have residents who have benefited from the law or know someone who has. When The New York Times asked Utah readers to share their experiences, hundreds who filled out the online questionnaire said they wanted the law to survive. Many came from Republican strongholds like Utah County, home of Provo, where only 14 percent of voters backed Mrs. Clinton last fall.A healthy minority of respondents said they opposed the law and wanted it repealed, usually citing high costs and few choices for coverage. Three insurers are participating in the marketplace here this year, but most counties have only one. Premiums for midlevel plans rose here by 20 percent on average this year, with higher increases in rural areas, but about 85 percent of marketplace customers qualify for subsidies to help with the cost, often substantially.Enrollment here grew by 12.3 percent to 197,187 this year, a time when nationwide enrollment dipped slightly, according to preliminary federal data. And the gains were not concentrated in left-leaning parts of the state: Utah County, where nearly 60 percent of voters are Republican, experienced a 26.7 percent enrollment increase through the end of December, Mr. Stevenson said, while Salt Lake County\u2019s enrollment grew by only 2.3 percent.Still, many Utah residents buy insurance outside the marketplace and receive no subsidy, usually because their incomes are too high to qualify. Mike Robertson, who lives in Orem with his wife and three children, said he had switched plans this year to avoid a 66 percent increase in premium costs but still paid $1,200 a month for a family plan with no subsidy.\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel like insurance. Feels like punishment,\u201d he said.Ms. Nelson said some of her conservative friends\u2019 and relatives\u2019 opposition to the law softened when they realized she was benefiting from it.\u201cSome people have said, \u2018You know, Kim, you make us feel better about A.C.A.,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey look at me and think, \u2018She used to be a runner. She never drank or smoked, but you know what, she got breast cancer.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Profitable Companies, No Taxes: Here\u2019s How They Did It", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byYet if the level is so high, why have so many companies\u2019 income tax bills added up to zero?Although the top corporate rate is 35 percent, hardly any company actually pays that. The report, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research group in Washington, found that 100 of them \u2014 nearly 40 percent \u2014 paid no taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015. Eighteen, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E, incurred a total federal income tax bill of less than zero over the entire eight-year period \u2014 meaning they received rebates. The institute used the companies\u2019 own regulatory filings to compute their tax rates.Companies take advantage of an array of tax loopholes and aggressive strategies that enable them to legally avoid paying what they owe. The institute\u2019s report cites these examples:Citing evidence in the report, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, introduced a bill on Thursday to eliminate tax loopholes that encourage companies to shift activities offshore. \u201cThe truth is that we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations,\u201d Senator Sanders said. \u201cOffshore tax haven abuse has become so absurd that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is now the \u2018home\u2019 to more than 18,000 corporations.\u201dOthers, like American Electric Power, Con Ed and Comcast, qualified for accelerated depreciation, enabling them to write off most of the cost of equipment and machinery before it wore out.Individual industries have successfully lobbied for specific tax breaks that function as subsidies: for instance, drilling for gas and oil, building Nascar racetracks or railroad tracks, roasting coffee, undertaking certain kinds of research, producing ethanol or making movies (which saved the Walt Disney Company $1.48 billion over eight years, the report says).These industry-specific subsidies mean that the goodies were not evenly distributed. Utilities logged an effective tax rate of just 3.1 percent over the eight-year period. Industrial machinery, telecommunications and oil, gas and pipeline companies paid roughly 11.5 percent. Internet services paid 15.6 percent. In just two sectors \u2014 health care and retail \u2014 companies paid more than 30 percent of their profits in federal income tax.\u201cOne of the things that jumps out pretty starkly is there\u2019s a real gap between the tax rates paid by different industries,\u201d said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the institute and a co-author of the study. \u201cWhen the biggest companies aren\u2019t paying their fair share, that means the rest of us are left to pick up the slack. It means small business and middle-income families are paying more.\u201dBut Tara DiJulio, a spokeswoman for General Electric, called the report \u201cdeeply flawed and misleading.\u201d\u201cG.E. is one of the largest payers of corporate income taxes,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the last decade, G.E. paid $32.9 billion in cash income taxes worldwide, including in the U.S., and pays more than $1 billion annually in other U.S. state, local and federal taxes.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe tax code is complex and outdated, which is exactly why tax reform must happen this year. G.E. has long been advocating to simplify and modernize the tax system \u2014 even if it means we pay more in taxes.\u201dCompanies with the biggest tax subsidies over the eight years, the institute\u2019s report said, included:Some of the tax incentives, including those enacted during the recession, were meant to increase economic growth and hiring, but the institute\u2019s report said they often didn\u2019t work that way.Republicans say their tax overhaul will eliminate some of the biggest loopholes, although critics counter that the substitute will end up further reducing companies\u2019 tax bills.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap Makes a Bet on the Cultural Supremacy of the Camera", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut Snap\u2019s success or failure isn\u2019t going to be determined this week or even this year. This is a company that\u2019s betting on a long-term trend: the rise and eventual global dominance of visual culture.But it\u2019s best to take Snap\u2019s camera company claim seriously, not literally. Snap does not necessarily mean that its primary business will be selling a bunch of camera hardware. It\u2019s not going to turn into Nikon, Polaroid or GoPro. Instead it\u2019s hit on something deeper and more important. Through both its hardware and software, Snap wants to enable the cultural supremacy of the camera, to make it at least as important to our daily lives as the keyboard.Since even before the invention of the printing press, text has been the central way that humans communicate over long distances and across time. Computers only entrenched the primacy of text. The rise of desktop publishing in the 1980s turned all of us into composers of beautiful, printed documents.Then the internet turned us into distributors of digital words. Suddenly we were all bloggers, emailers, tweeters and authors of Mediums and status updates. We ditched phone calls for written messages. We called these messages what they were: texts, as if we were describing the histories of ancients.But then came the cellphone camera, and then, a decade ago, the smartphone. For the first time, it became possible for humans to instantly document their visual surroundings and to transmit what we saw with lifelike fidelity.At first this seemed like a small change: We\u2019d have more pictures of our families. A host of companies, from Facebook to Flickr to Instagram, latched on to this idea.But Snapchat uncovered something deeper about the camera. Not only could we use pictures to document the world, but we could also use them to communicate. Snapchat, which was at first dismissed as a mere sexting app, showed that with the right design, a phone\u2019s camera could add an extra dimension to communication that you couldn\u2019t get with text alone.That may be only a start. The growing importance of cameras \u2014 of images rather than just text \u2014 is altering much about culture. It\u2019s transforming many people\u2019s personal relationships. It\u2019s changing the kind of art and entertainment we produce. You might even credit cameras \u2014 or blame them \u2014 for our more emotional, and less rational, politics.Perhaps most consequential, the rising dependence on cameras is changing our language. Other than in face-to-face communication, we used to talk primarily in words. Now, more and more, from GIFs to emoji, selfies to image-macro memes and live video, we talk in pictures.Snapchat has two defining features: pictures and ephemerality. When you talk to others on the service, you usually send them a photo, often of your face. The photo lasts for a few seconds before disappearing. Paradoxically, Professor Soffer said, these features make Snapchat much more like talking than writing.\u201cWhat Snapchat is attempting is to apply technology to visual products to create a fading-away effect \u2014 just as spoken words fade away in the air after utterance,\u201d he wrote.Snapchat adds other features to deepen this effect. The lenses and filters \u2014 ways to make your face look like a dog, for instance \u2014 seem juvenile to people who aren\u2019t used to Snapchat. But the moment you pick it up you understand the effect; lenses don\u2019t just add whimsy to your speech, but can perform other functions that approximate face-to-face chatting, too. They can hide your face when you\u2019re not looking your best. They can provide emotional cues: rainbow vomit may mean you\u2019re feeling great, while a black-and-white filter may suggest melancholy.\u201cThat\u2019s the purpose of the face filters or the geofilters in Snapchat \u2014 they provide a fun way to communicate these same kinds of phatic messages with pictures,\u201d Ms. McCulloch said.The other purpose the filters serve is to create a shared context for communication. When you talk to people in real life, you often do so while engaged in some other activity \u2014 you go out to dinner, you take a walk, you play a board game.\u201cIn digital environments, what you talk about is Snapchat\u2019s filters, or sticker collections, or you talk about an interesting GIF,\u201d Ms. McCulloch said. \u201cThey\u2019re a shared object to talk about.\u201dNone of this is to suggest writing is going to go away. On the internet, new forms of communication tend to be additive. We won\u2019t replace text with pictures; we add them together to create something new. What\u2019s more, text is still irreplaceable in lots of forms of communication. I could have tried to tell you this story in the form of an image-based Snapchat story, but it would most likely have been unwieldy and not especially informative. If you want to convey a lot of information concisely and accurately, writing is still one of the best methods to use.\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever looked at Ikea instructions, those don\u2019t have any words in them, and they\u2019re notorious for how frustrating they are to use,\u201d Ms. McCulloch said. \u201cIkea instructions would be a lot nicer if they came with words. So I don\u2019t think words are going anywhere.\u201dAnd you know what works even better than a hashtag? A GIF.No company is enabling and benefiting from the rise of visual communication as thoroughly as Snap. Its strategy doesn\u2019t guarantee its success; there are lots of other companies nibbling on the same megatrend, among them YouTube and Instagram, both of which have huge and growing audiences and deep relationships with advertisers.Yet alone among social companies, Snap is going all in on the image. And in a world where image is getting to be everything, that\u2019s not a bad bet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now Netflix Is All Thumbs", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNetflix, as you may have heard, is killing off its stars. At a recent news conference at its headquarters in Los Gatos, Calif., the company announced it was shedding its former one-to-five-star rating system in favor of binary digits: namely, thumbs up or thumbs down.\u201cNow it\u2019s easier to tell us what you like,\u201d the site promises.The writing had been on the wall. When I visited the company in 2012, full of questions about how it turned my methodical rating behavior into recommendations about what to watch next, Netflix\u2019s vice president of product innovation, Todd Yellin, told me the firm was \u201cde-emphasizing\u201d ratings in its algorithms.Stars were on the out for several reasons. For one, Netflix was transitioning from a DVD rental business to a streaming company. It was less reliant on you telling it what you liked (via ratings), because it could already tell what you liked \u2014 simply by analyzing what you had watched.This sort of virtue signaling, often undercut by divergent behavior, is everywhere \u2014 witness the discrepancies that sometimes occur between polling and actual voting in elections. And it\u2019s generally a one-way process: No one gives Adam Sandler\u2019s latest five stars and then secretly watches \u201cThe Sorrow and the Pity.\u201dBut why aspirational reviewing should happen on Netflix is intriguing, given that no one else sees your Netflix queue. It\u2019s just you, clicking your way to a better version of yourself.Another reason for Netflix\u2019s shift from stars to thumbs is that, in the term of data scientists, star ratings are statistically \u201cnoisy.\u201d I may have spent a few minutes rationalizing my three-and-a-half star rating \u2014 \u201cWell, the direction was a bit flaccid, but the story was an interesting take on globalization and the cinematography was amazing\u201d \u2014 but from a recommendation standpoint, that wasn\u2019t all that much more useful than simply saying whether I liked it or not.Of course, it is hard to resist the notion that Netflix\u2019s decision represents some kind of dumbing down.Recently, in a bathroom at Frankfurt Airport, I came across a sign that asked: \u201cSatisfied with the cleanliness of this restroom today?\u201d Below were three buttons: a green happy face, a yellow neutral face and a red sad face. This simple interface seemed appropriate to the task; I am sure the airport management did not require a more detailed analysis from me of its restroom hygiene (\u201cWhile I appreciated the level of polish on the tiles, I felt the hand dryer could have been slightly warmer\u201d).But a film, in theory, is a more complex experience than a trip to the toilet. Should our responses be so streamlined, so channeled into the world of internet \u201cA/B\u201d preference-testing?In a world of vastly proliferating consumer choice, it is small wonder we should turn to the quickest, most primitive gestures to express judgments. After all, we know what we like. But these binary snap decisions should give us pause.Every fast click on Facebook also serves to steer us deeper into our own proclivities; our every bleary post-binge-watch thumbs-up gives us more of the same, more of what we \u201clike.\u201d But in this one-click world, we should not forget that many of the best, most lasting works of art \u2014 novels, paintings, films \u2014 were things that, in their day, very often got the thumbs down.I have lately been spending less time on Netflix, and more time on a new streaming service, FilmStruck, which includes the holdings of TCM and the Criterion Collection. On the site, there are neither stars nor thumbs, as if to say: While you may or may not \u201clike\u201d every film here, we think they are all worth your time. This I like.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hungary Plan That Could Shutter Soros\u2019s University Is Called \u2018Political Vandalism\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 A law put forward by the Hungarian government would force a university founded by the Hungarian-American financier and philanthropist George Soros to shut its doors, the school\u2019s top official said on Wednesday.The move, according to observers, was the latest development in a crackdown on free expression and liberal values under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has embraced President Trump and vociferously denounced Mr. Soros, a billionaire who is a frequent target of attacks by the right-wing news media in both the United States and Europe.The school, the Central European University, opened in Mr. Soros\u2019s native Budapest in 1991, not long after the fall of communism and the start of Hungary\u2019s uneven transition to democracy. The school is known as a center for research in the social sciences, with programs led by internationally prominent educators.The university has also given a platform to dissident voices, particularly in the period since Mr. Orban, who helped popularize the term \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d came to power in 2010. Proponents of illiberal democracy place majority rule over civil liberties and minority rights, and they say that financiers like Mr. Soros are part of an elite capitalist class that puts cosmopolitan values over national interests.\u201cWe view it as discriminatory and we view it as a piece of political vandalism,\u201d Mr. Ignatieff said. \u201cWe feel that this isn\u2019t just about us; this is about Hungarian academic freedom in general.\u201dThe law would mandate that the university operate a campus in the United States, which it currently does not do \u2014 a requirement that Mr. Ignatieff said would be prohibitive financially.He said that the university, which operates as an American institution, was able to preserve its academic freedom because of that.The government\u2019s action raised concern within the European Commission and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as the American government.David J. Kostelancik, the temporary charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the United States Embassy in Budapest, praised the university as an \u201cimportant center for freedom of education in the region.\u201dMr. Soros, a Holocaust survivor, has financed many liberal causes and promoted democracy through his philanthropy, the Open Society Foundations. His right-wing critics assert that a good deal of Mr. Soros\u2019s wealth came from financial speculation and accuse him of having an undue influence on politics in the United States and Europe.Mr. Orban built his career as an opposition figure; as a young man, he was prominent in the activism that helped bring down communism in 1989. But he has shifted far to the right, particularly since taking power in 2010, after an earlier stint as prime minister.Over the last decade though, Fidesz adopted a different message, and now routinely accuses advocates for migrants, for example, of working on behalf of Mr. Soros and \u201cinternational capital.\u201dMr. Ignatieff said government officials had, in private conversations, criticized the university\u2019s choices of educators, among them opposition figures.The move against the university comes as civil society organizations that receive foreign funds, especially those affiliated with Mr. Soros, have come under increasing attack from governments in the region.The university says it has nearly 1,800 students from more than 100 countries and 370 faculty members.Hungarian officials on Wednesday rejected claims that the new legislation was created to target Mr. Soros\u2019s university.\u201cThis is not a move against any university of any foreign country but a clarification of the law,\u201d Laszlo Palkovics, a senior education official, said in a phone interview from Budapest. \u201cJust because a university is affiliated with Mr. Soros, that doesn\u2019t mean that Hungarian law does not equally apply to it.\u201dMr. Palkovics said he would speak with Mr. Ignatieff and also reach out to the United States Embassy.Mr. Kreko called the proposed law \u201can escalation\u201d of troubling trends. \u201cThe Hungarian government is taking ever tougher steps against civil society, higher education, the news media and other sectors,\u201d he said. The proposal was submitted to Parliament on Tuesday and could become law by summer.He warned it was not an isolated move, noting that Mr. Orban\u2019s illiberal democracy is seen by some as a model in the region. \u201cNobody should believe that what is going on in Poland is independent of what goes on in Hungary,\u201d he said.Mr. Ignatieff said that the embassy\u2019s statement was proof that Hungary\u2019s move did not go unnoticed.\u201cIf the government of Hungary was gambling that the Trump administration would say nothing about a flagrant discriminatory attack on an American institution, they judged wrong,\u201d Mr. Ignatieff said.\u201cIn an era of post-truth politics,\u201d he said, \u201cinstitutions that devote themselves to telling people that there is such a thing as knowledge, and it\u2019s the only reliable basis upon which to make public choice, that\u2019s pretty important.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Data Firm Says \u2018Secret Sauce\u2019 Aided Trump; Many Scoff", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byStanding before political and business leaders in New York last fall, Alexander Nix promised a revolution.Many companies compete in the market for political microtargeting, using huge data sets and sophisticated software to identify and persuade voters. But Mr. Nix\u2019s little-known firm, Cambridge Analytica, claimed to have developed something unique: \u201cpsychographic\u201d profiles that could predict the personality and hidden political leanings of every American adult.\u201cOf the two candidates left in the election, one of them is using these technologies,\u201d Mr. Nix said, referring to Donald J. Trump.Capitalizing on its work for the man who is now president, Cambridge has pitched potential clients in the United States ranging from MasterCard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Ahead of this year\u2019s elections in Europe, Mr. Nix is promoting the four-year-old United States-based company abroad, too.But a dozen Republican consultants and former Trump campaign aides, along with current and former Cambridge employees, say the company\u2019s ability to exploit personality profiles \u2014 \u201cour secret sauce,\u201d Mr. Nix once called it \u2014 is exaggerated.\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of really smart people,\u201d said Brent Seaborn, managing partner of TargetPoint, a rival business that also provided voter data to the Trump campaign. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as easy as it looks to transition from being excellent at one thing and bringing it into politics. I think there\u2019s a big question about whether we think psychographic profiling even works.\u201dAt stake are not merely bragging rights, but also an emerging science that many believe could reshape American politics and commerce. Big data companies already know your age, income, favorite cereal and when you last voted. But the company that can perfect psychological targeting could offer far more potent tools: the ability to manipulate behavior by understanding how someone thinks and what he or she fears.A voter deemed neurotic might be shown a gun-rights commercial featuring burglars breaking into a home, rather than a defense of the Second Amendment; political ads warning of the dangers posed by the Islamic State could be targeted directly at voters prone to anxiety, rather than wasted on those identified as optimistic.\u201cYou can do things that you would not have dreamt of before,\u201d said Alexander Polonsky, chief data scientist at Bloom, a consulting firm that offers \u201cemotion analysis\u201d of social networks and has worked with the center-right Republican Party in France.\u201cIt goes beyond sharing information,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s sharing the thinking and the feeling behind this information, and that\u2019s extremely powerful.\u201dBoth conservatives and liberals are eager to harness that power. In Washington, some Democratic operatives are scrambling to develop personality-profiling capabilities of their own. But even as Cambridge seeks to expand its business among conservative groups, questions about its performance have soured many Republicans in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit.Cambridge is no longer in contention to work for Mr. Trump at the Republican National Committee, a company spokesman confirmed, nor is it working for America First Policies, a new nonprofit formed to help advance the president\u2019s agenda.But when asked to name a single race where the firm\u2019s flagship product had been critical to victory, Mr. Nix declined.\u201cWe bake a cake, it\u2019s got 10 ingredients in it. Psychographics is one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to isolate exactly what the impact of that ingredient is.\u201dCambridge\u2019s parent company, the London-based Strategic Communication Laboratories Group, has a long record of trying to understand and influence behavior. Founded in 1993 by a former British adman, the firm has worked for companies and candidates around the world, as well as for government and military clients. SCL has studied Pakistani jihadists for the British government and provided intelligence assessments for American defense contractors in Iran, Libya and Syria, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times.\u201cTheir approach was seen as serious and focused,\u201d said Mark Laity, chief of strategic communications at NATO\u2019s military headquarters in Europe, who has taken part in NATO-affiliated conferences where SCL has made presentations.In recent years, the company has moved to exploit the revolution in big data to predict human behavior more precisely, working with scientists from the Cambridge University Psychometrics Center. The United States represented a critical new market. Europe has strict privacy protections that limit the use of personal information, but America is more lightly regulated, allowing the sale of huge troves of consumer data to any company or candidate who can afford them.In 2013, Cambridge Analytica was created as SCL\u2019s American operation, and the two companies today share many of their roughly 200 employees, several top executives, and offices in New York and Washington.To develop its profiling system, Cambridge conducts detailed psychological surveys \u2014 by phone and online \u2014 of tens of thousands of people, differentiating them by five traits, a model widely used by behavioral researchers.Uniquely, the company claims to be able to extrapolate those findings to millions of other people it has not surveyed, assigning them one of 32 distinct personality types. Cambridge then blends those profiles with commercial data and voting histories, revealing \u201chidden voter trends and behavioral triggers,\u201d according to a 2016 company brochure.Those profiles, in turn, would allow campaigns to customize advertising, direct-mail slogans and door-knocking scripts, each calibrated to prod the targeted voter toward \u2014 or away from \u2014 a candidate.The promise of psychometrics appealed to Mr. Mercer, a computer scientist who made a fortune helping to lead Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island-based hedge fund. Mr. Mercer and his daughter Rebekah presided over a growing political empire that included millions of dollars in contributions to conservative groups and a stake in Breitbart, whose nationalist and racially antagonistic content prefigured Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Mr. Mercer became Cambridge\u2019s principal investor, according to two former employees. (Like several others interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements and the threat of lawsuits.) Mr. Bannon, the family\u2019s political guru, also advised the company and served as vice president of its board, according to Delaware public records.Mr. Mercer has never spoken publicly about his policy views in depth, but his giving is eclectic: He has financed anti-Clinton documentaries, right-wing media watchdogs, libertarian think tanks and both Senator Ted Cruz, a religious conservative, and Mr. Trump, a thrice-married nationalist.\u201cThe genius here is Bob, and the billionaire in this is Bob, and the person with the extreme views of how the world should be is Bob,\u201d said David Magerman, a Renaissance research scientist who was recently suspended after criticizing his boss\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.As the 2016 presidential campaign began, however, Cambridge landed a marquee political client: Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator. Mr. Mercer seeded a super PAC with $11 million to support him.Cambridge had a talented salesman in Mr. Nix, an Eton-educated SCL director chosen to lead the American effort. Among colleagues, his skills at cajoling clients are legendary. At an office party at a London dog track in the summer of 2015, one young employee offered an affectionate toast.\u201cHe is so smooth he\u2019ll rub shoulders with politicians and their campaigns,\u201d the employee joked, according to a video of the event posted on YouTube, \u201cand, in their face, tell them he\u2019s going to rip them off.\u201dBut Cambridge\u2019s psychographic models proved unreliable in the Cruz presidential campaign, according to Rick Tyler, a former Cruz aide, and another consultant involved in the campaign. In one early test, more than half the Oklahoma voters whom Cambridge had identified as Cruz supporters actually favored other candidates. The campaign stopped using Cambridge\u2019s data entirely after the South Carolina primary.\u201cWhen they were hired, from the outset it didn\u2019t strike me that they had a wide breadth of experience in the American political landscape,\u201d Mr. Tyler said.Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon were aggressive advocates for Cambridge. When the campaign disputed a $2.5 million invoice, they lit into Mr. Cruz\u2019s senior campaign team during a conference call, according to the consultant. Cambridge Analytica, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon claimed, was the only thing keeping Mr. Cruz afloat. (The company declined to comment on the exchange, as did a personal spokeswoman for Mr. Bannon and the Mercers.)After the Cruz campaign flamed out, Mr. Nix persuaded Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director, Brad Parscale, to try out the firm. Its data products were considered for Mr. Trump\u2019s critical get-out-the-vote operation. But tests showed Cambridge\u2019s data and models were slightly less effective than the existing Republican National Committee system, according to three former Trump campaign aides.Mr. Bannon at one point agreed to expand the company\u2019s role, according to the aides, authorizing Cambridge to oversee a $5 million purchase of television ads. But after some of them appeared on cable channels in Washington, D.C. \u2014 hardly an election battleground \u2014 Cambridge\u2019s involvement in television targeting ended.In postelection conversations with potential clients, Cambridge has promoted itself as the brains behind Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory. One brochure circulated to clients this year, which details Cambridge\u2019s expertise in behavioral targeting, also calls the company\u2019s \u201cpivotal role\u201d in electing Mr. Trump its \u201cbiggest success politically in the United States.\u201dTrump aides, though, said Cambridge had played a relatively modest role, providing personnel who worked alongside other analytics vendors on some early digital advertising and using conventional microtargeting techniques. Later in the campaign, Cambridge also helped set up Mr. Trump\u2019s polling operation and build turnout models used to guide the candidate\u2019s spending and travel schedule. None of those efforts involved psychographics.At a conference in Munich last month, Alexander Tayler, Cambridge\u2019s chief data officer, dodged a question about whether Cambridge would work with far-right parties in European elections this year. He also played down the role of psychological profiling in the company\u2019s work, much of which, Mr. Tayler suggested, is still based on traditional data analytics and marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s not about being sinister,\u201d Mr. Tayler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about tricking people into voting for a candidate who they wouldn\u2019t otherwise support. It\u2019s just about making marketing more efficient.\u201dEven before the election, according to one former employee, Cambridge employees attended sessions about soliciting government business in the United States \u2014 where Mr. Trump now oversees the federal bureaucracy and Mr. Bannon is arguably the White House\u2019s most powerful staff member. According to documents obtained by The Times, SCL is pursuing work for at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Commerce Department and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Mr. Bannon\u2019s spokeswoman said he stepped down from the Cambridge board in August, when he joined the Trump campaign, and \u201chas no financial involvement\u201d with the firm currently. She declined to say whether Mr. Bannon previously held equity in the firm.Late last month, SCL executives met with Pentagon officials who advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff on information warfare. A reference document submitted in advance of that meeting indicates that the company has worked as a subcontractor on roughly a dozen Pentagon projects, many of them \u201ccounter-radicalization\u201d assessments in Pakistan and Yemen.Such intelligence work is the bread and butter of SCL\u2019s government contracting in other countries. And the firm\u2019s experience in trying to influence Muslim sentiment abroad dovetails with Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon\u2019s focus on combating the Islamic State.At the moment, according to former employees, Cambridge has relatively few well-known corporate clients in the United States. Among them are ECI New York, a clothing company, and Goldline, which sells gold coins and markets heavily to listeners of conservative talk radio.A spokesman for MasterCard declined to say if it would do business with Cambridge. The Yankees did not sign on.But Mr. Nix appears to have bigger ambitions. \u201cI think were are on the cusp of something enormous,\u201d he said.Data science is about to reshape marketing, Mr. Nix maintained, and the big advertising conglomerates would survive only by developing their own targeting technology \u2014 or acquiring companies like Cambridge.\u201cThose agencies that don\u2019t adapt will die,\u201d Mr. Nix said.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

Today\u2019s puzzle was no different, and I also appreciated the encouragement to look to the stars for entertainment.\u25a0 27A: Some gentle wordplay here: \u201cHamilton\u2019s bill\u201d could be about politics, or it could refer to paper money. Today it\u2019s the latter, and Alexander Hamilton is on the American TEN dollar bill.Of course politics, literature, entertainment and pop culture, combined with nimble vocabulary, heavily feed these puzzles. But as science rises in our culture, empowering us to become better shepherds of this world that we are borrowing from our descendants, we might expect to see science-inspired clues alongside the traditional ones. And maybe even an occasional puzzle that\u2019s entirely science-themed.In this spirit, I was delighted to work with one of your frequent contributors, Andrea Carla Michaels, an old acquaintance from college, to bring some of the universe down to Earth \u2014 in this case, for a Monday puzzle. As good a place as any to start.Neil participated in every aspect, from theme generation to input on fill and cluing, despite his very tight schedule. He really is in another stratosphere these days!Suffice to say, the original seed was YOU CAN\u2019T BE SIRIUS (15!), followed by PLANET OF THE APUS (a bird-of-paradise constellation no one has ever heard of!)Neil and I went through dozens of \u201castropuns\u201d and Will and Joel were the final arbiters, even adding LITTLE DIPPER. They were strict about getting us to tighten our focus on stars, specifically. Smooth sailing, despite a little \u201cdiscussion\u201d as to whether HEAVENLY BODY clued as a \u201chottie\u201d was sexist or not ... And my stubbornness of wanting DWARF PLANET (\u201cWhere Doc and Dopey hail from?\u201d) as a poke at Neil, who was responsible for demoting PLUTO, much to the horror of third-graders everywhere.Neil is an energetic, indefatigable, humorous, brilliant educator who wants to highlight science in many forms ... whether hosting \u201cCosmos\u201d or joining forces with his old college buddy to create a little Monday puzzle!And, before I hurry outside to look up, many thanks to the surprisingly dangerous Caitlin Lovinger for holding down the fort while I was away.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Inc. Plots a Future Beyond Its Heyday, as Suitors Line Up", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byOnstage at a recent industry conference with the longtime leaders of the country\u2019s biggest magazine publishers, Rich Battista, the new chief executive of Time Inc., did not seem the outsider. Tieless, with legs crossed, he ticked off his company\u2019s latest accomplishments \u2014 robust digital growth, updated advertising capabilities \u2014 with the swagger of a knowing publishing chieftain.\u201cThere\u2019s something really exciting happening at our company,\u201d he said, echoing what had become something of a rallying cry at Time Inc. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our brand to really exciting new places.\u201dA former television executive, Mr. Battista, 52, has been charged with revitalizing the most storied magazine publisher in the country. At the helm of the nearly century-old Time Inc. since September, he has quickly worked to transform the home of Time, People and Sports Illustrated into a multimedia, multipurpose company, with a strategy heavy on online video, television and entertainment \u2014 and noticeably lighter on magazine journalism. Among the ideas the company has floated: offering people paid services like a food-and-wine club and insurance for pets.Mr. Battista\u2019s zeal, however, may not be enough to save the Time empire, whose weekly publications helped propel the national conversation for decades but have struggled to maintain their relevance in the digital media environment.Time Inc.\u2019s revenue has fallen every year since 2011, and investors have punished its stock since the company was spun off from Time Warner nearly three years ago. Brutal cost cuts and relentless executive churn have roiled the company.Mr. Battista and Jen Wong, 42, Time Inc.\u2019s new chief operating officer, maintain that they are committed to advancing their plans for the company. During a recent interview at its new headquarters in downtown Manhattan, both insisted that Time was on solid footing despite its lackluster financial performance, and that it was done with any hand-wringing about what its strategy should be.\u201cThose things are behind us,\u201d said Ms. Wong, a former executive of the website PopSugar. \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on growth now.\u201dIn a note to employees several weeks ago, Mr. Battista introduced an \u201cinnovation challenge\u201d intended to \u201csurface ideas for new revenue-generating products and services to offer our consumers.\u201d The winning team will receive $10,000.\u201cThink of it,\u201d he said, \u201cas a Time Inc. \u2018Shark Tank.\u2019\u201dAlthough the print business still brings in roughly two-thirds of the company\u2019s $3 billion in annual revenue, focus has shifted toward other revenue opportunities, including short online videos and events. The magazines share resources, and editors work with the business side, an idea that for much of the company\u2019s history would have been anathema.More symbolically, Time Inc. recently moved from the iconic Time & Life building in Midtown to a nondescript skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.Like other print publishers that have experienced drastic declines in advertising and circulation, Time Inc. has slashed costs, closed bureaus and let talented but expensive journalists go. In the last year, it has replaced longtime editors at Real Simple and InStyle and laid off about 100 people across the company.While the occasional story in People still generates buzz and Time\u2019s covers sometimes draw attention (one from October featuring an illustration of President Trump won the American Society of Magazine Editors\u2019 Cover of the Year award), Time Inc.\u2019s magazines no longer set the agenda or break memorable stories the way they once did.But analysts and former employees also describe distinct challenges and missed opportunities that made it hard for the company to adapt to a shifting media landscape. Management disagreements and cost cuts in the 2000s led to high-profile departures that bled the company of talent and left it without a clear succession plan. Until the spinoff, Time Warner and its chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, took Time Inc.\u2019s earnings and invested them in higher-growth businesses like HBO, leaving Time Inc. itself with little money for reinvestment.\u201cHe saw that he had a stable full of horses, but he also saw that he had a garage full of cars,\u201d Josh Quittner, a former editor and digital editorial director at Time Inc., said about Mr. Bewkes. \u201cSo he was going to invest in the garage full of cars.\u201dA Time Warner spokesman said, \u201cTime Warner has always fully invested in all of our operations, including Time Inc. when we owned it.\u201dSitting on opposite sides of a table in a conference room near Time Inc.\u2019s boardroom \u2014 where a painting of Luce hangs \u2014 Mr. Battista and Ms. Wong lauded new services and products, including a platform for youth sports, called Sports Illustrated Play, and a streaming video channel from People and Entertainment Weekly.\u201cIt\u2019s very organic for us to write an article about a new show that\u2019s launching that we happen to be involved in,\u201d Mr. Battista said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great example of using our print assets to build new revenue streams.\u201dTime Inc. is also focusing more on advertising. The company recently purchased several ad technology and data companies, including Viant, the owner of Myspace. And it now has its own advertising studio in Brooklyn called the Foundry.Mr. Battista and Ms. Wong insisted that Time Inc.\u2019s magazines were still important to the company. And in early February, Mr. Battista and Alan Murray, Time Inc.\u2019s chief content officer, sent a note to employees praising recent developments at the company, including a bump in Time magazine\u2019s online audience.\u201cThese achievements are a testament to one of our key points of difference \u2014 Time Inc.\u2019s trusted, quality journalism,\u201d they wrote.But Mr. Battista and Ms. Wong also said the company was looking to leverage the company\u2019s well-known titles into other revenue opportunities.\u201cThe foundation of the company is, has been and will remain the power of these brands,\u201d Mr. Battista said. \u201cIt\u2019s about extending these brands and taking these brands far beyond, obviously, the printed word, which was the legacy of this company.\u201dTo some in the industry, Time Inc. seems to be on the right track even if its financial results suggest otherwise. And within the company, some have described a new sense of collaboration. Employees congregate in common areas, where there are bowls of fruit and free snacks. The company\u2019s new headquarters feature bright video studios and test kitchens, instead of the bar carts and palatial executive offices of yore. (Laura Brown, the new editor in chief of InStyle, coyly described the space as \u201chigh concept.\u201d)\u201cI think they\u2019re absolutely doing the right thing,\u201d said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital. But, he added, \u201cIt remains to be seen how they actually can monetize what they\u2019re doing.\u201dStill, the de-emphasis on traditional journalism has not gone unnoticed. One editorial employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering his employer, noted that whether the strategy worked or not, it was not going to lead to the kind of work that the company had historically prized.Time Inc. is now targeting $100 million in cost cuts this year, though it will not specify what parts of the company will be affected. The company expects revenue for this year to be roughly flat.Still, Mr. Battista and Ms. Wong are optimistic about Time Inc.\u2019s future. They project that digital advertising revenue will reach $600 million this year and $1 billion in the coming years, and are confident that the company will return to growth.And while some see value in Time Inc.\u2019s short-form videos, others involved in the magazine industry say the company\u2019s appeal may not be in all of its new bells and whistles. In the end, it may be in those venerable magazines that made it so prominent in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 Lives On: A Teenage Novel Turns 50", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byTULSA, Okla. \u2014 On a particularly windy day in the Crutchfield neighborhood here, the writer S. E. Hinton was touring the renovations of the future Outsiders House museum. The rundown Craftsman bungalow was where the Curtis brothers \u2014 Darry, Sodapop and Ponyboy \u2014 lived in the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola movie based on Ms. Hinton\u2019s book \u201cThe Outsiders.\u201dThe book, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month, was arguably one of the most influential young adult books of its time, and leading this tour was the self-described fanboy Danny O\u2019Connor, 48, who made his own contribution to pop-culture history as a member of the 1990s hip-hop group House of Pain.Mr. O\u2019Connor, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., bought the Outsiders House for $15,000 in 2016, determined to turn it into a museum. During the recent tour, Mr. O\u2019Connor was showing Ms. Hinton a first-edition hard cover of \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d pointing out a wide paper sash wrapped around the jacket that read in bright orange, \u201cA remarkable novel about teenagers, for teenagers, by a teenager.\u201dMr. O\u2019Connor has been on a quest to find artifacts to include in the museum, amassing a collection of memorabilia from the movie, vintage photographs and hard-to-find editions of the book. Next on his search list, he told Ms. Hinton, 68, was a claw-foot tub like the one 18-year-old Rob Lowe (Sodapop Curtis in the movie) stepped out of with just a towel wrapped around his waist.\u201cAll the girls love that scene,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said.That \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d has permeated the culture so deeply is still somewhat surreal to even Ms. Hinton. \u201cThe rest of my books I wrote, but \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 was meant to be written. I got chosen to write it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way I can deal with it.\u201dMs. Hinton, who still lives in Tulsa, goes by Susie. In 1966, Ms. Hinton\u2019s editor, Velma Varner, suggested she use her gender-neutral initials out of concern that her given name, Susan Hinton, would \u201cthrow some of the boy readers off.\u201d She continued to use the initials, even in more recent publications.When Ms. Hinton was 16, after failing creative writing in her junior year of high school, she wrote \u201cThe Outsiders.\u201d The teacher who failed her was not happy that Ms. Hinton liked to mention this in every interview. She sold the book when she was 17. It was published when she turned 18. It has, quite literally, always been part of her life.For Ms. Hinton, the book is something of a time capsule of her own emotionally driven teenage angst. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it still resonates with teens, because they feel like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYour feelings are over the top. You\u2019re feeling and seeing injustice, and you\u2019re standing up against it.\u201dIn \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d justice comes by way of class warfare between the greasers, a gang of poor teenage boys, and the Socs, the rich kids from the other side of town. What may be most remarkable about the greasers is their ability to show great affection and emotion despite the masculine-dominated cultural norm of the 1960s. In almost every chapter, someone is crying or on the verge of tears.\u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a book where boys are this emotional,\u201d said Daniel Kraus, books for youth editor at Booklist, a review magazine published by the American Library Association. \u201cThey\u2019re crying, they\u2019re embracing, they\u2019re holding each other in bed.\u201d This adds to the greaser mythology, Mr. Kraus said.Jennifer Buehler, an English education professor at St. Louis University, believes that the greasers\u2019 experience, and their need to be seen as human, is similar to what many marginalized groups today are also trying to claim. \u201cThe fact that the character development is so strong in this book plays a crucial part in its power and its enduring relevance,\u201d she said.While Professor Buehler believes other factors contribute to the book\u2019s endurance \u2014 the universal title and the seemingly genderless author \u2014 she credits librarians and teachers for supporting the book from the start. In 1988, an influential award further cemented the canonical status of the book, she said, when it received the first Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for young adults. \u201cSo even though \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 was 21 years old, and the movie had some life, there\u2019s something about that literary award from the world of librarians and library service that helped teachers along their way.\u201d\u201cI have no problem with anyone interpreting my books anyway they want,\u201d Ms. Hinton said. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting these letters that are, \u2018Just say you wrote it gay and I\u2019ll be satisfied.\u2019 Well, your satisfaction isn\u2019t at the top of my priorities. Fifteen years old in Tulsa, Okla? The word was not even in common use. So, no.\u201dIt\u2019s possible that this new shift is simply an additional sign that \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d continues to influence young readers. That after five decades, it shows no indication of becoming dated.\u201cI\u2019m as amazed as anybody else that it\u2019s lasted as long,\u201d Ms. Hinton said. \u201cSo many people say to me after reading it, \u2018I\u2019m looking at people differently now than I used to,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s all quit judging each other.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Push for Internet Privacy Rules Moves to Statehouses", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported byNow that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers\u2019 online data. States have other ideas.Illinois legislators are considering a \u201cright to know\u201d bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates.Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers\u2019 locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in internet-connected devices like mobile phones, smart TVs and personal assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo.Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois \u2014 because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of state- and country-specific features to localize their effects.Congressional Republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also assert, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation.Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction.California and Connecticut, for instance, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like email, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees\u2019 social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants.\u201cMore and more, states have taken the position that, if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,\u201d said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said.States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle.In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking to roll back regulations, not create them.But federal blockage can create local opportunities.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts \u2014 not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,\u201d said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it\u2019s going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy.\u201d\u201cI think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,\u201d said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure.Mr. Hastings said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation.In an interview, Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating email lists or giving online support to customers.\u201cHiring attorneys to write privacy policies, coming up with terms of service \u2014 that will be a real burden for small businesses,\u201d he said.\u201cWe were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive,\u201d said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC. \u201cIt\u2019s important because the Trump administration is doing so much to roll back privacy rights, so there is going to be a huge shift to state lawmakers and state attorneys general.\u201dCecilia Kang contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fax-Wielding Witness Tries to Link Japan\u2019s Prime Minister to Scandal", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 He said he had in his hand a fax.It was not quite Joseph McCarthy and his list, but in the most dramatic moment during several hours of testimony on Thursday in Tokyo, the leader of an ultraconservative education group that has become entangled in a scandal with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe produced a two-page fax that he said showed that aides to Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie, had talked to government officials on the group\u2019s behalf.Japanese media breathlessly covered the testimony of Yasunori Kagoike, the administrator of Moritomo, waiting for a smoking gun that would link either Mr. or Mrs. Abe to a suspicious deal in which the school group bought public land at a steep discount to build a new school.If such links prove true, they could inflict political damage on Mr. Abe, who could soon become the longest serving prime minister since the end of World War II.Last month, he vowed in Parliament that he would resign as prime minister if he or his wife were found to have been involved in any wrongdoing related to the school, and Mrs. Abe stepped down as honorary principal of the new school last month as the furor over the scandal escalated.In his testimony, Mr. Kagoike noted that not long after this communication, the government agreed to sell the land to Moritomo Gakuen at a drastic discount below the assessed value of the property.\u201cI am not party to the details of this negotiation,\u201d said Mr. Kagoike, who said a lawyer for a construction company had negotiated a deal on the group\u2019s behalf. \u201cSo I would ask that you please ask for clarification from the Ministry of Finance.\u201dMr. Kagoike said he was \u201cangry\u201d that Mr. and Mrs. Abe had pulled their support from the school. At one point, Mr. Kagoike wanted to name the school after Mr. Abe, but he said Mrs. Abe asked him not to. He also reiterated a claim \u2014 this time under oath \u2014 that he made last week, in which he said Mrs. Abe gave him an envelope of cash as a donation from the prime minister two years ago.Mr. Abe has emphatically denied it, and after the testimony on Thursday, Yoshihide Suga, Mr. Abe\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, said that Mr. Kagoike\u2019s claim was \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201dRenho Murata, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called for Mrs. Abe to testify before Parliament. On her Facebook page, Mrs. Abe wrote on Thursday that she did not give any donation to Mr. Kagoike, and that she was not involved with the fax written by her aide.\u201cI remember that my secretary told me that she would reply to the inquiries he sent to her in a written document,\u201d Mrs. Abe wrote. \u201cI remember that was a reply declining his request.\u201dConnecting the dots any further may be difficult. In response to a reporter\u2019s question at a 100-minute news conference late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Kagoike said he did not believe Mr. Abe had \u201cdirect influence\u201d on the discounted land deal.He hinted at \u201cpowers at work behind the scenes\u201d and said that unidentified officials in the Ministry of Finance had helped facilitate the deal. \u201cI believe that perhaps Prime Minister Abe or his wife were reading between the lines,\u201d Mr. Kagoike said. \u201cThere was some sort of a mutual understanding between us.\u201dMr. Kagoike\u2019s extreme right-wing views have become contentious as more details of his group\u2019s existing kindergarten have emerged. It teaches elements of a patriotic prewar school curriculum and Mr. Kagoike has been accused of making derogatory statements about Chinese and Koreans.Asked about such statements during the news conference, Mr. Kagoike said he wanted the children to understand Japan\u2019s position in territorial disputes with both China and South Korea.In the case of China, he said he wanted students to learn that when Chinese boats entered waters around a string of islands in the East China Sea administered by Japan and known here as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu, it was analogous to \u201crobbers entering somebody\u2019s home.\u201dAnalysts said that the Japanese public is skeptical of Mr. Kagoike and that therefore the scandal was unlikely to have more legs. \u201cI don\u2019t think the majority of the public believes what he said completely,\u201d said Koji Murata, a professor of international relations at Doshisha University in Kyoto.\u201cGiven the international situation surrounding Japan such as the North Korean provocations and the U.S.-Japan relationship,\u201d he said, \u201cI would guess the general public is getting more and more tired of this issue without clear evidence of a crime or scandal.\u201dMakiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Is the Goal. The Problem? Getting There.", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byTOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 She was a blur of motion \u2014 leading the school step-dance team, working long hours after school at a beauty products store, mentoring younger students and caring for her siblings. So TaTy\u2019Terria Gary, a senior at Topeka High School, had little time last fall to study for the ACT college admission test.She was crushed when she scored below the threshold for admission to some local universities. She saw her dreams of being the first in her family to go to college and becoming a gynecologist turning to dust.\u201cI was angry at myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI had underestimated the test.\u201dGetting there, though, is another matter.For young people with college-educated parents, the path to higher education may be stressful, but there is a road map. If their standardized test scores are too low, they can pay for a prep course; if their essay is lackluster, they can hire a writing coach. No one will be the wiser. If they can\u2019t decide which college is the \u201cbest fit,\u201d they can visit. When they are tempted to give up, their parents will push them on.But for many working-class students, like TaTy and most of her classmates at Topeka High, there is no money for test prep or essay help. The alternatives to higher education \u2014 joining the military, working for $13 an hour at the local factory or getting a cheaper, faster trade-school certificate \u2014 are alluring. The cost of college may seem formidable.At a basic level, many of these students simply lack the knowledge of how to manage the increasingly complex college applications process.\u201cThey know that everybody goes to college, and they don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d said Robert D. Putnam, a public policy professor at Harvard, whose book \u201cOur Kids\u201d looks at the widening class divisions in America. \u201cThey\u2019re going down that path without anybody holding their hands.\u201dAmong the barriers are less quantifiable psychological ones. Students who are not exposed to a college-going culture have trouble even imagining themselves at a university, beyond, perhaps, a community college close to home.For students like TaTy and her classmates, the difference between going to college and not going is often small gestures or luck \u2014 placement in a college prep program, a mentor\u2019s interest, a parent\u2019s encouragement, their own steely perseverance.\u201cMy mother wants me to go out of state,\u201d TaTy said. \u201cShe feels like Topeka is not a good place for people who have dreams.\u201dOver the last few months, TaTy and two of her classmates, Nathan Triggs and Zachary Shaner, grappled with decisions about college and made their way out of childhood, through money worries, broken families and peer pressure, into the next phase of their lives. Each followed a different path, but in combination, they tell a story of students at an average school in the middle of America trying to find a better future.NATECollege Is a BackupA dove hurtles out of the cedar trees, but Nate Triggs, in camouflage vest and cowboy boots, cradles his Mossberg shotgun and lets it fly. The dove is borderline out of range, he said. He would have to be lucky.Like the dove, college feels borderline out of reach to Nate too. He gets conflicting signals from home and school about whether it\u2019s even a good idea.His parents split before he was born. On weekends, he lives on his father\u2019s farm outside of Holton, a 45-minute drive from Topeka, where he lives during the week with his mother and goes to Topeka High. There is little doubt of his academic ambition. When he was in seventh grade, he eagerly signed up for a college prep program.This school year, the college prep teacher urged the students to expand their horizons, to make lists of \u201cbest fit,\u201d \u201cstretch\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d colleges and to think of what they would major in. Nate thought maybe he would pursue architecture. He had built a hip roof worthy of Frank Lloyd Wright, though he had never heard of him.Or maybe he would study wildlife management. He was upset by the misuse of hunting to garner trophies, not food.\u201cI\u2019m just trying to play my options,\u201d he said early in his senior year. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to do yet.\u201dHis school is a Depression-era temple to education, with Gothic arches and a carillon tower. But the college-going culture is far from pervasive.More than 60 percent of the 1,800 students are low-income. Only half the senior class of about 400 took the ACT college admission test in the 2015-16 school year, and only 30 students took Advanced Placement tests, a measure of college readiness (though many more took the classes).About half of Topeka High\u2019s senior class went on to college in 2014, according to the latest state data.\u201cAll of the counselors firmly believe the philosophy that college is great,\u201d a counselor said at senior parent information night, even while pushing trade school programs in phlebotomy and cosmetology. \u201cWe want to get your kids there if that\u2019s where they want to go. But it\u2019s not the only option, and sometimes it\u2019s not even the best option.\u201dAt another assembly, a business development group promoted jobs paying $13 to $19 an hour at companies like Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition, Frito-Lay, Goodyear and the chocolate manufacturer Mars Inc.Nate\u2019s mother, a secretary, fondly remembers high school French and ceramics. She thinks it would be \u201cawesome\u201d for Nate to go to college, but, never having been, she has left the process to him. His father, a handyman who also never got beyond high school, encouraged Nate to make his own decisions.His older brother, Ethan, dropped out of high school and has been homeless on and off for two years. His foster grandfather suggested the military as a place to explore his options. Most of his friends in Holton are going to technical school.During his senior year, Nate took a construction job to pay for his cellphone and gas. His grades dropped \u2014 from B to D in AP government, his favorite class, and from B to F in physics. He never took the ACT.\u201cI\u2019m pretty done with high school,\u201d he said.Concerned, the Topeka High principal, Rebecca Morrisey, recommended him for an internship at Westar Energy. He is in heaven, earning union wage as a fleet mechanic after school.The internship has concentrated his thinking, for now: trade school, like his Holton friends. \u201cI want to get into what I want to actually do,\u201d he said. \u201cCollege is my, like, Plan B.\u201dZACA Guidance Counselor\u2019s HelpWhen the marching band received dress uniform hats last fall, Zachary Shaner was truant. So he rummaged around the band room and found an old hat that he hoped would work. It didn\u2019t. It was the wrong color and it had a broken black feather plume on top.That was Zac, the familiar character in many high schools: the brilliant student who does not live up to his potential.In elementary school, he was steered into the gifted track by his high IQ, but once in high school, he often chose easy courses to skate through. But he found a vocation in music.He plays bass, guitar, piano and saxophone \u2014 self-taught \u2014 and has progressed from covers of Johnny Cash to composing his own songs, drenched with teenage anomie, and performing at the Boobie Trap, a dive bar.Zac was a mostly A student until his junior year, when he took a job bagging groceries at Mike\u2019s IGA so he could buy musical equipment. His grades plunged, along with his hopes to go to college to become a sound engineer.His home life is hard. His mother, Charla Shaner, has a degree in early childhood education but depends on disability and child support payments to pay the bills. His older brother, Chris, 20, was too depressed to apply to college. Ms. Shaner\u2019s ex-husband, retired from the military, lives in another city and communicates with Zac mainly through birthday cards.But Zac had one advantage: the interest of his guidance counselor, Harry M. Peterson Jr., a debonair accordion player in his 70s, with an office full of pennants from places like Kenyon, Rice and Emory.Mr. Peterson believed in Zac and urged him to aim high. Zac scored 27, in the 86th percentile, on the ACT without taking a review course. He seemed like a good fit for a small but selective college, like Grinnell or Oberlin, that would value his creative spark and could offer scholarship money.Zac had never heard of either. \u201cMy spark is intimidated,\u201d he said early in his senior year.He told everyone he was going to Washburn University, the local public university, because he thought he could get close to a free ride there and live at home. But Mr. Peterson\u2019s encouragement sank in.Without telling anyone, Zac applied to the University of Kansas just before the Nov. 1 scholarship deadline. He was admitted and automatically awarded $1,000 a year based on his high grade point average and ACT score. Elated, he decided to major in film.\u201cAs a musician, I\u2019ve loved some of the soundtracks even more than the films,\u201d he said, listing John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Howard Shore, Danny Elfman and James Horner as movie composers he admired.In December, he found out that as a high-achieving, poor student from Kansas, he qualified for grants of about $10,900 a year, enough to cover tuition and fees.\u201cWow,\u201d Zac said.He could double his scholarship to $2,000 a year if he took the ACT again and scored just one point higher.But he thought he had done as well as he could.TATYWhen Luck Meets PersistenceTaTy\u2019s mother was 17 when she gave birth to TaTy, an event that dashed her own college aspirations. So she encouraged her daughter to follow a different path. Her guidance had an effect.For TaTy\u2019s 16th birthday, she asked for a \u201cpurity ring,\u201d a silver ring symbolizing a pledge that she will abstain from sex before marriage, or until she is ready. She has focused her energies on her schooling and getting into college.She and her mother, Tracy, felt that staying in Kansas would hold her back, but she had little idea where to go. She searched for colleges online. Her mother drove her to Ohio State, and she considered Oklahoma Baptist University because she liked the idea of a spiritual element in her education.But when she met Jennifer Stark Fry, a private college counselor from Wichita, she began to think more strategically.Knowing TaTy wanted to be a doctor, Ms. Fry took her and her mother on a tour of Newman University, a Catholic university in Wichita, Kan., with a strong pre-med program. (And she reminded TaTy to send thank-you notes.)The Newman admission officers were impressed by TaTy\u2019s 3.7 grade point average, but she had scored an incongruously low 16 on the ACT, and their threshold was 18.Newman urged her to take the test again in December.The test fee was waived because TaTy was so poor; her mother works at a group home for troubled children, and her father is absent, in and out of jail. But she would have to pay $52.50 for her last-minute registration and a date change. She had 24 hours to come up with the money, and her paycheck was not due for a week.She was about to give up when a local real estate broker, Helen Crow, came to the rescue. Her own daughter had gone from Topeka High to Stanford, and she could not stomach the thought of a future derailed for want of so little money.In a second lucky break, Sean Bird, a dean at Washburn University who knew TaTy\u2019s mother, arranged for her to take practice tests in the university library.After two weeks of practice, TaTy raised her score to 18, a huge leap, to the 39th percentile from the 26th.Newman accepted her on Jan. 5, her 18th birthday. \u201cFeeling accomplished,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page.She received $26,400 in scholarship and grant money off the $37,382 annual cost of tuition, room, board and fees. Though generous, it fit with a common practice of colleges, offering less money than students need.She would have to pay for the rest through a combination of loans and work study or cash. For a middle-class family, roughly $40,000 in debt might be a molehill. For TaTy, whose financial aid form listed parental income of less than $20,000 a year, it is a mountain. Still, she is not giving up.She said yes to Newman and is looking for more scholarship money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the Everyday People Who Have Sued Trump. So Far, They\u2019ve Won.", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byThe papers each bore two names, one unknown, the other ubiquitous, facing off across the letter V. The V was important. It meant that in America, anyone could sue the president of the United States and hope to win.In New York, there was Darweesh v. Trump. In Colorado, Hagig v. Trump. There was also Ali v. Trump, Zadeh v. Trump, Bayani v. Trump, Albaldawi v. Trump.\u201cIt was never my intention to go against the president of the United States,\u201d said Mohamed Iye, a Somali-born American citizen whose Somali wife and two American daughters were stranded in Nairobi after President Trump\u2019s first travel order prevented them from joining him in Minnesota. \u201cI was just following the law and doing everything the way it\u2019s in the books. And it came to this.\u201dThe government is appealing those decisions, which have drawn Mr. Trump\u2019s fury. His administration has insisted it will prevail.The people who sued the president this winter were Muslim, and they were Christian. They were professors and grocery clerks. They were parents, daughters and sons-in-law, and they were married but divided, or just planning the wedding. They were Americans, or trying to become ones.The ban \u201cisn\u2019t really what this country\u2019s about,\u201d Mr. Iye, 66, said recently through an interpreter. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have brought my family if I didn\u2019t love this country, if I didn\u2019t believe this country was the land of dreams.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s original executive order, signed on Jan. 27, barred visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, including those with valid visas, from coming to the United States while federal agencies tightened their vetting procedures. It also blocked the entry of all refugees worldwide. The revision in March, an attempt to satisfy the courts, removed Iraqis, green card holders and visa holders from the list.The American Civil Liberties Union, along with state attorneys general in Hawaii, Washington and Minnesota, have mounted the most successful challenges to the executive orders. The rest came about more haphazardly: Teams of pro bono lawyers hurried to the airports and the courts, filing lawsuits to free some of the trapped passengers. Other plaintiffs contacted their own immigration lawyers in hopes of striking down the ban, anxious to reunite with relatives who had been barred; still others lent their names to lawsuits after local Muslim community groups and immigration lawyers who were preparing to file court papers asked them to come forward.There was Allan Hakky, an Iraqi Kurd who found himself picking up the phone and volunteering to join a lawsuit after his mother-in-law had to abandon plans to visit a daughter with a premature baby in the United States.\u201cI\u2019m a very private person, so to actually have my name on a federal lawsuit, on something so polarizing and so in the headlines \u2014 if somebody told me this a year ago, I\u2019d probably laugh at them,\u201d said Mr. Hakky, a technology executive who has lived in the United States for 27 years. He said strangers had harassed his home with threatening calls ever since the lawsuit became public.But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to wake up one day and find a bunch of military people outside my house taking me to a camp the way they did to the Japanese. It\u2019s one of those things that, if you don\u2019t fight it at the beginning, does it get worse?\u201d\u201cI hope that everybody understands this isn\u2019t just something on a piece of paper,\u201d Ms. Ali, a Somali-born naturalized citizen, said. Even if the legal challenge does not succeed, she said, \u201cI can go to sleep at night knowing that I have done what I can legally to have my son with me.\u201dHe emailed every civil liberties group he could think of without expecting a response, \u201cbecause we feel like we\u2019re just tiny little fish in a great big pond,\u201d said Mr. Harrison, who trains new flight attendants for American Airlines. He had never been one for politics before, he said.Like the other plaintiffs, the couple veer between dread and hope with each successive legal victory, each sign that the Trump administration will not relent.\u201cWe look at each other and we say, \u2018Gosh, we don\u2019t know whether we should laugh or cry at any given moment,\u2019\u201d Mr. Harrison said from Istanbul, where, unlike in Tehran, the couple is free to act like one. \u201cShould we be happy? Should we be scared?\u201dStill, in an ordeal defined as much by the minutiae of plane tickets and visa applications as by the sweep of headlines and history books, the fundamentals are never far from view.In Iran, \u201cthere is no freedom of speech, no freedom of press,\u201d said Ali Asaei, 27, an Iranian who earned a master\u2019s degree from the State University of New York at New Paltz and now works at a psychiatric research institute in Manhattan. \u201cOne of the reasons I came here was because I thought, here we\u2019re going to have the freedom of speech and religion and all these. But if I don\u2019t have those freedoms, then what would be the point of staying here?\u201dNot that the plaintiffs have needed to sign court papers to feel the tremors of what many Muslims say is a heightened Islamophobia.In Los Banos, Calif., Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Ali, 39, a grocery store clerk born in Yemen and naturalized in 2010, has been able to bring his 12-year-old daughter to California after the first executive order stranded them in Djibouti for a week. It is a relief, he said, to be done with the incessant attention from the news media.His daughter, now a citizen, is settling into the sixth grade. Mr. Ali, however, is still on edge over a threat no court can banish.\u201cIt\u2019s started to feel a little bit different \u2014 everybody watching you, everybody looking at you. Something you never had it before, you never feel it before. Racist words,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I take my kids and wife to go shopping, to do this, to do that, I always worry that somebody will stop me on the way.\u201dThe plaintiffs\u2019 faith has been shaken, strengthened and stretched again. So far, the America they know has come out on top.\u201cIn a funny way, even though I\u2019m discouraged about how they\u2019re vilifying Muslims and using the presidential seal of approval to vilify Muslims, the lawsuits and people\u2019s response has made me feel even stronger about this country,\u201d Mr. Hakky, the technology executive, said.\u201cIn any other country, when the president wants something, he gets it,\u201d Mr. Hakky added. \u201cThe fact that a lowly judge somewhere can basically stop the most powerful man on earth with a simple ruling is gratifying, and it shows what this country\u2019s all about.\u201dHis mother-in-law visited recently. Mr. Harrison and his fianc\u00e9 are still awaiting a visa. Ms. Ali video-chats with her son regularly, struggling to explain their separation.Reporting was contributed by Kirk Johnson, Lizette Alvarez, Adeel Hassan and Isma\u2019il Kushkush.Advertisement"}

The 23-year-old Canadian pop singer, whose rise to stardom was driven in large part by support from adoring young fans, is on tour in Australia.The suspect, who has not been identified by name, was already facing charges in Queensland State of possessing material exploiting children, and of using the internet and social media to entrap children under age 16, the police said.He now faces a further 931 criminal charges for offenses including rape, the indecent treatment of children and \u201cmaking child-exploitation material\u201d that the police said stretched back at least a decade.The police raided the home of the suspect after he initially refused to allow access to his social media accounts. Investigators examined his computer, the police said, and found that he was using applications including Facebook and Skype to communicate with his victims and lure them into sending him explicit images.Detective Inspector Jon Rouse, who works on a Queensland Police Service task force devoted to combating the sexual exploitation of children online, described the offenses as \u201cfrankly horrendous.\u201d He said it was imperative that the parents of Bieber fans be vigilant.\u201cThis investigation demonstrates both the vulnerability of children that are utilizing social media and communication applications, and the global reach and skill that child-sex offenders have to groom and seduce victims,\u201d Inspector Rouse said in a statement. \u201cThe fact that so many children could believe that they were communicating with this particular celebrity highlights the need for a serious rethink about the way that we as a society educate our children about online safety.\u201dProsecutors said the man, a retiree living on the outskirts of Copenhagen, had paid for live, online sex shows from the Philippines.But Interpol has attributed a surge in child-related offenses to the internet, because it gives predators easy access to abusive material as well as a means to contact children via chat rooms or social networking sites.\u201cOffenders are able to gain easier access to larger and new populations of children through the use of online forums, email, social networks and other internet-based communication tools,\u201d the study said.The report also found that child abusers can have relatively high education levels, making them more adept at using technology.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saint Mattis\u2019s Forces in Combat Against Harassment", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byIn a photo with today\u2019s story, a former Marine captain named Shawn Wylde, who spent $10,000 taking out targeted Facebook ads asking Marines to help him reveal the identities of those sharing photos, leans on his desk. A poster over his shoulder features Defense Secretary Jim Mattis dressed like a medieval saint, complete with halo, and gripping a knife and a grenade. Underneath it reads: Saint Mattis of Quantico, patron saint of Chaos.The image, created by Mr. Wylde, is so wildly popular that it now hangs unofficially in Marine bases around the world. Mr. Wylde, who owns an online, military-themed T-shirt company, has also sold more than 100,000 shirts featuring the tough-talking Mr. Mattis, who has become a cult figure among Marines.That a defense secretary could have such resonance in the rank-and-file shows that Mr. Mattis is no ordinary secretary. While most recent picks to lead the Pentagon have been policy wonks with Ivy League degrees, Mr. Mattis is a combat-hardened Marine and that most dubious of modern achievements, internet meme.He is revered in the military as a no-nonsense warrior who as a general never shied away from talking about killing. To the enlisted, whose lives are a dizzying array of questionable training exercises and all-day human resources briefings, he is an inspiration.Troops saturate social media with their favorite Mattis quotes \u2014 many of them unprintable in this newspaper. They build shrines to him in the barracks. They even tried to get him to run for president.Marines like to quote \u201cMattisisms,\u201d like one he told Marines invading Iraq: \u201cBe polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.\u201dMarines who served under the general say he is also a scholar with an exceptional grasp of history, who is reluctant to fight, but once engaged will go all-in.\u201cSaint is being modest; he\u2019s a God to us,\u201d Mr. Wylde said. \u201cI\u2019m nervous even talking about General Mattis because I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t do him justice.\u201dAfter the scandal broke, Secretary Mattis condemned the photo sharing as \u201cunacceptable and counter to unit cohesion.\u201d At that moment, Mr. Wylde knew the time was right to strike back at the online groups, which he described as \u201ccreepy misogynists.\u201d\u201cThese groups have been around for a long time, but when anyone would try to report them or criticize them, they would just get shouted down or harassed off the internet,\u201d Mr. Wylde said. \u201cBut Mattis is so loved by Marines, so respected, when he says something everybody listens, even these weird angry groups of Marine veterans.\u201dMr. Wylde created targeted Facebook ads quoting the secretary, aiming for veterans who might have inside information.Mr. Wylde had tried to combat online harassment before, reporting it to the Navy Criminal Investigation Service, but he said that nothing happened. Yet after he sent out what he calls \u201cthe Mattis post,\u201d he received dozens of tips that helped him unmask the online personas of Marines who had avoided detection, he said.He began posting their names, ranks and duty stations. Soon, many of the sites associated with the online groups shut down. So did the personal Facebook pages of the men he exposed online.\u201cThis is really about something broader than just naked pics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what we want the Marine Corps to be.

{"Headline": "Misogyny and Women in Politics", "Date": "2017-03-11", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:I beg to differ with Susan Chira, who posits the notion that the furor over Kellyanne Conway\u2019s couch-lounging posture in the Oval Office was mostly sexist in origin. If Sean Spicer were sprawled on that sofa with his feet propped up on a coffee table, the outcry would be the same.Where is the respect for the most hallowed office in the White House? Where is the respect for the presidents of historically black colleges who were gathered in that room, and the presidency itself?Furthermore, Ms. Conway may well be the victim of sexist comments in other regards, but carping about the clothing of politicians has been a national sport since the days of George Washington, well before there were women in office.Has Ms. Chira missed the double entendres fired at President Trump and his ties or those aimed at Sean Spicer\u2019s tailor?To the Editor:Hillary Clinton and Kellyanne Conway may both be \u201cambitious, assertive women,\u201d but the similarities end there.Mrs. Clinton has devoted her entire life to public service \u2014 as first lady, senator and secretary of state, fighting relentlessly for women\u2019s rights and human rights worldwide. No small accomplishments, considering that she entered the work force in the 1970s, a time when women were often expected to stay home, take care of the kids and bake chocolate chip cookies.Ms. Conway, however hardworking she has proved to be in the past year, has devoted herself to one task \u2014 defending Donald Trump. The attacks against her may be offensively sexist, but they are not rooted in the \u201cpersistent anger toward women who step outside conventional roles.\u201dHer role is as conventional as could be \u2014 that of the loyal assistant protecting her often embarrassing and profligate boss.CATHY BERNARD, NEW YORKTo the Editor:For years, I have decried the irrelevant remarks about appearance that turned up in the media and in casual conversation about powerful women such as Hillary Clinton.After reading your article focusing on this issue with regard to Kellyanne Conway, I realized that despite my efforts to assess our female leaders based on the performance of their duties, I was guilty of maligning Ms. Conway for her looks.Many thanks to Susan Chira for making me aware that I was as guilty as the meanspirited critics who undermined Mrs. Clinton with their comments about her pantsuits.To the Editor:I\u2019m no fan of Kellyanne Conway\u2019s politics, but in the aftermath of the hoopla surrounding the photo of her kneeling on the Oval Office couch, I have to wonder: Would Steve Bannon, also an adviser to the president, have been asked to step back and take a snapshot of a roomful of distinguished men?To the Editor:The White House is not Kellyanne Conway\u2019s home. It is the People\u2019s House, and she is a guest/employee in it. She should understand that it was inappropriate for any adult, male or female, to strike such an informal pose at an Oval Office reception.GAIL MINTHORN, WILTON, CONN.To the Editor:I agree with Susan Chira in her derision of over-the-top misogynistic jabs aimed at powerful women in politics that appear in tweets, Facebook and on comedy programs such as \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d However, it may be worth noting that the three tweets used as examples in the article were written by women.The term \u201cmisogynist\u201d usually connotes a male bias against women. So when the mocking or hateful missiles are thrown by women against women, do we call this misogyny? No, perhaps not. Perhaps it just comes with the territory.After all, we have always heard or seen comical caricatures of male politicians \u2014 jokes about John Boehner\u2019s tan; or cartoons of Barack Obama accentuating his ears; or pratfalls performed as imitations of Gerald Ford. Perhaps we are merely experiencing the rise of women to powerful positions that put them in the limelight. Bravo for them!To the Editor:I\u2019m sorry that our current president expects female White House employees to \u201cdress like women\u201d \u2014 clones of news anchors in their constraining sleeveless shift dresses. I\u2019m sorry that Kellyanne Conway had to contort her body while wearing these binding clothes in order to take photos. I\u2019m sorry that I will not accept an accusation of being sexist for being put off when any ill-mannered person, male or female, puts his or her dirty shoes on the president\u2019s couch.It\u2019s 2017, female White House staffers. If you need to do acrobatics to do your job, be a little bold, and consider wearing trousers to work. I promise it won\u2019t turn you into a Democrat. You just might be able to move and even breathe a bit more comfortably. A little more blood flowing to brains in the White House will always be a fashionable choice.To the Editor:Susan Chira\u2019s article tries the \u201cevenhanded\u201d approach that The New York Times and other media adopted during the 2016 campaign. Yes, Kellyanne Conway has drawn some misogynistic attacks; she has also invited such attacks through behavior (and, yes, appearance) that would be considered flatly unacceptable from a man in her position. Your story also does a disservice to the many other women who have represented administrations \u2014 and for that matter covered news \u2014 in equally charged situations.The criticism of Kellyanne Conway is all about Ms. Conway\u2019s conduct and demeanor. To call her out using misogynistic terms is impolite, impolitic and wrong, but to say that she lies, disrespects the United States and needs to look in the mirror before looking into the camera are all within bounds.So, other than an overdose of political correctness, what justified putting this article on your front page?To the Editor:ANDREA B. HALE, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Why is it that when there is constructive criticism against a woman it is called sexist, or even worse, misogynist. Men get criticized all the time \u2014 by both men and women. If women are going to be successful in these high political jobs, they\u2019ll have to take the \u201cconstructive\u201d criticism.There are women in public life who are not criticized, and it is because they are good at their jobs, but when someone criticizes a Sarah Palin, or a Kellyanne Conway, it is usually justified and it shouldn\u2019t be misconstrued as sexist, or misogynist. Criticism can be constructive \u2014 and that\u2019s not an alternative fact.DOUGLAS CORNISH, OTTAWAAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Selfie With Merkel by Refugee Became a Legal Case, but Facebook Won in German Court", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byW\u00dcRZBURG, Germany \u2014 A Syrian refugee whose image showed up in fake news reports linking him to terrorism lost a closely watched case in Germany on Tuesday that sought to prevent Facebook from allowing users to repost the picture.The case, one of several against Facebook in Germany, was viewed as an important indicator of how the country\u2019s stringent laws on personal privacy will be applied to social media companies. It also raised questions about whether those companies should be treated as data providers, and whether they should follow stricter media laws or even new legislation.The rise of fake news and populist propaganda has prompted broader concerns ahead of German elections in September. A government-led task force, which includes representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter, is looking into how such companies deal with posts deemed hateful.In the case on Tuesday, Judge Volkmar Seipel ruled that there were no grounds for an injunction because Facebook had not in any way manipulated the content, which would have made it legally responsible for the distribution. The judge added that a host provider, according to the European Union\u2019s electronic commerce laws, could be held responsible for eliminating content from its site only when it was considered technically possible.Facebook had argued that it was not possible to search the entire contents of its site. Mr. Modamani\u2019s lawyer disagreed. \u201cThis question was disputed by the parties and could not be clarified in the hearing,\u201d the judge said, suggesting it could be answered in a separate trial if pursued.Mr. Modamani, who lives in Berlin, was not present at Tuesday\u2019s announcement and declined to comment on the ruling. His lawyer, Chan-jo Jun, said that although some of the altered images remained available on Facebook, the attention the trial generated had resulted in a drop in threats against Mr. Modamani since late December.Mr. Jun, however, arrived at the court flanked by two police officers. He said the security detail had been ordered after an anonymous call several weeks earlier in which the person threatened to murder him and cited information that Mr. Jun said only an insider could have known.\u201cWe learned a lot from this case,\u201d Mr. Jun said after the ruling. \u201cPeople have learned that Mr. Modamani is not a terrorist. We lawyers have learned that we cannot help victims of libel and slander with the laws we have. But we have learned which laws have to be changed.\u201dThe post remains in circulation on Facebook, although Mr. Jun said that he had reported it as recently as Monday through the channels the company provides. In response to a request to take down the photograph, Facebook replied that it did not violate user guidelines, the lawyer said.\u201cWe appreciate that this is a very difficult situation for Mr. Modamani,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cRegarding the ruling, we are pleased that the court shares our view that the legal action initiated was not merited or the most effective way to resolve the situation.\u201d\u201cWe quickly disabled access to content that has been accurately reported to us by Mr. Modamani\u2019s legal representatives,\u201d the statement added, \u201cand will continue to respond quickly to valid reports of the content at issue from Mr. Modamani\u2019s legal representatives.\u201dMr. Jun had previously tried to file a separate suit against Facebook for violating a German law that prohibits publication of seditious comments by extremists. A court in Hamburg rejected that suit last year, but a court in Munich is examining it.Mr. Jun said that one goal of the trial was \u201cto find out and demonstrate whether it is possible, under existing laws and Facebook\u2019s approach to compliance, to effectively protect personal privacy.\u201dThe German Constitution guarantees a right to the \u201cfree development of the individual,\u201d which is understood to include the right to personal privacy and to determine the extent to which a person appears in public. Mr. Jun has argued that Facebook is failing to uphold German law, instead adhering only to its own guidelines.The case also demonstrated the complications involved in applying rules in a digital era.Judge Seipel was not clear, at first, of some of the basic social media terminology. He asked for clarification about the difference between \u201cviewing,\u201d or seeing something posted to the platform, and \u201csharing,\u201d when people distribute another person\u2019s content to their own networks, increasing the number of viewers.In Mr. Modamani\u2019s case, such information was crucial, as simply erasing the original version of the disputed image would not ensure that it could no longer be found elsewhere on the platform.Lawyers for Facebook said in February that they did not possess a \u201cwonder machine\u201d capable of recognizing and immediately blocking every reproduction of Mr. Modamani\u2019s image. Mr. Jun rejected that defense as \u201cridiculous.\u201dGermany has been struggling with how to apply laws on personal privacy to social media giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter.On Monday, an administrative court in Bremen handed down a suspended sentence of six months and two weeks to a man who had insulted refugees on his Facebook page. That case concerned the posting of hateful comments on the platform, but it did not involve Facebook itself.The Justice Ministry is expected to announce in the coming weeks its guidelines for dealing with hate speech on social media and for preventing its proliferation. The report comes after more than a year of round-table talks involving the ministry and representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter.Advertisement"}

Coal is still used to generate electricity, Mr. Laiz said, but now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purchased from cheaper overseas sources. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe social fabric of this region is being destroyed, yet they are still using the same fossil fuel from 20 years ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Laiz said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last mines are dinosaurs. They are going to disappear sooner or later.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Laiz grew up in Le\u00c3\u00b3n, a city that itself was shaped by the industry. So, too, was the political climate, as miners were at the forefront of major strikes and confrontations with the police. Those clashes had been covered by many. What attracted Mr. Laiz was the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical importance, which he set out to document with the help of Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Antonio Otero, a journalist who served as a consultant to the project.As recently as 10 years ago, the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s miners enjoyed a privileged position, earning as much as 4,000 euros a month. Mr. Laiz said that for every coal-related job, another 10 jobs were generated in business like restaurants, stores and hotels. Today, monthly salaries have dropped to about 800 euros, and towns that were once abuzz with 20,000 residents have shrunk to a tenth of that.As government policy shifted to favor cheaper overseas sources, the work force shrank. The lucky ones at least had pensions to support them, Mr. Laiz said. But many others were temporary workers who were not entitled to benefits. These developments would have once sparked outraged pushback from labor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCoal generated jobs and a strong way of life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Laiz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe population identified with the left and was very combative. They were the first to strike for their rights with marches that spread across Spain with great popular support. But now we are losing a culture that was a bastion of labor rights, not just for miners but for workers in general.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd so, like workers in other countries that have seen jobs vanish to cheaper corners of the global economy, once-proud residents scramble to stay afloat. Younger people just leave to find work elsewhere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe social and economic fabric has been torn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Laiz. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the north of Spain, the mining towns will become ghost towns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "To the City, a Pollution Fighter. To Some Residents, an Eyesore", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byCamera in hand, Carmine Famiglietti faced off with a crew from the city in front of his house late last year. City workers were on his corner in Flushing, Queens, to construct a bioswale, a pit dug into the sidewalk that is filled with rocky soil and topped by shrubbery, designed to absorb polluted storm water otherwise running into the sewer system, some eventually seeping into waterways like Flushing Creek. The bioswales, or rain gardens, are part of the city\u2019s effort to take pressure off an aging sewer system that can be easily overwhelmed by the more frequent storms rolling in as a result of climate change.Mr. Famiglietti stared down the workers until they left.On Facebook, where he documented the standoff, friends celebrated his victory \u2014 temporary though it may prove to be \u2014 as a David squaring off against a governmental Goliath. But others had a different view. \u201cProtesting a project that makes the water cleaner?\u201d one friend wrote. \u201cBecause the water around your neighborhood is already too clean for anybody\u2019s good?\u201d Mr. Famiglietti did not respond to a message left at his place of business.The opposition comes at a time when efforts to build the resilience of cities in the face of climate change is an urgent and international undertaking. And it underscores a perennial tension that has ensnared similarly ambitious environmental efforts, where wind farms, erosion-blocking dunes and solar energy arrays are viewed as unsightly. In corners of Queens and streets of Brooklyn, the same not-in-my-backyard response has found resonance with those who prefer their waterfront views \u2014 and even sidewalks \u2014 just the way they were.\u201cNew Yorkers often object to changes in their neighborhoods,\u201d Mr. Goldstein added. \u201cBut rebelling against the city paying to green up local streets, is really something else.\u201dThe city has dug the bioswales into the sidewalks since 2012, part of a $1.5 billion investment in a variety of types of so-called green infrastructure, of which $258 million has been spent in the five years since the program began. They are mostly placed in areas in which storm water drains into polluted waterways, such as coastal Brooklyn and Queens. Some of the bioswales, which cost about $26,000 apiece to build, might be put in parts of Manhattan.The city\u2019s network of sewers is what is known as a combined system, meaning that when it storms, rainfall mixes with raw sewage water flowing from homes and buildings. Too much rain, and this swill overflows, pouring out, untreated, into local waterways.But a small but steady outcry has mounted in the communities where bioswales have been placed.On a rainy day in March, Jeanette Romano stood beside the bioswale that was installed last year in front of her house in Maspeth near Newtown Creek. Brown water filled the 20-foot long pit, as did cigarette butts, bottle caps and a single, dank sock. \u201cIt\u2019s a garbage collector. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s a sloppy, sloppy look,\u201d said Ms. Romano, 70, who has battled the bioswale, spending $2,600 on repairing what she says was poorly laid concrete after the pit was dug, and going on something of a publicity tour against them in the local newspapers.Complaints run from the aesthetic to the practical \u2014 and for each complaint, the city has an answer.In a storm, the bioswale fills with water that slowly seeps away; residents say they are swampy mud pits and ripe mosquito breeding grounds. (They drain in 48 hours, according to the environmental department.) It is unclear if street parking is permitted alongside a bioswale. (It is, the city says.) Some residents say that trash eddies in infrequently maintained plots. (The environmental department says it is in the process of hiring more than two dozen more workers specifically for maintenance patrol.)The bioswale\u2019s aim of preventing runoff from polluting waterways does not move Ms. Romano. \u201cSo what happened when we were kids and it used to go in the East River and the Hudson?\u201d she said, referring to pollutants. \u201cI\u2019m still here and I\u2019m 70 years old. Is it fair that I have to get stuck with something?\u201dTony Avella, a Democratic state senator who represents parts of Queens has taken up the anti-bioswale cause, holding several rallies against them over the past year. Mr. Avella criticized how the bioswales have been put into effect and the lack of input sought by the city sought from community groups. With the last point, environmental officials conceded they could have done better.\u201cI understand the logic,\u201d Mr. Avella said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that anytime you think you have a good idea, you have the right to roll over everybody and do it. This is a democracy, not a dictatorship.\u201dThe City of Philadelphia has put in over 400 bioswales since 2011 and has received similar community response. More than 250 are in the works for the future.Many more bioswales are still coming to the city, but the confrontation has led to some changes, said Eric Landau, the deputy commissioner for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Residents can now choose between options of swales that look like patches of lawn grass, or even ones hidden under permeable concrete. The rancor and resistance \u201cwas something that we hadn\u2019t yet experienced,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it created an opportunity to refine the program.\u201dAnd despite the standoff in Flushing, a bioswale may still come to Mr. Famiglietti\u2019s street, according to the department.

{"Headline": "How a Facebook Executive Revived a Fading Surf Brand", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipSo says Matt Jacobson, who grew up surfing with his father in Manhattan Beach, Calif., and wearing the hand-sewn board shorts all summer long.As an adult with deep pockets \u2014 he was one of the first employees at Facebook, where he now heads the marketing development \u2014 Mr. Jacobson, 56, decided many years ago that he wanted to buy Birdwell. His goals were to protect the legacy of the brand, which is more than 55 years old, and to ensure that the company stayed in Southern California and continued to make shorts the way it always has, with a human touch.\u201cThere are few brands with Birdwell\u2019s legacy, reputation and customer loyalty that haven\u2019t been licensed or screwed up in some way,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why they were so interesting to me.\u201dIn 2014, he finally bought the company from its reluctant owners \u2014 the Birdwell family, whose enthusiasm for the business had flagged \u2014 and sold equity shares to friends who now run the company and have been turning it around.\u201cWe always loved the brand and the products, and we made attempts to buy it over the years,\u201d Mr. Drexler said. \u201cBut then Matt was able to buy it, so he won and we won.\u201dIn addition to men\u2019s and women\u2019s shorts for surfing and walking, Birdwell sells shirts, bags, hats, jackets and towels \u2014 all with a vintage beachy vibe, of course.Mr. Drexler said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big business for us, relatively speaking, but it\u2019s important to our customers and it sells out every year.\u201dOver the years, Birdwell\u2019s shorts acquired a cultish following, especially among surfers. A pair can last for generations, and customers often send in photos of their father\u2019s or grandfather\u2019s board shorts, still going strong.Yet over time the Birdwell family lost interest in maximizing their brand\u2019s potential. Production peaked in the 1970s.By the time Mr. Jacobson acquired it, the company had one facility running four days a week during the busy season and one day a week during low-demand periods. Birdwell barely had a digital presence and rarely changed product designs or selection.Another friend of Mr. Jacobson\u2019s, Geoff Clawson, left Facebook to become Birdwell\u2019s chief executive in 2016.The new owners have brought an industrial revolution to Birdwell. Their first priority was to move from wholesale to direct-to-consumer sales and build a web presence that would be the primary point of interaction with customers. The company now has Instagram and Facebook accounts.Next, they redesigned the production space with the tenets of lean manufacturing in mind. Birdwell\u2019s shorts used to be sewn one at a time, by one worker, but now employees cycle through several different operations each day, depending on what\u2019s needed.\u201cLean manufacturing and management informs my thinking every day, removing waste from processes and making everything more efficient,\u201d Mr. Clawson said. \u201cWe literally rearranged the way employees physically work, putting them in closer proximity to their task.\u201cThat shaves seconds off the production time, which results in more shorts being produced.\u201dThe company\u2019s recently renovated, 10,000-square-foot facility is bright and clean, with rows of sewing machines in the center and large cutting tables attached to the side walls. The back wall is a kaleidoscope of color, with rolls of brightly colored fabrics stacked tightly together.Mr. Clawson\u2019s ideas about efficiency come from his 20-year career in software development. Board shorts and software might seem quite unrelated, but Mr. Clawson says they aren\u2019t.\u201cPeople get into this flow state \u2014 here it\u2019s a sewing flow state \u2014 where they start producing at a certain speed and you don\u2019t want to say, \u2018O.K., stop doing that and now start doing this instead,\u2019\u201d Mr. Clawson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s very much akin to software development. Engineers often talk about being \u2018plugged in,\u2019 and that means when you see an engineer with headphones on, it\u2019s not the time to ask them where they want to go to lunch, because they are focused on solving a problem.\u201dTheir problems, Mr. Clawson continued, just happen to be intellectual, virtual problems, \u201cwhereas at Birdwell, ours are usually a physical problem.\u201dMichael Lynton, the chairman of Snap Inc. and former chief executive of Sony Entertainment, is one of Birdwell\u2019s longtime customers and now an investor. \u201cI think what they\u2019ve done very cleverly is stay true to what the brand always was,\u201d he said in an interview.\u201cWhen you order online now, it\u2019s still delivered in the same Birdwell box, same as the times when I would call up one of the sisters and buy it over the phone,\u201d Mr. Lynton said. \u201cIt\u2019s more efficient now, but, oddly enough, retains the same feel for me it had many years ago.\u201dAs Birdwell\u2019s new owners strive to retain that old-school feel while maintaining growth, they are also confronting the tension that exists today between \u201cfast fashion\u201d \u2014 trendy and seasonal clothes that move from runway to retail quickly \u2014 and what Birdwell does, which is small-batch production of classic clothing that is not tied to a particular season. It is made to be worn whenever it is bought, Mr. Clawson said, but consumers are used to being led into the new season, seeing spring clothing in February and winter clothing in July. That\u2019s not how Birdwell operates, he said. \u201cWe have more of an endless summer vibe.\u201dAs for Mr. Jacobson, he still lives in Manhattan Beach and still surfs. And his memories of summers with his father wearing Birdwell shorts are still vivid.\u201cWe got one pair each summer and that was it,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cLike a fireman\u2019s overalls, we\u2019d drop them beside the bed at night and pull them on first thing in the morning. They were indestructible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Day Without a Woman\u2019 Protest Tests a Movement\u2019s Staying Power", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byOnce again in the young presidency of Donald J. Trump, women rallied against his administration on Wednesday, this time by skipping work, wearing red and refusing to spend money. But the protests were far smaller than the masses who turned the women\u2019s marches on Jan. 21 into a phenomenon, keeping the question open of whether protesters\u2019 fervor can be channeled into a sustained movement with demonstrable political results.In New York City, hundreds of people jammed into a Midtown block, and the Women\u2019s March on Washington said 10 of its organizers were arrested there for blocking traffic. The municipal court in Providence, R.I., shut down because seven of the clerks and a deputy court administrator stayed home from work. Schools in Alexandria, Va.; Chapel Hill-Carrboro, N.C.; and Prince George\u2019s County, Md., closed for the day because so many teachers stayed home.The strike was held on International Women\u2019s Day, and President Trump weighed in early with a restrained statement, writing a message of respect on Twitter for women and the role they play in the economy.On International Women's Day, join me in honoring the critical role of women here in America & around the world.It was always unlikely that a general strike, labeled \u201cA Day Without a Woman,\u201d would produce the same turnout as the post-inauguration marches. The strike lacked the marches\u2019 momentum coming off the election, as well as their virality and visuals, like the photogenic pink \u201cpussy hats\u201d that many attendees wore. It is also hard to tally participation or impact because employers could not provide counts of how many women stayed home, and retail figures are not yet available to show whether women stopped spending money.Some questioned the decision to call a strike at all. \u201cIn order to work, a general strike has to actually stop something from functioning,\u201d said Todd Gitlin, a former president of Students for a Democratic Society who has written about political movements. \u201cAnywhere it hasn\u2019t done that can\u2019t be counted as a success. It plays to your inner audience, not your outer audience.\u201dThe strike\u2019s leaders tried to manage expectations from the start. \u201cThe object for us isn\u2019t that we hope to shut the whole economy down,\u201d said Linda Sarsour, a co-chairwoman of the event who was arrested. \u201cWe see this as an opportunity to introduce women to different tactics of activism. Our goal is not to have the same numbers as the march.\u201dCritics have charged that the call for a strike reinforces one of the central tensions of this next wave of women\u2019s activism: the gap between white, privileged women and minority, lower-paid women, who may not be able to afford a day off from work and could lose their jobs. Ms. Sarsour said that was why organizers deliberately offered a menu of ways to participate if women could not strike.Janna Pea, a spokeswoman for the Women\u2019s March, said that as of Tuesday, more than 30,000 people had registered their intent to participate, most of them in the blue states of New York and California.One-day mass protests are valuable displays of political muscle and hard for politicians to ignore. Ultimately, Mr. Gitlin said, protesters must be wooed into the harder, more dogged work of continuous organizing and political participation that changes policies or wins elections.There is some anecdotal evidence that this is beginning to take place. Ms. Sarsour said the march had produced an instant national database that is being used to match first-time protesters with organizational tools for activism.Women, deployed by Planned Parenthood and other groups, were at the forefront of recent town hall meetings, confronting members of Congress about plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.More than 5,000 small-group meetings were held across the country last month, at the urging of the women\u2019s march organizers, to form networks to push for political change in local communities. A national call-in convened by a similar network of women\u2019s groups to encourage protests about health care drew 58,000 people in mid-February.And many women are joining forces with a bevy of groups that have sprung up since the election to foster activism with technological tools, such as Indivisible, which provides a template for influencing members of Congress; SwingLeft, which identifies nearby swing districts and offers opportunities to volunteer; and countless more.Many women marked the day in personal ways. Kellee Stemac, in the conservative city of Plano, Tex., said she had misgivings about asking women to strike, so she planned to wear red and spend money only at women-owned businesses.A few dozen red-clad demonstrators turned out at a downtown plaza in Lafayette, Ind. Gloria Goings, 63, a retired nurse and first-time protester, said she had come because of \u201cthe injustice that women deal with \u2014 like jobs, everyday life.\u201dThe same was true in Phoenix. Kristy King, who helped organize the January march, said that the strike was a welcome show of solidarity, but that low-income women might not have been able to attend. \u201cI could think of better ways of spending my time,\u201d she said a few hours after she decided to join Wednesday\u2019s protest at the Arizona State Capitol.In Denver, Theresa Newsom, a teacher, said she had driven 90 minutes from Colorado Springs for her first political march, noting proudly that she had a male substitute in her classroom.In Silicon Valley, where women have often battled hostile workplaces, many companies were eager to demonstrate their support. Uber, which has been weathering a storm caused by a female engineer\u2019s complaint about sexual harassment, sent a memo to employees last week saying they were welcome to participate in the strike, said MoMo Zhou, a spokeswoman for the company. Because Uber offers unlimited vacation time, no one will be docked pay.Facebook \u2014 where Teresa Shook, a lawyer in Hawaii, first posted the idea of a march on Washington \u2014 is marking International Women\u2019s Day with a 24-hour live feed of events.Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the advertising agency 360i, said that hundreds of the company\u2019s 600 New York employees were participating in some way. Jezebel, a news site aimed at women, was run on Wednesday by men.International Women\u2019s Day was also observed around the world. Women in Tbilisi, Georgia, demonstrated under a symbolic \u201cglass ceiling\u201d to illustrate limitations on women\u2019s advancement. Tens of thousands of Polish women held protests. In India, where a toilet is still an aspiration for many women, Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over a celebration of women who had worked hard to secure this basic item for their families.But not everyone had the option to protest. Jo Sorrentino, a 28-year-old arborist from Oakland, Calif., posted on Facebook that she would have lost a day\u2019s pay. On an hourly wage of $21.50, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t afford it.\u201dAn earlier version of a photo caption accompanying this article misstated a message printed on scarves.

But that culture of debate and tolerance has been increasingly attacked by Hindu nationalists since the 2014 election of their standard-bearer Narendra Modi as prime minister, with several particularly disturbing incidents last month.The organizers of the seminar agreed to drop Mr. Khalid as a speaker. Nonetheless, the mob charged the auditorium, hurling rocks, breaking windows, and cutting off electricity. Scores of professors and students were trapped as the bricks and stones rained and as the police, which reports to Mr. Modi\u2019s government, stood by watching. The seminar was called off.Nationalism is majoritarian in character. Since majoritarian sentiment isn\u2019t natural but political, it needs to be manufactured. A nationalist party in power has to take over the cultural sphere, especially the universities, which are regarded as safe havens for intellectual rigor and questioning. India\u2019s universities and colleges have long been dominated by left and liberal ideas. The Hindu nationalists are attempting a hostile takeover.The day after the canceled seminar at Delhi University, students and teachers conducted a silent march to protest this attack on free speech. Marchers were seriously hurt when nationalists attacked them. The Delhi police, which report to Mr. Modi\u2019s federal government, played spectator.In a Facebook post from the hospital, Mr. Chakravarty described the political situation as a \u201cperfect fascist moment.\u201d The \u201cright is in ascendancy today,\u201d he added, it had done \u201cthis painstaking job of hate-mongering effectively.\u201dThe great gift of the university is that it enables students to question laws and social norms that victimize the underprivileged castes, religious and sexual minorities, migrants, workers and women. It is at the universities that students are encouraged to push for rights and justice within the framework of democracy.Anyone expressing ideas unacceptable to India\u2019s new militant nationalism faces an inquisition. This movement leaves no space for an intellectual culture to thrive, where ideas can prosper. When patriotic sentiments become allergic to criticism, nationalism poses a danger to democracy.A nationalism that responds to arguments with threats alone is an enemy of culture. In such times, critical thinking is an activity not only to restore culture, but also to keep alive the promise of the future, of what Jacques Derrida called a \u201cdemocracy to come.\u201dManash Firaq Bhattacharjee teaches poetry at Ambedkar University in New Delhi.Advertisement"}

While the two projects are separate, high-speed trains are expected to use Caltrain tracks in the Bay Area. California Republicans have tried everything to disrupt the high-speed rail project, but this move is particularly damaging.By any measure, Caltrain is the equivalent of a dated personal computer running Windows 95 way overdue for an upgrade. Rush-hour trains are so crowded that their aisles are filled with passengers. Trains break down frequently and the locomotives belch plumes of black smoke into the air \u2014 a sight more in line with the early industrial age than 21st century Silicon Valley.During the campaign Mr. Trump and supporters like Peter Thiel, the Bay Area venture capitalist, argued that he was the only candidate who could rebuild America.

{"Headline": "Inquiry Opens Into How a Network of Marines Shared Illicit Images of Female Peers", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported bySome photographs show female Marines posing topless in their dress uniform slacks, or with their camouflage blouses open, in pictures they thought would forever be secret. Others show private moments swiped from their personal social media sites.In one photograph, surreptitiously taken in February, a female corporal from Camp Lejeune, in North Carolina, is shown bent over from behind. The image, once posted online, was flooded with derogatory comments, including suggestions that she should be raped.Now the Defense Department has opened a criminal investigation and the Marine Corps is facing its latest unwanted controversy after it was revealed over the weekend that a secret online Facebook group of active-duty and veteran Marines shared thousands of naked and private photos of Marine Corps women.The invitation-only group, called Marines United and made up of more than 30,000 active duty Marines and veterans, built online dossiers on Marine women without their knowledge or consent, listing dozens of women\u2019s names, ranks, social media handles and where they are stationed.The Marine Corps quickly condemned the all-male group, saying in a statement on Sunday that Marines United\u2019s conduct \u201cdestroys morale, erodes trust and degrades the individual.\u201d The Naval Criminal Investigation service has opened an investigation, and the Marine Corps said that any Marine who \u201cdirectly participates in, encourages or condones\u201d illicit activity could face court-martial. The Marine Corps declined to say how many Marines were being investigated.One of the victims of the group was Marisa Woytek, a Marine lance corporal serving at Camp Pendleton, who had photos taken from her Instagram account and posted to the group. She was alerted by friends and sent a screen shot.\u201cThey were nothing scandalous, just me saying good morning,\u201d Corporal Woytek said in an interview. \u201cBut the comments went just as far toward sexual assault and rape and degrading as your imagination can go.\u201d\u201cI love the Marine Corps,\u201d she added. \u201cBut after seeing that, I wouldn\u2019t re-enlist.\u201dSeveral Marines said the Marines United postings are an evolution of a retaliatory practice called \u201cmake her famous.\u201d Marines would share nude photographs of girlfriends or spouses they believed were cheating through text messages to a broad swath of people, encouraging them to forward the photos.Jason Elsdon, a Marine in his early 40s, who said he was a member of Marines United and said he played no role in posting, organizing or disseminating the photographs, argued that people were overreacting. \u201cIt was just nudes,\u201d he said. \u201cI scrolled past it.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s right, but I don\u2019t feel that people should be utterly surprised that it is happening. There are other groups, and many are civilians, that are the same way.\u201dHe defended the larger mission of the group and the web page, which is a grab bag of military news and humor, saying it provided needed support. He cited instances in which servicemen were contemplating suicide and the page would \u201clight up\u201d with people who wanted to help.But many Marines have pushed back against the idea that crude behavior is intrinsic to their identity.\u201cThat is absolute nonsense,\u201d said Maj. Clark Carpenter, a Marine Corps spokesman. \u201cA true warrior carries himself with a sense of decency and compassion, but is always ready for the fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who hide in the dark corners of the internet with a shield of anonymity and purport to be warriors are nothing of the sort \u2014 they are nothing more than cowards.\u201dStill, the Marine Corps leadership has never fully rid the Corps of its rough ethos, and in recent years it has been hit with a number of scandals when this mentality broke into the open, including allegations that commanders retaliated against women who reported sexual assaults and recent reports that drill instructors hazed recruits, especially Muslims.The Marine Corps is also the military branch that has put up the stiffest resistance to opening combat jobs to women, with several high-ranking Marines saying the move could hurt combat effectiveness. A small group of women joined combat units in January.Women in the Marine Corps say the culture has been hostile to them for years.\u201cWhen I was in Iraq, I always carried a can of black spray paint to cover up what was written about me in the port-a-johns,\u201d said Kate Hendricks Thomas, a Marine veteran who is now a professor of behavioral health at Charleston Southern University. \u201cI tried to laugh it off, but the harassment is so pervasive that it can have a real effect.\u201dMarines United collected thousands of photos that appeared to be a mix of private photos shared by former partners and images taken from personal accounts. Some were photos of women clothed, and others in various states of undress, in civilian and military clothing, and often accompanied by a blizzard of lewd comments.In September, a Marine veteran named John Albert was invited to join the site, and, disgusted by what he found, alerted Facebook.\u201cI have tons of friends who got killed in Afghanistan and have died since they came home. These types of actions dishonor their names and the entire Marine Corps,\u201d Mr. Albert said in an interview.Facebook took down the page temporarily for violating a ban on nudity after the complaint, Mr. Albert said, but the group apparently got around restrictions on nudity by shifting photos to a shared Google file.Marine Corps officials, alerted to the site by Mr. Brennan, contacted Google and had the files removed.Since publishing the story, Mr. Brennan said he and his family had received death threats from members of the group. He charged that one member was offering \u201c500 bucks for nudes\u201d of Mr. Brennan\u2019s wife and said he was \u201ccooperating with multiple law enforcement agencies\u201d regarding threats to him and his family.\u201cI\u2019m no angel. I have deployed just like these Marines. I\u2019ve sat around a fire in Afghanistan and shared that dark, dark Marine humor. In ways, that humor has healing properties. But this is different. It has gone too far,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hurting other Marines.\u201dJulie Turkewitz contributed reporting from Denver, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Internet Is Saving Culture, Not Killing It", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne secret to longevity as a pundit is to issue predictions that can\u2019t be easily checked. So here\u2019s one for the time capsule: Two hundred years from now, give or take, the robot-people of Earth will look back on the early years of the 21st century as the beginning of a remarkable renaissance in art and culture.That may sound unlikely to many of us in the present. In the past few decades, we\u2019ve seen how technology has threatened the old order in cultural businesses, including the decimation of the music industry, the death of the cable subscription, the annihilation of newspapers and the laying to waste of independent bookstores.But things are turning around; for people of the future, our time may be remembered as a period not of death, but of rejuvenation and rebirth.Part of the story is in the art itself. In just about every cultural medium, whether movies or music or books or the visual arts, digital technology is letting in new voices, creating new formats for exploration, and allowing fans and other creators to participate in a glorious remixing of the work. This isn\u2019t new; from blogs to podcasts to YouTube, the last 20 years have been marked by a succession of formats that have led to ever-lower barriers for new and off-the-wall creators.But now something surprising has happened.In the last few years, and with greater intensity in the last 12 months, people started paying for online content. They are doing so at an accelerating pace, and on a dependable, recurring schedule, often through subscriptions. And they\u2019re paying for everything.You\u2019ve already heard about the rise of subscription-based media platforms \u2014 things like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify and Apple Music. But people are also paying for smaller-audience and less-mainstream-friendly content. They are subscribing to podcasters, comedians, zany YouTube stars, novelists and comic book artists. They are even paying for news.It\u2019s difficult to overstate how big a deal this is. More than 20 years after it first caught mainstream attention and began to destroy everything about how we finance culture, the digital economy is finally beginning to coalesce around a sustainable way of supporting content. If subscriptions keep taking off, it won\u2019t just mean that some of your favorite creators will survive the internet. It could also make for a profound shift in the way we find and support new cultural talent. It could lead to a wider variety of artists and art, and forge closer connections between the people who make art and those who enjoy it.\u201cWhat we want to do is change the entire financing mechanism that drives the production of content online,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cWe want to change how things are paid for and how the web runs. For us, it\u2019s a very, very big problem.\u201d\u201cI do think something has changed culturally,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cThis new generation is more concerned with social impact. There\u2019s a desire to vote with your dollars and your time and attention.\u201dSome of that is happening in the news business, too. The New York Times and many other newspapers reported a surge in subscriptions after Donald J. Trump won the presidency last year.Huge content platforms have been criticized for the way they treat artists. Even if lots of people are paying for services like Spotify, critics say that it can be difficult for musicians, especially smaller and less-well-known ones, to make a sustainable living from the platform.Yet many artists are finding ways around these difficulties. Thanks to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, artists can now establish close relationships with their fans. They can sell merchandise and offer special fan-only promotions and content. And after finding an audience, they can use sites like Patreon to get a dependable paycheck from their most loyal followers.This sort of alternative arrangement isn\u2019t easy to pursue; it can take time, effort and skills in unusual dark arts (such as how social-media marketing works). But there are signs it is catching on: At the Grammys last year, the award for best new artist went to Chance the Rapper, who has famously, proudly rejected every offer to sign with a record label and even to sell any of his music.If there are difficulties in navigating the modern cultural business, there are upsides, too.\u201cI don\u2019t have to go out on the road and play in bars,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be a father and I can be a husband. This normalizes my career. It normalizes the career of being an artist, which has never been normalized.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oculus Cuts Prices of Its Virtual Reality Gear", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Many obstacles stand between virtual reality and a mass audience, from a lack of great games to the ungainly tangle of cables that connect the 3-D headsets to the computers that power them.On Wednesday, Oculus announced that it has dropped the price of a package featuring its Rift headset and Touch controllers, which allow players to use their hands inside virtual reality, by 25 percent to $598 from $798. Oculus will also reduce the individual price of the Rift to $499 from $599 and Touch controllers to $99 from $199.In a phone interview, Brendan Iribe, the leader of the Oculus group developing virtual reality products for personal computers, said the company had long intended to reduce prices on products as Oculus\u2019s own manufacturing costs came down. Such cost reductions are common for game hardware as manufacturers reduce defects on assembly lines and volume discounts for parts kick in.Mr. Iribe, who declined to give sales figures for Oculus Rift, said that so far the system had been purchased by early adopters and that making it less expensive would begin the process of taking it beyond an enthusiast audience. \u201cWe certainly think this will help,\u201d said Mr. Iribe, a co-founder of Oculus before it was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion.Oculus is still far from the price levels that most consumers are willing to stomach. The Rift requires a powerful PC to run virtual reality games, which costs hundreds of dollars, bringing the total price for Oculus products and a computer to over $1,000, even after the price cuts.Oculus has less control over when a breakout virtual reality game will emerge that catapults its product to a wider audience. Many game developers have held back their investments in new virtual reality games because, with so few systems in use, their prospects for making money are low.Mr. Rubin said that he could not predict whether this year\u2019s lineup of virtual reality games would include the parallel of World of Warcraft or Grand Theft Auto, both huge hits for PCs and consoles, but he said that \u201cwith every new release, and with every new discovery, VR gets closer to finding its killer app.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It elated Wall Street institutions eager for a prominent initial public offering when few had surfaced for months.The company has entranced investors despite a litany of red flags, like enormous losses that are expected to persist for years, a slowdown in its once-vaunted user growth rates, and an ownership structure that gives Snapchat\u2019s founders control for decades to come.Some analysts have already shown skepticism about the newest publicly traded tech giant. One, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, says the share price should be $10, far below the company\u2019s offering price of $17, which itself was above the initial range predicted. Snap faces competition from larger companies and the challenge of a slow-growing user base, he said.Boosters of Snap\u2019s prospects argue instead that Snap has the potential to become less like Twitter and more like its biggest rival, the $395 billion Facebook. These supporters point to some of the company\u2019s obvious strengths: the 158 million people on average who used Snapchat each day by the end of 2016; the roughly 18 times a day that those users opened the app on average; the $404 million in sales that it collected last year, up from nothing three years ago.For now, investors appeared to focus on the positive. Snap raised $3.4 billion in its market debut, the most by an American tech company since Facebook\u2019s initial offering in 2012, according to data from Renaissance Capital. It was the first significant tech stock sale since at least December. And the 44 percent pop in its stock price was the biggest enjoyed by a company of a billion-dollar I.P.O. since Twitter\u2019s debut in 2013. More than 217 million shares traded on Thursday, as some investors bought and others cashed in, exceeding the number of shares Snap sold in the I.P.O.For investors in other still-private unicorns \u2014 a term for start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 the immense success of Snap\u2019s deal highlights the appetite for a tech darling, even if the company still bleeds money. Count Uber, Spotify and Airbnb within that group.\u201cThe sound you\u2019re hearing today after the Snap I.P.O. is the happy snapping of fingers of money-losing unicorns and their investors,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. \u201cIt looks like Snap has set the path to monetization.\u201dIn countless meetings during a two-week roadshow with investors, Snap executives sought to rebut some of the biggest concerns about the company\u2019s prospects. Slowing growth toward the end of last year stemmed from problems with the service\u2019s Android app. Competition from Facebook, which openly copied some of Snapchat\u2019s signature features at Instagram, would do little to dent user enthusiasm.Unlike newly public companies that seek to celebrate their first day of trading on the stock markets, Snap kept its festivities largely confined to the New York Stock Exchange.

I didn\u2019t want to be considered a risk.\u201d (Both of them approved my writing this here.)So in our time of radical disclosure, how should patients evaluate the risks and benefits of sharing medical information?\u201cWith something like H.I.V., there are very clear issues about cultural reactions and risk of infection,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something like organ transplants are the opposite. If you need a kidney transplant, trust me, everyone will have to know. Finding a match is nearly impossible.\u201dWith these qualifications, Dr. Wicks comes down strongly in favor of disclosure. His reason: You never know where you can learn something that might save your life.As a researcher, he said, \u201cI used to give patients nuggets of wisdom.\u201d But he added, \u201cI can\u2019t meet every patient.\u201dWhen patients seek out others with similar illnesses, their knowledge grows exponentially. \u201cIt\u2019s more scalable, less serendipitous,\u201d he said.Even my mother, when she broke down and divulged her operation to a friend, who happened to have the same condition, radically changed her course of treatment.Dr. Wicks\u2019s research shows that patients who participate in peer groups have learned tips about drug sequencing or little-known specialists that proved critical to their care.\u201cThe value of a tweet-length piece of information can be the difference between life and death,\u201d he said.\u201cThe first thing people get on social media is emotional support,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it quickly shifts to medical information as the patients go onto specialized websites and become more expert in treatments, scientific trials and so on.\u201dMost people are comfortable sharing their names in disease-specific forums, she said, even if those forums are on Facebook, where membership in such a group can be visible to their friends. The information in these discussions is so valuable that if you still prefer anonymity, you should join under a pseudonym.Dr. Wicks called this lurking. \u201cThe ratio of people who contribute to Wikipedia versus people who use Wikipedia is quite tiny,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can just lurk in these forums and still get much of the benefit.\u201d\u201cIf anything, young people are likely to overshare,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been living your life in public all these years, and suddenly you have this thing you may not want to talk about. Yet posting about that scoop of ice cream you just had feels dumb. There\u2019s a lot of pressure.\u201d\u201cOnce you put things on Facebook or Twitter, it\u2019s out there forever,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may want to share things now, but sometime down the road, are you going to want those pictures of you with your scars in public?\u201dIn her case, she wanted those things out there at the time of her treatment, she said, but as she moves further away from it, she has changed her mind.From that day forward, I appointed a chief information officer \u2014 in my case, my brother \u2014 whose job it was to keep everyone informed.While designating such a figure can be helpful, Ms. Adams said, today it\u2019s not sufficient. Patients have to set clear parameters about what that person is allowed to say, share or post in public.\u201cI don\u2019t think you should have any hesitation in telling that person: \u2018Hey, can you please take that photo down? I\u2019m not ready to go public about that aspect of my condition.\u2019\u201d Her one firm rule: \u201cDon\u2019t let people post pictures of you in the operating room.\u201d\u201cWhen you open up about your condition, you don\u2019t just receive information,\u201d Dr. Wicks said, \u201cyou also start sharing your own information with others. You get to be the helper sometimes, and helping people makes you feel really good.\u201d`Ultimately, what I had thought of as a black-and-white decision \u2014 tell or don\u2019t tell \u2014 is now much more nuanced: tell or don\u2019t tell; tell, but not too much; or don\u2019t tell but stalk the web for tips among people who do tell. In other words, the best professional advice on this issue is almost exactly the same as the best professional advice on other medical matters: Whatever you do, do it in moderation.An article last Sunday about whether to share your health updates on social media misidentified the profession of Paul Wicks, who works with an online patients network, and quoted incorrectly from his comments about his work. He is a neuropsychologist, not a neuroscientist, and he did not refer to himself as \u201ca doctor.\u201dBruce Feiler\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe First Love Story: Adam, Eve and Us,\u201d will be published this month.

{"Headline": "Let a Robot Be Your Museum Tour Guide", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byMEAUX, France \u2014 Near the edge of a parapet of stacked sandbags, a test robot rumbles, offering visitors hundreds of miles away a bleak view of military life in World War I trenches.\u201cThe idea is not to replace humans with robots, but to reach people and distant visitors, thanks to technology,\u201d said El\u00e9na Le Gall, a community manager for the World War I museum, which opened in 2011 in a vast, three-story building in this town about 30 miles east of Paris.For the last three years, a consortium of six French companies has been developing the robot, which now looks more like an industrial vacuum cleaner topped by a screen and equipped with three computers, a camera and a microphone. A human guide always trails at its side to offer running commentary while visitors direct its path. Laser technology brings it to a halt when obstacles loom.The eventual goal is to use mass production to bring down the price of the robots to about 2,000 euros, or around $2,100, from about 20,000 euros, or approximately $21,300, according to Didier Sansier, the manager of Another World, a French technology company and one of the partners in the French project. \u201cIt\u2019s the future, but it doesn\u2019t replace the emotions of a visit,\u201d said Mr. Sansier, as he stalked a test robot by a trench to the piped music of French soldiers singing \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201dMuseums have been experimenting with robots since the 1990s, but it is only in the last five years that new companies have produced telepresence robots that can be exploited as guides or electronic showmen to attract visitors \u2014 especially during hours when the institutions are closed or underused.Caroline Boutin, a spokeswoman for the Canada Science and Technology museum, said that while its building was closed for an $80.5 million renovation project, it was testing the French robot and exploring a pilot project that would coincide with the reopening of the museum next fall.\u201cA robot roaming the museum\u2019s gallery becomes an exhibit in itself \u2014 evoking people\u2019s curiosity and sparking the imagination,\u201d she said, adding that roving robots could also link schools with experts, such as scientists who \u201ccould remotely lead a group through a tour of important scientific discoveries.\u201dThe French World War I museum \u2014 created with a private collection amassed over 40 years \u2014 is constantly seeking inventive strategies to attract international tourists from the country\u2019s core museum hub, Paris. Although it is about a half-hour by train from the French capital, the museum has to work hard to attract about 100,000 visitors a year to an area where two major battles of the Marne took place in 1914 and 1918.Since it opened in 2011, the museum has published a book designed to read like Facebook postings from the front, with comments from a young French soldier, whose clipped words are paired with historical photographs of life in the trenches and grim portraits of dead men. This year it is organizing conferences and an exhibition about Americans\u2019 experiences in the war, including those of Alabama soldiers who were part of the 167th Infantry Regiment of the Rainbow Division. It is also the first French museum to offer guided hourlong web visits for school groups, with human guides who offer programs in French and English.The robot is yet another tool to reach people, Ms. Le Gall said. In December, the museum, while it was closed, tested the device with a group of handicapped students about 350 miles away, in Brittany. The feedback was that they liked manipulating the robot, but still missed the opportunity to touch exhibits that the museum allows to be handled.More testing is underway. \u201cWe are in a period of experimentation and exploration, and it\u2019s important to be connected to our world,\u201d Ms. Le Gall said. \u201cFor a museum of our size, we have to offer something innovative.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What\u2019s essential is in the eye of the beholder, and the deciders here are overwhelmingly men. They\u2019re not at risk if these benefits are dropped from required coverage (with the rare exception of male breast cancer).The White House and Republican leadership agreed to cut the benefits as part of a last-ditch attempt to woo enough conservatives to support the bill. Even before today\u2019s debate, women\u2019s health care had emerged as one of the most polarizing \u2014 and politically incendiary \u2013 touchstones of the Trump presidency.Women across the country, mobilized by Planned Parenthood and other groups, flooded town halls to berate members of Congress about plans to repeal Obamacare. The Women\u2019s March on Washington has made health care a rallying cry. The Democratic determination to filibuster Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination is motivated in part by its base\u2019s concerns about his potential stance on abortion.The political perils of men proclaiming their thoughts on what women ought to say or how they ought to receive medical care should be clear enough to the Republicans. There is the now-infamous scene in the Senate of Elizabeth Warren being silenced, when male colleagues were later allowed to read the same letter from Coretta Scott King criticizing Jeff Sessions during the debate over his confirmation as attorney general. Earlier, Republicans reeled from the \u201cwar on women\u201d label in the 2012 election, when Representative Todd Akin, Republican of Missouri, talked about victims of \u201clegitimate rape\u201d not becoming pregnant.There\u2019s no doubt that continuing instances of powerful men demeaning or undermining women have helped to galvanize liberal women. So far, the Republican attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare has been stymied by a combination of conservative Republicans who feel the bill does not go far enough and Republicans who fear it goes too far.And yet. Despite widespread social media outrage and activism, the political damage from such moments can be fleeting. Many people believed the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape would doom Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy.The obliviousness on display Thursday caused a tweet-storm; we don\u2019t know yet whether that storm will do lasting damage.Advertisement"}

And it may herald a coming wave of unicorns \u2014 technology start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by private investors \u2014 that are expected to hit the public markets in the next few years.Snap\u2019s offering was priced on Wednesday at $17 a share \u2014 a dollar more than the previously expected pricing range. The pricing came on a day when the stock market surged to another high, fed by raised expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. Shares of the social media companies Facebook and Twitter also rose.Those buying into Snap\u2019s offering did so even as warning signs have flashed over the company, based in California. It lost more than $500 million last year, and its explosive user growth appears to have hit a speed bump. And in a decision that has angered some large investors, the shares will have no voting rights, leaving control in the hands of the company\u2019s founders, who can retain that power for years even after leaving Snap.Yet when Snap begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, under the ticker name SNAP, it will command a lofty valuation multiple even richer than that of Facebook, which earned $10 billion last year.The question beyond this week is whether Snap will prove to be like mighty Facebook or embattled Twitter.Much has been riding on Snap\u2019s offering, including expectations that it will lift a moribund market in new stocks. In going public, Snap has leapt ahead of other technology darlings like Uber, Airbnb and the data-analysis provider Palantir.After a nearly two-week road show for investors that spanned the country and stretched to London, demand for Snap shares proved robust. Bankers for the company received orders totaling more than 10 times the number of shares up for sale.With a market value of almost $24 billion, including unvested stock options and grants, the company is now setting itself up with little room for error.Throughout the presentations to investors, Snap executives and their advisers kept the emphasis squarely on the promise of what first seemed like a technological lark. Instead of focusing on the core product of disappearing messages, Snapchat instead represents a new way of consuming content, largely produced by its users \u2014 laid alongside a fast-growing advertising business.At the end of 2016, Snap reported an average of 158 million active daily users. Revenue totaled about $404 million for the year, up from zero in sales three years ago. The company believes sales could reach $1 billion this year.Snap has come a long way from its beginnings in a Stanford dorm room as a service used largely by young people enamored with sending their friends pictures and video that self-destructed after seconds.Based in the fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice, the company has since introduced ways for users to broadcast \u201cstories\u201d about their days to wider audiences and pioneered the use of computer-generated lenses that transform those users into dogs or Taco Bell tacos.Now, Snap is trying to convey even greater ambitions.In the prospectus for its stock sale, the service declared itself a \u201ccamera company.\u201d So far that has included selling Spectacles, camera-equipped sunglasses that let users upload 10-second videos directly to Snapchat, which briefly captured the fancy of the tech cognoscenti. And Snap has worked on prototypes for products like drone-mounted cameras.But Mr. Spiegel and his fellow shareholders are still hoping that investors will help lift their company to Facebook-type heights. Since Mr. Zuckerberg took his business public just under five years ago, Facebook\u2019s shares have climbed more than 254 percent.The cautionary tale is that of Twitter, which celebrated a lofty stock market debut in 2013, only to have its share price tumble amid questions about its ability to grow. Twitter\u2019s stock is down about 62 percent from its initial public offering, and the company has had to fend off questions about whether it can remain an independent and publicly traded business.Analysts also raised the specter of lower growth with Snap, given that the company\u2019s user growth slowed last year.Then there is the copycatting of Snapchat\u2019s most recognizable features, from its Stories to its animated lenses and filters. Chief among the imitators is Facebook, whose Instagram service has forthrightly adopted those elements. Even smaller social networks like Medium, a blog-posting service, have rolled out similar offerings.Executives contended during the investor presentations that Snapchat\u2019s slowdown was largely due to technical issues with its Android app. And they argued that the bigger issue to look at was engagement, or, put another way, how much its audience loves the app.And Snap, under Mr. Spiegel, has argued that it will continue to roll out innovations.Regardless of whether Snap soars or sinks, its offering will significantly enrich its earliest investors, notably Mr. Spiegel and the company\u2019s other founder, Robert Murphy.With 227 million shares each, the two men are each worth more than $3 billion on paper, well ahead of their 30th birthdays.Advertisement"}

Judge Richard Peet, the top administrator of Gray County, Tex., told local news outlets that three people \u2014 two men and a woman \u2014 had been killed by a wildfire that flared Monday afternoon.One man, Cody Crockett, 20, was on horseback; his girlfriend, Sydney Wallace, 23, was nearby on foot, Judge Peet told reporters. Ms. Wallace, he said, was unable to escape the fumes and died of smoke inhalation.Mr. Crockett and the third victim, Sloan Everett, 35, who was also on horseback, suffered burns, Judge Peet said.Nearly six million people live in areas at risk for critical wildfire conditions, including Tulsa, Okla., Oklahoma City and Kansas City, the Storm Prediction Center said. Forecasters said conditions were also ripe for fires in Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska.Kansas officials said that in addition to the homes and buildings destroyed, the fires had killed an unknown number of livestock in several counties.\u201cAll in all, I\u2019d guess I seen between 300 and 400 dead cattle,\u201d said Mr. Konrade, who spent the day helping a rancher. \u201cIt was just a matter of putting animals out of their misery, doing them a favor.

{"Headline": "A Small Table Maker Takes On Alibaba\u2019s Flood of Fakes", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 From his desk in a downtown workshop, Greg Hankerson is at war with a Chinese company half a world away.One recent day, Mr. Hankerson fired up his web browser to scan for counterfeits. Several Taobao shops sell copies of various Vintage Industrial tables, including one with A-shaped legs and another with a glass top and propeller-like base, as well as cabinets and a metal locker.\u201cIt just keeps going and going and going,\u201d Mr. Hankerson, 45, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to pick weeds on a 70-acre farm.\u201dBut Mr. Hankerson wants to know why Alibaba doesn\u2019t do more to defeat counterfeiting, which damages the very same small businesses Mr. Ma says he intends to aid.Mr. Ma \u201cis making himself look like someone you can trust,\u201d Mr. Hankerson said. But, he added, his company is selling counterfeit products.That leaves many businesses, big and small, wondering why it has such a hard time finding fakes on its sites. Its online system for reporting counterfeits, many say, is cumbersome and prone to hiccups. Against one of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms, Mr. Hankerson employs his iMac, $74-a-month image-searching software, his phone and a lot of time \u2014 sometimes, he says, 12 hours a day.Yet if he doesn\u2019t invest the effort, he worries that a flood of cut-rate replicas could undermine the future of his business. Shops on Alibaba \u2014 shops that sometimes sell outside China \u2014 offer their copies at a fraction of Mr. Hankerson\u2019s prices. One Taobao store sold a version of his A-frame table, with a starting price of $5,295, for $24.\u201cIf this gets out of hand, people are going to be able to buy our stuff for next to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be devastating for us.\u201dAlibaba has long faced accusations that its sales platforms are a haven for fakes, and big organizations have been effective at bringing the problem to the fore.In a report submitted to the U.S.T.R. in October, Alibaba boasted about the technology and resources it uses to clean counterfeits from its platforms. The company says its systems are powerful enough to scan 10 million product listings each day. As a result, Alibaba said, it proactively removed 380 million suspect product listings in one 12-month period.\u201cThere are few companies (indeed, none, to our knowledge) that have taken the combination of steps Alibaba has taken, and has concrete plans to take, and certainly none that have put in place measures on the scale of Alibaba\u2019s,\u201d the company told the U.S.T.R.Alibaba also argues that many of the complaints against it are unfair. Counterfeiting and piracy are widespread in the Chinese economy. As private businesspeople, Mr. Ma and his team cannot shut down the culprits producing fake goods.Additionally, Alibaba suggests that it has been made into a scapegoat. In a statement in December, the company protested that the U.S.T.R. decision \u201cleads us to question whether the U.S.T.R. acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate\u201d \u2014 presumably referring to heightened anti-China sentiment amid last year\u2019s United States presidential election.The U.S.T.R. and industry experts contend that there is a lot more Alibaba could and should be doing to tackle fakes.\u201cThey are a leading technology company,\u201d said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, which represents many brands hurt by counterfeiting. \u201cIt is our hope that they use this technology to develop solutions and make sure those solutions are available for everybody.\u201dFor small enterprises, fighting fakes on Alibaba\u2019s sites \u201ccan become expensive, it can become frustrating, it can take time away from your sales, marketing and other creative endeavors,\u201d Mr. Lamar said.An Alibaba spokesman said that suggestions that small businesses do not get its attention are \u201cfalse\u201d and that they can qualify for the streamlined process if their submissions prove reliable. He added that its process for removing suspect listings is in place to address the large number of fraudulent claims the firm receives.\u201cThere are places that our systems can be improved to make them more effective, efficient and user-friendly,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are working hard every day to make these improvements a reality.\u201dMichelle Stennett, 38, a jewelry maker in Suwanee, Ga., found out counterfeiters had stolen her designs during a trip to Yiwu in eastern China in 2012 to buy supplies. Upon returning home, Ms. Stennett scoured Alibaba.com \u2014 an Alibaba platform that sells around the world \u2014 and discovered shop after shop selling copies of her wares.She first tried contacting the stores directly, ordering them to take down the offending goods. Some complied, but others didn\u2019t. Next she filed a couple of complaints to Alibaba, asking the firm to remove the copies. Although those were successful, she quickly realized that the scale of the problem and the paperwork Alibaba required were too much for her to handle as a one-person business.\u201cThere was no way I could go through the process,\u201d she said. There were \u201ctoo many.\u201dDespondent, Ms. Stennett said she stopped making jewelry for nearly a year. \u201cIf someone is going to take my design and mass-produce it, it is hard for me to compete with them,\u201d she said. When she resumed, in 2013, she decided to source her components only from American suppliers, hoping to make it harder for counterfeiters to replicate her products.Now Ms. Stennett rarely checks Alibaba, afraid of what she\u2019ll find. After a quick search of Alibaba.com one day in March, she spotted an image of one of her pendants, which she reported to Alibaba. It is no longer on the platform, but she said she still does not have time to hunt for fakes.\u201cYou\u2019re losing out on money,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause time is money.\u201dAlibaba did not respond to a request for comment on Ms. Stennett\u2019s predicament.Last year, a friend told her that she had found her designs being sold by a store in Australia. Confused, Ms. Long contacted the proprietor, who informed her she had purchased the clothing on Alibaba.com and had no idea the designs were originally from Reignland. Ms. Long looked at the Alibaba shop and was shocked to find a picture of her own son, one of the models in her promotional material, being used to peddle fakes of her clothing.Ms. Long did not know she could ask Alibaba for assistance in removing these counterfeits. Instead, she contacted several shops, which, in some cases, have cooperated and removed the offending products. But Ms. Long blames the spread of copies from Alibaba for the sudden decline in sales of one of her best-selling products, a pair of children\u2019s pants.A few months ago, she had been selling about 30 a week, she said. Now, she moves only five a month.Mr. Hankerson had worked at his father\u2019s financial firm and in I.T. services, building websites, before he began tinkering with furniture.He unexpectedly started Vintage in 2009, when his wife said she wanted a new patio table. Mr. Hankerson hammered one together and posted a picture on a website. He began making more tables and advertising them on the internet, too. \u201cI loved the experience so much that I just wanted to make a better table,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a mad artist.\u201dToday, the Vintage factory is abuzz with the sounds of welding, sawing and hammering. There is one nod to modern automation \u2014 a recently acquired computerized steel-cutting machine \u2014 but much of the manufacturing is done by specially trained employees with woodworking or metalworking skills.While his business was quickly growing, Mr. Hankerson had no idea counterfeiters were profiting off his work as well.He first learned he had a problem in 2014, when he spotted an advertisement on Facebook that included a photo of one of his A-frame tables. He contacted the seller, who said she had bought the merchandise from elsewhere. Intrigued and worried, Mr. Hankerson began searching for images of his designs using Google, and he discovered many of them around the web.\u201cYou would find one image, and you go and look at their catalog on Alibaba, and there\u2019s another and another and another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going down the rabbit hole.\u201dMany shops promote these fakes with pictures lifted from Mr. Hankerson\u2019s own website. One photo bouncing around Taobao features a Vintage console with framed snapshots of Mr. Hankerson and his family still hanging on the wall above it.Some Taobao sellers admit they get their designs from Mr. Hankerson. Liao Xiaoting, a customer service provider at Shang Jie Crafts Company, said her firm\u2019s designers use them as \u201creference\u201d to make their own furniture, with changes, mainly to the materials.Huang Geqing, proprietor of a Taobao shop called Creative Iron Factory, said that he copies Vintage\u2019s designs, manufactures replicas in Fujian province in eastern China, and uses Mr. Hankerson\u2019s photos to promote his own products. He first found Vintage\u2019s designs marketed on other Taobao stores, then traced them back to the original source.Mr. Huang estimates 100 shops may be selling fakes of Mr. Hankerson\u2019s furniture. The style \u201cis quite popular in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can make something exactly like it.\u201dMr. Hankerson said he had no idea how many of these fakes can be found outside of China. Though some of these likely counterfeits have been on Taobao, which has primarily Chinese users, he has also spotted them on the globally focused Alibaba.com.One furniture maker in India, Raja Rani Art Handicrafts, said two pieces of furniture it sells on Alibaba.com are based on Mr. Hankerson\u2019s designs. \u201cThis design is from Vintage Industrial, but we also manufacture the same design in our company,\u201d said Bobby Shukhla, who answered queries from The New York Times.Mr. Hankerson tried contacting sellers directly, asking them to take down his images. Most of them complied. He was also encouraged when Alibaba staff members removed all of the photos he targeted on Alibaba.com through its infringement-fighting process.But then he ran into difficulties. Last year, the website through which he could send Alibaba requests to remove suspect listings stopped working. He tried submitting and resubmitting the required paperwork on the site, even on different computers, only to have it return error messages.An Alibaba spokesman, in written responses, said that in October the company started an improved online system through which companies and people can report possible infringement on any of its platforms. He said that Mr. Hankerson has not tried to use this new system. Mr. Hankerson said he had but could not get it to work.Mr. Hankerson decided to step up his efforts. In August, he sent emails to Alibaba\u2019s investor and public relations departments threatening to raise a public ruckus about fakes on its sites.A manager at Alibaba\u2019s intellectual property protection department reached out. Mr. Hankerson handed over lists of more than 400 suspect images, only some of which were removed. Many of them, Mr. Hankerson was informed, were on a different Alibaba system and had to be removed through a separate process, which has not yet been undertaken.He argued that he shouldn\u2019t have to go to such lengths to get Alibaba to act. Once Alibaba has been made aware of his company\u2019s intellectual property, he said, the firm should proactively prevent additional postings of his photos or clean any suspect products from its platforms. Yet despite Alibaba\u2019s boast to the U.S.T.R., combing the millions of listings could be difficult or expensive.\u201cIt should be click and forget,\u201d he said. \u201cOur products should never be on their site.\u201dAn Alibaba spokesman said the company had tried to work with Mr. Hankerson to remove his images and resolve his technical problems. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the primary responsibility of protecting a brand rests with the brand itself,\u201d the spokesman wrote in an email.Additionally, Alibaba disputes the idea that it tolerates fakes. Intellectual property infringement \u201churts Alibaba\u2019s business and reputation,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether the infringement is against big brands or small companies.\u201dMr. Hankerson remains unmollified. He is talking to lawyers about his options and is trying to rally other small-business owners to the cause.\u201cThey want to have all those counterfeits,\u201d he said, \u201cand they want to make money off of it.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about American small businesses\u2019 fighting counterfeits on Alibaba\u2019s sales platforms misstated the Chinese company\u2019s relationship with a popular online payment system in China. The system, Alipay, is owned by a company controlled by Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman, not by Alibaba itself.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Takes Nashville", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byNASHVILLE \u2014 \u201cFight the power,\u201d the Facebook message said. \u201cGet two tix for Donald and let the place stay empty!\u201dI clicked the link, and that\u2019s how I learned that the president of the United States was coming to Nashville. As with so many of these scattershot acts of resistance, the call to reserve tickets and leave the seats unoccupied seemed pointless for a first-come-first-served event issuing unlimited tickets. I made my reservations anyway on the off chance I was wrong.Then I thought, \u201cI should just go.\u201d Not as a protester \u2014 megaphone-to-megaphone combat is a fine American tradition, but it\u2019s not a great fit for someone who likes pretty much everybody. Most Tennesseans might consider me a Yellow Dog Democrat, but President Trump\u2019s people are my people \u2014 the people I come from, the people I live among. I believe my people elected the greatest threat to American democracy since the Third Reich, but I haven\u2019t been able to work up a real us-versus-them way of thinking about my own friends and family.A few steps down the line, a Trump supporter named Megan Taylor was dressed in jeans and a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hoodie with sleeves made of American flags \u2014 and dozens of Trump buttons: \u201cHot Chicks for Trump,\u201d \u201cGirls Just Wanna Have Guns,\u201d \u201cBasket of Deplorables Member.\u201d \u201cI feel like I\u2019m at the fair!\u201d Ms. Taylor said, turning to show me a button the size of a salad plate: \u201cTrump 2016 \u2014 Finally Someone With Balls.\u201dBut mostly the line looked like any line that might form outside Nashville\u2019s scruffy Municipal Auditorium for a concert by a band a decade past its chart-toppers but still pulling in true believers on tour. Word had gotten out among protesters that the empty-seat strategy wasn\u2019t going to work, and a new plan called for them to take their seats and then rise to leave en masse once the president took the podium. But there was no evidence of anti-Trump sentiment on the line. Either the protesters hadn\u2019t gotten in line before dawn themselves, or it was impossible to tell protesters from supporters.For several blocks around the auditorium, vendors pushed carts full of souvenir buttons, hats, T-shirts and Trump masks. A large vehicle labeled \u201cTrump Tram\u201d circled the block with an effigy of Hillary Clinton imprisoned in a cage on the roof. If spectacle is what you crave, a Trump rally is worth getting up before dawn for.\u201cI wanted something new,\u201d the woman, Sybil Dukes, said about voting for Mr. Trump. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I was discriminating against Hillary as a female. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m a Christian lady, and I believe what he was saying in terms of abortion.\u201d For her daughter, Johnesha Dukes, the decision was even more straightforward: \u201cI just liked him.\u201dA full-throated protest was inevitable. By Tuesday more than 2,000 people had committed to attend \u2014 including buses full of activists from Memphis and Knoxville.One of the earliest to arrive was John Boylan, who described himself as \u201can Ecumenical Franciscan and an Ecumenical Catholic priest.\u201d He was holding a \u201cBeat Swords Into Plowshares\u201d sign and wearing a sticker that said \u201cPaid Protester\u201d with a Chi-Rho monogram, the symbol for Christ, in place of each P. \u201cMy payment comes later,\u201d he said, pointing heavenward.People from groups like Indivisible, the A.C.L.U. and the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition were present in force, but everyone on both sides of James Robertson Parkway seemed calm. I asked Francie Hunt, executive director of Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood, how the famously testy Trump supporters were behaving. \u201cActually, I haven\u2019t heard anything from them,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the day is young.\u201dBy the time the auditorium doors opened, I was hearing scattered reports of intimidation, particularly from protesters who had to pass that mile-long line on their way to the demonstration: \u201cWe had to walk all the way by them with our signs,\u201d said Mary Reeves, who drove in from Murfreesboro. \u201cAt first it was just the usual, and then they said, \u2018We\u2019ll kill you, we\u2019ll kill you.\u2019 \u201dI might\u2019ve looked a little skeptical. I\u2019d been in that crowd for more than five hours by then, and except for the way they vote, the Trump people all seemed pretty innocuous to me. \u201cTake this sign and walk by them,\u201d the women from Murfreesboro urged. \u201cYou\u2019ll get to experience \u2026.\u201d She trailed off. I\u2019d get to experience the real Trump supporter? I didn\u2019t take her up on the offer, but she had a point. Nothing I\u2019d done myself that day had provoked anyone spoiling for a fight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clare Waight Keller Is Named First Female Designer of Givenchy", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byIs Audrey Hepburn making a return to the house of Givenchy?On Thursday, the French brand named Clare Waight Keller as its artistic director, responsible for women\u2019s and men\u2019s wear, accessories and couture. She will be the first woman to run the creative side of the house founded by Hubert de Givenchy in 1952.The announcement marks a new stage in this year\u2019s game of fashion musical chairs, and it is a potentially significant change, both for Givenchy and its incoming designer.\u201cI am very happy to have Clare Waight Keller join the LVMH group,\u201d said Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, in announcing the news, which was released simultaneously on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WeChat and Weibo. \u201cI believe her widespread expertise and vision will allow Givenchy to enter the next phase of its unique path.\u201dWhat that next phase is remains to be seen, but the choice of Ms. Waight Keller, rumored during the recent Paris Fashion Week, suggests the answer is not more of the same.Indeed, the statement by Philippe Fortunato, chief executive of Givenchy, seemed to suggest a return to the brand\u2019s roots.\u201cI am very excited to see Clare bring her singular sense of elegance and modernity to Givenchy,\u201d he said. \u201cBy exploring our maison\u2019s 65-year heritage and the outstanding savoir-faire of its ateliers, I am convinced Clare will help Givenchy reach its full potential.\u201dThough Ms. Waight Keller, who began her career working at Calvin Klein in New York and with Tom Ford at Gucci, was also in charge of men\u2019s wear at Pringle, she has never worked with an haute couture atelier before. Givenchy suspended its formal couture shows in 2012, first holding static presentations of the collection instead, and more recently incorporating some couture looks into its men\u2019s wear shows in January and June. But the fact that Ms. Waight Keller has been specifically given responsibility for the highest form of fashion\u2019s art suggests that a return to a more formal couture offering may be in the future.It also suggests that the idea was false that Ms. Waight Keller, who has three children and has recently moved her family to London from Paris, was taking time off after Chlo\u00e9 because of the pressures of today\u2019s fashion cycle. Her responsibilities at Givenchy, after all, will be significantly greater than her responsibilities at Chlo\u00e9: She will be overseeing at least eight collections a year, as opposed to four.In her new role \u2014 like Phoebe Philo, the creative director of C\u00e9line, another LVMH brand (who, when she was creative director of Chlo\u00e9, became the first designer to ever take a formal maternity leave) \u2014 Ms. Waight Keller will move between London and Paris, where the Givenchy atelier is based.It may seem astonishing, but the idea that a designer would not have to choose between having a power position and a family life is a relatively new look in the fashion world.Ms. Waight Keller officially begins work May 2. Her first show for Givenchy will take place during Paris Fashion Week in October.The fashion world will be left to speculate on where Mr. Tisci, whose next move has not yet been announced, will end up. Rumor has it the answer is Versace. Stay tuned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maria Sharapova\u2019s Imminent Return Stirs Debate on Wild Cards", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byINDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 A year after the news of her positive doping test shook the BNP Paribas Open, Maria Sharapova again dominated conversation here in absentia.She has no ranking but has secured three wild-card entries for clay court events in Stuttgart, Germany; Madrid; and Rome. The next two Grand Slam events, the French Open and Wimbledon, have yet to reach any decision on wild cards for Sharapova, who is a past champion of both tournaments.Among tennis\u2019s top players and executives, opinions on Sharapova\u2019s exemptions were a mix of cautious and conflicted.\u201cThis is, all over, a strange situation,\u201d Kerber said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say about this because it\u2019s a little bit strange for the other players that somebody can just walk on site Wednesday and play Wednesday.\u201dKerber, rarely outspoken, is a surprising voice of dissent regarding the Stuttgart event, where she is defending champion. She and Sharapova are sponsored by Porsche, the tournament\u2019s title sponsor. Kerber lamented that a wild card for Sharapova would remove an opportunity for a German player to play in her country\u2019s largest WTA event.Steve Simon, the chief executive of the WTA, said tournaments should feel free to welcome back Sharapova, who will be a player in good standing after her ban lapses. The I.T.F. and the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that she had unintentionally committed a doping infraction after failing to keep up-to-date on the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s prohibited list.\u201cI think it\u2019s really clear: She\u2019s served her suspension, she\u2019s eligible to play, and we welcome her back,\u201d Simon said.He rebutted the notion that there was any sort of star treatment for Sharapova.\u201cMaria\u2019s had anything but the red carpet,\u201d he said. \u201cShe served a significant suspension for this issue, and again you\u2019ve seen the reasons and you know what they are. All we\u2019ve said is, \u2018Yeah, she\u2019s available to play.\u2019 Her wild cards are based on what she\u2019s earned through her career, and the tournaments are making their decisions at their sole discretion.\u201dWhen asked about Sharapova last week in an interview with The Times of London, Andy Murray, the top-ranked men\u2019s player, said, \u201cI think you should really have to work your way back.\u201dOn Wednesday, he further outlined many difficulties of Sharapova\u2019s case, especially given that the logistics of accommodating a star like her could overwhelm the lowest-level events.\u201cThe tournaments are well within their rights to give a wild card; there\u2019s nothing saying that they can\u2019t,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThere\u2019s no rule in place, so the tournaments are going to do what they think is best for their event. But should you get a wild card into every event when you come back? I\u2019m not sure about that. That\u2019s something that maybe should be looked at.\u201dJo-Wilfried Tsonga, the top-ranked French player, said he did not believe the French Tennis Federation should give Sharapova a wild card into Roland Garros, which she would need to compete.\u201cIt\u2019s like if you give a sweet to a kid who did bad things,\u201d Tsonga said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it again.\u201dBernard Giudicelli, the newly elected president of the French Tennis Federation, said he met with Sharapova here this week, at her request. He said they spoke for a long time and had agreed to keep the content of their meeting confidential.He said he would return to Paris and discuss Sharapova\u2019s situation further with Guy Forget, the French Open tournament director.\u201cIt\u2019s an important decision for the future of our tournament and also for a matter as sensitive as the fight against doping,\u201d Giudicelli said.Svetlana Kuznetsova, a fellow Russian who has been one of Sharapova\u2019s more vocal supporters, said Sharapova\u2019s comeback would be \u201cgreat for tennis\u201d but acknowledged that the wild-card issue was complex.\u201cI\u2019ve been supportive to her because I don\u2019t think this thing was really that serious,\u201d Kuznetsova said.She added: \u201cI understand, because if we talk about cheaters, people who cheat, you would say, \u2018Why would cheaters get a wild card?\u2019 But then if there is some mistake, you know, it\u2019s a little bit of a different story. But it\u2019s really hard to say. I understand all the sides.\u201dMurray acknowledged that there would always be a gray area when it came to suspensions.\u201cIf someone\u2019s coming back from a drugs ban, whether they were intentionally cheating, whether it was for recreational drugs, whether it was for performance-enhancing drugs, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to have rules for so many different things. So I think it\u2019s tough.\u201dEven after more than a year away, Sharapova remains one of tennis\u2019s biggest stars \u2014 and a powerful draw for tournaments.\u201cI think tennis needs a person like she is,\u201d third-ranked Karolina Pliskova said. \u201cSo on the one hand, it\u2019s good that she\u2019s going to be back \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter how she\u2019s going to play. On the other hand, there\u2019s a lot of discussions now about that she\u2019s going to get wild cards.\u201cI think it just depends on the tournaments, depends on the directors who are deciding wild cards. I have my own opinion, but I\u2019m just not going to say it.\u201dChristopher Clarey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did the Supreme Court Base a Ruling on a Myth?", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported bySidebarBut there is vanishingly little evidence for the Supreme Court\u2019s assertion that convicted sex offenders commit new offenses at very high rates. The story behind the notion, it turns out, starts with a throwaway line in a glossy magazine.The guide, a compendium of papers from outside experts, is 231 pages long, and it contains lots of statistics on sex offender recidivism rates. Many of them were in the single digits, some a little higher. Only one source claimed an 80 percent rate, and the guide itself said that number might be exaggerated.The source of the 80 percent figure was a 1986 article in Psychology Today, a magazine written for a general audience. The article was about a counseling program run by the authors, and they made a statement that could be good for business. \u201cMost untreated sex offenders released from prison go on to commit more offenses \u2014 indeed, as many as 80 percent do,\u201d the article said, without evidence or elaboration.That\u2019s it. The basis for much of American jurisprudence and legislation about sex offenders was rooted in an offhand and unsupported statement in a mass-market magazine, not a peer-reviewed journal.\u201cIts endorsement has transformed random opinions by self-interested nonexperts into definitive studies offered to justify law and policy, while real studies by real scientists go unnoticed,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe court\u2019s casual approach to the facts of sex offender re-offense rates is far more frightening than the rates themselves.\u201dThe Justice Department report said the risk of new sex offenses by convicted sex offenders rises over time, reaching 27 percent over 20 years.That number is significant, but it is nothing like 80 percent. Perhaps it is sufficient to warrant harsh sex offender registry laws, but judges and lawmakers would have been better served by basing their judgments on the best available data.Judge Alice M. Batchelder, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, described \u201cthe significant doubt cast by recent empirical studies on the pronouncement in Smith that \u2018the risk of recidivism posed by sex offenders is \u201cfrightening and high.\u2019\u201dThe constitutional question in the case is interesting and substantial. And hearing the case would allow the court to consider more fully its casual assertion that sex offenders are especially dangerous.Advertisement"}

Residence over retirement. Later over now. Needs over wants. Faith over financial facts. The people you\u2019ll encounter here\u00a0have been sorting it out for themselves for some time now. Their household income is at or close to the median in their area \u2014 from Arkansas to Michigan, Indiana to California.Meeting the most basic of needs is usually not a problem for these people, but it\u2019s a challenge to figure out how often to allow themselves things they want and\u00a0to\u00a0weigh those desires against\u00a0longstanding\u00a0debt or the contributions they probably ought to make to their futures.Below are some of the most common trade-offs that they \u2014 and all of us \u2014 face.  Bryant, Ark.Sometimes Tanya Brashers can almost forget about the financial situation her family is in.Tanya and her husband, Chris, are military veterans \u2014 Tanya is a former member of the U.S. Navy and Chris of the Marines \u2014 living in this bedroom community southwest of the state capital.In mid-February, Tanya, 41, lost her $37,000-a-year job with a nonprofit veterans group in North Little Rock when grant funding dried up. In early April, the couple and their teenage son from a previous marriage must vacate the house they have been renting for $1,200 a month because their landlord plans to sell it. The couple has about $50,000 in student loan debt.\u201cThe more I talk about our situation, the more grim it seems,\u201d she said. \u201cWe prioritize everything: our rent and utilities and our food comes first \u2026 It\u2019s a huge splurge if we go out to dinner or something, but we feel like it\u2019s important to do that every so often. And I do feel guilty for it.\u201dThe couple has decided to move to Fairhope, Ala., on the Gulf Coast, hoping it will bring new opportunities.Tanya\u2019s Arkansas social worker license is valid in Alabama. Chris, who has a degree in engineering but is trying to build a business as a freelance photographer, researched the area and thinks there are more freelance jobs there. They will also be near several military bases, an employment option if they cannot find full-time work, she said.Money worries are not new to Tanya, who grew up in poverty in Yazoo City, Miss., in the Mississippi Delta. She remembers moving often as a child because her parents could not pay the rent. The water and electricity were frequently cut off.Tanya said that growing up in poverty and seeing poverty every day had a significant influence on her political choices.\u201cGiven that there are a lot of economic issues right now, social welfare programs are essential and help people from being homeless to keeping people from having their health become detrimental,\u201d she said.Money was also scarce during her five years in the Navy. \u201cSo you kind of get used to living very basic,\u201d she said.The first time in her life that she thought she had enough money was after she was discharged and moved to Reno, Nev. \u201cI started to make good money in the civilian world \u2026 and I lived a little more lavishly, maybe too lavishly, and ended up in bankruptcy,\u201d she said, and \u201cthen, of course, I reverted back to the basics again.\u201dChris, 46, grew up in Arkansas; he also filed for bankruptcy after leaving the military because he lived beyond his means.While Tanya no longer has a paycheck she can count on, she receives disability compensation of nearly $2,000 a month for a back injury she sustained during a training exercise in the Navy.Chris, who served during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was also receiving $2,000 a month in disability compensation for a number of physical and emotional issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder. But in December, that payment was halted for six months after a paperwork error resulted in his being overpaid.The couple has health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs; Tanya\u2019s ex-husband covers their son\u2019s insurance.While they drive newer vehicles, they shop for things marked down to the lowest price and closely monitor their utility costs.Chris said he is hopeful about their situation, and he likes a lot of what President Trump is doing. \u201cLike wanting to renovate the V.A. system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would really impact us, but how is he going to do it?\u201dTanya said she is not sure of their future. \u201cWe are happy with living simply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried to find the least extravagant house in the neighborhood.\u201cI\u2019m at peace with the fact that I don\u2019t have to have a lot of money to be happy.\u201dRob Moritz lives in North Little Rock. He has spent more than 30 years covering politics, state and local government and crime news for newspapers in Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas.Colorado SpringsAvalon Manly is proud of who she is and what she represents as a feminist, bisexual, social activist, writer, artist and teacher living in the famously conservative stronghold of Colorado Springs.And defying what she sees as an unfair image of her fellow millennials as \u201clazy and entitled,\u201d Avalon, 27, works hard. She teaches at a Colorado Springs middle school. She also does \u201cpart-time pittance work\u201d to bridge the gap between her $44,000 teaching salary, in an area with a median income of about $54,000, and her bills. She calls them \u201cside hustles.\u201d\u201cEvery millennial I know has a side hustle or two,\u201d said Avalon, who does freelance design work, editing work and writing. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who has one job and makes a living at it.\u201dShe scrambles because she is digging out of a financial hole she created when she lost her job in 2014 and turned to credit cards to fill the gaps in her monthly budget. It\u2019s a choice that taught her a particularly painful lesson in personal finance.\u201cThere were months during the great season of unemployment where I would send out 15 job applications and then I would sit on the couch and have panic attacks,\u201d she said.\u201cI was really dumb,\u201d she said, explaining how she took temporary and part-time jobs to generate income and negotiated with her bank and credit companies for relief.\u201cWe live in this system that correlates wealth with character,\u201d Avalon said. \u201cIf you are doing well financially, you must be a good person. And if you are doing poorly, you must be a bad person. What an unjust narrative that is.\u201dShe might have recovered from her financial woes more quickly, but chose a lower-paying teaching job in a neighborhood with one of the lowest per-capita incomes and highest crime rates in the region, turning down more lucrative offers.\u201cMy friends and I tend to be very activist, very passionate about people and passionate about doing meaningful work,\u201d she said.She admits she would fit in better in more progressive Colorado communities like Boulder or Denver, but she is committed to staying here. \u201cMy family is here,\u201d she said, and she likes to be near them.Avalon moved back after a three-year stint in New Orleans, where she taught in a poor public school as a member of Teach for America. And she is making no compromises as she plants roots here.Instead, she wants the community to adjust. \u201cThere are more of us here than people realize,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe are working to change Colorado Springs.\u201dShe is tempted to take higher-paying jobs, but says her work is too important to leave. She points to a seminar she led for new Teach for America corps members.\u201cWe had a very real conversation about supporting queer kids,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard to watch all the new teachers\u2019 faces when we talked about the need to support queer kids in states that legislate against them.\u201dBill Vogrin has worked as a reporter, editor and columnist for 35 years, primarily for The Associated Press and The Colorado Springs Gazette. He has lived in Colorado Springs since 1994.Grand Rapids, Mich.Money has been a burden for Kate Elenbaas for much of her life, a constant reminder of how her family struggled financially, and then how her addiction to alcohol nearly killed her.\u201cFrom the time I was a little kid, money has somehow or another woven itself in and out of my life in a negative way,\u201d said Kate, 53. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I made bad decisions, did desperate things.\u201dNow, 15 years sober on Feb. 1, Kate still does not have a nest egg, or even her own home. Yet she lacks for nothing and makes a point to donate to organizations that help people who are homeless and addicted.She is a therapist at Thriveworks Counseling and Life Coaching, and she made $57,000 in 2015, just above the median income for this area. She rents a small two-bedroom home on the northwest side of this city, and the only luxuries she allows herself are a 2008 Jeep Commander and a 60-inch 4D television with a stereo sound system.She owes more than $70,000 in student loans, some from attending college in her 20s and the rest from earning a master\u2019s degree in social work in 2010.\u201cSobriety has taught me I could be so much worse off, and I tell myself that daily.\u201dHer parents divorced when she was 7, and Kate said her mother remained acrimonious toward her father about child support. That bitterness extended to Kate.\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for her, but it would be one thing if my mother would have instilled in us the idea that, \u2018Look, we may not have much money, but we have enough,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut every week and every day there was an argument about money. My mother would berate me \u2014 tell me I was ungrateful.\u201dWhile Kate\u2019s family was considered middle class, most of Kate\u2019s friends were in the upper income range. It made her feel insecure, she said, and she became the life of the party, the class clown.\u201cI found friendships through humor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut inside, I was insecure. I realized my alcoholic behavior \u2014 what I thought and how I felt about myself \u2014 started in childhood.\u201dThat behavior escalated in her adult life. A fifth of vodka would temporarily cure the physical toll the disease was taking on her. She suffered from the shakes, retching, hair loss and nosebleeds, and she was desperate for money to pay for liquor and cigarettes. She pocketed money from the till while working at a fast-food restaurant. She stole quarters from her nephew\u2019s piggy bank.\u201cYou feel horrible, but when you are in the throes of addiction \u2026 \u201d she said. \u201cI was at the point where I had to drink all the time. I existed on a fifth of vodka and a pack of cigarettes.\u201dKate finally reached her \u201cbottom\u201d in 2002, when her sister rushed her to a treatment center.\u201cThe doctor took a look at me and said, \u2018She won\u2019t make it through the weekend,\u2019\u201d Kate said.She remembers waking up in a hospital intensive care unit three weeks later. She weighed 106 pounds. She had suffered from alcohol encephalitis and cirrhosis of the liver. Her body had begun to shut down.\u201cObviously I lived, but it was a very long and tenuous recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cA liver specialist told me I\u2019d aged my body by 10 years. I went through menopause at 40. I still feel chronic pain and arthritis. Everything has been accelerated.\u201cBut by God\u2019s grace, here I am, and I realize what\u2019s important. I have a good life.\u201dMary Ullmer has been an associate editor for espnW.com since 2011. She is a Michigan native who worked in the newspaper industry for nearly three decades. She returned to her home state in 1999.New Albany, Ind.Wesley Shears thought he\u2019d arrived. Still in his 30s, he was on the fast track at work, owned his first home \u2014 a small three-bedroom in Lexington, Ky. \u2014 and with his wife had a combined income in excess of $100,000.But his degree in architecture could not protect him when building projects dried up after the country\u2019s financial crisis in 2008.\u201cI survived many rounds of layoffs,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, there was nobody else to lay off.\u201d The house went soon after, lost in a bankruptcy.In what should have been his prime earning years as an architectural designer, Wesley scrambled to continue his livelihood, finding only a string of hourly wage jobs.\u201cIt just looked like everything was stepping up and then boom, boom,\u201d said Wesley, now 44, from the small living room in the duplex he rents for $800 a month in New Albany, Ind., just across the river from Louisville, Ky. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me. I think it\u2019s this whole generation that I\u2019m a part of. Because there\u2019s a lot of people that I went to college with that I connect with on Facebook \u2026 they\u2019re just kind of in the same boat.\u201dTo make ends meet, he managed an office, directed projects for a cabinetmaker and was a substitute teacher in the New Albany school system. \u201cThere\u2019s one school right down the road in a bad neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had me on speed dial.\u201dA year ago, Wesley separated from his second wife, Kristin. He now lives frugally with his 11-year-old son, Hank, a fifth grader at Hazelwood Middle School, along with two cats and two Jack Russell terriers. The family recently stopped using the upstairs bathroom, he said, because the leaky pipes send water through the downstairs ceiling. An older son, Cowen, 18, is a freshman at Butler University, and he also lives with them.\u201cMoney was the end-all, be-all growing up,\u201d Wesley said. \u201cIt seemed what you would strive for. Now what makes me happy is just everything\u2019s taken care of, everything\u2019s paid for. The lights are on. There\u2019s food. Stuff like that.\u201dWhen Hank needs new sneakers, Wesley buys a high-end brand, so they last longer. His own shoes, he said, come refurbished. Occasional trips to Goodwill and the Salvation Army augment his wardrobe. Entertainment comes courtesy of one of the few remaining neighborhood video stores \u2014 where kids\u2019 movies are free. Cable TV is a splurge. Internet, he said, is a necessity.\u201cWhen stuff is really, really, really needed, I can make it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI take it to the very last point. If I can\u2019t make it then, I reach out. I don\u2019t want to, but I do.\u201dHe also helps others, serving food at a soup kitchen, as a volunteer coach at his son\u2019s school, and at his church. What he has lost in bank accounts, he has gained in relationships, including a new love interest.Wesley said he is confident that his current struggle will be a catalyst for his sons\u2019 future success.\u201cI do have dreams and I have no plans of letting them go,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus on myself and my two boys is clearer, and with my current job I will be a homeowner again and move ahead financially in life.\u201dJohn Mura is director of communications for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. He worked for 36 years as a reporter and senior editor at newspapers in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Kentucky.Los AngelesNatalie Davis was married with a 5-year-old and three months pregnant with her second child when her husband died. She was 31.\u201cNobody expected him to die at 45,\u201d said Natalie, now 36. \u201cHe literally just dropped. Metaphorically speaking, that can happen to anything. It was a wake-up call.\u201dIn the years after his death, Natalie relied heavily on her credit cards and accrued lots of debt.\u201cGoing through high school and college, I always had some sort of a credit-card debt,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019d worked hard to get out of debt,\u201d and she had finally established good credit. But as she struggled to deal with the loss of her husband, she ran up credit card bills again.\u201cNow I find myself digging out of another debt hole,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be careful about where I put my money, where I spend it. I hate packing my lunches for work, but I do it.\u201dWhile she is considering where to cut corners, and what she can allow herself, her philosophy on money is relatively simple.Natalie does not have any savings, which she says makes her a little more cautious but is not a source of great anxiety.The biggest trade-off she has made was leaving a full-time executive position to spend more time with her 10-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. \u201cI\u2019m the only parent they have,\u201d she said, \u201cand they\u2019re young.\u201dShe is now a freelancer working with clients in fashion merchandising and product development. The flexibility is important to her, but her salary can swing by as much as $20,000 a year, without ever quite amounting to six figures. She said her number of clients had grown, but she was not completely removed from the financial struggle.But the change was worth it to get time with her children. \u201cI see their development getting so much better,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially my son.\u201dNatalie said she was getting over the guilt she felt about not being able to give her children everything, especially in the absence of their father.\u201cThis is what we have, and this is what we\u2019re going to work with,\u201d is her mantra, of sorts. \u201cI\u2019m definitely less hard on myself about not being able to provide in all aspects. I just cut myself a little more slack, because I used to physically lose hair over it.\u201dThis mom has also carved out two small luxuries for herself that she says have made her life much better, even if she can feel it in her wallet.\u201cI\u2019m going out tonight,\u201d she says, on one of the evenings she sets aside to spend with other mothers. Only in the last year has she felt comfortable enough with \u201cbiting the bullet, and hiring a babysitter because it was needed.\u201dThe other little thing she says she will not bend on is having a housekeeper come once a month to help out.\u201cIt chops off an entire day for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s time I can now take my kids out and do things with them. I don\u2019t feel so guilty about that anymore, but I used to.\u201dJarrett Hill is a freelance journalist in Los Angeles. He hosts Back2Reality, a politics and pop culture podcast for NBCBLK.Florissant, Mo.Alonzo Adams doesn\u2019t know if the old saying will hold true for him.\u201cBlack preachers don\u2019t retire, they die,\u201d said Alonzo, a 42-year-old pastor and father of four. Particularly at smaller, modest churches like his, he said, pastors\u2019 families often divert their own money to fill the church\u2019s coffers, leaving little for retirement savings.It\u2019s a cycle Alonzo is hoping to break. In addition to tending to New Jerusalem\u2019s flock, he works a full-time job at the Department of Agriculture and runs a small janitorial business that cleans offices overnight. His wife, Ronica, 40, home-schools three of their four children and runs a cake-baking business out of their home.\u201cMy wife was diagnosed with lupus two years ago. Kneading all the fondant, and all of these things to make these cakes and put all this stuff together, it hurts her,\u201d Alonzo said from his home in Florissant, Mo. Ronica has to work, he said, even though he puts in 75 to 80 hours a week. \u201cThis is the world that we live in,\u201d he said.Even with the extra jobs, the Adams family brings in a maximum of $76,000 each year, just about the median income in their ZIP code. They have trouble saving, he said, and have no retirement nest egg.The financial pressure of raising four kids is apparent and frustrating. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re not buying as many groceries as we normally would,\u201d Alonzo said.But it is not the hustle that bothers him. It is the feeling that no matter how hard he works, no matter the choices and sacrifices he makes, he barely keeps his head above water \u2014 after a lifetime of watching white classmates, friends and co-workers excel, seemingly with ease.\u201cI\u2019m educated. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m ignorant. I try to speak intelligently. I try to carry myself, and even I get to the point where I just get frustrated and want to lash out,\u201d Alonzo said. \u201cThen I look at my cousins, my friends, people who I went to school with, people who I just see on the street on a daily basis. And I just see how they respond, how angry they get, and how they lash out.\u201dIt is the weight of an economic stagnation and anxiety that North St. Louis County\u2019s residents have carried over the years, and one of the factors that fueled the unrest following the police killing of the teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014.\u201cI can\u2019t condone it,\u201d Alonzo said of the disturbances, \u201cbut oh my God, I have to tell you how much I understand it.\u201dHe has done his best to get ahead. He served in the Navy, graduated from the University of Missouri, read up on I.R.A.s and 401(k)\u2019s \u2014 all the while remembering his grandfather, also a preacher, who spent his life picking cotton in Mississippi.What Alonzo knows about finances, he taught himself.Today, he is helping his son, who is his oldest child and an aspiring engineer, go to college locally. He and his wife spend more on rent than they can easily afford, but want their kids to grow up in a safe neighborhood.He may spend the rest of his life working, but at least he will have tried to set up his son and daughters for a life easier than his.\u201cThey are a product of their environment,\u201d Alonzo said, sitting at his dining room table over a cake his wife had baked. \u201cSo what environment am I willing to pay for now to ensure that they can have a better later?\u201dRyan Schuessler is a freelance journalist who grew up in St. Louis. He has lived in Chicago since 2015.Oakland, Calif.Christina Chung, 39, still remembers being one of just a few children in her middle school who lined up in the cafeteria for the free lunch program. It didn\u2019t make her feel bad, exactly, but she was aware that she came from one of the poorer families in her upper-middle-class Orange County, Calif., neighborhood. \u201cI was around a lot of people feeling that I didn\u2019t have what they had,\u201d she said.Now, as a mother of one with a second child on the way, she packs a lot of lunches and realizes food is an easy way to spend and to save. \u201cSo we cook at home a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe rarely do takeout or delivery.\u201dChristina is Korean-American. Her parents met in Southern California and \u201cwere all about assimilation and the American dream,\u201d she said. When Christina was little, her father worked as a computer scientist and the family bought a small home, but he had flashy tastes, \u201clike buying a new Acura.\u201d Her mom was more practical and \u201cwould immediately return it.\u201dChristina\u2019s father struggled with mental illness, and life got harder as he got older. He owned a gas station for a while, then couldn\u2019t hold down a job or be an effective parent; he died when she was 13.Her mother went from being a stay-at-home mom for Christina and her younger sister to working multiple jobs as a translator, a thrift store manager and an office assistant for a car repair shop.Christina worked, too, babysitting, then at various jobs throughout high school. \u201cIf we wanted to buy a CD, we had to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no asking Mom for that.\u201dChristina took out student loans to attend the California Institute of the Arts, then went into education. She chose a career that offers modest financial rewards in order to focus on service. \u201cWork for me was about finding meaning,\u201d she said of her job as a curriculum developer. \u201cThe money was secondary.\u201dShe is cleareyed about the consequences and benefits of her choices. She loves the creative life she has built with her husband, an administrator in an independent school, and their 4-year-old daughter in an apartment in the Temescal district with stable, under-market-rate rent. They both D.J. on the side and have a rich community of friends \u2014 she works a 30-hour week to have more time with their daughter.But, she says, she sometimes wonders if she is \u201clike super-insane to have so little money.\u201dThe couple only started using credit cards a couple of years ago and have no debt, but little savings. The bulk of what Christina earns goes toward rent and child care. They cannot save enough for a down payment on an apartment or house of their own.\u201cI have always had expensive taste, but I won\u2019t go into debt,\u201d she said. \u201cLike this couch. It\u2019s falling apart but it\u2019s Room & Board. I always try to find the things I like but used, like on Craigslist.\u201dChristina feels a deep allegiance to her diverse Oakland neighborhood. But as it gentrifies she realizes they are, in some ways, trapped. Skyrocketing rents mean \u201cwe couldn\u2019t even afford to rent another house on this block right now.\u201dMeanwhile, as real estate values escalate, the local elementary school still ranks poorly. \u201cWhy would we send our kids to that school when no one else I know would ever put it in their top five?\u201dNow Christina is expecting their second child. The couple waited to conceive until their first daughter would be entering kindergarten so they could avoid double day care costs.They\u2019re committed to sending their children to public school, but quality concerns have driven Christina to at least consider private options if she can find a place that costs around what they already pay for preschool. The change, however, would place a serious squeeze on the family budget.What about college? Christina said her children will be expected to attend college \u2014 just as she and her sister were \u2014 and to pay for it. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting a free ride from us,\u201d she said with a laugh.Jeanne Carstensen is a writer in San Francisco. She is the former managing editor of The Bay Citizen and Salon.com.Duquesne, Pa.In Tara Thompson\u2019s weekly calculations on how to scrape by on $20,000 a year, her daughters are always at the heart of the equation.Kayla, 18, is a busy high school senior planning for college. Kaiya, a 15-year-old sophomore, is training to be a nurse at a vocational school where she spends half her days. Tara tries to make sure they have clothes, food and field trips, which is no easy task when you are a single parent earning less than half the county\u2019s median income.\u201cAs long as my kids have everything they need,\u201d she said, \u201cwhatever I can do that week, I do. Whatever I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dShe said she knows that money shapes the way people think about you. \u201cThe way you dress and look and the way you eat: Everything is based on what you can afford to do, and people judge you on that,\u201d she said.Tara, 39, works as a home aide in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh, earning $12 an hour caring for people in their 90s. She is paid only if she shows up \u2014 if her clients are sick, or if she is, less money comes in that day. \u201cMy last paycheck was lower than normal because my daughter had the flu and was in the hospital for three days,\u201d she said, \u201cso I missed work.\u201dShe would be more than willing to get a second job, but her daughters\u2019 school district does not have any activity buses, and so she needs to drive them around in the afternoons.That is especially challenging because the city where the Thompsons live, Duquesne, Pa., became so poor five years ago that it could no longer afford to maintain a high school, and its students were divided between two nearby districts.Duquesne was once part of a bustling, economically vibrant stretch of steel mill cities along the Monongahela River, which flows into Pittsburgh. Most of the mills shut down more than 30 years ago, and today, Duquesne is mostly African-American, with a median household income that is about the same as Tara\u2019s.To make ends meet, Tara and her daughters live in the home of her sister, who is a nurse. Also sharing the five-bedroom house is their mother and her sister\u2019s son.\u201cI have looked at a couple of other places to live, but they need a $1,500 deposit or the first and last month\u2019s rent,\u201d Tara said. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t want to move my kids into the projects because of the alcohol and drug addictions and the danger.\u201dBeside her earnings, Tara gets about $3,400 a year in child support from Kayla\u2019s father, and she relies heavily on her earned-income tax credit each year, which ranges from $6,000 to $7,000.\u201cWhen I get my income tax check,\u201d she said, \u201cI pay off whatever bills I have and then it\u2019s gone.\u201dA big part of what sustains her is her church, First Presbyterian Church of Duquesne, where she is an ordained elder.\u201cI grew up afraid of God,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I said or did something someone didn\u2019t like, I was told I was going to burn in hell. When I started going to this church 14 years ago, I saw for the first time what God really wanted for me.\u201cI still struggle a lot, but the difference now is, I know that God is with me.\u201dMark Roth is a freelance writer who was an editor and reporter at The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for 33 years, retiring in 2015. He also teaches science writing at Carnegie Mellon University.Scottsdale, Ariz.Somehow, over more than three decades in the Phoenix area, David and Laura Demson, husband-and-wife haircutters, have hopscotched through 10 or so hair-salon locations and raised three children.What goes around comes around, and now their business, Salon Rock, is only 13 doors away from the Scottsdale bar where they first met in 1984 when it was called Cowgirls.David, 54, looks like David Lee Roth, the rock singer, and Laura, 57, looks like Nancy Wilson, the blond guitarist from Heart.Despite their rock star looks, they say they rarely drink, they don\u2019t do drugs, and they regularly attend Grace Chapel, a local evangelical charismatic church.Faith and music, secular and nonsecular, are big parts of their lives.The $100 white guitar that Laura threw out the window after a fight with David hangs on the wall of Salon Rock. The drums from one of David\u2019s first bands, Foreplay, sit next to the cashier\u2019s desk; their daughter, Rain, 21, plays them when they hold a concert in the salon.They have been together for 32 years, and their banter can sometimes turn contentious. Their son, River Jordan Demson, 22, leaves when they start to raise their voices.\u201cI am more of a realist, he\u2019s a dreamer totally,\u201d Laura said of David.What do they argue about? Money. \u201cWhen you have no money, there\u2019s a lot of stress,\u201d Laura said.In their lush periods, mostly in the 1990s (when they were able to charge as much as $150 for a haircut and coloring), they made as much as $100,000 a year. Now they are lucky to make $48,000 a year, slightly below the local median household income of $50,000.A mishandling (by David) of payroll taxes brought large tax penalties from the Internal Revenue Service in 1988 and ruined their credit rating.The 2008 recession hit them especially hard. They had to scrimp and were not able to save. Laura has no savings account. David has the minimum $5 in his. \u201cWe are flying by the seat of our pants,\u201d David said.Money was so tight, the Demsons used food stamps and food banks to get by. David, a diabetic, gets insulin and other treatments under the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the state\u2019s Medicaid agency for low-income people.Recently, the Demsons and two of their children moved in with David\u2019s mother. She has a nearby 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house, fully paid for. \u201cHow do we get by?\u201d David said. \u201cWe live rent-free.\u201dDavid\u2019s mother, Peggy, 84, allowed him to take out a $50,000 second mortgage \u2014 $30,000 to remodel Salon Rock and $20,000 for surgery to reset River\u2019s jaw, flawed since infancy.The couple has given up going to the movies, eating out and vacationing in San Diego. Laura misses makeup and mostly uses the free samples from stores\u2019 bonus programs.\u201cLooking back, I wish our parents, who knew about money, taught us more about money,\u201d said Laura, who was one of eight children. Her father was a General Motors executive, and her mother was a jazz singer.\u201cFor our own kids,\u201d David said, \u201cwe\u2019re teaching by example.\u201dAnthony Ramirez is a former reporter for The New York Times. He has lived in Scottsdale for four years.Tacoma, Wash.Jordan Hightower took her American-history students from the Tacoma School of the Arts to Washington, D.C., in January to witness President Trump\u2019s swearing-in. By the time she and her students traveled back home, Mr. Trump had issued a flurry of executive orders and she was even more assured of the trip\u2019s success.\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting,\u201d said Jordan, 31, a graduate of Washington State University. \u201cI\u2019ve been instructing them that there are limits to the presidency.\u201dJordan, a Democrat, was dismayed to hear that one of the president\u2019s first acts was to suspend a planned cut in housing-loan insurance rates. While the Tacoma housing market is not quite as hot as Seattle\u2019s, prices are escalating. It\u2019s another challenge for millennials trying to buy into the American dream.\u201cAny move on those loan insurance rates can make the difference of $50 or $100 a month,\u201d said Jordan, who has just a small amount of savings.For now, buying a house is on the back burner. When it comes to decisions about money, she factors in an unusually painful but important chapter of personal history.In January 2010, her younger sister was killed in the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti. Molly Hightower had traveled to Port-au-Prince to volunteer with Friends of the Orphans and was working with children when the building they were in collapsed.Her sister\u2019s death made Jordan rethink most things in her life. \u201cOne of the biggest things was my \u2018one day\u2019 mentality,\u201d she said. \u201cI was stockpiling away money, waiting for \u2014 I don\u2019t know: a partner, a better job, more money \u2014 unclear. But I was waiting to do the things I always wanted to do.\u201dWhen her sister died, Jordan was 24. Molly was 22. \u201cI realized that waiting to experience life was stupid because hers had been taken so suddenly and I could be next,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI began living.\u201dFor Jordan, who has two brothers and whose father is a general manager of a steel mill in the Puget Sound area, that meant travel. Over the last seven years, she has visited 23 countries, backpacking for weeks at a time during breaks from her teaching job in Tacoma.\u201cI have run marathons, bought a car, seen hundreds of events and shows \u2014 including musicals, plays, concerts, sporting events \u2014 and have gone to a dozen bachelorette parties around the nation, celebrated friends in a variety of ways and fallen in love,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of those things are worth the small number in my bank account to me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a huge savings,\u201d she said, adding that if something were to happen, she would have support from her parents, Mike and Mary, until she got back on her feet.And now Jordan has another big-ticket financial item on the horizon. When she returned from Washington, D.C., Michael surprised her by proposing. He took her to the pier on the Tacoma harbor, and friends, family members and a photographer were there.\u201cThese weddings are such a burden we put on each other,\u201d Jordan said, referring to herself and her friends. \u201cBut now that I\u2019m getting married, it\u2019s my turn to get back some of the money I\u2019ve spent the past few years!\u201dLaura Vecsey is a freelance writer specializing in real estate news. Previously, she was a sports and political columnist in Harrisburg, Pa.; Baltimore; Seattle; and Albany.Tampa, Fla.\u201cIt\u2019s my passion and it\u2019s my lifestyle,\u201d said Martin, 25, a Mexican-American who is among the first generation of his family to be born in the United States. \u201cIt makes me happy and keeps me sane. I see myself being very successful. At the same time, right now, I have a family to take care of.\u201dAnd that is his priority.Martin and his wife, Raquel, have two daughters, Maria, 6, and Emily, 3. Raquel once worked as a personal banker, but now stays home to raise the children.\u201cIt\u2019s a financial sacrifice, but we don\u2019t want to just drop them at day care and miss out on so much time,\u201d Raquel said. \u201cYou never get that time back. Time is more important than money.\u201dHe has two to three fights a year, and he is paid by performance, plus funds from sponsors and a percentage of the ticket sales. But right now, that doesn\u2019t account for much of his income.Things are looking up. There\u2019s stability, no debt and a rental home for his family that was secured through one of his clients.\u201cEverybody wants a nice house, but I don\u2019t want a mansion, not even a huge house,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI just want comfort for my family. We don\u2019t need a lot of material things. Maybe I\u2019d like to take them on a nice family vacation, something like that.\u201cPeople say they\u2019d like to win the lottery. I don\u2019t think I do. Money can\u2019t buy you happiness. That mind-set starts young. When you come from nothing or very little, you tend to appreciate everything you have. I\u2019m more grateful for that than almost anything.\u201dMartin\u2019s parents, Ignacio and Gloria, immigrated from Mexico and raised five children, mostly in New Jersey before moving to Florida. His father was a truck driver, and Martin sometimes accompanied him on long trips as he hauled cargo. His mother was a delivery person who had regular work throughout New York\u2019s office buildings, including the Twin Towers.\u201cI can\u2019t say we were comfortable because it was a constant financial struggle,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut my parents did their best. Compared to where they came from, our life was luxurious,\u201d even when the family living space was about 800 square feet shared by seven people, a small home attached to the Mexican restaurant they operated.Martin first met Raquel when they were in high school, working at competing fragrance kiosks at the mall. At first, she was suspicious of her business rival, but was soon won over by his kindhearted personality and ambition.It has not always been easy and fun. In one of their first apartments, they could not pay the electric bill, so they ate Chick-fil-A by candlelight, telling their oldest daughter that it was a camping party.\u201cMoney is not going to determine our happiness,\u201d Raquel said. \u201cI believe in Martin. We\u2019re going to be just fine.\u201dMartin said that his parents opened his eyes and taught him \u201cthere\u2019s a very big world out there. We have a lot of opportunity in this country.\u201cI feel I can do anything. I just happen to be a fighter. That\u2019s what I know. We\u2019re so much better off than most people. I\u2019m young and have a beautiful family. I am living the dream.\u201dJoey Johnston was a sportswriter at The Tampa Tribune and St. Petersburg Times for 36 years until 2016. A lifelong resident of Tampa, he is now president of Johnston Communications.DallasAnna Hill exudes confidence. She founded a community group and routinely faces down City Hall officials over conditions in Dolphin Heights, her lower-income neighborhood in southeast Dallas.Behind her self-assurance, however, the 76-year-old worries about being able to pay her mortgage.In 1990, after renting for much of their lives, Anna and her husband, Daniel, bought a 936-square-foot two-bedroom house, built in 1923, for $17,500. In 1992, they decided to buy life insurance so they could pay off the house if one of them died. But Daniel died the day before they were supposed to sign the papers.\u201cThat was kind of a hard time,\u201d Anna said. She was making good money, she said, as a home health care contractor. But her mother fell and she needed to take care of her full time. Now Anna is the sole caregiver for her mother, who is 98. An 88-year-old friend also lives with them.For her live-in friend, who has glaucoma, out-of-pocket medical expenses in the first five weeks of 2017 reached $1,000.\u201cI hear people at the pharmacy counter say, \u2018Just put that back because I\u2019ve got to buy food,\u2019\u201d Anna said. Unexpected medical bills are a big worry. \u201cTo be honest, that keeps me awake.\u201dShe dislikes credit. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in what you need, you get,\u201d she said. She saved for two and a half years to pay cash for a five-burner gas range. \u201cWe don\u2019t really eat out,\u201d she said. \u201cI do all the cooking.\u201dSometimes Anna has had to borrow: to buy the house; to replace the heating and air-conditioning, for which she still owes $500; and for new windows to reduce utility bills. The hardest lesson she\u2019s learned about money: \u201cBudget.\u201dShe has her indulgences: She tends the community garden next door and drinks the occasional glass of white wine.\u201cMy biggest luxury is Sunday school and church,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I miss, I get grumpy.\u201dShe traces her feelings about money to her grandmother, who raised her and her brother until Anna was 12. They lived in servants\u2019 quarters in a white neighborhood near downtown Dallas.Her grandmother supported them by taking in laundry from detectives, police officers and businessmen, washing their white shirts in a black three-legged pot and hanging them on a line. \u201cWe never went without anything,\u201d Anna said. \u201cKnowing what I know now, I know it was hard.\u201d\u201cWe grew up happy,\u201d she added. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201dShe voted for Hillary Clinton because she objected to President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall and his characterizations of immigrants. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I would have voted for her just because of the economy,\u201d Anna said.But her friends see hardened attitudes \u2014 reinforced since the election \u2014 toward the poor. \u201cSome of them are scared,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them are worried that they\u2019ll wind up back on the street.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t think that four years from now, when she is 80, economic conditions for people in her situation will be great. But \u201cI\u2019ll be O.K.,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I know how to do without.\u201dRandy Lee Loftis is a freelance journalist focusing on environment, science and history.

{"Headline": "Members of the Italian Band Soviet Soviet Are Deported", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byMembers of the Italian postpunk trio Soviet Soviet, booked to play at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., were detained in Seattle on Wednesday and eventually deported by United States Customs and Border Protection officials as immigration enforcement under the Trump administration continues to cause tension.In addition to visa waivers, Soviet Soviet members traveled with an invitation from South by Southwest festival organizers, as well as a letter from the band\u2019s United States label, Felte Records, indicating that the trio\u2019s performances would be purely promotional.Jeff Owens, who runs Felte, said in an email on Sunday that it is possible that Soviet Soviet\u2019s travel permits were not foolproof, but argued that independent bands and labels face an unclear and burdensome process when attempting to obtain work visas.He also lamented the way the band members were treated by customs officials, saying that \u201cthey were not a threat and genuinely thought they had the proper paperwork.\u201dHe said that he was scheduled to speak with the band on Tuesday for the first time since their deportation.On Facebook, Soviet Soviet said that its three members were separately interrogated for four hours before they were handcuffed and taken to jail, and that they were denied the opportunity to make phone calls.\u201cWe were relieved to fly back home and distance ourselves from that violent, stressful and humiliating situation,\u201d the post said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside John Calipari\u2019s Media Empire", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byLEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 John Calipari, residue from that morning\u2019s Ash Wednesday service smudged on his forehead, unbound his iPad\u2019s leather case and showed a visiting reporter its gleaming sky-blue desktop.\u201cIt\u2019s never off,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know how to turn it off.\u201dCalipari, 58, Kentucky\u2019s successful and controversial basketball coach, does not have a computer in his office overlooking the Wildcats\u2019 practice gym. He does not know how to post Facebook updates or messages on Twitter. He does not, he said, even use email.\u201cWe\u2019re going to give out our message,\u201d Calipari said this month, \u201cbut they\u2019re also going to be able to see who I am, who my friends are, what I do, what I read \u2014 and it\u2019s not filtered through anybody.\u201dNew technology has allowed Calipari to do the same type of thing, only on a much grander scale.\u201cHis major was marketing,\u201d said Scott, now a senior director in communications at ESPN, \u201cand he\u2019s used it every day of his life.\u201dThe internet and social media have eliminated the costs of printing and distribution, making anyone a potential publisher. From political campaigns to corporations to celebrities, organizations or individuals that in the past depended on traditional media outlets for their messaging now communicate directly with voters, consumers and fans.This autonomy is especially crucial for Calipari, who stands atop perhaps the most obsessed-over college sports program this side of Alabama football; who seeks a prominent public profile, at least partly to aid the all-important endeavor of recruiting; and who in the past, he acknowledges, has been fitted with the \u201cblack hat.\u201dNotoriety and negative coverage have long trailed Calipari, a Hall of Fame coach known for his brash personality and disruptive methods, along with his teams\u2019 consistent success. The N.C.A.A. vacated his Final Four runs with two previous teams, UMass and Memphis, and it takes only a few keystrokes to find someone criticizing his embrace of the so-called \u201cone-and-done\u201d strategy \u2014 recruiting talented prospects who expressly aspire to enter the N.B.A. after a single season in college.While in the past, Calipari said, he could not effectively combat reports or columns that cast him or his team in a bad light, that is no longer true.\u201cIn the old days, you had to wait,\u201d said Calipari, describing how he would respond to slights or what he viewed as misinformation earlier in his career. \u201cYou can get on a day later on the radio, but it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s already singed in their mind.\u201dToday \u2014 with the aid of full-time staff members in Kentucky\u2019s sports information and image operations, who transcribe and publish the thoughts and musings of the tech-illiterate coach \u2014 things are different. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI can respond in 30 seconds.\u201dThe newest addition to Calipari Inc. is Cal Cast \u2014 Calipari\u2019s podcast, a breakout by a major active coach. After only three months and 15 episodes, it has more than a million listens. Calipari has hosted fellow coaches, businessmen, basketball commentators and his good friend Drake.

{"Headline": "AT&T and Johnson & Johnson Pull Ads From YouTube", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byAT&T and Johnson & Johnson, among the biggest advertisers in the United States, were among several companies to say Wednesday that they would stop their ads from running on YouTube and other Google properties amid concern that Google is not doing enough to prevent brands from appearing next to offensive material, like hate speech.\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re trying harder \u2014 that\u2019s insufficient,\u201d Mr. Wieser said of Google. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to understand the scale of the perceived problem.\u201dThe company has defended itself by noting that it prevents ads, which are placed on websites automatically, from running near inappropriate material \u201cin the vast majority of cases.\u201d It also said it added thousands of sites to its ad network every day, as well as 400 hours of video to YouTube every minute.Still, several advertisers, seeking more accountability, have pulled some of their ad spending. They include the British government, The Guardian, the pharmaceutical company GSK and the French advertising multinational Havas.Now, the issue is taking hold with American advertisers, with the car rental company Enterprise announcing a temporary halt of spending on YouTube on Wednesday. Verizon, while it did not mention Google or YouTube by name, said Wednesday that it would suspend \u201call digital nonsearch advertising inventory\u201d after learning its ads \u201cwere appearing on nonsanctioned websites,\u201d which presumably included ads on YouTube and websites in Google\u2019s ad network.AT&T said in its statement: \u201cWe are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won\u2019t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google\u2019s nonsearch platforms.\u201dJohnson & Johnson said it \u201chas decided to pause all YouTube digital advertising globally to ensure our product advertising does not appear on channels that promote offensive content.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe take this matter very seriously and will continue to take every measure to ensure our brand advertising is consistent with our brand values.\u201dGoogle, in response to the actions, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual customers, but as announced, we\u2019ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear.\u201dGoogle has become the largest seller of advertising on the internet by pairing its vast network of content \u2014 its own and other publishers\u2019 \u2014 with businesses large and small looking to grab eyeballs moving from traditional media to the web. The company\u2019s ad business generated $22.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, about 85 percent of the total revenue in the period by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. The biggest part of that still comes from search advertising.While the pullback from major brands is a public relations blow, it is unclear if it will have much of an effect on that vast ad business. The underlying dynamic of advertising\u2019s shift from TV toward the internet remains unchanged, and YouTube is still the largest player in the web video game.Still, AT&T was one of the top five advertisers in the United States last year, spending nearly $1 billion through November, according to data from Kantar Media. Mr. Wieser said its size would certainly cause other marketers, and investors, to take note.\u201cEventually, they\u2019ll respond appropriately,\u201d Mr. Wieser, who cut his recommendation on Google shares to hold, from buy, early this week, said of the company, citing \u201cglobal repercussions\u201d from the moves in Britain. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to just see a significant business go away.\u201dWhereas advertisers usually get strict assurances about how and where their ads will be placed on television and in print publications, Google and other internet players like Facebook do not provide the same oversight. That is because of the volume of websites they deal with, because of the fact that they have less direct control over the content uploaded to those sites and because algorithms, rather than humans, place the majority of ads.Google\u2019s policies prohibit ads on video content deemed to be pornographic, inciting violence or promoting illegal behavior. The company uses software to comb YouTube titles and images to flag potentially inappropriate content, but by its own admission, these methods are not perfect. Marketers also have the option of prohibiting their ads from appearing next to certain types of content, such as videos featuring profanity.\u201cAlthough it is effective in dealing with the highly fragmented nature of the digital ad world, programmatic buying is still evolving as a business practice \u2014 and it appears that technology has gotten ahead of the advertising industry\u2019s checks and balances,\u201d Laura Bryant, a spokeswoman for Enterprise, said in a statement. \u201cThere is no doubt there are serious flaws that need to be addressed.\u201dProgrammatic advertising and YouTube represent two major initiatives for Alphabet. The shift to searches on smartphones has pushed down the prices for Google\u2019s main search ads, heightening the importance of new areas of growth.Google does not break out revenue from either business but has trumpeted both during earnings calls. Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts in January that Google had only \u201cscratched the surface\u201d for what it could do with YouTube and programmatic advertising.\u201cWe remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped,\u201d she said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the place in California where Google\u2019s complex is.

{"Headline": "On Banning Leaf Blowers", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported by360 ViewNew Yorkers who leave the city for the suburbs often do so for three reasons: schools, space and silence. The silence, it turns out, can be a problem.Most suburban streets are certainly free of blaring horns, wailing sirens and, sometimes, even people. But come springtime, they vibrate with the hum of lawn mowers, edgers, trimmers and leaf blowers; the accompanying noise continues until the last leaves fall from the trees in early December.In Maplewood, N.J., the desire to keep all that space manicured is on a collision course with a longing for quiet.\u201cI never in my wildest dreams thought this leaf blower issue would have been so controversial,\u201d said Nancy Adams, 59, the deputy mayor of Maplewood and a driving force behind the new rule.Most landscapers use leaf blowers with two-stroke engines, which are light enough to carry but produce significant exhaust and noise. The gas and oil mix together, and about a third of it does not combust. As a result, pollutants that have been linked to cancers, heart disease, asthma and other serious ailments escape into the air.Two seemingly unrelated trends may also be contributing to the problem. The number of people working from home is growing and so too is the lawn care industry. Between 2002 and 2016, the number of professional ground maintenance workers, including supervisors, grew by 85 percent to 1.6 million, according to Quiet Communities.What does it look like when those two forces collide? For that, I spoke with Susan Greeley, 48, a film programmer who works out of her three-bedroom house in Maplewood. She moved from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, three years ago in search of quiet but has instead found this: Every Tuesday, the landscapers arrive at 8 a.m. For the next seven hours, they move from one house to the next, filling her home with cacophony.At times, the noise is so loud she has to retreat to the basement to take work calls, and she is unable to watch the films she needs to review. \u201cWe were basically trapped in our home with this deafening noise and this disgusting smell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s far beyond an annoyance.\u201dLast year\u2019s ban, she said, \u201cwas fantastic,\u201d reducing the intrusion substantially.But landscaping troubles are not universal. After all, misery is relative. Erika Imranyi, 38, a book editor who moved from Jersey City to South Orange, next to Maplewood, in November finds her new neighborhood \u201ceerily quiet,\u201d although she has yet to experience a suburban summer.\u201cThere was one car alarm in Jersey City that would go off constantly,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt would honk for a few minutes and then stop, and you\u2019d have this moment of relief, and then suddenly it would start again and you\u2019d think you were losing your mind. I\u2019ll take a leaf blower any day.\u201dJames Nathenson, 68, a retired banker who lives in Maplewood, said, \u201cIt\u2019s never been to me an issue that is worthy of a lot of agitation.\u201d Instead of passing new laws, Mr. Nathenson suggests that the town enforce existing rules that limit hours and decibels. \u201cSee how that works,\u201d he said.\u201cThe local judge knows him well,\u201d said his wife, Patricia C. Kenschaft, 77, a retired math professor who mows her lawn with a manual reel mower. \u201cHe usually wins.\u201dUltimately, landscapers say that restrictions breed shabbier results. \u201cThe properties aren\u2019t as pretty as we\u2019d like them to be,\u201d said Alan Bella Jr., a landscaper who services Maplewood. \u201cIt comes down to cosmetics.\u201dCosmetics, though, are a matter of taste.

It looked quite satisfying, to tell the truth. Next time I have a hard day at the office, I\u2019m going to go look for a big truck.Under rules created last October by the Federal Communications Commission, Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and other broadband providers had to ask your permission to track your online behavior to sell for advertising purposes. On a party-line vote, Republicans in the Senate decided that was too onerous. If the measure passes the House and gets President Trump\u2019s signature, broadband companies will be free to track you without your permission.This whole thing is clearly in no way justifiable in the name of consumer protection. The reason there isn\u2019t more outrage about this, in my opinion, is that it\u2019s far too technical of an issue for normal people to get up in arms about unless translated into plain English and publicized.More and more ads are being sold \u201cprogrammatically\u201d \u2014 that is, through financial algorithms run by computers rather than by human marketers determining the exact placement of any given spot. But it\u2019s not clear that the big programmatic companies, of which Google is the largest and most powerful, have perfected ways to keep prominent brands off some of the seedier corners of the internet.But how do you deal with ads that appear on videos that have racist or xenophobic content in them? Doesn\u2019t that get into the realm of sentiment analysis? Isn\u2019t that difficult to handle in the long term? I feel like that requires the aid of artificial intelligence, a field that C.E.O.s have admitted still needs help understanding very human issues.The other side of this lies with the folks who have to write up the community guidelines around what constitutes racism and hate speech, an area into which companies like Google and Facebook have increasingly been drawn as reluctant arbiters of speech. That\u2019s the last place they want to be headed, but I think they won\u2019t have much of a choice.My guess on how this plays out: A bunch of brands will yank ads. YouTube will come out with some rewritten policy on community guidelines that\u2019s somewhat more hardline against certain kinds of speech, but still relatively squishy. Brand advertisers will reinsert their ads on YouTube. The heat will go away. Life will steadily march on.Speaking of that, I\u2019m going to go enjoy life and find a truck horn to honk. See you.Advertisement"}

When Ms. Carroll moved back to the United States in 2003, other events would influence her project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction, as she began the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDraped\u00e2\u0080\u009d portion of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnonymous Women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Carroll and her husband bought a 1950s ranch home in Indiana, and she began to decorate, combing antique shops and estate sales for vintage fabrics that would adorn both her house and, later, her models. At the same time, her niece, a logistics officer in the Marine Corps, was stationed in Iraq. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was devastated and worried about her, then I really started worrying about the women in Iraq,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Carroll said. It weighed on her that she was engaging with her own domestic sphere, her dream house where she had a chance to do \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis sort of obsessive fun renovation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while the households of many women in Iraq were being destroyed.  Her portraits reflect on the notion of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity being contingent upon the belongings that surround them, with arrangements that call to mind religious head coverings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 burqas, hijab, habits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that signal specific roles.It was no accident \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ms. Carroll went to Catholic school for 12 years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy whole visual vocabulary comes from the Virgin Mary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughed. Each image tells a different story. In the \u00e2\u0080\u009cReconstructed\u00e2\u0080\u009d part of the series, the figures of women merge into the cluttered materials around them, and the Anonymous Woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity is eclipsed by the objects and belongings that weigh her down. When Ms. Carroll constructs a scene, she often begins with an object \u00e2\u0080\u0094 vintage curtains from her house, a lamp from her collection \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and arranges an environment that engulfs the woman within it. She hired a small team to help her build scenes and used mannequins for those that took longer, sometimes days, to set up. The project is still ongoing. Its latest chapter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d brings the death of the Anonymous Woman, who is \u00e2\u0080\u009ceither being completely overwhelmed by her stuff, or going crazy, or the stuff taking her over in some way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some of the depictions of death were inspired by the board game \u00e2\u0080\u009cClue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where someone is killed in each room with an everyday household object.

{"Headline": "Erdogan Calls Dutch \u2018Nazi Remnants\u2019 After Turkish Minister Is Barred", "Date": "2017-03-11", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The Dutch government on Saturday intensified a diplomatic dispute between Turkey and its NATO allies in Europe by refusing to let the Turkish foreign minister fly into the Netherlands to campaign on behalf of a referendum that would augment the power of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.French officials, however, allowed the Turkish minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to attend and speak at a gathering of Turks in Metz, a city in the northeast, on Sunday. Germany and Switzerland have banned similar gatherings where Turkish officials were to speak.Mr. Rutte, whose party is in a tight race with Geert Wilders\u2019s anti-Islam party in the elections set for Wednesday, said on Sunday that it was important for his government not to give in to Turkish pressure.\u201cTurkey is a proud nation; the Netherlands is a proud nation. We can never do business under those sorts of threats and blackmail,\u201d he said, referring to Turkey\u2019s threat of sanctions.The Turkish leader is eager to campaign in Europe to bolster the referendum\u2019s chances because several million Turks live there, principally in Germany and France. An estimated 400,000 Turks reside in the Netherlands and many have dual nationality, according to the Dutch government.The votes of European Turks on the referendum, scheduled for April, could make the difference between Mr. Erdogan\u2019s gaining more power or being checked by his people.This debate is playing out on many levels, both for Turks and for the Dutch, with the subtext being whether the referendum is acceptable to a majority of Turks living in the Netherlands who have two passports and two identities.\u201cThe Dutch-Turkish society here is still with one leg in their mother country,\u201d said Enis Odaci, the deputy editor of the Nieuwwij news website.\u201cAnd now Erdogan comes along and asks loyalty. He says, \u2018Give me your vote because you are Turkish people,\u2019 not Dutch-Turkish, German-Turkish or French-Turkish. And that is very, very delicate in the international debate about Islam and integration and migration.\u201dMr. Odaci, whose father came to the Netherlands from Turkey decades ago, added: \u201cDutch politics and politicians are questioning how can you contribute to this Dutch society, but you are still willing to vote for a man who is heading toward a dictatorship or a theocracy. What the Dutch are asking is: \u2018Can you have two loyalties? Can you have two identities?\u2019\u201dThe diplomatic row comes as the nation\u2019s parliamentary elections are set for March 15. Mr. Rutte\u2019s party is running slightly ahead of Mr. Wilders\u2019s far-right Party for Freedom, which opposes immigration and campaigns against any overt signs of Islam in Dutch society.Mr. Wilders vocally opposed the visit by the Turkish foreign minister in recent days, and Mr. Rutte, who is trying to maintain his narrow lead, soon took the same line. Now other Dutch politicians are voicing their approval of the government\u2019s latest move.Adding to the growing crisis was a tense standoff outside the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam on Saturday night, when Turkey\u2019s family and social policies minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, tried to attend the gathering there but was escorted back to the German border, according to The A.P.Mr. Erdogan continued to denounce the Dutch move on Sunday, saying that the Netherlands would \u201cpay the price\u201d for the \u201cshameless\u201d treatment of the foreign minister.Whether blocking the campaigning will achieve the Dutch politicians\u2019 goal is not clear. Mr. Odaci, the editor, said that in a way, the Dutch handed Mr. Erdogan a weapon with which to rally Dutch-Turks from afar by declaring them second-class citizens deprived of freedom of speech.Some of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents, however, have noted that while the Turkish president is vigorously defending his right to free speech in Europe, he is eroding that right for Turks at home.Christopher F.

{"Headline": "How a Money-Losing Snap Could Be Worth So Much", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Common SenseTesting the upper limits of valuation, Snap\u2019s investors are betting on the kind of rapid growth that few, if any, companies have ever achieved.Supported byBy now, even most of us over 35 \u2014 old age, by Snapchat standards \u2014 are aware of the photo sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial America.Even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that self-destruct, or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow, turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts, you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $34 billion.At that price, Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook \u2014 not to mention such internet stalwarts as Google, Amazon and even Netflix \u2014 look like bargain-basement \u201cvalue\u201d stocks.Snap \u201clooks tremendously overvalued to me,\u201d said Brian Hamilton, a co-founder of Sageworks, a financial analysis and valuation firm.Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Snap as a \u201cfield of dreams.\u201d Even with rosy growth forecasts, \u201cat $22 billion, we\u2019re looking at a stock trading at five to eight times estimated revenues in 2020,\u201d he said before the valuation rose even higher. \u201cThe only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba, and they have massive scale. And both of them are profitable.\u201dMajor I.P.O.s of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992.So let\u2019s be generous and ignore profit. How about revenue? Snap said it generated $404 million in sales in 2016. A valuation of $34 billion is about 84 times revenue.That\u2019s six times as high as Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio, which is 14. It\u2019s 14 times as high as Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which trades at just over six times revenue. Amazon trades at a mere three times. Even high-flying Netflix trades at seven times.Compared with Snap, however, those are mature companies, whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as they\u2019ve aged. As Mr. Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry Gold put it in a recent note to clients: \u201cThere is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all. The sky\u2019s the limit and history is not a guide.\u201dTo justify a valuation of even $25 billion, \u201cyou have to make some very lofty assumptions,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cThey would need to grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent, which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly.\u201d He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the history of American business.But let\u2019s ignore revenue, too. This is social media, after all, where \u201cdaily active users\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d are the coins of the realm.And $1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for Snap. At $34 billion, each of Snap\u2019s daily active users is worth $215, six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for Instagram.As of January, Instagram reported 300 million daily active users. At $215 each, the Instagram app alone would be valued today at $64.5 billion.These are static numbers, and what Snap is selling investors is growth. According to Snap\u2019s prospectus, Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016, about the same as the year before. If it can pull that off again next year, it would reach an impressive 234 million users, though still short of Instagram.The Snapchat story \u201cis all about growth,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about economics.\u201dBut Snapchat\u2019s growth slowed sharply in last year\u2019s fourth quarter \u2014 just about the time Instagram started its own version of Stories, a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos. It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters.By comparison, 150 million Instagram users are now using its Stories feature. That\u2019s already nearly as many as Snapchat\u2019s entire user base.Maybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user, even if its user base doesn\u2019t grow all that much. It\u2019s currently generating an average of $5.83 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebook\u2019s North American average of $12.81, the MoffettNathanson analysis notes, suggesting plenty of room to grow.But even doubling revenue doesn\u2019t get Snap close to a Facebook valuation.There are, of course, superhigh revenue and user-growth assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuation.Still, very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels (and I looked for some). The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as $30 billion. But that\u2019s based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of $3.8 billion in 2018.Mr. Gold said some investors were buying into the I.P.O., but not to hold Snap for the long term. \u201cPeople are saying they\u2019ll wait for a valuation that\u2019s truly astronomical, and then take the other side of the bet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run into trouble over the next few quarters.\u201dDespite many of its somewhat juvenile features, at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate, substituting images for language. \u201cSnapchat has built a better mousetrap,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s engaging, and it\u2019s fun, especially for young people.\u201dThat\u2019s a story that obviously appealed to investors starving for the next hot social media company. Whether they\u2019ll want to cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains to be seen.\u201cThis looks and smells like Twitter to me,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time, if ever, before they see any meaningful appreciation.\u201dAbout the best Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Gold could come up with: Snap\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t \u201cpatently crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today\u2019s introduction comes to us from Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief.Asif Mahmood was born in a small village in rural Pakistan. He came to the United States 26 years ago to study medicine, and is today a pulmonologist in Pasadena. At age 56, he has decided to run for lieutenant governor of California.\u201cThe divisive and hateful agenda of Donald Trump compels me to run,\u201d Dr. Mahmood said Tuesday in an interview. \u201cI am a proud Muslim. I am a Muslim immigrant. I am from the state of California. I am a triple threat to Donald Trump.\u201dDr. Mahmood will officially announce his first bid for public office Wednesday morning. The election is in November 2018. If elected, he would perhaps be the first Muslim to hold statewide office in California. That said, there are already a number of Muslims in public office across the country, including two Muslims in Congress, according to Mohammed Nadeem, the executive director of the Muslim Observer, which tracks these kinds of elections. (And in Michigan, a Muslim man is running for governor.)Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the incumbent, is barred by term limits from seeking a third term; he is running for governor. This is not one of the highest-profile jobs in the state, but, it can be a steppingstone for anyone hoping to run for governor. (Case in point: Mr. Newsom.)So far, only one other person, a state senator, has signaled that he\u2019s running. Still, as a newcomer to politics, Dr. Mahmood certainly has an uphill climb here. He has retained Ace Smith, one of the state\u2019s top Democratic political consultants, to run his race. Mr. Smith said Dr. Mahmood would probably need between $1 million to $3 million to mount a campaign, and seemed confident he could raise it.Dr. Mahmood said his experience as a doctor gave him credentials to campaign on health care reform. He did not dispute that he was a bit of a long-shot. But Dr. Mahmood said he did not think his religion would be an obstacle in California, of all states.\u201cThere might be a small segment of people who feel that way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am a proud Muslim and a proud immigrant and I love America. I deal with Americans every day. And when you help them they are totally appreciative of that.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)For others, the move was a reminder of the first time the Raiders left Oakland.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Low-Energy Intruder Hangs Out in a High-Tech Home", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byCrime SceneThe person who entered the apartment was not the one who was expected there, and as of that moment in February, a modern, Brooklyn version of \u201cGoldilocks and the Three Bears\u201d played out over a night and a day, the cold porridge and broken chair replaced by fast Wi-Fi and weed.Once upon a time, a 26-year-old software developer named Sam moved into an apartment in Williamsburg. That was about four months ago. He was traveling in Argentina on business in February, so he joined what has become a cottage industry in New York City, listing his home on a website for short-term rentals.On Feb. 22, he was contacted by a potential client: Meg from California, who wanted the place that very night. Short notice, but Sam, who asked that his last name be withheld because he was the victim of a crime, agreed for one reason.\u201cShe had excellent reviews,\u201d Sam recalled last week by telephone from Argentina. He quoted one: \u201cMeg leaves the place cleaner than when she found it.\u201d So he agreed and explained where Meg could find the keys.Sam keeps a motion-activated camera in his apartment trained on his front door when he is away. It is not hidden, and he said he told guests about it upfront, and invited them to unplug it if they wanted. It is one of several gadgets he owns, along with an Amazon Echo, the voice-controlled speaker and personal assistant.Hours after his exchanges with Meg, he received a picture sent by the camera, taken moments earlier. It showed a man, alone, entering the apartment with a duffel bag.Suspicious, Sam texted Meg: \u201cWere you able to get in?\u201dCame the reply: \u201cYes, Sam,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe already feel at home. LOL.\u201dSam was skeptical \u2014 \u201cI thought it was strange that he was speaking as though another person was with him,\u201d he said \u2014 but he let it go.All was quiet for a few hours. Then Sam received another alert from his camera, this one regarding its air-quality monitor, which detected an airborne foreign substance.\u201cThis guy is smoking weed,\u201d Sam said.At about the same time, Sam received yet another alert, from Amazon, seeking verification of his recent spoken-command purchase using the Echo \u2014 an iPhone 7.Sam texted: \u201cWhy are you ordering an iPhone on my credit card?\u201dAccording to Sam, the man replied: \u201cSorry, I was just curious.\u201d Sam gained access to the camera feed. \u201cHe was just doing weird stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWalking around naked.\u201d The man noticed the camera and turned it toward the wall, and, a while later, turned it back.Sam pulled up Meg\u2019s account information, he said, and noticed a cellphone number he had not seen before. He called, and Meg herself answered. He explained the situation.She looked at her account and saw trouble, Sam said. She told him that someone had used her account to book a recent string of back-to-back stays in apartments, and the apartment owners had reported damage, Sam said. Any negative feedback they may have written had not yet appeared.\u201cYou should call 911,\u201d Meg told him. \u201cI have no idea who is in your apartment.\u201dSam found he could not call 911 from Argentina, so he called his local police precinct in Greenpoint. It was around 2 a.m. on Feb. 23 in Brooklyn, and the officer who answered said there was nothing she could do, Sam recalled.\u201cA renter needs to be physically present to report a break-in,\u201d Sam said he had been told. (The police said last week that at that time, any dispute sounded civil in nature, and not criminal, because Sam had agreed to rent out his home.)In Williamsburg, the man was tucking himself in for the night, his sole companion Alexa, the name of the Echo\u2019s virtual assistant, who records every command that comes her way.\u201cHe turned off the music, turned off the lights,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHe asked Alexa for a bedtime story.\u201dSorry, Alexa replied. I don\u2019t have any audiobooks in Sam\u2019s library right now.In Argentina and feeling helpless, Sam turned to Facebook.\u201cSomeone broke into my apartment last night and is sleeping in my bed right now (creepy),\u201d Sam wrote.His friends responded: \u201cOMG.\u201d \u201cSorry this is happening bro.\u201d One offered to go to the building, call 911 and report an intruder.The next morning, the man awoke and, according to Sam, threw all his clothes in the washing machine. He took a picture of the gloomy scene out a window, the skyline shrouded in fog, and posted it on his own Facebook page. \u201cThis weather,\u201d it read in part, with no indication of where he was.Sam\u2019s friend arrived and called the police. Sam, about 5,500 miles away, watched his camera as officers arrived.\u201cThey opened the door and had their guns out,\u201d he said.The officers arrested the man in the apartment, and Sam posted a photo of him leaving in handcuffs. The police identified him as Amir Lewis, 21, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn. He was charged with burglary and trespassing. His lawyer declined to comment on Thursday.Sam returned to the country and his apartment on Friday and discovered a final indignity in the kitchen, one that would have been familiar to those three bears.\u201cHe baked a pizza,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHe cleaned out my fridge and freezer.\u201dThe End.Advertisement"}

Among them are overeager suitors (\u201cCan I recharge your mobile?\u201d), tremulous supplicants (\u201cI am talking to you, madam, but my body is shaking\u201d) and the occasional heavy breather (\u201cI want to do the illegal things with you\u201d).India is justly proud of its mobile-phone revolution. Call tariffs are among the world\u2019s cheapest, and competition has sent the price of broadband plummeting. An estimated 680 million Indians use cellphones now, with three million new ones coming online every month. India\u2019s leaders promote mobile platforms as a sign of social progress, a better way to distribute subsidies and obtain information about health care and agricultural conditions.An unintended consequence is that social barriers between men and women are collapsing. Reports of phone stalking have increased exponentially, leading to growing complaints of harassment. But an unknown number of such calls are successful, resulting in what an American anthropologist has labeled \u201cwrong-number relationships.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a new thing,\u201d said Julia Q. Huang, a fellow in the anthropology department of the London School of Economics, who has written a scholarly paper on the practice among young women in Bangladesh. \u201cIt\u2019s covert, it\u2019s risky, it\u2019s experimenting with that outside world which they don\u2019t have much access to.\u201dRecently, a complaint came from Geetika Chakravarty, 24, a makeup artist who grew up traveling the world with her father, a diplomat. After she returned to India from Canada last year, she posted her phone number in the contact section of a salon\u2019s Facebook page and received so many calls from unknown men that she blocked 200 separate numbers.\u201cI do not know what their mind-set is,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they call and say, \u2018I love you.\u2019 Sometimes they call and say, \u2018I want to talk to Sonia,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018I am not Sonia,\u2019 and they would say, \u2018O.K., can I talk to you?\u2019\u201dBut the most persistent among them was from a man who would call three or four times a day, urging her to meet him somewhere. When she blocked his number, he would call from another. She began to worry that he would track her down in person.\u201cHe sounded like a creepy Indian guy to me,\u201d Ms. Chakravarty said.When the police traced the number, the person they found at the end of it was Premsagar Tiwari, whose given name in Hindi translates as \u201cSea of Love.\u201d Mr. Tiwari, 24, turned out to be a high-strung, pencil-necked man who grew up in two small rooms in the corner of the down-at-heel government school where his father worked as a night watchman.Outside his window, young women came and went in their crisp school uniforms. But the night watchman\u2019s son could not approach them.\u201cThe way he was built,\u201d said Satyavir Sachan, the constable assigned to the case, \u201cit didn\u2019t seem he could talk to girls.\u201dPoring through Mr. Tiwari\u2019s call records, Mr. Sachan found that he was using eight SIM cards, some registered under false names, to contact more than 500 women. The activity occupied, by police estimates, two to three hours a day.Summoned to the police station, Mr. Tiwari confessed readily and with clasped hands he beseeched the police not to imprison him. His phone calls, he explained in an interview, should better be understood as part of his search for a soul mate.\u201cOne person is enough to fulfill you,\u201d Mr. Tiwari said. \u201cI have nobody. The person you love will be somewhere, there, standing last in line. You have to reach them somehow. And when you find that someone, you stop looking.\u201dHe said he had heard many stories of men and women meeting over social media and going on to marry.\u201cI may be a failed man,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am very passionate.\u201dThe police were not impressed, and held him in custody for 15 days.An inverse story was unfolding in Bangalore, where Umakanti Padhan, a moon-faced 16-year-old garment factory worker, tried to call her sister-in-law. She misdialed and found herself accidentally conversing with Bulu, a railway worker eight years her senior.She hung up, alarmed. At home, beginning at puberty, she had been prohibited from speaking with any adult man, including her brothers and cousins.Ten minutes later, Bulu called back and told her that he liked the sound of her voice. \u201cWhen I hear your voice, it feels like someone of my own,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like talking to you all the time.\u201dSo she agreed. Every night, she slipped out to the roof of her Bangalore workers\u2019 hostel, where she shares a room with 11 other young women, and spoke to Bulu about mundane things: how their shifts went and what they had eaten that day.\u201cHe\u2019s told me everything that ever happened to him from the time he was a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it is good or bad, but I trust him. I know he will not betray me.\u201dMs. Huang, the anthropologist, said the women she met in Bangladesh were often happy to engage in telephone courtships with anonymous strangers, and some maintained five or six at once. Phone contact, they told her, was safer because it presupposed physical distance. Also, it forced the men on the other end of the line to listen to them for long stretches.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those boundary-expanding experiences that allow you to think about opportunities that were not previously available,\u201d she said. Young women, she said, described these relationships with \u201ckind of a fearful excitement.\u201dFor the young men, she said, \u201cdialing random numbers is like playing the lottery and seeing what comes up.\u201d Often, she said, they approach it almost as a competitive sport, vying to see \u201cwho is more skilled at keeping a woman on the phone for a long time.\u201dAs for Ms. Padhan and her boyfriend, 11 months have passed and they still have not met in person.Her roommates roll their eyes at her na\u00efvet\u00e9.But when their shifts are finished, they, too, retire to stairwells and corners of the rooftop for the covert nightly call. From there, it is possible to look across the rooftops of other boardinghouses and see figures hunched over their cellphones, in all directions, a wide-angle shot of young India in pursuit of love.Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from Lucknow, and Jennifer Harrison from Panjim.Advertisement"}

But there\u2019s more, too.As you reflect, a quick history lesson:Many Irish immigrants began arriving in New York around 1845, fleeing the potato famine.\u201cThe Irish were coming, with all due respect, as the lowest of the low,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. Many settled in what New York once knew as Five Points \u2014 a notorious slum district \u2014 and blocks away from what is now Chinatown and Little Italy.So back to the question: What do we celebrate on St. Patrick\u2019s Day?\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily know if we know,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cI think we\u2019re celebrating more than one thing. If you ask an Irish-American what St. Patrick\u2019s Day means to them, you\u2019re going to find a very different thing than what someone who is 22 and goes to N.Y.U. sees. And maybe that\u2019s the power of the Irish immigrant story.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Call it the luck o\u2019 the Irish.After a week of slush and gusts, we\u2019re getting a break, but it won\u2019t last.Enjoy the sunshine: Snow and rain are likely tomorrow.\u2022 Rangers host Panthers, 7 p.m. (MSG).

The police arrested him on a charge of second-degree murder, but the chief said they wanted to upgrade the charge by classifying it a hate crime.\u201cI\u2019m the person you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Chief Aubry said Mr. Jackson told police officers when he walked into the police substation in Times Square. He had recognized himself in an image from a security camera broadcast on the news Tuesday evening, the chief said.Mr. Jackson told the police that he had chosen New York City to make a statement by attacking black men. He told investigators where he discarded the murder weapon, a 26-inch sword with an 18-inch blade, and told them he was carrying knives in his pocket. Chief Aubry said the police had collected video evidence that seemed to corroborate Mr. Jackson\u2019s account of the evening.\u201cHe was very forthcoming with us,\u201d Chief Aubry said. \u201cHe knew what he was doing when he was coming up here, and he relayed all of that information to us.\u201d\u201cMore than an unspeakable human tragedy, this is an assault on what makes this the greatest city in the world: our inclusiveness and our diversity,\u201d he said.Mr. Caughman walked two blocks to the Midtown South Precinct, where he arrived about 10 minutes after the attack. Officers summoned an ambulance to take him to Bellevue Hospital where Mr. Caughman was later pronounced dead.The police on Tuesday released an image of the suspect wearing a black coat and walking away from the scene of the stabbing. Around 12:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Jackson had turned himself in.Mr. Jackson was handcuffed and dressed in a Tyvek suit to protect evidence on his body when investigators escorted him out of the Midtown South Precinct on Wednesday afternoon. He appeared subdued as he was taken to his arraignment in criminal court in Manhattan, which was not expected to take place until later in the day.The police found two knives in Mr. Jackson\u2019s coat, and later recovered the sword he said he used to kill Mr. Caughman, Chief Aubry said. Investigators were also seeking a warrant to search his cellphone and laptop. Mr. Jackson had a manifesto explaining his desire and plans that he had wanted to deliver to The New York Times, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the investigation is continuing.Mr. Jackson harbored a hatred of black men for more than a decade and came to New York last weekend to attack them, Chief Aubry said.Officials did not say if they knew what had triggered his animosity. Investigators were beginning to plumb his background, including any criminal history or mental health issues, the chief said.Mr. Jackson returned from a deployment to Afghanistan in 2011 and was stationed in Germany before he was discharged, according to information posted on his father\u2019s Facebook page. It is not clear when he was discharged or under what circumstances.An Army spokeswoman did not return an email seeking comment. Calls to numbers listed for his parents in Maryland were not returned on Wednesday.Surveillance video recorded before the fatal attack showed Mr. Jackson following another black man around Midtown though he did not do anything to the man, the police said.\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that it stopped at one, and it wasn\u2019t more,\u201d Chief Aubry said.Emily Palmer and William K.

{"Headline": "In an Era of Fake News, Teaching Students to Parse Fact From Fiction", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byThe sixth graders took their seats in a classroom with a \u201cnews literacy word wall\u201d that featured, in large letters, terms like \u201cvalidity,\u201d \u201caccurate\u201d and \u201creliable.\u201d The teacher, Marisol Solano, said that the question for the day boiled down to this: \u201cHow do we know what\u2019s news or not?\u201dThen she played a four-minute video of a man jumping from an airplane \u2014 without a parachute, the video said. As the class broke into discussion groups, Ms. Solano told the students to concentrate on other questions, about the video: \u201cWould I share this? Would that be responsible of me as a news consumer?\u201dThe teachers see an urgency to news literacy because, on the internet, misinformation can be mistaken for news. Is a tweet ripped from the headlines, or fabricated?And then there is \u201cfake news.\u201d\u201cWe started news literacy even before people started talking about fake news,\u201d said the principal, Carmen Amador. \u201cBut something we always asked students to do, think critically, now has new importance.\u201dUpstairs, a seventh-grade class was grappling with whether an article headlined \u201cFraudulent Clinton Votes Discovered by the \u2018Tens of Thousands\u2019\u201d was trustworthy.The seventh graders are more practiced at news literacy, and it showed. One student evaluated the sourcing: \u201cThey got it from a Trump supporter,\u201d he said. A classmate noted that the article said the website had not independently confirmed the story. The students were skeptical.\u201cYou have to be selective about what you take in and accept as truth,\u201d the teacher, Rema Kaddah, told them. \u201cDon\u2019t accept somebody else\u2019s truth. You\u2019re living in a different world than we grew up in. You need to think about how to arm yourself to fact-check this world.\u201dThe center has been doing that since before Facebook and Twitter reshaped the media landscape and made it easier than ever to spread fake news. A concern is that teenagers who have never known anything but a smartphone as a source for news need to learn to separate fiction from fact as they work their way around the web.But the fight is not just about fake news. \u201cIf you define fake news as news that\u2019s totally fabricated,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s only a small part of a much bigger problem, which is this tsunami of information and misinformation, half-truths, advertising masquerading as news and opinion appearing as if it\u2019s fact-based. That\u2019s the problem, the information stew we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\u201cIntroducing this at the university level is way, way too late,\u201d he said.The ideal time is middle school, he said, when students are internet-savvy but not yet immersed in social media. And their worldviews and political orientations are not fixed as firmly as they will be later on.The video that Ms. Solano played for her class appeared to show a parachutist jumping from a single-engine plane, landing on a trampoline and surviving. The video looked like a news report. It went viral when it was released in 2014.News literacy teaches students to ask, among other things, whether a news article or a video is from a legitimate news organization.That question figured in the way Ms. Solano\u2019s students analyzed the video. A couple of students noticed that the video came not from a major television network but from something identified as Sky Newz, which they realized was not a real news outlet.Most said they would share the video. \u201cThey\u2019re so used to YouTubing and being YouTubers,\u201d Ms. Solano said after class. \u201cThey saw this and they found it to be exciting, and they didn\u2019t question, \u2018Is this real?\u2019\u201dBut Charline Giambrone, 12, was among a handful of students who did question it. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t one name\u201d in the video, she said. \u201cSomeone could just be jumping through a roof and landing on a trampoline.\u201dCharline was right. The video was a clever promotion for a trampoline park in Louisiana. The jump was not real.Advertisement"}

They urge it, framing it as a \u201cwoke\u201d tribe\u2019s message to the slumbering masses, a parable of the hypocrisy that white America harbors and the fear with which black Americans move through it.For his opponents, it has the right timbre of foreboding. For his supporters, it brims with what they surely see as lefty paranoia. If anything ever cried out for a Frank Luntz focus group, it\u2019s \u201cGet Out.\u201d I\u2019ll bring popcorn along with my tape recorder.He wasn\u2019t reflecting the fresh currency of the phrases \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201dHe was moved by the myth that, with Obama\u2019s election, we were entering some postracial era. No small number of liberals bought into that, and \u201cGet Out\u201d is an all-out assault on their complacency, a bloody mockery of it.\u201cGet Out\u201d is being categorized as a horror movie, though Peele prefers the neologism \u201csocial thriller,\u201d and it\u2019s more eerie than violent, with superb pacing that critics are rightly praising. It\u2019s also a reminder that the best horror movies are intensely topical, putting a fantastical, grotesque spin on the tensions of their times.I could subject you to my whole long riff on Vatican II and \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d (Don\u2019t worry: I won\u2019t.) I could link abortion to \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby,\u201d women\u2019s liberation to \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d and Black Lives Matter to \u201cGet Out,\u201d in which black lives matter to the main white characters in only a ghoulish fashion.The ingeniously plotted details of \u201cGet Out\u201d \u2014 not just what\u2019s in the movie, but what\u2019s left out \u2014 gather and distill complaints that black activists, writers and intellectuals have brought to the fore over recent years: the objectification and violation of black bodies; white people\u2019s appropriation of black culture; the trope of the white savior.Kellik Dawson, an 18-year-old freshman at Ithaca College, wrote on Facebook that the \u201ccatharsis of watching that black man\u201d fight back against white oppressors \u201csaved my life.\u201dI swapped emails with Dawson, who is black, on Friday, when he told me that he\u2019d seen the movie twice and would probably buy it as soon as it\u2019s available on DVD. He said that \u201cGet Out\u201d meant so much to him because it \u201cshows the dangers of racism from white liberals\u201d and because white audiences were embracing it even though \u201cit rejected the oldest horror movie formula of the black person dying first.\u201dThat white audience is a notably young one: Exit polls revealed that nearly half of all the people who saw \u201cGet Out\u201d when it opened on the last weekend in February were under the age of 25. Data from the survey organization CinemaScore suggested that this group of moviegoers was especially taken with \u201cGet Out\u201d \u2014 they gave it an average rating of A+. Moviegoers of all ages awarded it an A-, which is still well above the norm for the horror genre.Peele, who is half the TV comedy sketch duo \u201cKey & Peele,\u201d has set a precedent with \u201cGet Out,\u201d becoming the first black writer-director whose debut movie hit that $100 million mark.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airbnb\u2019s Rivals in China Hold Hands in a Nervous New Market", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Sun Huifeng liked the idea of tapping Airbnb or one of its rising local competitors to rent out his spare Beijing bedroom.The problem: He didn\u2019t like the idea of a stranger in his house.\u201cI mainly worry about the quality of guests,\u201d said Mr. Sun, 31, a marketer for an information technology company. \u201cOr, to speak more plainly, I was even worried that some criminals might come.\u201dXiaozhu, a Chinese version of Airbnb, swung into action. It ran him through the company\u2019s guest-vetting system, helped him install a password-based lock on the door to his Beijing apartment and provided bright pink cushions for his sofa. Twice a week, Mr. Sun carefully waters the plants Xiaozhu gave him.Airbnb sees big promise in China, where travel spending reached nearly $500 billion in 2015 thanks to a new generation of domestic tourists. On Wednesday in Shanghai, Airbnb unveiled a new Chinese name \u2014 Aibiying, which means \u201cwelcome each other with love\u201d \u2014 as well as efforts to increase local hiring and deals to draw visitors to Shanghai with offers such as behind-the-scenes visits to the Chinese opera.\u201cOur mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere,\u201d Brian Chesky, Airbnb\u2019s chief executive, said in Shanghai on Wednesday. \u201cIf we are going to achieve our mission of belonging anywhere, anywhere must include China, and anyone must include Chinese travelers.\u201dBut like other global tech firms with an eye on China, Airbnb faces challenges. Chief among them are domestic versions of the site, including Xiaozhu and another rival, Tujia, that offer more local listings. To counter Airbnb\u2019s advantage with cosmopolitan Chinese who may have used its service in New York, Paris or Tokyo, the competitors are taking big steps to educate other skeptical Chinese about renting out \u2014 and crashing in \u2014 a spare bedroom.The cultural barriers are significant. In a country where a home is for family or for investment and tourism is still relatively new for many, the idea of posting homes online for random guests to rent takes some getting used to.\u201cThere is a manager behind every property,\u201d said Kelvin Chen, the chief executive of Xiaozhu. \u201cWe still need time to educate our users.\u201dCrucially, like LinkedIn, another international hopeful in China, Airbnb complies with Chinese laws requiring it to keep Chinese data only on domestically based Chinese servers. That could expose it to requests from the Chinese surveillance authorities to track any of its users. Last year, Airbnb sent a message to its users in China informing them that data would be stored in the country.For Airbnb, which has only about 80,000 listings in China, its more than three million listings around the world put it in a strong position to cater to the millions of Chinese who travel overseas each year. It also has outreach efforts, like informational events for hosts and occasional promotions offering free photography for hosts with apartments they want to rent out.Natasia Guo, a longtime Airbnb host and entrepreneur in China, said most visitors tended to be younger, while the odd middle-aged guest did not seem to understand how the service was supposed to work. Of one 40-year-old guest, she said: \u201cHe treated my place like a hotel. And the reason I say that is he started smoking in the room.\u201d\u201cI think he was using one of our bowls as an ashtray,\u201d she said.Xiaozhu, which has about 140,000 listings, seeks to reassure hosts against such problems. It also works with the internet censorship department and the public security bureau, which helps weed out users with a criminal record. For the benefit of guests, it offers its own cleaning services as well as training events to teach hosts how to get along with customers and decorate their homes.Tujia, a competitor with more than 420,000 listings, more directly manages many of the apartments it showcases, either itself or through management firms. In some cases, it works with property developers sitting on unsold units. For those it does not manage, it conducts inspections and also maintains a blacklist of problematic guests. Many of Tujia\u2019s users stay for a longer period of time or use the properties for vacation.David Wang, 52, a Beijing resident, said his nephew first suggested renting out the spare room in his mother\u2019s courtyard house in the capital. But Mr. Wang\u2019s 89-year-old mother took some persuading. To assuage her concerns, the family segregated the room from the rest of the house, blocking the door to the courtyard, and created a new entryway from the road. Then they installed a closed circuit television. They listed the room on Xiaozhu, which provided linens, a picture frame, lamps, curtains and a small Ikea table.\u201cNow she is happy because every cent from the rent goes into her account,\u201d Mr. Wang said.The companies are counting on younger Chinese to catch on as both hosts and guests. \u201cChinese millennials are keen to have an authentic experience,\u201d said Jens Thraenhart, president of Digital Innovation Asia, which connects Asian tourism business with digital know-how.Zhu Jiamin, a 28-year-old from Shanghai, said he just started hosting on Airbnb, in part because of the positive experiences he had traveling overseas using the site and other services like Couchsurfing. He said he had no problem having long conversations with guests or sometimes showing them around. Other friends rent out apartments and pull out the stops to attract guests.\u201cThey have photos that are way too fancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe places are decorated with flowers, and some of them even hire models, some beautiful girls, for the photos.\u201dMr. Zhu said that he chose to focus more on having meaningful exchanges with people who stay at his place. \u201cYou just feel that their photos don\u2019t represent the people who live there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a home. It\u2019s a fancy place to take photos.\u201dMr. Sun, who received the pink cushions from Xiaozhu, said he had also come to enjoy the company of his guests and the income he received from them, which totals about $300 to $600 a month. One was a Sichuan cook brimming with gossip about the entertainment business. Another played mah-jongg.\u201cMah-jongg is my hobby,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the guests want to play mah-jongg, I get pretty excited.\u201dCao Li and Zhang Tiantian contributed research from Beijing, and Ailin Tang from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Randall\u2019s declarations of fact (the realism of the wave function, for example) are subject to the same caveats. A core argument of my book is that on current issues in fundamental physics there is no consensus. Nobody has the Truth in her pocket. Disagreement nourishes science, but assaults on different schools of thought weaken it.Randall also mischaracterizes my discussion of how modern science builds upon earlier concepts. Of course ancient ideas are not the same as contemporary ones: The entire book is about this difference. There is more history, depth and complexity in contemporary science than what some scientists make of it.CARLO ROVELLIMARSEILLE, FRANCE\u2b25Reading For The Age Of TrumpTo the Editor:Please add another forgotten title to the list of books that resonate in today\u2019s political climate.\u201cWhen the Kissing Had to Stop,\u201d by Constantine FitzGibbon, was first published in England in 1960, and later in the United States.The London Daily Mail said, \u201cIt relegates Orwell\u2019s \u20181984\u2019 and Huxley\u2019s \u2018Brave New World\u2019 to the nursery.\u201d The Sunday Times of London wrote, \u201cThe nightmare has arrived, and its effect persists after the last page.\u201dIt is frightening and sad to reread this novel today.JOY W. BROWNNEW YORK\u2b25A Gospel Account? To the Editor:How excited I was to see a nonfiction review about \u201cPontius Pilate\u201d (March 5). But how disappointed I was to find that the review treated the Gospel accounts \u2014 and Aldo Schiavone\u2019s book \u2014 as if they were modern history. Ignoring the perspective of biblical scholarship does readers a disservice.To interweave the Gospels into a narrative is to create another work of fiction \u2014 and that can be wonderful indeed. In fact, Schiavone\u2019s subtitle is \u201cDeciphering a Memory.\u201d But to state as fact that Pilate tried Jesus, that the Sanhedrin instigated the trial, and that decades later the Gospels retold the dialogue accurately, reduces the Gospels to inaccurate newspaper writing.BRUCE ROBINSONDOHA, QATAR\u2b25The Politics Of \u2018High Noon\u2019To the Editor:In discussing Glenn Frankel\u2019s book \u201cHigh Noon: The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic\u201d (March 5), Peter Biskind addresses the political significance of the film. This has always been one of its most fascinating aspects: John Wayne detested it as an allegory about the blacklist, but it was a favorite of President Eisenhower (and other presidents as well). A poster with an image of Gary Cooper from \u201cHigh Noon\u201d was distributed across Poland to encourage voting for Solidarity in the June 1989 election.

He mentions Irving Berlin, Cole Porter and several other lyricists.Perhaps he didn\u2019t include Ira Gershwin because he is aware that in his \u201cLyrics on Several Occasions,\u201d Gershwin wrote, \u201cSince most of the lyrics in this lodgment were arrived at by fitting words mosaically to music already composed, any resemblance to actual poetry, living or dead, is highly improbable.\u201dMICHAEL TROMBETTAMANHASSET, N.Y.\u2b25Stalin The Reader To the Editor:Surely Simon Sebag Montefiore was jesting when he supported Simon Ings\u2019s notion in \u201cStalin and the Scientists\u201d (March 5) that the Soviet dictator was a sort of philosopher-king. The distinguished Stalin biographer certainly knows what Plato meant by this exemplar of a leader \u2014 and that did not include mass extermination.Stalin\u2019s reading, while extensive, resembles the efforts of Flaubert\u2019s \u201cBouvard and P\u00e9cuchet\u201d with an ideological bias more than it does a sustained education. Also, the principal antagonist of the agronomist-charlatan Lysenko was Andrei Zhdanov\u2019s son (and Stalin\u2019s short-term son-in-law), rather than the man who gave his name to Zhdanovshchina.

{"Headline": "A \u2018Dying Breed\u2019 Taking More Than Its Loud, Local Voice With It", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byMediatorThe reason I fell in love with newspapers \u2014 the printed kind \u2014 was because of the great columnists of the New York City tabloids, whose bylines hit the sidewalks like anvils when the delivery trucks dropped their bundled papers off at newsstands overnight.If you were starting out in journalism when local newspapers were more economically vibrant, as I did, you followed their last names with awe: Kempton, McAlary, Duggan, Hamill, Dwyer, Daly, Collins, Gonzalez. You wanted to be them (or, at least, I did).Their columns lionized the working stiff, gave cops their due when they were heroic \u2014 yet showed them no mercy when they were on the take or being abusive \u2014 and shook City Hall until the corruption and hypocrisy spilled out onto their crisply printed pages.But no name quite defined the genre like that of Breslin, as in Jimmy Breslin, who died Sunday at his home in Manhattan.The phrase is about more than nostalgia (for instance, no one is pining for the gender imbalance of Mr. Breslin\u2019s heyday). It\u2019s about where news is going and, more to the point, where it\u2019s going away, which will have an effect on you and where you live in ways that can be hard to appreciate until it\u2019s too late.But \u201cit used to be that there were many more of them,\u201d the writer Jonathan Alter told me Sunday. Mr. Alter, a former columnist and editor for Newsweek, is co-producing a documentary for HBO about Mr. Breslin and his fellow New York City columnist Pete Hamill. The idea, he said, is to capture \u201cwhat we\u2019ve lost\u201d with the dwindling ranks of big, voicy local writers.\u201cEvery city had somebody who was at least a Breslin wannabe,\u201d he said, \u201cso as a result of that we got a lot of gritty columns that spoke for the average person and connected, spoke to the community. And we\u2019ve really lost that all over the country.\u201dThat point resonates in particular these days given the postelection questions about whether the mainstream news media understood and addressed the frustrations of middle-class Trump supporters.And you can see how that might worsen the partisan divide: If there\u2019s anything that can bring people of all political persuasions together, it\u2019s the stuff of good and angry local columns about bribery at the local planning board or the town hall appointee who raided the public land trust.Along with everything else that\u2019s changing in media, you can blame the internet for this, too.Facebook, Twitter, personal blogs and websites like Medium make it possible for anyone to write a column, leading to a cacophony that can keep any one person from standing out and setting an agenda the way Mr. Breslin did.Now that every news organization, no matter how local, has the potential for national and international reach, \u201cyou\u2019re losing a certain kind of local focus because it\u2019s not exclusively a local medium,\u201d Mr. Alter said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose a sense of community.\u201dAs The Daily News\u2019s editor in chief \u2014 and my former boss \u2014 Arthur J. Browne put it, \u201cToday, of course, you have the digital distribution of journalism, and the rewards may not be there for a big city newspaper column when you\u2019re appealing to a much broader, national audience on the web.\u201dThen you have the economics \u2014 always the economics.The end of Mr. Abouhalkah\u2019s run at The Star must have come as a relief to those he regularly pursued, like Kansas\u2019 governor, Sam D. Brownback, and its secretary of state, Kris Kobach.Getting to a place where you can write an authoritative, hard-charging column that shakes up your city or town takes what Mr. Browne of The Daily News described as \u201cmaturity and seasoning\u201d \u2014 real reporting chops that get the goods and deliver them with impact.But, Mr. Browne said, in terms of young journalists working toward becoming something akin to the Breslins of the past, he wasn\u2019t sure he was \u201cseeing that aspiration right now.\u201d\u201cFar more common is the easy commentary,\u201d he said.It\u2019s a disease worth catching.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt Says 10 Soldiers and 15 Militants Are Killed in Sinai Fight", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byThe deaths underscored the strength of the Sinai insurgency, led by an Islamic State affiliate, despite almost four years of concerted Egyptian counterterrorism operations. In recent months Sinai militants have expanded their area of operations, targeted Christian civilians and fired rockets into Israel.In a statement posted on Facebook, Tamer el-Refai, an Egyptian military spokesman, said the Egyptian soldiers died in two roadside blasts on Wednesday during an operation that had targeted two Islamist storehouses in the deserts of central Sinai, outside their stronghold in the north of the peninsula.Among the soldiers killed were three officers and seven enlisted men, Mr. Refai said.Seven militants were arrested, he said, and explosives, medical supplies, cellphones and four-wheel-drive vehicles were seized.The death totals and other details from the operation could not be independently corroborated as most journalists, Egyptian or foreign, are prohibited from working in Sinai.The sectarian violence drew sharp criticism of Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, from angry Christians and some human rights groups, who said it highlighted the military\u2019s failure to protect citizens against kidnapping and killing. More broadly, the violence seemed to indicate the government\u2019s wavering grip on the area.Mr. Sisi has insisted that his forces are winning the fight. Describing the violence against Christians as \u201ca cowardly plan by evil people,\u201d he last month vowed to intensify counterterrorism efforts in Sinai.Such tough talk has been praised by President Trump, who has described Mr. Sisi as a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d and invited him to visit the White House on April 3. It will be Mr. Sisi\u2019s first visit since coming to power in a 2013 military takeover.International human rights groups have accused Egyptian forces of numerous violations in Sinai, including extrajudicial killings.Describing the deaths as part of a long-running pattern of abuses against civilians in Sinai by the military and the internal security forces, Human Rights Watch called for an independent investigation.The Egyptian military routinely denies any abuses.The fighting in Sinai began in 2013 after the military overthrew the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, and killed hundreds of Islamist supporters who had protested his ouster.The rocket attacks followed Islamic State claims that an Israel drone had killed four of its members in a missile strike just inside the Egyptian border, near Rafah.Advertisement"}

Its population has been stable \u2014 some would say static \u2014 since 2005. But four reporting trips from August to December of last year revealed a civic spirit dragged down by malaise and class divisions. A 2016 survey conducted by an economic development consultant found that the city\u2019s biggest problem was its \u201cdeep and persistent low morale.\u201dThat issue was reflected in a brain drain of Topeka residents.

There were trips hunting dove and turkey with Nathan Triggs, the outdoorsman (some of his classmates called him \u201cthe farmboy\u201d), whose rural, working-class values did not necessarily promote college as the key to success. And there was step-team practice, and filling out college financial aid forms, with TaTy\u2019Terria Gary, the student driven to succeed beyond her circumstances.Also essential to the project were the good will and cooperation of the teachers, the principal, Rebecca Morrisey, and the school district superintendent, Tiffany Anderson, both new to their jobs. Dr. Anderson blew into town from Jennings, Mo., at the beginning of the school year like a hurricane in white sneakers and a skirt suit, vowing to make sure every senior in Topeka\u2019s school system had a plan \u2014 college, technical school, the military or a job \u2014 for after graduation.In December, she called the Topeka High senior class into the school cafeteria. Holding a microphone, she roamed the room and quizzed students about their plans.She passed the mike to a boy who jumped up on a table, smirked and asked, using inappropriate language, how many people in the room that day just didn\u2019t care. Dr. Anderson handled it with grace: \u201cI can\u2019t do more for you than you do for yourself,\u201d she said.It was the answer to the same questions that inspired this story \u2014 and a lesson that Nate, TaTy and Zac each learned in a different way.Advertisement"}

This frenetic online environment has fostered the perfect space for rumormongering, creating a need for fast and accurate ways to counter false narratives.\u201cThere\u2019s more misinformation out there than there was in the past,\u201d said Rasmus Nielsen, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to distribute, and more people are trying to do it.\u201dLike many false reports, much of the misinformation surrounding Mr. Izzadeen turned on a kernel of truth, namely his criminal history.With accusations swirling that Mr. Izzadeen was involved in the London attack, some online voices jumped to his defense to debunk the falsehoods.Sewell Chan contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

Certainly, there were analysts pointing out that it looked overvalued.Caterpillar, a manufacturer of heavy equipment, has been dogged by accusations that it slashed its domestic tax bill by shifting corporate profits from the United States to a subsidiary in Switzerland.A 2014 congressional investigation concluded that a scheme to move cash between the company\u2019s subsidiaries cut its United States tax bill by $2.4 billion over 13 years. A report from the investigation said that Caterpillar worked with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, now PwC, to use sham transactions to transfer $8 billion in profits to a Swiss subsidiary from 1999 to 2012.The transfers were not legitimate business transactions, but done solely to take advantage of a lower tax rate.The 2014 inquiry did not draw conclusions about whether Caterpillar had broken the law, but it appears to have piqued the interest of federal investigators. Caterpillar later received a grand jury subpoena for documents related to these transactions and it said Thursday that the search warrant was related to the investigation into its tax practices.Masayoshi Son, the billionaire technology entrepreneur who promised President Trump 50,000 new jobs in the United States, has grand plans for Sprint.The billionaire and his financial advisers are considering several possible major deals for Sprint, the struggling wireless operator that he controls through SoftBank.One possible deal is a tie-up with T-Mobile U.S., Sprint\u2019s closest competitor. Another is a merger with Comcast, the cable colossus, which would allow him to fulfill a long-held ambition to invest aggressively in wireless networks and next-generation mobile technology in the United States.SoftBank\u2019s pitch could be helped by a possible push for infrastructure investing by the Trump administration, but there are still some questions over how closely regulators would scrutinize potential deals.The donor, Charles C. Spackman, is an entrepreneur known for generous donations to the university, his alma mater.He is based in Hong Kong and leads the Spackman Group, a global investment holding company with $1.5 billion under management.The ruling was part of a long-fought quest by an aggrieved investor to collect on a judgment against Mr. Spackman involving a South Korean business deal.The case could have far-reaching implications for the college, said Douglas A. Kellner, a Manhattan lawyer specializing in recovering hidden assets worldwide.\u201cIf he diverted funds to Harvard when he should have been paying his judgment, that\u2019s a fraudulent transfer,\u201d Mr. Kellner said. \u201cThey could sue Harvard to get the money back, and they\u2019d be entitled to get it back if they can show that it was fraudulently transferred.\u201dThe lawyer handling the investor\u2019s case, however, said he had no plans to sue Harvard.Advertisement"}

Some \u201cSerial\u201d fans may be disappointed to learn that the crew\u2019s latest offering is not a straightforward whodunit. They shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cS-Town\u201d turns out to be much more interesting than that.\u201cS-Town\u201d is not another tale of a journalist trying to solve a murder with just a microphone and a little elbow grease, and thank God. Instead, \u201cS-Town\u201d transcends the podcast procedural with a destabilizing narrative structure in which one small-town mystery leads to another, all surrounding Mr. McLemore and his acquaintances. There is that murder, but also a treasure hunt, a land grab and a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Reed\u2019s investigation turns psychological and emotional \u2014 into how people come to be branded as bad, and the hidden relationships among men in the rural South.\u201cS-Town\u201d \u2014 which is executive produced by Mr. Reed and the \u201cSerial\u201d producer Julie Snyder, with editorial input from the \u201cSerial\u201d host, Sarah Koenig, and the host of \u201cThis American Life,\u201d Ira Glass \u2014 is not \u201cSerial\u201d Season 3. It\u2019s kind of a podcast spinoff, and it unfolds more like a novel than a true-crime procedural. Mr. McLemore is its beguiling principal character. He\u2019s got a backyard labyrinth, gold buried in an undisclosed location and a literary flair that turns small-town life into big drama. He\u2019s the peppiest pessimist south of the Mason-Dixon line.The \u201cS\u201d in \u201cS-Town\u201d is shorthand for a four-letter word \u2014 Mr. McLemore\u2019s preferred nickname for his hometown. He has a talent for profane rants about civilization\u2019s downfall that he delivers in an Alabama drawl. In one diatribe, he rails against a nation of people who are \u201cwhiny, fat, flabby, out of shape, Facebook-lookin\u2019, damn twerk-fest, peekin\u2019 out the windows and snoopin\u2019 around, listening on the cellphones and spyin\u2019 in the peephole and peepin\u2019 in the crack of the goddamn door, listenin\u2019 in the [expletive] Sheetrock.\u201d Mr. McLemore takes a breath. \u201cI gotta have me some tea.\u201dAlmost every journalist has met people like Mr. McLemore, sources who email you under pseudonyms with tips a little too good to be true. Often they seem to mostly want someone to talk to, and to have their experiences validated by a journalist, whose job, after all, is to decide what\u2019s important and true. Most reporters would stop taking those calls when the story ideas don\u2019t bear fruit, but not Mr. Reed. He finds Mr. McLemore\u2019s life important in and of itself, and a whole world opens up to him.A disappointment of the first season of \u201cSerial\u201d was that so many of its central players refused to talk \u2014 an understandable response to a journalist\u2019s digging up of a 15-year-old tragedy already decided upon by the courts. That often made for uncomfortable listening, as these actual people were posited as possible murder suspects on the basis of one-sided claims.Accusations, criminal and otherwise, fly in \u201cS-Town,\u201d too, but Mr. Reed manages to speak with just about all of the pivotal characters in the story, deftly interviewing them in a way that generates sympathy for their perspectives and illuminates their charms. Meeting these people provides delightful little surprises throughout the narrative: Among them is Uncle Jimmy, who communicates exclusively through shouted affirmations, and a man who divides his life into two eras: before and after the 2005 release of \u201cBrokeback Mountain.\u201dAlso, \u201cS-Town\u201d mercifully departs from \u201cSerial\u201d by releasing all of its seven episodes at once. The publish-as-you-go, seat-of-your-pants style of \u201cSerial\u201d and stylistic offshoots like \u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d holds an addictive appeal, but it\u2019s also a risky gambit that rarely pays off. The inevitable internet-fueled frenzy to help crowdsource the mystery quickly turns the whole exercise into a dehumanizing game. It doesn\u2019t work.Such podcasts often raise high expectations \u2014 let\u2019s solve a murder, or at least flush out a reclusive celebrity \u2014 only to end in shrugs. Assembling the whole story before its release frees Mr. Reed to pace out a real narrative, including an emotional twist at the end of the second episode that turns the whole thing upside down. You should probably start listening now before somebody spoils the twist. But then, take your time with the story \u2014 \u201cS-Town\u201d is so much more than its central mystery.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Understanding the Angry Mob at Middlebury That Gave Me a Concussion", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byOn CampusIn the days after the violence, some have spun this story as one about what\u2019s wrong with elite colleges and universities, our coddled youth or intolerant liberalism. Those analyses are incomplete.Political life and discourse in the United States is at a boiling point, and nowhere is the reaction to that more heightened than on college campuses. Throughout an ugly campaign and into his presidency, President Trump has demonized Muslims as terrorists and dehumanized many groups of marginalized people. He declared the free press an enemy of the people, replaced deliberation with tweeting, and seems bent on dismantling the separation of powers and 230 years of progress this country has made toward a more perfect union. Much of the free speech he has inspired \u2014 or has refused to disavow \u2014 is ugly, and has already had ugly real-world consequences. College students have seen this, and have taken note: Speech can become action.That is the context into which Dr. Murray walked and was so profoundly misunderstood.From the stage where I sat with Dr. Murray, waiting for students to take their seats, I saw a sea of humanity. Students were chanting, \u201cWho is the enemy? White supremacy,\u201d and \u201cRacist, sexist, anti-gay: Charles Murray, go away!\u201d Others were yelling obscenities at Dr. Murray or one another. What alarmed me most, however, was what I saw in the eyes of the crowd. Those who wanted the event to take place made eye contact with me. Those intent on disrupting it steadfastly refused to do so. They couldn\u2019t look at me directly, because if they had, they would have seen another human being.Most of the hatred was focused on Dr. Murray, but when I took his right arm to shield him and to make sure we stayed together, the crowd turned on me. Someone pulled my hair, while others were shoving me. I feared for my life. Once we got into the car, protesters climbed on it, hitting the windows and rocking the vehicle whenever we stopped to avoid harming them. I am still wearing a neck brace, and spent a week in a dark room to recover from a concussion caused by the whiplash.It is obvious that some protesters made dangerous choices. But with time to reflect, I have to say that I hear and understand the righteous anger of many of those who shouted us down. I know that many students felt they were standing up to protect marginalized people who have been demeaned or even threatened under the guise of free speech.But for us to engage with one another as fellow human beings \u2014 even on issues where we passionately disagree \u2014 we need reason, not just emotions. Middlebury students could have learned from identifying flawed assumptions or logical shortcomings in Dr. Murray\u2019s arguments. They could have challenged him in the Q. and A. If the ways in which his misinterpreted ideas have been weaponized precluded hearing him out, students also had the option of protesting outside, walking out of the talk or simply refusing to attend.Part of the problem was the furor that preceded the talk. This past month, as the campus uproar about Dr. Murray\u2019s visit built, I was genuinely surprised and troubled to learn that some of my faculty colleagues had rendered judgment on Dr. Murray\u2019s work and character without ever having read anything he has written. It wasn\u2019t just students: Some professors protested his appearance as well.Intelligent members of the Middlebury community \u2014 including some of my own students and advisees \u2014 concluded that Charles Murray was an anti-gay white nationalist from what they were hearing from one another, and what they read on the Southern Poverty Law Center website. Never mind that Dr. Murray supports same-sex marriage and is a member of the courageous \u201cnever Trump\u201d wing of the Republican Party.Students are in college in part to learn how to evaluate sources and follow up on ideas with their own research. The Southern Poverty Law Center incorrectly labels Dr. Murray a \u201cwhite nationalist,\u201d but if we have learned nothing in this election, it is that such claims must be fact-checked, analyzed and assessed. Faulty information became the catalyst for shutting off the free exchange of ideas at Middlebury. We must all be more rigorous in evaluating and investigating anger, or this pattern of miscommunication will continue on other college campuses.I am not saying that students shouldn\u2019t protest white nationalism. That it is immoral is not at issue. But there was a direct line between the fighting words on campus, the suppression of speech and the angry mob that gave me a concussion. All violence is a breakdown of communication.There is no excusing what happened at Middlebury, and those who prevented Charles Murray from speaking must be punished for violating college rules. But what the events at Middlebury made clear is that, regardless of political persuasion, Americans today are deeply susceptible to a renunciation of reason and celebration of ignorance. They know what they know without reading, discussing or engaging those who might disagree with them. People from both sides of the aisle reject calm logic, eager to embrace the alternative news that supports their prejudices.More broadly, our constitutional democracy will depend on whether Americans can relearn how to engage civilly with one another, something that is admittedly hard to do with a bullying president as a role model. But any other way forward would be antithetical to the very ideals of the university and of liberal democracy.Advertisement"}

But in a special election, energy is everything,\u201d said Mr. Ossoff, who, if he makes the runoff after the vote next month, will most likely face off against the leading Republican in the race to fill the congressional seat vacated by Tom Price, President Trump\u2019s new secretary of health and human services.If Democrats have any hopes of recapturing the 24 seats needed to take back the House, they will depend on a lot of anti-Trump energy and underdogs like Mr. Ossoff. The race in Georgia, in a district Republicans have held for a generation, will be an early test of Democrats\u2019 ability to capitalize on Mr. Trump\u2019s polarizing presence \u2014 he barely won the district last year \u2014 and the ability of both parties to choose candidates within their divided ideological factions who can win a general election.Fueled by the conviction that affluent, educated suburban areas are at least trending toward competitive in the strange and shifting battlefields of Mr. Trump\u2019s America, Democrats believe this is the kind of district where they have a shot.Republicans are confident that Democrats will be inclined to nominate candidates from the most progressive wing of the party, who may energize their base but prove a poor fit for general elections in even the most anti-Trump Republican districts. At the same time, Republicans are going to have to decide whether candidates who distance themselves from Mr. Trump or those who run as his mini-me are their strongest candidates.\u201cIt\u2019s a base election, and our base is very energized right now,\u201d said Nancy Keenan, the executive director of the Montana Democratic Party.Both parties, Nathan Gonzales, the editor of Inside Elections, said, \u201care trying to figure out whether it is an example of a new movement, or just people who always vote Democrat just being more vocal.\u201d\u201cHistory is on their side,\u201d Mr. Gonzales said of the Democrats, \u201cbecause the president\u2019s party often loses a significant number of seats in the midterms. But in 2016, there was a disconnect between how voters viewed Trump and Republican candidates down the ballot. Democrats assumed that voters would hold other Republicans responsible for Trump\u2019s sins, and in most cases, they didn\u2019t.\u201dIt remains to be seen how Republican-leaning moderates will end up perceiving Mr. Ossoff here in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, a tony swath of golf courses, cul-de-sacs and pristine strip malls just north of Atlanta. Mr. Ossoff grew up in the district and attended Paideia, an Atlanta private school known for nurturing creativity and individualism, followed by Georgetown University and the London School of Economics. He was a high school intern in the office of Representative John Lewis, a Democrat who represents a large part of Atlanta, and was a Capitol Hill staffer for Representative Hank Johnson, also from Georgia. He currently works as a documentary filmmaker.In an interview at his parents\u2019 spacious suburban home this month, the boyish Mr. Ossoff, in a dark, narrow-cut suit, struck a serious tone focused on repairing the Affordable Care Act and on local economic issues.\u201cI\u2019m not campaigning across the district talking about Donald Trump at every event,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many in this district who are concerned that the president may embarrass us on the world stage, that he may be incompetent and that he\u2019s dishonest. I share those concerns, but by running a positive campaign focused on core American values, the contrast is obvious.\u201dGary Dichtenberg, an organizer of Needles in a Haystack, said about 500 people had said they planned to attend a March 12 Democratic candidates\u2019 forum the group is sponsoring, forcing a venue change from a Unitarian church to an indoor go-kart racing complex. Mr. Dichtenberg said he was optimistic about Mr. Ossoff\u2019s chances.\u201cIn a special election, only a small percentage of the electorate votes to begin with \u2014 and only the most energized,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd look how Trump has energized.\u201dKerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University, predicted that a Republican would \u201cprobably crush\u201d the Democrats in the runoff. For Democrats in the Sixth District, and in Georgia generally, Mr. Swint said, \u201cthe numbers just aren\u2019t there yet.\u201dHe said that Democrats were not the only ones in the district imbued with a new political energy.\u201cA lot of these people I\u2019m talking to are conservatives, and people that have never voted before that are Trump voters, if you will,\u201d Mr. Gray said.Charles S. Bullock III, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said that a Democrat might fare best in a runoff against an overtly pro-Trump candidate, given the president\u2019s extremely narrow victory here.

But Ms. Cunningham was determined to enlist. She ships off to basic training the first week of April.\u201cSomeone needs to stand up and say this does not represent the values of the Marine Corps,\u201d she said. \u201cIf not me, then who? Yes, for a long time it was a boys\u2019 club, but there needs to be progress.\u201dThe Marine Corps faced blistering questioning on Tuesday from the Senate Armed Services Committee, with members accusing the leadership of failing to take action on an issue they said the corps has known about for years.\u201cThere is no mystery \u2014 this has been going on a very long time, it is right in front of you,\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, told Marine Corps commanders, citing a 2013 hearing on the cyberbullying of women in the corps. \u201cWhen you say to us, \u2018It\u2019s got to be different,\u2019 that rings hollow.\u201dIn contrite and at times introspective testimony, the Marine Corps commandant, Gen. Robert B. Neller, said the online harassment was a symptom of a broader cultural problem that threatens to undermine the foundation of the fighting force. He vowed to punish all who participated, and to work to make the force of 184,000 a more welcoming place for its 15,000 women.\u201cYou\u2019ve heard it before, but we are going to have to change how we see ourselves and how we treat each other,\u201d he told Ms. Gillibrand. \u201cThat\u2019s a lame answer, but that\u2019s all I have right now. And that\u2019s on me.\u201dCommanders said of the 30,000 members of Marines United, only about 500 appeared to have gone into folders of nude photos. Investigators were working to build cases on active duty troops it could identify.And even as the top enlisted Marine, Sgt. Maj. Ronald L. Green, condemned the group in testimony before Congress last week, members were taunting him online, according to a veteran, James LaPorta, who has been tracking the group\u2019s activities.\u201cThere seems to be no regret,\u201d Mr. LaPorta said. \u201cThey were using racial slurs and talking about getting pictures of his wife.\u201dThe group continues to post on anonymous pornography sites. A recent review of images from these sites shows dozens of identifiable women, naked or partly undressed, along with photos of them in uniform.Thomas Brennan, a Marine veteran and journalist who first reported on the group, said that he had given the names of 55 Marines involved in the photo sharing \u2014 including officers ranked as high as major \u2014 to investigators six weeks ago, but that there was no sign that any of them had been removed from duty.A Marine spokesman said he could not comment on the continuing investigation.The scandal has now spread to the Army and Navy, which are investigating similar photo sharing groups. But for the tens of thousands of women serving in the military, even successful prosecutions may have little effect on the minefield of bias they say they confront.\u201cAlmost every woman I know in the Marines has faced this kind of harassment, and you try to show you are tough enough to ignore it,\u201d said Justine Elena, a former Marine captain who served in Afghanistan and now works for \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d \u201cBut at some point, by ignoring it, you just condone it.\u201dShe recalled an instance when fellow Marines took photos of women in the bathrooms on a ship a friend was serving on.\u201cWe need to stand up and say that is not what the Marines is about,\u201d she said.Ms. Cunningham, who is just a few weeks away from placing her feet on the painted yellow footprints at basic training that are the symbolic first step in becoming a Marine, said that while she had often been torn about how to respond to the online harassment, she had decided that the best response would be to become the best Marine possible.Always athletic growing up, she made up her mind in high school to join the military, and chose the Marines, she said, because it was the most selective and demanding. She plans to work on a crew loading missiles on Cobra helicopters.Two years ago, she began working out intensely to prepare \u2014 hitting the gym until her arms, which could not do a single pull-up at first, could knock out 14 in a row.\u201cI wanted to make sure I could do anything male Marines could,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to hold me to a lower standard.\u201dLater, she was dating a Marine, and when he was stationed outside of Arizona, she sent him a short strip tease video.\u201cI don\u2019t typically do that stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for the person you love, you do things to keep a relationship alive.\u201dThe video was soon added to the cache of hundreds of photos and videos of active-duty Marines and veterans \u2014 filed with the subject\u2019s name, rank and place of duty \u2014 that is being circulated by Marines United and other groups. Ms. Cunningham was notified by male Marines she knew who were members of the group, and she was eventually given access to view the whole collection.She pored through the files, searching for women she knew so she could alert them, knowing that their colleagues and commanders could see them.But while she was horrified by the actions of the group, she said she never equated it with the Marine Corps. She now dates a Marine sergeant and said that most of the male Marines she knew were just as disgusted by the photo sharing as she was. That was what made her stick with her plan to enlist.\u201cWe have to be positive examples of the change we want to see,\u201d she said. \u201cCourage, integrity, honor: I want to live those values.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, relying on information from a source, misstated the highest rank of Marine reported to have been involved in sharing nude photos. It was major, not lieutenant colonel.Advertisement"}

Most importantly, so do the victims and families.\u201dAfter several terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere, the region\u2019s lawmakers and regulators, as well as some of their counterparts in the United States, now want Silicon Valley companies to do more to tackle potential threats.For many policy makers, that includes opening up services like WhatsApp and Telegram, a rival messaging tool, to national intelligence agencies when they are investigating terrorist activities.\u201cWe do want them to recognize that they have a responsibility to engage with government, to engage with law enforcement agencies when there is a terrorist situation,\u201d Ms. Rudd told the BBC on Sunday, referring to tech companies. \u201cThey cannot get away with saying we are in a different situation. They are not.\u201dTech companies and digital rights advocates have said such efforts would infringe on human rights because providing the authorities with access to such messaging services would require weakening their overall levels of encryption. That, they argue, would leave people who use those services vulnerable to outsiders.Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in an email: \u201cWe are horrified by the attack carried out in London,\u201d adding that the company was \u201ccooperating with law enforcement.\u201dOfficials in Britain, however, are going a step further. And by demanding that intelligence agencies be allowed to read encrypted messages, Ms. Rudd is reiterating long-held plans to gain more control over digital services.Tech companies say they cannot hand over such information because internet messages are sent through so-called end-to-end encryption.This technology scrambles messages to make them indecipherable to anyone but their intended recipient. It also makes messages unreadable when they pass through an app\u2019s server, meaning companies do not have the ability to provide the information to law enforcement even if they wanted to.If such technology is weakened, campaigners say, governments and hackers could gain access to encrypted messages, reducing people\u2019s ability to communicate privately online.\u201cCompelling companies to put back doors into encrypted services would make millions of ordinary people less secure online,\u201d said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, a British nonprofit. \u201cWe all rely on encryption to protect our ability to communicate, shop and bank safely.\u201dSewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The F.C.C. chairman under the Obama administration, Tom Wheeler, had declared that broadband would be regulated more heavily, by categorizing the service in the same regulatory bucket as telephone services, which are viewed as utilities.That move acknowledged the importance of the internet for communications, education, work and commerce and the need to protect online users, Mr. Wheeler had said.\u201cWe appreciate today\u2019s Senate action to repeal unwarranted F.C.C. rules that deny consumers consistent privacy protection online and violate competitive neutrality,\u201d the cable industry lobby group, NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, said in a statement on Thursday.The F.C.C. chairman, Mr. Pai, has also talked with Republican allies in Congress about privacy and broadband classification. Mr. Pai has already chipped away at more than a dozen regulations, including aspects of net neutrality and the program, known as Lifeline, that provides subsidies for broadband users in low-income households.Consumer groups warned that internet users would suffer from the changes. The Federal Trade Commission, the consumer protection agency, is barred from overseeing broadband providers, so without the F.C.C. privacy rules, the federal government will be a weaker watchdog over internet privacy, supporters of the regulations said.\u201cSenate Republicans just made it easier for Americans\u2019 sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared and sold to the highest bidder without their permission,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.Democrats had taken to the Senate floor on Wednesday and Thursday to warn that without the rules, broadband providers will now have free range to peer into their customers\u2019 lives. A company like AT&T or Sprint can tell the time people wake up by when they check the clock on their phone, or see where users go to lunch or whom they visit. By tracking a user\u2019s browsing of medical websites, a carrier can also determine if that person might have an illness.The Senate\u2019s action also signaled a philosophical shift on tech regulation. Lawmakers and Mr. Pai have said regulations should be created only when there is proof of harmful activity. They also argue that the telecom industry competes with internet firms such as Facebook and Google for access to online content, so any rules should also include those companies. Republicans have said the F.T.C. should be the watchdog for all online privacy.But Democratic regulators have said the key difference is that consumers do not have many choices for broadband access, which makes them vulnerable to data collection by internet service providers.\u201cSubscribers have little or no competitive choice as to which provider to use,\u201d said Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic commissioner of the F.T.C. Yet broadband providers \u201cknow our identities, and their position gives them the technical capacity to surveil users in ways that others cannot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One of the crew members works during the week painting stripes on highways, and another sits behind a desk on Wall Street. Some are New York City firefighters accustomed to springing into action.They were ready when a routine day of training turned into an emergency mission.Word came over the radio that a small plane bound for Francis S. Gabreski Airport here had lost contact with the tower. The Guard crew followed a trail of smoke billowing over the tree line, leading it to scattered wreckage and a man struggling to escape from the fuselage. The Guard members rushed to the man, some fighting back flames with fire extinguishers as others pulled him from the plane.\u201cWe made eye contact,\u201d Yaanique Scott, a firefighter from Brooklyn, recalled, \u201cand he told me, \u2018There\u2019s two others still in the aircraft.\u2019\u201d\u201cYou could tell he was in shock,\u201d Mr. Scott added, \u201cbut he was still worried about his friends.\u201d The two others aboard did not survive.In several of the crashes, passengers walked away without injury. But the crash on Sunday was a reminder how a day of leisurely flying can sometimes turn into a harrowing ordeal.\u201cWe could not have crashed at a better place,\u201d said Michael Rome, a survivor along with the pilot, the only other person aboard the plane.Mr. Rome, who sustained a head injury, said he remembered the plane\u2019s falling below the tree line and his being carried from the scene, but nothing in between. He learned later that the plane had been consumed by flames and that the swift response of the emergency workers probably saved his life.\u201cThey snatched us from the jaws of death,\u201d Mr. Rome said. \u201cThat thing was on fire in a big way.\u201dThe authorities said the plane that crashed on Sunday morning was a Ryan Navion F aircraft, manufactured in 1951, that took off from Republic Airport in Farmingdale, about 45 miles away. There had been no indication of distress from the plane, and the weather was clear, though \u201ca little breezy,\u201d said Daniel Boggs, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the accident.\u201cHe was coming into this airport to do some practice touch-and-goes,\u201d Mr. Boggs said. \u201cSo, he was landing and he was taking off again.\u201dGabreski Airport, which is often used by private planes, covers 1,400 acres in Westhampton Beach and is bordered on its eastern edge by the wooded area where the plane crashed. At the other end of the airport, the Apron Cafe has a wall of windows facing the runways. It is typically packed on Sundays with aviators and with families who watch planes take off and land. Jessica Christiansen, who works in the cafe, said customers and workers had seen plumes of smoke in the distance and a line of emergency vehicles rushing toward it.Arieh Narkunski, a flight instructor, and Robert A. Wilkie, a licensed pilot who was a passenger, were killed in the crash, the authorities said. The pilot, Richard Bruce Rosenthal, was taken to Stony Brook University Hospital, where he was in critical condition, hospital officials said.The authorities said the aircraft was designed so that passengers entered through a sliding canopy over the fuselage instead of through side doors. When Guard members found Mr. Rosenthal, he was \u201ckind of lodged in the canopy of the aircraft, trying to get out,\u201d said Joseph McCarthy, who was flying the helicopter.Aaron Pacholk, a Guard member, described a surreal scene and said, \u201cWe just ran to try to help.\u201dMr. Pacholk expressed regret that more could not have been done to help the others. \u201cIt was just very sad to feel helpless like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was only so much we could do before the fire became too intense.\u201dInvestigators have not determined a cause for the crash. They are reviewing the plane\u2019s mechanical history as well as Mr. Rosenthal\u2019s record as a pilot. Investigators say they also want to interview Mr. Rosenthal but will have to wait until his condition improves.Mr. Wilkie, 65, lived in Hempstead, where he worked as a lawyer. He was passionate about flying and his grandchildren, frequently posting photographs on Facebook of them smiling in his home office or flipping through a flight magazine in an airport terminal.\u201cHe was a loving grandfather,\u201d said Nicole Wilkie, his daughter-in-law. \u201cHe loved his children, and he died loving what he did.\u201dMr. Narkunksi, 64, had been enamored of airplanes since he was a young man in Israel and trained to be a mechanic.

{"Headline": "Debunking a Myth: The Irish Were Not Slaves, Too", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byIt has shown up on Irish trivia Facebook pages, in Scientific American magazine, and on white nationalist message boards: the little-known story of the Irish slaves who built America, who are sometimes said to have outnumbered and been treated worse than slaves from Africa.But it\u2019s not true.Historians say the idea of Irish slaves is based on a misreading of history and that the distortion is often politically motivated. Far-right memes have taken off online and are used as racist barbs against African-Americans. \u201cThe Irish were slaves, too,\u201d the memes often say. \u201cWe got over it, so why can\u2019t you?\u201dThe Irish slave narrative is based on the misinterpretation of the history of indentured servitude, which is how many poor Europeans migrated to North America and the Caribbean in the early colonial period, historians said.Without a doubt, life was bad for indentured servants. They were often treated brutally. Not all of them entered servitude willingly. Some were political prisoners. Some were children.\u201cI\u2019m not saying it was pleasant or anything \u2014 it was the opposite \u2014 but it was a completely different category from slavery,\u201d said Liam Hogan, a research librarian in Ireland who has spearheaded the debunking effort. \u201cIt was a transitory state.\u201dThe legal differences between indentured servitude and chattel slavery were profound, according to Matthew Reilly, an archaeologist who studies Barbados. Unlike slaves, servants were considered legally human. Their servitude was based on a contract that limited their service to a finite period of time, usually about seven years, in exchange for passage to the colonies. They did not pass their unfree status on to descendants.Contemporary accounts in Ireland sometimes referred to these people as slaves, Mr. Hogan said. That was true in the sense that any form of coerced labor can be described as slavery, from Ancient Rome to modern-day human trafficking. But in colonial America and the Caribbean, the word \u201cslavery\u201d had a specific legal meaning. Europeans, by definition, were not included in it.\u201cAn indenture implies two people have entered into a contract with each other but slavery is not a contract,\u201d said Leslie Harris, a professor of African-American history at Northwestern University. \u201cIt is often about being a prisoner of war or being bought or sold bodily as part of a trade. That is a critical distinction.\u201dThe memes sometimes pop up in apolitical settings, like history trivia websites, but their recent spread has mirrored escalating racial and political tension in the United States, Mr. Hogan said. Central to the memes is the notion that historians and the media are covering up the truth. He said he has received death threats from Americans for his work.\u201cThese memes are the No. 1 derailment people use when they talk about the slave trade,\u201d he said. \u201cLook in any race-related or slavery-related news story from the last two years and someone will mention it in the comments.\u201dThe memes often have common elements: the false claim that Irish people were enslaved in America or the Caribbean after the 1649 British invasion of Ireland led by Oliver Cromwell; the false claim that Irish slaves were cheaper and treated worse than African slaves; the false claim that Irish women were forcibly \u201cbred\u201d with black men.Some of them are easy to disprove. Many of the memes use photographs, including of Jewish Holocaust victims or 20th century child laborers, to illustrate events they claim happened in the 17th century, long before the invention of photography. Many reference a nonexistent 1625 proclamation by King James II, who was not born until 1633.They often hijack specific atrocities committed against black slaves and substitute Irish people for the actual victims. A favorite event to use is the 1781 Zong massacre, in which over 130 African slaves were thrown to their deaths off a slave ship.\u201cIt almost becomes a race to the bottom of who suffered more,\u201d Mr. Reilly said, adding that the memes are \u201can effort to claim a certain ancestry of suffering in order to claim a certain political position.\u201dThe white slavery narrative has long been a staple of the far right, but it became specifically Irish after the 2000 publication of \u201cTo Hell or Barbados: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ireland,\u201d a book by the late journalist Sean O\u2019Callaghan, which Mr. Hogan and others have said was shoddily researched. It received positive reviews in Ireland, however, and was widely read there.In America, the book connected the white slave narrative to an influential ethnic group of over 34 million people, many of whom had been raised on stories of Irish rebellion against Britain and tales of anti-Irish bias in America at the turn of the 20th century. From there, it took off.Ireland has a long history of verifiable tragedies: centuries of British occupation, famine, emigration and sectarian violence. Three decades of armed conflict in Northern Ireland ended only in 1998, and paramilitary violence has intermittently flared ever since.Mr. Hogan said it was upsetting for many Irish people to see that history \u201cused as a weapon\u201d by Americans who claim a connection to the country. He said that for some people, it seemed like the meme was \u201creplacing the actual history of their Irish heritage.\u201dIt is true that anti-Irish sentiment was present in the United States until well into the 20th century, but that is a separate issue from 17th century indentured servitude, Ms. Harris said. The descendants of indentured servants, Irish or otherwise, did not face a legacy of racism similar to the one faced by people of African descent, she said.Nevertheless, she called the meme\u2019s existence unsurprising. \u201cThere has been a huge backlash against talking about slavery that continues to this day,\u201d she said, not to mention Jim Crow and other forms of discrimination against blacks that \u201cgrew out of enslavement.\u201d\u201cThis continued misuse of Irish history devalues the real history,\u201d Mr. Hogan said. \u201cThere are libraries filled with all the bad things that actually did happen. We don\u2019t need memes and these dodgy articles full of lies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Student Suffers Severe Reaction After Hazing Involving Peanut Butter", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byA Michigan college student with a deadly peanut allergy was the victim of a hazing ritual in which he was daubed in the face with peanut butter at an off-campus party, spurring a severe reaction that left him with swollen eyes, officials and the man\u2019s mother said.The police in Mount Pleasant, Mich., said they were investigating the October encounter involving youths who said they were members of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity at Central Michigan University and the student, Andrew Seely, 19.Law enforcement authorities and university officials found out about the hazing this week, after Mr. Seely\u2019s mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about it and posted a photograph of her son\u2019s distorted face on Facebook.\u201cHe could have been killed,\u201d she wrote, adding that he carried medicine to counteract accidental exposure to peanuts.\u201cWe will be investigating,\u201d Capt. Andy Latham of the Mount Pleasant Police said by telephone. He added that the authorities had not yet spoken to Mr. Seely, who transferred to another school, but that they were contacted on Wednesday by the family\u2019s lawyer.Ms. Seely wrote in the post that her son had a \u201cdeadly\u201d peanut allergy and had passed out at the party. When he came to, she said, he discovered that his eyes, nose and lips had ballooned because peanut butter had been rubbed on his face.Ms. Seely said he was treated at a campus clinic. He told his family only this week about the hazing, she said, after which she called the campus police, the Mount Pleasant police and university officials.Ms. Seely could not be reached by telephone on Friday.Heather Smith, a spokeswoman for the university, said the fraternity had not been active on campus since 2011 because of previous hazing. She said campus officials heard about Mr. Seely\u2019s experience through his mother\u2019s social media post.University police do not have jurisdiction over the off-campus party, according to Ms. Smith, but the university could investigate any violations of the student code of conduct if Mr. Seely reached out.\u201cIt is a potential criminal matter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is obviously a very concerning situation.\u201d\u201cAlpha Chi Rho does not condone this type of behavior, or any form of hazing, and it stands in conflict with our mission to cultivate men of character, honor and integrity,\u201d the statement added.While there are no official government databases on hazing cases and their outcomes, university professors keep their own statistics, and put in place policies to control the practice. According to a chronology of cases kept by Hank Nuwer, a journalism professor at Franklin College in Indiana, there has been at least one hazing death every year from 1969 to 2016 at United States colleges and high schools.\u201cI would say there are thousands of hazings every day, most of which are not reported,\u201d said Susan Lipkins, a psychologist and expert on the practice. \u201cAnd each year hazing gets worse. A rookie wants to enter the group, and you become a bystander and watch others, and eventually become a perpetrator.\u201dDr. Lipkins said that in some cases, members of banned fraternities recolonize off-campus and operate in unofficial, self-designated groups. She said she had no direct knowledge of Mr. Seely\u2019s case, but believed it was most likely that the group had advance knowledge that he had an allergy.\u201cIt is not a typical hazing activity,\u201d she said. \u201cOf all the hazing activities, I have not heard of peanut butter on the face.\u201dIn 2012, a 26-year-old drum major died after a brutal hazing ritual at Florida A&M University in which he was pummeled with hands, drumsticks, bass drum mallets, straps and even an orange cone by at least 15 band members on a bus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Art That Infuriates Be Removed?", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookWe all encounter art we don\u2019t like, that upsets and infuriates us. This doesn\u2019t deserve to be exhibited, our brains yell; it should not be allowed to exist. Still, does such aversion mean that an artwork must be removed from view \u2014 or, worse, destroyed?Many people found themselves in the messy middle ground, seeing both sides, grasping for precedents.Those who call for the removal of Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting today seem to align themselves with black artists who in 1997 started a letter-writing campaign against what they considered the negative stereotypes of blacks in the early work of Kara Walker, the African-American artist known for her mercilessly Swiftian portrayals of antebellum plantation life. They also appear to side with Roman Catholics who in 1999, led by then Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, protested a painting at the Brooklyn Museum by the British artist Chris Ofili. It depicted the Madonna and Child as black on a surface embellished with small cutouts from pornographic magazines and a few pieces of tennis-ball-size elephant dung, heavily varnished and decorated with beads.On Thursday, Ms. Walker posted a cryptic message on Instagram that seemed guided by her own experiences. She stood up for Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting without making great claims for it or reprimanding the protesters.\u201cThe history of painting is full of graphic violence and narratives that don\u2019t necessarily belong to the artists own life,\u201d Ms. Walker wrote. She concluded that an artwork can be generative regardless of how it offends or falls short, giving \u201crise to deeper inquiries and better art. It can only do this when it is seen.\u201dOnce released into the public sphere, images proceed under their own power and, in a free society, they will be used by anyone drawn to them, in ways that will be judged effective, inconsequential or egregious. But artists don\u2019t ask permission.Ms. Schutz has said she painted \u201cOpen Casket\u201d out of sympathy for the pain endured by Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, and the label at the Whitney has been adjusted to take this into account. In an email on Monday, Ms. Schutz wrote: \u201cThe photograph of him in his casket is almost impossible to look at. In making the painting, I relied more on listening to Mamie Till\u2019s verbal account of seeing her son, which oscillates between memory and observation.\u201dBut Ms. Schutz has always focused her art on physical suffering expressed by traumatized bodies and skin. Occasionally, the body has been black \u2014 as in her painting of Michael Jackson on an autopsy table \u2014 but it is usually white. Her subjects include Terri Schiavo on life support; George Washington as a kind of monster with overgrown wooden teeth; and a portrait of Ukraine\u2019s former president Viktor A. Yushchenko, his face disfigured by poison. Most ambitious is the enormous \u201cPresentation,\u201d which shows two naked figures lying on a table being tormented and sliced up by a people in a crowd.Themes of race and violence figure in art throughout this Biennial, including a painting by the black artist Henry Taylor, \u201cThe Times Thay Aint a Changing Fast Enough!\u201d It depicts the fatal police shooting of Philando Castile.Some might say the events and their depictions are apples and oranges. Mr. Castile was not brutally disfigured. Till\u2019s torture more than 60 years ago, and his image, have become a nexus of inexpressible pain and anger for generations of Americans.But by remaking these tragic images as paintings, both artists have given them a monumentality and a hand-wrought physicality that photographs generally do not attain. They have made them more present while keeping some distance. Mr. Taylor\u2019s Castile has the noble face of a Greek statue. Ms. Schutz has been faulted for \u201cabstracting\u201d Till\u2019s gruesome wounds, yet her sliding brushwork guides our eyes away from them, suggesting a kind of shocked visual reflex.But perhaps most important, the paintings by Mr. Taylor and Ms. Schutz share an all-too-American subject, that of hateful, corrosive white racism. Who owns that?The Schutz painting and the debate around it are already a historical unit, one that seems new to the art world, and one that will change things. Unlike the Styron controversy, it has unfolded on the internet at warp speed with thousands of people arguing about it almost in real time. Unlike Mr. Goldsmith\u2019s poem, the cause of the furor is not ephemeral; the painting has a kind of equal weight with the debate. They are each in their own way extremely present, for people to consider going forward. \u201cOpen Casket\u201d will not be destroyed but by now it is also beyond destruction.Advertisement"}

Yet he declined to be interviewed or answer questions directly, making the job of separating fact from fiction that much harder.For instance, one tale I chased was the report of his pushing a drug lord out of a helicopter and into the sea. The story had been circulating for years, and although a former diplomat told me that Mr. Duterte had once crowed to him about it, details proved scarce. Who was the drug lord, and where was the helicopter? When did it happen? And why were the mayor and a drug lord in a helicopter together? Answers to these questions never surfaced.During two trips to Davao City, in the southern Philippines, I pursued these and other cases. While proof was usually lacking, the story of the swallowed cigarette butt was promising because it looked like there were witnesses.According to Mr. Pi\u00f1ol\u2019s account, the arrogant tourist was informed of the local smoking law and responded by insulting the mayor. The restaurant owner called the police and asked them to summon Mr. Duterte.He pulled out his snub-nosed, .38-caliber revolver and threatened to shoot. After the man swallowed his cigarette butt, Mr. Pi\u00f1ol wrote, the mayor told him, \u201cNever, ever challenge the law.\u201dI called Mr. Pi\u00f1ol for details. When did this happen? Which restaurant? Was it possible to contact the owner or other witnesses?Mr. Pi\u00f1ol, a former journalist, was friendly, if vague. He said he had never asked Mr. Duterte for the restaurant\u2019s name, which seemed odd. And it wasn\u2019t clear who the witnesses were. But he promised to get more information for me.He never did. Nor did he take my calls after that.I tried to find others who knew of these events. One of Mr. Duterte\u2019s friends came up with a restaurant name. The owner said he knew nothing about it.Jocellyn Duterte, Mr. Duterte\u2019s sister, said she believed that the cigarette butt and helicopter stories were just myths.Finally, I asked Mr. Duterte\u2019s communications secretary, Martin Andanar, if the smoking incident was true.Mr. Andanar, also a former journalist, put the story to rest, at least for me.\u201cSecretary Pi\u00f1ol said the story has become a stuff of legend,\u201d Mr. Andanar said in an email. \u201cIt has been the talk of the town in Davao for many, many years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Adviser Gary Cohn to Sell Stake in Chinese Bank Giant", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byThe White House economic adviser Gary D. Cohn is selling a significant holding in the world\u2019s largest bank \u2014 which happens to be in China \u2014 as he clears potential conflicts of interest to serve in his new role.The Chinese bank position appears to be the largest stock, private equity or hedge fund holding \u2014 apart from his shares in Goldman Sachs, where he was president \u2014 that Mr. Cohn will have to sell because of his new job. The timing of his initial purchase of the Industrial and Commercial Bank shares and of his planned sale are not clear.Neither Mr. Cohn, who is now the director of the National Economic Council advising President Trump, nor a White House spokeswoman responded to requests for comment. A Goldman spokesman referred questions to the White House.Mr. Cohn\u2019s holding in the Chinese bank are notable because the Trump administration has portrayed China as a threat to American economic growth.Richard W. Painter, who served as an ethics lawyer in the administration of President George W. Bush, said the sale of the Chinese bank shares made sense, given China\u2019s importance on the global economic stage.\u201cIf we get into a big spat with China, it is obviously going to have an effect on that bank economically,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cThere is no way you should be a senior adviser on economic or military policy, and have a big stake in a Chinese bank. That\u2019s an invitation for trouble.\u201dThe ethics documents issued to Mr. Cohn, known as certificates of divestiture, and a separate set issued to his wife, Lisa Pevaroff-Cohn, indicate that the couple will reinvest the proceeds of the Chinese bank stock sale and other asset sales into certain widely held assets, like Treasury bills or exchange-traded funds.The certificates of divestiture issued on March 8 are not a complete picture of Mr. Cohn\u2019s assets. They list only those that he and Ms. Pevaroff-Cohn will sell and then reinvest as a means of legally avoiding certain capital-gains taxes. Once the positions listed in the documents are liquidated, the couple will have 60 days to make the new investments.But the documents do provide a window into the assets that Mr. Cohn and his wife held at the end of his 26-year tenure at Goldman Sachs, from which he resigned in December.In addition to his stake in the Chinese bank, Mr. Cohn is selling roughly $216 million in Goldman stock, plus 18 other stocks, and plans to reinvest the proceeds.The other holdings include some major consumer brands, like the tobacco companies Philip Morris and Reynolds American, as well as the food company Kraft Heinz; and a passel of tech companies including Facebook, Twitter, Box, Intel, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Aside from Goldman, his holdings include only one other major United States bank, Bank of America. (Mr. Cohn is selling 9,174 Bank of America shares, valued at roughly $230,000.)Taken together, Mr. Cohn and Ms. Pevaroff-Cohn are selling small minority stakes in 11 private investment vehicles, including a group of Goldman Sachs-operated private equity funds, some of which were set up specifically for firm employees.Mr. Cohn\u2019s detailed ethics plan and personal financial disclosure statement, which would include further information about his income and assets, have not yet been made public.Mr. Cohn is not the only Goldman Sachs executive to invest in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. When he became Treasury secretary in 2006, the former Goldman chief executive Henry M. Paulson Jr. sold an individual position worth as much as $25 million in the bank, according to government documents issued at the time.Goldman itself held a sizable position in the Chinese bank for seven years, selling the last block of it to end the investment in 2013.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Artists Capture Your Wedding on Site and on Canvas", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byField NotesIt was delivery day and Leah Jay Hicks and Joe Hicks were waiting at her parents\u2019 house in Richmond, Va.In what could be described as an Ed McMahon moment, Ben Keys, a wedding artist who owns Wed on Canvas, rang the doorbell. Rather than a large sweepstakes check, he presented the newlyweds with a framed oil painting, which he began creating the month before, on Jan. 7, their wedding day.The Hickses are among couples who want a true artistic influence at their wedding, skipping unflattering caricatures or a photo booth.Mr. Keys depicted the couple\u2019s first dance on the 24-by-30-inch canvas.\u201cIt\u2019s a most beautiful and sacred moment for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re dancing, I get a strong sense of who they are as a couple. They smile at each other and show their affection. That inspires me.\u201dMr. Keys\u2019s work was more lifelike than the couple expected.\u201cSeeing us was magical,\u201d said Ms. Hicks, 25, who stood next to her husband, squeezing his hand tightly as Mr. Keys revealed his work. \u201cThe memories came flooding back. It was like I was in the ballroom, dancing.\u201d\u201cIt took my breath away,\u201d she added. \u201cThere was so much depth. He highlighted our cake and flowers, and who was wearing what. He did my friends perfectly. I didn\u2019t remember the seating arrangements, but looking at his painting I could see where everyone was.\u201dMs. Hicks knew she wanted an artist, thanks to word of mouth and Pinterest. After investigating a number of professionals and deciding on oil as opposed to watercolor, she chose Mr. Keys.\u201cSometimes people cry when they see the finished product or how much I\u2019ve accomplished at the end of their event,\u201d said Mr. Keys, who still gets nervous when making the delivery.Mr. Keys caps his wedding gigs at 40 a year, and he said he turned down over 100 requests. Inquiries from event planners, anxious brides, even mothers-in-law regarding his availability doubled in 2016 from 2015.\u201cThis has taken off greater than expected,\u201d said Mr. Keys, who has focused solely on weddings for the past five years. Prices can range from $3,500 to $5,000, plus transportation and accommodation expenses for two nights. Each painting can take more than 20 hours to complete and is delivered eight to 10 weeks after the wedding.Some couples choose other types of live art: sketches by illustrators, paintings by watercolorists, and also work created by an iPad app.Abigail Smith and Oscar Zamorano hired Ronald Bayens for an oil painting to colorfully celebrate their day. The couple married Nov. 26, 2016, in Auburn, Ala., at the Jule Collins Smith Museum of Fine Art, named after the bride\u2019s grandmother, who died the previous year. Hiring a painter seemed to be in keeping with their passion and theme, and was a thoughtful nod to her grandmother.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the final product yet,\u201d said Ms. Zamorano, 30, who lives with her husband in St. Louis. \u201cBut we saw different stages of it coming to life throughout the evening. When you can see it progressing, and when you see people\u2019s reactions, it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\u201cHe painted in several people at the wedding,\u201d she added, \u201cbut we sent him photos of other guests we wanted added in who are meaningful to us.\u201dMr. Bayens, whose fee was $4,500 and was a gift from the bride\u2019s parents, chose a space in the Grand Gallery to honor the couple.\u201cI loved the idea that we could make the reception even more personal,\u201d Ms. Zamorano said. \u201cWe loved our photographer, but wanted another way of remembering our occasion that we could display. Your wedding goes by so fast. Anything you can do to remember how everything looked and felt during the process makes it even better.\u201dWhile some artists rely on more traditional methods to encapsulate a moment \u2014 a blank canvas, easel, rainbow of colors, set of pencils and brushes \u2014 others are using technology.Emily Brickel Edelson is a founder and lead fashion illustrator of Chic Sketch, a live-event service that turns participants into a custom sketch. The company\u2019s mobile app will do something similar. For $9.99, a user can send a photo; a fashion artist will transform it into an illustration and email it back.\u201cI can do a very flattering, fashionable digital sketch on my tablet of anyone at the wedding in three to five minutes,\u201d Ms. Brickel Edelson said.The two-year-old company sends up to three illustrators to portray guests at any wedding. Chic Sketch can print out a 2-by-3-inch sticker of a drawing while on site, broadcast the sketches on a TV screen or projector, and offer a time-lapse video recording of the artist making your chic-self come to life. Prices run from $1,500 to $4,500 for a four-hour event.\u201cPeople are awe-struck,\u201d Ms. Brickel Edelson said. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional attachment. You can see it in their faces. It\u2019s an elevated selfie.\u201dPortability helps, too, as Ms. Brickel Edelson can follow the couple, or guests, whether it\u2019s inside or out, in a small area or at the cake cutting.That was part of the appeal for Catherine Peridis and Bradley Greenawalt, who hired Chic Sketch for their cocktail reception. Ms. Brickel Edelson, who was set up at a table in the garden at Wave Hill, along the Hudson River in the Bronx, sketched 30 of Ms. Peridis\u2019s guests, (there were 110) and emailed or texted everyone their personalized artwork.\u201cFashion is such a big part of me and what I do,\u201d said Ms. Peridis, who is a freelance stylist and creative consultant. \u201cWe did a black-tie wedding, and everyone got dressed up. This was a great chance to give my guests a special memento of them looking beautiful.\u201d\u201cSome friends still have it up as their profile picture on Instagram and Facebook,\u201d she added.In January, the St. Regis Princeville Resort, in Princeville, Hawaii, collaborated with the fashion illustrator Dallas Shaw, crowning her its resident in-house artist for 2017.\u201cI work for luxury designers so this is a special something for the bride to get that\u2019s not readily available to them,\u201d she said. (Ms. Shaw\u2019s first book, \u201cThe Way She Wears It,\u201d was released on March 28.) \u201cI\u2019m not the traditional watercolor person who will draw your guests. It\u2019s not a portrait or a jury drawing. These brides are looking for something way more stylish.\u201dMs. Shaw, who charges $2,500 plus tax, travel expenses and accommodations for her and her assistant, will create three custom 9-by-12-inch illustrations of the couple while on the property. Newlyweds looking for a fashion statement without the large price tag can opt for an original 9-by-12-inch illustration pulled from an image provided by the couple of their wedding for $1,000 plus tax.\u201cEveryone has a photographer and has photos taken,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a piece of luxury she can have in her home just for her.\u201dOther couples place importance on the entertainment, interaction and camaraderie of having an artist at their wedding.\u201cThis is so much more than just a still photo,\u201d said Vanessa Garcia, 29, who married Andrew Becerra on July 9, 2016, at the Wilson Creek Winery & Vineyards in Temecula, Calif. \u201cHaving a live painter gave our guests something different without separating them from the wedding experience. It brought them together.\u201dThe Becerras found Lisa Owen while visiting a wine store where they stumbled upon her roadside gallery. Like the Hickses at their reception, they requested that Ms. Owen depict their first dance. Their oil painting, which cost $1,250, now hangs above their fireplace in Corona, Calif.\u201cLisa let people add a touch or paint a stroke if they wanted to, so my guests felt they were helping to create this,\u201d Ms. Becerra said. \u201cI have something no one else will ever have. This is our piece. You can\u2019t put a price on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "High-Ranking Syrian Officials Could Face Reckoning in Landmark Spain Case", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byThe death of a 43-year-old delivery van driver in Syria with no known political connections could easily have faded into obscurity. Instead, photographs showing he was burned, beaten and starved in a Damascus prison have propelled him to prominence in a landmark legal action targeting officials close to President Bashar al-Assad.A judge in Spain\u2019s national court agreed on Monday to hear criminal proceedings against high-ranking members of Syria\u2019s security services over the 2013 death of the driver, identified in court documents only by his first name, Abdul, to protect relatives in Syria.While Syria may dismiss the complaint as meaningless, international jurists said it could represent a legal reckoning for Syrian officials who have acted with impunity in six years of war.Defendants may find themselves taken into custody if they travel abroad. Their assets could be seized in other countries.\u201cIt starts a process of accountability,\u201d said Stephen J. Rapp, former United States ambassador at large for the Office of Global Criminal Justice and now a nonresident fellow at The Hague Institute for Global Justice, who helped to file the case. \u201cWe could have international arrest warrants in a month or two against these individuals.\u201dThe defendants include Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa, a former foreign minister; Ali Mamlouk, head of the National Security Bureau; Gen. Jamil Hassan, head of air force intelligence, one of Mr. Assad\u2019s most feared organizations; and senior officers running the prison where Abdul was detained and killed.The case \u201cwill specifically allow the courts to investigate the torture and execution of thousands of civilians in the illegal detention centers\u201d operated by Mr. Assad\u2019s government, according to lawyers in London and Madrid with the Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, a legal advocacy group that represents Abdul\u2019s sister.The case reflects accelerating efforts in Europe to bypass the political obstacles that have thwarted access to other international justice remedies for crimes committed in Syria\u2019s war.Russia, a key ally of Mr. Assad, has made clear that it will use its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to block Syria\u2019s referral to the International Criminal Court. China has vowed to follow suit.European prosecutors have started more than 20 cases against individuals for war crimes, but all have focused on low-ranking perpetrators from opposition armed groups or jihadist forces. The case in Spain targets the Syrian government and high-ranking officials.Judge Eloy Velasco ruled that Spain\u2019s national court had jurisdiction to hear the case because the plaintiff is a Spanish citizen, and that under international law, relatives of people who have disappeared or died from crimes committed elsewhere are also victims.Ms. Bernabeu called the judge\u2019s ruling \u201ca landmark decision not only for the victims\u2019 fight for justice but also for the requirements to investigate and prosecute international crimes in national courts when other international institutions such as the International Criminal Court have proven unable to do so.\u201dGermany\u2019s federal prosecutor has agreed to hear witness testimony in a case filed in March by the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights and two Syrian lawyers, Anwar al-Bunni and Mazen Darwish, which accuses six high-ranking Syrian officials of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The center has not publicly identified the officials, and it is unclear when, or if, that case will advance to a court.Guernica 37 lawyers are also preparing a case relating to the death of Abbas Khan, a 32-year-old British doctor who had traveled to Syria to treat war casualties and died in a Damascus prison in December 2013. Syrian officials said he had hanged himself in his cell days before the government had promised to release him.The case undertaken in Spain began when a WhatsApp message appeared on Amal\u2019s phone during her lunch break showing a photo of Abdul\u2019s face taken after his death, Ms. Bernabeu said.The Syrian Association for Missing and Conscience Detainees, an activist group, posted about 3,000 of the Caesar photographs on Facebook in March 2015. Abdul\u2019s son, who has escaped to Turkey, spotted what he believed was his father\u2019s face and sent it to his aunt in Madrid.Confirming that Abdul was the man in the photograph was not easy, Ms. Bernabeu said. His face and body were emaciated, with burn marks. His limbs appeared to have been broken.Abdul\u2019s identity was confirmed by his widow during an emotional Skype call in which Ms. Bernabeu showed her the Caesar images, and she identified surgery scars.Syrian activists have welcomed the Spain case but remain frustrated that Mr. Assad and his subordinates have yet to answer to an international tribunal.\u201cThe realistic chance of arresting any of them and bringing them to trial is very slim,\u201d said Mohammad al-Abdallah, a former detainee who is now executive director of the Syria Justice and Accountability Center in The Hague.Others still saw progress.The Spain case is \u201cnot a panacea by any means, but in a conflict that has been without any positive symbols, this is potentially positive,\u201d said Cameron Hudson, director of the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide in Washington.He said the case could show that \u201cthere is an end that we can get to that would involve some measure of justice and accountability.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Software Engineer Starts Unlikely Business: A Weekly Newspaper", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byMONTCLAIR, N.J. \u2014 In a newsroom wedged into a storefront here, reporters worked on stories about the contentious issues driving the conversation around town, like a property reassessment that could affect taxes and testing in the public schools. An editor read through submissions for a St. Patrick\u2019s Day limerick contest. And Kevin Meacham, the newspaper\u2019s top editor, was in his office, looking at a mock-up of a front page on his computer, \u201cXXXX\u201d taking the place of headlines waiting to be written.This month, the weekly newspaper arrived for the first time in mailboxes around town. A local family decided to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into starting a news organization from scratch, hiring reporters to cover zoning board meetings and high school wrestling tournaments and whatever else residents in this New Jersey suburb care about.The investment \u2014 by a software engineer who studied artificial intelligence, no less \u2014 seems like a quixotic one when so many newspapers are struggling and many readers prefer to catch up on town news on Facebook. But the engineer, Heeten Choxi, whose journalism experience was limited to a middle school newspaper, believes there is no better way than print to deliver local news.\u201cIt looks beautiful,\u201d Mr. Choxi, who has lived in Montclair for three years, said as he flipped through a copy of the first issue. \u201cNews tends to be more fragmented,\u201d he added, referring to social media. \u201cYou find out about topics you\u2019re already looking for. You don\u2019t get that same broad exposure to all the different things happening in town.\u201dThe debut has touched off a modern version of an old-fashioned newspaper war, with a fledgling independent newcomer pitting itself against a community staple, printed since 1877, that has had cuts in coverage and staffing after it was bought by a major publishing company.The new newspaper is an audacious bet that a renewed interest in journalism can trickle down to the community level. And if any place can support such an endeavor, it is Montclair.\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have done it in any of the other towns I\u2019ve lived in,\u201d Mr. Choxi, who, with his wife, Thalla-Marie, is The Local\u2019s publisher, said in the newspaper\u2019s office, as his daughter played in the back room. \u201cI feel like Montclair is a town that really does value having its people be informed and engaged.\u201dMontclair, a town of 37,000 people in Essex County, is a 20-mile drive from New York City, with streets lined with colonial homes set back on tidy lawns and walkable strips of small businesses. Residents brag about the absence of drive-throughs and strip malls that are fixtures elsewhere in New Jersey.\u201cSome people would argue that what happens on the local basis is more important than what happens on the national basis,\u201d said Linda Moss, a reporter who covers municipal government, a beat she once had for The Montclair Times.She noted that Montclair\u2019s property taxes were among the highest in the state, and that she knew from experience that readers cared about education and public safety. \u201cThese are things that hit home for people every day,\u201d she said, \u201cand these are the things we\u2019re writing about and focusing on.\u201dThe Local, for some, has been a welcome move in the opposite direction, even if media analysts say it faces long odds of financial success. \u201cThat can have an amazing impact, putting more reporters on the street,\u201d said Stefanie Murray, director of the Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University. \u201cThey\u2019ve reported on that community. They know that community. That, actually, is the potentially biggest contribution Heeten and his wife will make through this investment.\u201dMr. Choxi said the decision to start the newspaper was in response to what he saw happening with The Montclair Times as Gannett, the company that publishes USA Today and dozens of other newspapers around the country, took over. He noticed articles in The Montclair Times from towns miles away, like Lodi and Paramus, both in Bergen County \u2014 \u201cwhich I don\u2019t really view as local,\u201d he said. A report released this month by the Center for Cooperative Media, examining the evolution in coverage since the ownership change, found significant decreases in articles about the community, with a 12 percent jump in stories not about Montclair in The Times.Rick Green, the editor and vice president of content for the North Jersey Media Group, acknowledged some tumult as the news organization reorganized its staff, but he argued that it had continued to provide robust news coverage in print and online. He believes The Montclair Times is well positioned.\u201cCompetition is good for everyone involved,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cIt sharpens our skills, it makes us better, and ultimately the reader benefits from that competition.\u201d He added, \u201cI know we\u2019ve been there for a long time, with a great track record, and we\u2019re committed to doing journalism that makes a difference in Montclair.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s enough going on in town, between local government, education, arts, theater and restaurants,\u201d said Andy Weinstein, a lawyer who grew up in Montclair and moved back with his family last year. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to talk about.\u201dMr. Choxi has hired seven journalists, most of whom either lost their jobs at the North Jersey Media Group or left voluntarily. A subscription costs $12 a year, and he is aiming to sign up 6,000 subscribers. \u201cWe want it to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it to be sustainable. But it\u2019s not about making money for us.\u201dThe first issue of The Local was published on March 9 and mailed to every home address in town. Its motto: \u201cObjectively Informing, Sparking Dialogue, and Building Community.\u201d There were front-page articles about a ShopRite possibly moving into a shopping center and the public school budget. A rare nod to the world beyond Montclair was an article on residents \u201ckeeping up the \u2018resistance\u2019\u201d with letter-writing campaigns and organizing dinners with Syrian refugees.It was met with positive reviews on community Facebook groups. At least one person who stopped by the newsroom had intended to go to a neighboring insurance office. But there were others who bought subscriptions or wanted to offer praise in person.\u201cI think people were delighted to find this wonderful piece of writing and community showing up in their mailbox,\u201d said Debra Caplan, a theater professor at Baruch College, who lives in Montclair. She wrote a column in the first issue about the area congressman\u2019s town hall meetings.\u201cWhat I expected was a lot less professional than what emerged,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing I wouldn\u2019t have thought could be done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those internet companies are not regulated by the F.C.C. but are increasingly in competition with telecom companies for online streaming customers.Lawmakers and Republican regulators at the F.C.C. have said they plan to target the 2015 classification of broadband as a utilitylike service that is strapped with strong regulatory oversight. They are also set to seek the overturning of Obama-era net neutrality rules that forbade broadband providers from blocking, slowing down or charging extra for downloads of websites and apps.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve created is confusion, and this is the way to rein in an agency that was overreaching,\u201d said Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who introduced the House bill to overturn the privacy rules.

{"Headline": "Davis Cup May Switch to Best-of-Three-Set Matches", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byThe leaders of the International Tennis Federation took a significant step on Thursday toward ending a 117-year tradition when they voted unanimously in favor of a proposal that would switch the Davis Cup to best-of-three-set matches.The Davis Cup, the sport\u2019s leading men\u2019s national team competition, has used best-of-five-set matches since it began as a challenge cup between Britain and the United States in 1900.David Haggerty, the I.T.F.\u2019s president, said the federation\u2019s board was also proposing to reduce Davis Cup ties from three days to two, pending consultation with the event\u2019s sponsors and broadcasters.The proposed changes, which would be enacted in 2018, must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the I.T.F.\u2019s full membership at its annual general meeting in early August in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\u201cI think the main drivers of our strategy are to increase top player participation and enhance the experience for the fans, the spectators and the broadcasters,\u201d Haggerty said in a telephone interview from Indian Wells, Calif., on Thursday. \u201cTwo five-set matches in one day can be very exciting, but it can also be very long. You lose TV audiences, so we think the quality of the two-out-of-three-set matches will far outweigh what people feel they may not be getting.\u201dDavis Cup remains far more popular in Australia and some European and South American nations than in the United States, which has not won the competition since 2007. Last year, Argentina\u2019s first victory was a major story (and cause for celebration) in that country.Traditionalists would bemoan the loss of the long-form Davis Cup, which has generated many epic matches through the decades. Haggerty said it was possible that the best-of-five-set format over three days could be preserved for the final, but even in that case, the four Grand Slam tournaments would become the only events where all men\u2019s singles matches were played in the best-of-five format.Bernard Giudicelli, the new president of the French Tennis Federation, who is chairman of the Davis Cup committee, said on Wednesday in a video posted on his Facebook page that \u201cwe have to evolve with our time\u201d and that \u201cfewer people stay seated for eight hours to watch tennis.\u201dBut the Davis Cup proposals are also an attempt to shore up the event within the sport. In last month\u2019s first round, Novak Djokovic of Serbia was the only member of the Top 10 to play.\u201cI think if you dislike change, you\u2019ll dislike irrelevance even more,\u201d said the United States Davis Cup captain, Jim Courier, paraphrasing the retired Gen. Eric Shinseki, a former Army chief of staff. \u201cWhen you lose support of the top players, as we did in the first round this year, I think it\u2019s clear that you have a declining asset that you need to refurbish if you want it to be pristine again.\u201cDave knows that,\u201d Courier said, referring to Haggerty. \u201cI think he\u2019s the right guy for the job. What I like about this move is that he consulted the players.\u201dOther national team competitions have been proposed in the past and are again being considered. The inaugural Laver Cup, a three-day event between a team representing Europe and one representing the rest of the world, will be played in Prague in September.Haggerty said the ATP Player Council had expressed support for the proposed changes, and Chris Kermode, the executive chairman and president of the ATP, said in an email that \u201cwhile the players clearly see the value of the Davis Cup, there is a strong desire to see some change to the format.\u201d\u201cThe proposal to move towards a best-of-three-set format across two days has been an important part of our discussions,\u201d Kermode wrote.Others maintain that more radical change is needed.\u201cUntil the I.T.F. goes away from Davis Cup being an every-year occurrence, it will continue to face the exact same challenges,\u201d Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain, said Thursday.For now, it remains an annual event in transition.Under the current format, two singles matches are played on a Friday, a doubles match on a Saturday and two more singles matches on a Sunday. The switch to two days, which would mimic the Fed Cup women\u2019s team event, eliminates the possibility of a competitively meaningless third day of tennis. In Davis Cup\u2019s current format, a team can clinch a 3-0 victory before the third day.Haggerty said the I.T.F. leadership had not decided where to place the doubles in a two-day format. Scheduling it first on the final day could prove unpopular with the players who compete in singles and doubles. Players generally prefer to play singles first. Scheduling doubles as the last match on the final day, which is where it sits in Fed Cup, could make doubles a much less central part of Davis Cup and lower its profile in general.But the more contentious debate continues to be about the proposal to put the Davis Cup final at a neutral venue chosen far in advance, to help with revenue and promotion, instead of allowing one of the two finalists to stage it on short notice. Djokovic and other top players have opposed the idea, which the I.T.F. is still studying. It has called for cities to submit bids to host the 2018 final and will study those bids in June, deciding only then whether to go forward with a proposal to the general meeting in Vietnam.\u201cI think most of tennis are behind the changes we have just made,\u201d Haggerty said of best-of-three-set and two-day formats. \u201cI still have some heavy lifting to do on the fixed-final concept.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to track down and prosecute individuals like the defendant before they are able to become foreign fighters or harm the United States and its allies.\u201dAccording to the complaint, Mr. Redzepagic first spoke to federal agents after being arrested in Suffolk County in February for an unrelated offense. In interviews with investigators from a joint terrorism task force, he said he had become a Muslim while he was in Montenegro.In 2015, the complaint said, Mr. Redzepagic began communicating with a cousin who he believed was a member of the Islamic State or the Nusra Front and the commander of a battalion in Syria.Mr. Redzepagic told the authorities that the cousin, who was not identified, instructed him to travel to Istanbul and contact him when he got there, according to the complaint.Based on Mr. Redzepagic\u2019s account and airline and customs records, the complaint said, the authorities determined that he had indeed traveled to Turkey that year, spending about seven days in Istanbul and making \u201cseveral unsuccessful attempts to obtain help and cross the border into Syria.\u201dThe complaint said Mr. Redzepagic told the authorities \u201che was prepared to strap a bomb on and sacrifice himself for jihad.\u201dHe also told investigators he believed that fighting in Syria was different from committing a domestic act of terrorism and that he did not want to harm innocent people, the complaint said.Unable to reach his cousin and \u201cfrustrated by the lack of assistance he was receiving, and unable to enter Syria,\u201d the complaint said, Mr. Redzepagic returned to the United States.After obtaining a search warrant, investigators searched a Facebook account used by Mr. Redzepagic where they found messages he had sent, including \u201cI read a lot about jihad,\u201d and \u201csince I got back from turkey from trying to perform Jihad and join Jabhat Al Nusra the cia has been bothering me,\u201d according to the complaint.In August 2016, the complaint said, Mr. Redzepagic went to Jordan planning to enter Syria. But he was stopped by Jordanian officials and returned to the United States. Mr. Redzepagic told Customs and Border Protection officials who debriefed him when he returned that the purpose of his trip was to learn Arabic.Mildred M. Whalen, a lawyer for Mr. Redzepagic, said in an email that he had been \u201cfully cooperative with law enforcement.\u201d\u201cWe will be working with his family in the hope that the court and the government will see that what he needs is counseling and support, not imprisonment,\u201d Ms. Whalen said.Jack Begg contributed research.Advertisement"}

And despite the many competing platforms that now allow for the public airing of opinions and grievances \u2014 the endless chatter on Facebook and Twitter, a given article\u2019s online comments \u2014 The Times\u2019s letters section is as robust a forum as ever.Lately, in fact, it\u2019s seen a surge in submissions. \u201cSince the election, and since the inauguration, the numbers have gone up significantly,\u201d said Thomas Feyer, the editor to whom, though unbeknown to most writers, the letters are addressed. (Two additional editors work with Mr. Feyer to curate and edit the submissions, and to design the page for print.)That\u2019s because readers see the page as a safety valve of sorts, he said. \u201cIn moments of national importance, people feel the need to give their opinions, or to express shock, or excitement, or grief, or mourning. And we help give them voice.\u201dIn all, between 10 and 15 letters appear daily in The Times. And given the constraints \u2014 limited page space, the demands of timeliness, the ever-flowing current of news \u2014 it isn\u2019t simply a matter of selecting the best individual letters.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a building a ship in a bottle: It\u2019s a very tight space, and we have to make it fit to the line,\u201d Mr. Feyer said, noting that oftentimes he holds letters for a day or two simply because he doesn\u2019t have sufficient space to publish them.By now you\u2019ve probably done the math: If 10 or 15 letters are pulled from a pool of a thousand, then somewhere between 1 and 2 percent of submitted letters find a home on the Opinion page. Not great odds. Still, for aspiring letter writers, there are ways to improve one\u2019s chances of landing in print.Above all, keep it short, Mr. Feyer says. Letters are typically between 150 and 175 words, so submitting a letter of Op-Ed length is often disqualifying.\u201cAnd make your argument forcefully and clearly,\u201d he added, emphasizing that The Times values wit and humor.\u201cWe like a combination of ordinary people and those who are experts in the field,\u201d said Mr. Feyer, who in the course of his career has had the opportunity both to edit a letter from Kurt Vonnegut and to reject one from Tom Wolfe. (Mr. Wolfe\u2019s was too \u201cinside baseball,\u201d Mr. Feyer said.)As a rule, the letters section does not address factual errors in the news report; those are handled in the corrections section. And, if you submit a letter, make sure you\u2019re available on email or phone to field edits made for space, clarity, civility and accuracy.But regardless of the outcome, and despite the fact that not everyone receives a response, letter writers can rest assured that Mr. Feyer has read each submission and considered it for publication \u2014 and, more likely than not, enjoyed its contents.\u201cOur readers are very attentive, very perceptive,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to be guided by their interests.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cI learn something from them every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pressed Into Caregiving Sooner Than Expected", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported by The New Old AgeIt was August, and Gina Rinehart was preparing for another school year as a special-education teacher in Hemet, Calif., when she got the call: Her father, Floyd Hall, was facing surgery to remove a tumor in his lung.She flew to rural Lake Cushman, Wash., to be with her parents, expecting to spend two weeks helping her dad recover. Her father, known as Bub and an active retiree at 68, spent his days woodworking, volunteering at the local food bank and helping his own 95-year-old mother.But the report from the surgical team was grim: Stage 4 lung cancer, a terminal diagnosis. \u201cHave you ever heard news and felt like you wanted to throw up?\u201d said Ms. Rinehart, who recalls breaking into a cold sweat. \u201cI was seriously shocked.\u201dHer son and daughter had only recently left home for school and work. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have a break, my husband and me,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the kids gone and a little extra money, I thought we could go to Europe. He\u2019s never been.\u201dInstead, since that discovery in 2013, Ms. Rinehart and a younger brother, Patryk Hall, who also lives in Southern California, have been trading off monthslong stints at their parents\u2019 home. With her father declining rapidly now, Ms. Rinehart has decided to stay for the duration.Elder care was a responsibility Ms. Rinehart expected to shoulder, eventually. But she didn\u2019t foresee having to leave her home for extended periods and to give up her job when she was just 46.Researchers call this an \u201coff-time event,\u201d a normal experience that comes at a point when it\u2019s not normal. Most family members caring for elders are over 55, the National Academy of Sciences reported last year, and the older people most likely to need \u201cintensive support\u201d from family are in their 80s or older.Anyone can be suddenly pressed into family caregiving, of course: Ask those whose spouses have been injured in accidents or war zones, or parents of children with disabilities. But most of us don\u2019t anticipate caring for our parents, or other older relatives, in our 30s or 40s.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t really prepared to take on the responsibility then,\u201d said Donna Cohen, a psychologist and gerontologist at the University of South Florida. \u201cIt comes when you\u2019re still climbing to the summit in your own life.\u201dBeyond the challenges that caregiving brings at any age, these people face particular disruptions.Among the youngest group, \u201cwhat particularly concerns them is the negative impact on their pursuit of education,\u201d said Feylyn Lewis, a doctoral candidate at the University of Birmingham in England, whose dissertation looks at 18- to 25-year-old caregivers.Caregivers closer to midlife contend with pressures at work and sometimes have to reduce their hours, refuse promotions or retire early. Ms. Rinehart took a personal leave from her school, but when her absence exceeded the maximum number of months allowed, she resigned. \u201cI loved my job,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cI miss the kids.\u201dIn turn, job loss increases current and future financial strains.Younger caregivers may also have children at home. \u201cThey feel pulled,\u201d said Carol Whitlatch, assistant director for research and education at the Benjamin Rose Institute in Cleveland. \u201cThey need to be there for their kids who are still dependent, and they have parents who are growing more dependent.\u201dColleen Kavanaugh calls herself \u201cthe classic stereotype\u201d of a caregiver, \u201cthe firstborn daughter who lives nearby and puts everything on hold.\u201d In 2004, when she moved back into her parents\u2019 home in Martinsville, N.J., she was newly divorced, with a 5-year-old son. Then 33, she planned to regroup, find another job and, within a few months, move out and resume her independent life.But her mother learned she had breast cancer; after multiple surgeries and increasing disability, she died in early 2009. Then Ms. Kavanaugh\u2019s father, who had been experiencing memory loss, was found to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease.When caring for him at home became too difficult, Ms. Kavanaugh moved him into assisted living and finally to a nursing home; he died in 2013. Along the way, while helping her son navigate school, Ms. Kavanaugh had to leave her job managing a marketing and design firm.\u201cI went seven years with no income, no 401(k), the loss of Social Security\u201d contributions, she said. \u201cIt was a bitter pill.\u201dPerhaps the most jarring aspect of off-time caregiving, though, is the sense of becoming entirely out of sync with one\u2019s peers.Friends fall away after the umpteenth time a caregiver says no to a concert or cancels a dinner because of an emergency, or because of simple exhaustion. Caregivers report biting their tongues when agemates grouse about seemingly trivial problems, from disappointing vacations to home d\u00e9cor dilemmas.\u201cWe are so isolated,\u201d said Noraleigh Carthy, 50, who lives in Portland, Ore. She has spent four years lovingly caring for her partner, who has a degenerative muscular disease, while working part time and raising their 13-year-old daughter.\u201cI get so angry and jealous when friends post on Facebook about some very basic thing, like a Sunday hike with their family.\u201dShe looked into caregiver support groups, but felt she had little in common with their much older members. \u201cIt\u2019s different when you\u2019ve had your career, your chance to travel,\u201d Ms. Carthy said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so angry if I were retired and I\u2019d already had the chance to live my life.\u201dMs. Kavanaugh found that the people she grew close to, as her father moved into a dementia unit, were other women with parents there. \u201cAll my friends were in their 50s to 80s,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have contemporaries to confide in.\u201dAt least she had confidantes. \u201cOne way to discharge anger and reduce stress is to be able to talk about it,\u201d Dr. Cohen said. She worries about younger caregivers\u2019 physical and mental health if they feel unsupported and too overwhelmed to take care of themselves.Supportive programs specifically for younger people providing elder care struck her as a good idea, possibly using social media. The people who most understand what Ms. Rinehart is going through aren\u2019t old friends, she said; they\u2019re participants in a weekly Twitter chat (#LCSM Chat).Not one of these caregivers regrets undertaking the role. As Joseph Gaugler, a gerontologist at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, points out, many caregivers take satisfaction in reciprocating their parents\u2019 sacrifices and pride in doing a good job.Patryk Hall, 49, may always remember the nights he and his father, both science fiction lovers prone to insomnia, sat up watching \u201cStar Trek\u201d and \u201cFirefly\u201d DVDs, fortified with blackberry cheesecake ice cream.But off-time caregiving can also change your perspective for good. Though Bub Hall has long outlived his prognosis, he is faltering. Hospice care is probably not far-off, his daughter said.After his death, Ms. Rinehart intends to bring her mother home to live with her and her husband in Southern California, where she\u2019ll find another teaching job. At least, \u201cthat\u2019s the plan,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned that you can\u2019t expect things to go the way you think.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The region\u2019s commuter rail line is saddled with aging, smoke-spewing, diesel-powered locomotives.For more than a decade, the managers of the Silicon Valley railway, known as Caltrain, have been planning to upgrade to faster and less polluting electric trains.But those plans are now imperiled by the Trump administration\u2019s decision in February to withhold a $647 million federal grant.In this impasse, some transportation experts see a foretaste of the political infighting and financial hurdles that could plague the nationwide infrastructure projects that President Trump is promising. Reviving America\u2019s rusted and sagging infrastructure is one of the few areas where it seemed Democrats and Republicans could agree. But making these projects a reality \u2014 the \u201cnew roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land\u201d that Mr. Trump enumerated to Congress last week \u2014 will require political cooperation and accommodations that are increasingly rare in ultrapartisan times.In the case of Caltrain, the decision to withhold the grant came after California\u2019s Republican congressional delegation asked the transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, to withdraw funding because the electrified system also would be used for the state\u2019s bigger high-speed rail project, a plan they vehemently oppose.The high-speed rail line connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles is the most ambitious rail plan in the country and has been in the works for more than two decades with a projected cost of $64 billion. The project calls for completion in 2029.Despite initial support, Republicans now regard the high-speed project as too costly.\u201cWe have said no more federal dollars will go to California high-speed rail,\u201d said Representative Jeff Denham, a Republican who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Railroads. \u201cWe\u2019re very strong on that position.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Denham said the project should immediately stop.There has long been tension in California between advocates of more freeways and those favoring public transport. But the high-speed rail project had bipartisan support in its early stages. It was formally started in 1996 by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and was supported by another Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.That consensus is long gone. The letter penned by the state\u2019s 14 Republican members of Congress, including Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, called the project a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and described the Caltrain grant as an \u201cirresponsible use of taxpayer dollars.\u201dCaltrain and the high-speed rail project are administratively separate, but a 2013 agreement to share tracks as a cost-saving measure raised Republican ire.Defunding the electrification of the Silicon Valley corridor has immediate consequences for the system\u2019s 65,000 daily commuters. Caltrain had hoped to switch to its electric system by 2021. The current trains are overcrowded and breakdowns are frequent; there are more than 19 mechanical failures per month, according to Caltrain engineers. Two-thirds of the fleet has \u201creached the end of its useful life,\u201d Caltrain says.At the rail line\u2019s maintenance depot, engineers say they have trouble finding parts for the locomotives, which were built in the 1980s. And new maintenance workers need lectures from veteran technicians because they have no experience working on such old equipment.\u201cYou change out parts here and there,\u201d said Joe Navarro, director of operations and maintenance at Caltrain. \u201cWe are putting Band-Aids on. It\u2019s very challenging.\u201d\u201cWe are lucky to live in a place where innovation is in the DNA, but we don\u2019t see that for public transport,\u201d said Sridhar Iyer, a software engineer for Twitter who rides the double-decker Caltrain that runs near the headquarters of Apple, Facebook and Google. \u201cThe whole thing is stuck in the past.\u201dIn recent weeks, more than a dozen leaders of Silicon Valley firms called lawmakers to urge that the federal money be released for the Caltrain electrification project, according to Carl Guardino, the president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents most of the region\u2019s large tech companies.Mr. Guardino called the Republican campaign to block funding \u201ca misinformed effort.\u201d\u201cThe most important asset of the innovation economy are our employees,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they are stuck and stalled in traffic they are not productively creating the future.\u201dThe specific objection by Republicans is that $600 million of state funds allocated to Caltrain\u2019s electrification were initially authorized by a 2008 referendum on high-speed rail, known as Proposition 1A.\u201cThey are stealing Prop 1A money and using it for something else,\u201d Mr. Denham said.Caltrain says that although the two trains will use the same tracks, the electrification project is \u201cindependent\u201d and high-speed rail\u2019s use of the corridor will require a separate environmental review.The bigger picture, proponents of the electrification project say, is that the commuter rail project deserves the support of the Trump administration because it meets the broad criteria of its infrastructure push \u2014 it will be made in America by American workers. Almost all of the materials for the new train system will be sourced from factories across 14 states. Caltrain estimates the project will create nearly 10,000 jobs.\u201cThis is the perfect project if you care about infrastructure, if you care about jobs and if you care about focusing on areas that are going to deliver long-term economic benefit,\u201d said Stuart Cohen, the executive director of TransForm, a nonprofit group that advocates public transportation.The state High-Speed Rail Authority is making a similar pitch. \u201cEvery ounce of the steel, every ounce of the concrete is domestic,\u201d Dan Richard, the authority\u2019s chairman, said. \u201cWe are reaching out to the Trump administration to make the case that this is entirely consistent with the president\u2019s vision.\u201dOutside Fresno, a city in California\u2019s Central Valley surrounded by almond and fruit orchards and racked by poverty, about 1,000 workers have been employed on the project to build viaducts and tunnels at 10 construction sites.The Finance Department of Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, decided on Friday that the project was ready to lay some track and approved $2.6 billion in spending. But there are lingering questions about how the later stages of the project will be financed, especially if Congress blocks more federal support.Although the authority was established more than two decades, ago it was only in 2013 that construction began on the first, 119-mile segment of the project.Mayor Lee Brand of Fresno, a Republican, supports the project, which would make Silicon Valley a 45-minute train ride away by 2025.\u201cI don\u2019t look at this ideologically,\u201d Mr. Brand said. \u201cI look at it practically. The city of Fresno can enjoy a major benefit from what\u2019s going on with high-speed rail. This is a poor city that needs all the help it can get.\u201dTom Richards, a real estate developer in Fresno who is on the authority\u2019s board, said the rail connection could encourage tech companies to set up in the city and workers to commute to well-paying jobs in Silicon Valley.\u201cThis is a whole story about connecting California together,\u201d he said.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Compounding Pharmacy Owner Not Guilty of Murder After 60 Meningitis Deaths", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that some 13,000 people in multiple states could have been injected with the possibly tainted medicine, and recipients waited anxiously to see if they developed symptoms.In all, 732 people were sickened by the meningitis and other infections. Sixty-four people died. Many survivors live with constant pain.On Wednesday, the first trial related to the outbreak ended in a split verdict: A jury here convicted Barry J. Cadden, 50, the owner and head pharmacist at the New England Compounding Center, of more than 50 counts of mail fraud and racketeering, but acquitted him of 25 counts of second-degree murder.The acquittal on the murder charges dismayed some survivors of the outbreak and probably spared Mr. Cadden from a sentence of life in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for June 21; Mr. Cadden will remain free until then.The acting United States attorney for Massachusetts, William D. Weinreb, said Mr. Cadden was being held accountable for serious crimes, despite the acquittals.Officials looking into the New England Compounding Center case said investigators had found dirty mats and hoods, a leaky boiler, dark debris floating in vials of medicine, and evidence that the laboratory was not leaving enough time to properly sterilize some products. They also said that a supposedly clean room was infested with insects and mice.\u201cThis trial revealed that, among other things, Mr. Cadden participated in a massive fraud in which N.E.C.C. masqueraded as a pharmacy when it was in fact manufacturing drugs,\u201d Mr. Weinreb said. \u201cAs a result of that, he managed to escape F.D.A. oversight of his actions, and 65 people died. Hundreds of others were injured.\u201dThe defense argued that prosecutors had failed to show how the drugs had been contaminated or to specify any role that Mr. Cadden might have played in the deaths. On Wednesday, Mr. Cadden\u2019s lawyer, Bruce A. Singal, pushed back against Mr. Weinreb\u2019s comments, saying his client had not been convicted of massive fraud.\u201cIt was a terrible lapse of judgment for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to accuse Mr. Cadden of murder in the first instance,\u201d Mr. Singal wrote in an email. \u201cFor the prosecution to persist in trying to blame him for the deaths in the wake of acquittals on all 25 murders is irresponsible and reprehensible.\u201dLegal specialists said the burden of proof for the murder charges was ultimately too high.\u201cThey were going to have to show that the pharmacist knew, or recklessly disregarded, that the vials they were shipping were going to cause infection or kill people,\u201d said Kevin Outterson, a law professor at Boston University.\u201cYou can have a bad lab that is sloppy, and you might know that you\u2019re cutting corners to save money,\u201d Mr. Outterson said. \u201cThat is completely different from somebody knowing their vials were contaminated and still shipping them nonetheless.\u201dFamily members of the victims and survivors of the infections said they were dismayed that Mr. Cadden had not been convicted of murder.Angel Farthing, 46, who was sickened with meningitis and now has scar tissue on her spine, said other survivors had expressed their frustration over the verdict in a private Facebook group. She said she still hoped that Mr. Cadden would spend years in jail.\u201cI have a lifetime sentence of pain,\u201d Ms. Farthing said. \u201cStanding hurts, bending over hurts, putting my socks on hurts.\u201dEach of the 52 mail fraud counts of which Mr. Cadden was convicted carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, although Mr. Weinreb, the prosecutor, did not say how much time he would seek. \u201cI think the judge will have room to impose whatever sentence that he deems appropriate,\u201d he said.Katharine Q.

{"Headline": "White House Echoes Tech: \u2018Move Fast and Break Things\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byAdventures in CapitalismLast summer, not long after Donald J. Trump secured the Republican nomination for president, his recently installed campaign manager, Stephen K. Bannon, met with top officials from the Republican National Committee to discuss management of the general election.Mr. Trump\u2019s staff had remained unusually small throughout the grueling primaries \u2014 a compactness, his advisers believed, that had given them a nimble edge. Now most Republican officials expected the Trump team to expand as it began to oversee the thousands of Republican staff members, state officials and consultants who would be ground troops in the coming political war.But when Mr. Bannon met with R.N.C. officials, he informed them that a major expansion was not going to happen.The Trump campaign, he said, intended to remain sparse and decentralized. Borrowing a Silicon Valley mantra from Facebook, he told his shocked listeners that \u201cyour job is to move fast and break things,\u201d according to a person who was present. \u201cFigure out what needs doing, and then just do it. Don\u2019t wait for permission.\u201dHis audience was surprised. Conventional political wisdom advocated a robust and elaborate campaign hierarchy.But Mr. Bannon demanded the opposite. Winning, he said, required tactics and ideas \u2014 like distributed decision making; quick experimentation and execution rather than thoughtful deliberation; learning from left-leaning advocacy groups and video game companies \u2014 that were drawn from the management playbooks of Silicon Valley start-ups.After that meeting, many thought Mr. Bannon\u2019s strategy was crazy, the person who was present said. Then Mr. Trump won the election. And now we can argue that Mr. Trump is, in many ways, the first genuine Silicon Valley start-up candidate and president.President Barack Obama may have embraced technology, weaponized social media and sought advice from the co-founders of Facebook and LinkedIn. But he was ultimately a traditional campaigner and manager. It is Mr. Trump\u2019s team who, surprisingly, have embraced the philosophy of disruption and the management styles of Silicon Valley, and who have sought to imitate the tactics that have powered companies like Uber and Amazon.\u201cTrump is the Silicon Valley candidate in every way except that the ideology is flipped,\u201d said Sam Altman, a prominent technology leader, chief executive of Y Combinator and a major Hillary Clinton donor. \u201cHe\u2019s an outsider. He took on a system he thought was broken and then disregarded the rules, he got to know his users well and tested his product early and iterated rapidly. That\u2019s the start-up playbook. That\u2019s exactly what we tell our start-ups to do.\u201dIt remains to be seen, however, whether Mr. Trump will successfully transition from a start-up to a mature commander in chief. Just as Uber and other young tech firms have stumbled while growing, so Mr. Trump seems, right now, in over his head at the White House.But understanding these early missteps \u2014 and how start-up thinking vaulted Mr. Trump into power \u2014 is important, because it gives us a lens into the strengths and weaknesses of management techniques that are increasingly being imitated by other industries around the world.Put differently, the president\u2019s success has demonstrated the strength of the start-up philosophy. But is it a good or a bad thing if Mr. Trump becomes the first political unicorn?But the fact remains that he is a prime example of the disruptive forces that the tech industry celebrates. At the most basic level, Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of technology \u2014 the millions of dollars he has raised through online donations, and his capacity to mobilize huge crowds through email and drive news through Twitter blasts \u2014 is crucial to his unexpected political success.And his team\u2019s embrace of Silicon Valley philosophy goes much deeper. As Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign gained steam, for instance, top officials began a dedicated effort to study the tactics of successful digital advocacy groups, particularly the left-leaning Moveon.org, as well as #BlackLivesMatter, to reverse engineer methods for rapidly mobilizing voters.His campaign also reached out to video game companies to learn how to make addictive content. During the race, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with Gabriel Leydon, founder of a company in Palo Alto, Calif., named MZ, previously known as Machine Zone, which created the highly popular games Mobile Strike and Game of War: Fire Age. Mr. Leydon, one of the biggest online advertisers, agreed to share insights about digital marketing tactics with the Trump campaign. (In a statement, MZ said it never formally worked for Mr. Trump.)The influence of start-up philosophy on Mr. Trump\u2019s team extends to day-to-day management. The campaign and the White House have looked to tech industry management techniques to empower staff members to start policy initiatives, to conduct rapid digital tests, and to push fund-raising and advertising campaigns without seeking authorization from senior officials.In contrast to the methodical Obama White House and the Clinton campaign, where tweets often needed approval from at least three officials before they were posted, members of the Trump team could dream up ads or email blasts almost without oversight. At its peak, his campaign was running 60,000 different online advertisements per day to see which phrases and images outperformed others.However, the most significant connection between Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley thinking is how thoroughly he embodies the \u201cdisruption thesis\u201d that has propelled so many emerging technology firms. Mr. Trump\u2019s team has deliberately worked to remove the traditional gatekeepers \u2014 the big donors, the political parties, the advocacy groups and the news media \u2014 that have, in the past, often determined political viability.A senior campaign official said the strategy \u201csidestepped the power brokers the same way Uber sidestepped taxi dispatchers,\u201d and asserted that politics as practiced by Mr. Trump was part of a revolution that started in technology and was now spreading to other industries and governments around the world.Yet, even by that measure, Mr. Trump, who attracted many first-time voters, and who was elected with a big boost from Americans without college degrees, seems to fit the bill.Which all presents a question: If the playbook was so successful in electing Mr. Trump, why is he stumbling now? Why has the Silicon Valley mentality failed to thrive in Washington?It might be that Mr. Trump simply needs to evolve to the next level of tech industry thinking. And, in fact, there is a ready playbook for how start-ups transition into mature firms. Google, for instance, began floundering when it reached about 200 employees. So the company\u2019s founders brought in a more established leader, Eric Schmidt, to \u201cbe a bit of chaperone, providing adult supervision,\u201d as Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, explained in 2001. When Facebook\u2019s work force hit 1,800 in 2008, its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, hired Sheryl Sandberg, a seasoned manager, as chief operating officer to rein in the firm\u2019s freewheeling, decentralized culture.We\u2019re seeing a similar shift in the White House. After Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban caused widespread confusion at airports and within federal agencies last month, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, put in effect a formal process for rolling out executive orders. When the president was preparing for his address to Congress last week, his team used a formal process to review the script. Republican leaders are pushing the White House to bring on more aides with prior governing experience. As at Facebook and Google, a hierarchy is being built.But for many within the technology industry, this new, more mature White House is cause for concern. \u201cI think most people don\u2019t want him to succeed at all,\u201d said Laszlo Bock, who until last year was a senior vice president at Google. \u201cNo matter how Trump manages the White House, what he believes in is the opposite of Silicon Valley values. We don\u2019t want him to learn from us.\u201dUltimately, say Silicon Valley luminaries, the world is changing thanks to forces beyond the control of any one industry. Technology companies aren\u2019t to blame for these shifts. They have merely seen and taken advantage of them faster than everyone else.It is not a question of whether campaign managers, politicians and leaders in other industries should mimic the technology industry, but rather a question of when they will realize that it is too late to resist.\u201cI think all of this \u2014 the current start-up revolution, Trump and lots of other things \u2014 is largely a consequence of the internet breaking down traditional barriers,\u201d Mr. Altman, the Y Combinator executive, wrote in an email. \u201cThis societal openness has some great consequences in my opinion, like the start-up boom of the last 20 years, and some bad ones, like Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Wrightson, Artist and a Creator of Swamp Thing, Dies at 68", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byBernie Wrightson, a widely admired comic book artist who was known for his lush, intricate, otherworldly visions of horror and who was one of the creators of the popular DC Comics character Swamp Thing, died on March 18 in Austin, Tex. He was 68.Besides his comic book work, Mr. Wrightson did illustrations for horror magazines and novels, including Mary Shelley\u2019s 1818 classic, \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d and several by Stephen King. He also contributed character designs for films, including creatures, aliens and ghouls for \u201cThe Mist,\u201d \u201cGalaxy Quest\u201d and the original \u201cGhostbusters.\u201dBut his most famous creation was Swamp Thing, who first appeared in an issue of House of Secrets in 1971. The character was a tragic figure: an early-20th-century man transformed by a chemical explosion, unable to communicate to his wife that her new suitor was a murderer.Swamp Thing, created with the writer Len Wein, was promoted to his own series in 1972, which contemporized his origin, set up his home base as Louisiana and introduced his love interest, Abigail Arcane. The character reached new levels of acclaim in the 1980s under the authorship of Alan Moore.One of Mr. Wrightson\u2019s most personal works was an adaptation in 1983 of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d for Marvel Comics, a project to which he devoted seven years. \u201cHe considered his Frankenstein illustrations to be his magnum opus,\u201d his wife said in an email.The drawings, which recall the precise pen-and-ink work of the early-20th-century artist Franklin Booth, are stunning in their obsessive attention to minutiae. In one double-page spread, the monster \u2014 with throbbing neck and muscled forearms \u2014 confronts his maker in a laboratory so bountiful with detailed paraphernalia that it could be a hoarder\u2019s fantasia.Bernard Albert Wrightson was born in Dundalk, Md., on Oct. 27, 1948, and learned his craft from studying comics and from correspondence courses.\u201cThe Man Who Murdered Himself,\u201d his first published work, appeared in House of Mystery, from DC, in 1969. Two years later, Ms. Simonson served as a model for Mr. Wrightson for the cover of Swamp Thing\u2019s first appearance. (She is the woman being spied on by the boggy creature.)Since then, Swamp Thing has starred in feature films, in 1982 and 1989, and a USA Network television series, from 1990 to 1993. A less murky, more child-friendly version of the character is voiced by Mark Hamill in the animated series \u201cJustice League Action,\u201d which began last year. Swamp Thing appears in more familiar form in the R-rated \u201cJustice League Dark,\u201d a straight-to-video animated film from Warner Home Video that appeared on DVD and Blu-ray in February.Mr. Wrightson\u2019s formative years in comics were a time before Federal Express and the internet allowed artists to work globally. The comic book writer and artist Walter Simonson, Louise\u2019s husband, who is perhaps best known for his work on Marvel\u2019s Thor, said that one of the great joys of working then was running into fellow creators at the office.During one encounter, Mr. Simonson recalled, he saw a full-page drawing of a werewolf by Mr. Wrightson, from Swamp Thing No. 4. \u201cIt was just an incredible shot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d go back and juice yourself up and say \u2018I have to get better,\u2019 because Bernie was so far ahead of everyone else.\u201dIn 1974, Mr. Wrightson began working at Warren Publishing, where his work, including original material and adaptations of stories by Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft, appeared in Creepy and Eerie magazines.Mr. Wrightson\u2019s first marriage, to Michele Wrightson, ended in divorce. She died in 2015. In addition to Liz Wrightson, Mr. Wrightson is survived by two sons, John and Jeffrey, and a stepson, Thomas Adamson.It might be easy to think that an artist who created such grim images would harbor a dark soul, but Mr. Wrightson has been remembered in tributes for his kindness. He was especially warm toward comic fans.\u201cBernie loved attending conventions and seeing fans grow over the years, many eventually bringing their own children to meet him,\u201d Ms. Wrightson wrote.Advertisement"}

The price soon recovered some of the lost ground, however.The commission said it was rejecting the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust because the markets where Bitcoin are currently traded are largely unregulated.The lack of such regulation, the commission said, raised \u201cconcerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market.\u201dThe price of Bitcoin has climbed sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of the commission approving the Winklevoss brothers\u2019 fund, with the price of a single Bitcoin surging to a record high above $1,300.Bitcoin aficionados had hoped that an exchange-traded fund would help bring the virtual currency into the mainstream by making it available to retail investors through brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and eTrade.Several other companies have also applied to operate Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and the S.E.C. could reach a different decision on those proposed funds. But the commission\u2019s broad concern about the unregulated nature of Bitcoin markets suggests that an approval may be unlikely in the near future.\u201cIt seems as if the other E.T.F.s in the pipeline for the S.E.C. are facing the same stone wall,\u201d Charles Hayter, founder of the virtual currency data provider CryptoCompare, said on Friday.The commission added that it could reconsider a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund if more mature markets developed.Tyler Winklevoss said that he and his brother were not giving up on the exchange-traded fund.\u201cWe began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through,\u201d he said. \u201cWe agree with the S.E.C. that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors.\u201dThe twins rose to fame through their legal tussles with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook.Most Bitcoin, however, are traded outside the United States, beyond the reach of American regulators. The virtual currency emerged in 2009 and was celebrated for its ability to circumvent government authorities.Since then, Bitcoin has gained prominence partly because of its use on shadowy online black markets, where it is exchanged for drugs, and in countries like China and Venezuela, where some citizens are looking to evade government oversight.Over time, it has become clear that Bitcoin\u2019s growth prospects are probably limited if it is not easily available through regulated institutions to ordinary investors.Jerry Brito, executive director of the Coin Center, a virtual currency advocacy group, said that the S.E.C.\u2019s decision presented a problem for the further development of the technology.\u201cHow do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the U.S. and Europe if financial innovators aren\u2019t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?\u201d Mr. Brito said in a statement on Friday.Many large financial institutions have mostly declined to invest significant resources into Bitcoin, because of the regulatory questions that surround it.Advertisement"}

She took the stage in front of a sold-out crowd at Cooper Union, and there was \u201cthis kind of unanimous scream,\u201d said Robin Desser, a Knopf editor who has worked with Ms. Adichie for 12 years.\u201cI really have never seen anything like this,\u201d Ms. Desser said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve published people who are really popular.\u201dThe main proposition of \u201cDear Ijeawele\u201d is that feminism is a project that necessarily binds mothers and daughters, and that raising a daughter feminist has as much to do with what you tell yourself as what you tell her. Ms. Adichie\u2019s first of 15 suggestions places a mother\u2019s freedom and growth at the center of a daughter\u2019s feminist education.\u201cBe a full person,\u201d Ms. Adichie writes. \u201cMotherhood is a glorious gift, but do not define yourself solely by motherhood.\u201dThe book grew partly out of the desire of Ms. Adichie\u2019s friend, called Ijeawele in the text, to teach her daughter \u201cto take less of the nonsense\u201d that past generations faced. Ms. Adichie wrote her friend a letter in 2015 and published it on Facebook last year.She said she still wasn\u2019t thinking of it as a book but simply wanted to start a conversation. The responses she received made her even more sure that it was an important piece to write.\u201cEven friends of mine \u2014 people I love \u2014 wrote, \u2018why yes, we kind of agree, but why call it feminist? It\u2019s just common sense.\u2019 And I\u2019m like no, it\u2019s feminist,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. \u201cOr, oh it\u2019s just humanism. Or someone said, \u2018these are just democratic ideals.\u2019 And I thought, what? It\u2019s everything but to acknowledge the fact that gender is a problem.\u201dMs. Adichie wrote the letter before she was a parent, but now she has a 17-month-old daughter whom she is trying to raise as a feminist. She and her husband split their time between Nigeria, where she grew up, and the United States.Ms. Adichie often comments on how race and gender play out in the United States, but her book does not tackle some of the meatier questions that have occupied the American feminist movement in recent years, most notably the role of transgender people.\u201cI see how my saying that we should not conflate the gender experiences of trans women with that of women born female could appear as if I was suggesting that one experience is more important than the other. Or that the experiences of trans women are less valid than those of women born female,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not think so at all \u2014 I know that trans women can be vulnerable in ways that women born female are not.\u201d\u201cI think there is some misogyny in the way she\u2019s been characterized, and I think it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. She becomes animated talking about the vitriol aimed at Mrs. Trump, in the same way she bristles when asked about how Mrs. Clinton was treated during the campaign. She is concerned with how society responds to powerful women across the political spectrum.\u201cI don\u2019t even like talking about it, because I get very upset,\u201d she said while describing the media\u2019s focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability.\u201d (One of the suggestions in her book is for mothers to teach daughters to \u201creject likability.\u201d)Ms. Adichie will not say what she\u2019s working on next \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m very superstitious\u201d \u2014 but continues to write and throw herself into her international speaking engagements. The satisfaction she takes in her work is at the heart of her proposal: To raise feminist daughters, mothers must take pleasure in their own achievements, follow both the challenges and delights of the work, and give themselves room to fail.

They took the wiretap word out.\u201dHeadlines in the newspaper differ from digital ones more often than not, for a variety of reasons. Generally, The Times publishes articles on its website first, before they are printed in the following day\u2019s newspaper. Editors are afforded more freedom with the digital version of a headline, because they\u2019re not constrained by the space available on a given page. \u201cOften we have to boil down a lengthy web head to three lines just a column wide, which can mean just six words,\u201d said Lew Serviss, a senior news editor at The Times. (That was the case in the instance of the January article.) The Times has strict standards, too, for how a headline \u201cbreaks\u201d across multiple lines; each line should contain a complete thought, without separating a preposition and object or an adverb and verb, for example.Editors who write headlines for print often have to work quickly before each day\u2019s national edition closes, around 9 p.m. In the case of the \u201cwiretap\u201d article, \u201cWe went through five or more iterations from 8:50 to 9:01,\u201d remembered Kayne Rogers, one of several Times editors who worked on the headline, before settling on the one that ran.Digital headlines often evolve after a story has been published online, too. A writer might file an update containing new information that changes the focus, for instance, or an editor may decide to update a headline so that search engines will find the article more easily. \u201cIn a competitive news environment, there\u2019s value in changing a headline when the story changes, because it keeps you up in search,\u201d Ms. Taylor said.The Times also makes a practice of running what are called A/B tests on the digital headlines that appear on its homepage: Half of readers will see one headline, and the other half will see an alternative headline, for about half an hour. At the end of the test, The Times will use the headline that attracted more readers. \u201cPeople think if you change a headline, that it\u2019s some kind of \u2018Gotcha!,\u2019 and it\u2019s just not,\u201d said Mark Bulik, a senior editor who oversees digital headlines. \u201cPeople who think it\u2019s a \u2018gotcha\u2019 just don\u2019t have a full understanding of news in the digital world.\u201dAnd anyone who takes umbrage at the difference between a print and digital headline need look no further than the bottom of the digital version. If a story (including this one) runs in the paper, the print headline will be listed.The Inside The Times article on Friday about why a headline on an article is sometimes different in online and print presentations misstated the title of Mark Bulik. He is a senior editor who oversees digital headlines; he does not run the digital news desk.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Journey Into the Merriam-Webster Word Factory", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byShe walked me through a hallway that seemed to double as a museum of superannuated filing cabinet technology. She offered a glimpse of the dungeonlike storage room used as a podcast studio and cheerfully pointed out some of the creepier company heirlooms, like mangy historical dioramas donated by local schoolchildren and an inflatable dictionary with arms and legs, created for a long-ago promotional campaign.\u201cIt was conceived of as another way of shuffling information,\u201d Ms. Stamper said of the index, which seems to have been produced intermittently from the 1930s to the \u201970s. \u201cBasically, someone sat here and typed up all the entries backwards. And then went crazy.\u201dMs. Stamper calls it \u201ca love letter to dictionaries in English,\u201d if one that allows for some mixed feelings.\u201cPeople have so many fears about what their use of language says about them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you talk to people about dictionaries, they often start talking about other things, like which words they love, and which words they hate. And it\u2019s perfectly fine to hate parts of the language.\u201dMs. Stamper, 42, grew up in Colorado and majored in medieval studies at Smith College. When she interviewed at Merriam-Webster in 1998, she was puzzled to learn the job involved writing definitions.\u201cI just thought, \u2018Why would you need to do that?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cHasn\u2019t the dictionary already been written?\u201d\u201cWord by Word\u201d describes her own initiation into the art of lexicography, which involves wrestling with the continuous evolution of language. She walks the reader, chapter by chapter, through different aspects of a definition, including grammar, pronunciation, etymology and more.\u201cTake,\u201d which she wrestled with for a month, was the longest in column inches. (It\u2019s also one, she notes wryly, that very few people will ever read.)\u201cGod,\u201d which she revised for the company\u2019s unabridged dictionary (now being updated online only), took the longest \u2014 four months \u2014 and involved not just extensive reading but consultation with clergy members, theologians and academics, who often responded to her email queries with long philosophical disquisitions.Which leads to an important point. Dictionaries are often seen as argument-settling arbiters of truth. But their job, Ms. Stamper notes, isn\u2019t to say what something is, but to objectively and comprehensively catalog the many different ways words are used by real people.Ms. Stamper has no patience for self-styled purists who quail at \u201cirregardless\u201d \u2014 an actual word, she notes. (She is O.K. with ending sentences with prepositions as well as \u2014 brace yourself \u2014 split infinitives.) But she also describes being caught up in some higher-stakes fights.That brought reams of hate mail, but most interactions with readers are friendlier. When Merriam-Webster began its videos, the heavy-breathing fan mail prompted her to create an \u201cAsk the Editor Video Hotness Chart.\u201d\u201cPeople would write in saying, \u2018The editor with the glasses is so hot,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is hysterical, since we all wear glasses.\u201dStalkers who show up at the offices in Springfield, alas, may have trouble finding actual people. Ms. Stamper telecommutes from her home outside Philadelphia. During the visit, the halls were eerily deserted. No heads popped above cubicles. Only a few faintly murmuring voices were heard.But at the center of the main upstairs work area stands a howling mass of irreplaceable historical chatter: the Consolidated Files.The files, kept in red cabinets that snake around the middle of the room, contain millions of citations: small slips of paper documenting individual word uses, drawn from newspapers, books, radio, packaging and other sources, stretching from the 1980s back well into the 19th century.These days, lexicographers work from an updated digitized database. But Ms. Stamper opened a drawer and pulled out a favorite \u201cpink,\u201d as editorial notes are called, from the 1950s sternly declaring that the word \u201ccracker\u201d \u201ccould not be defined as a \u2018biscuit\u2019 nor as a \u2018wafer.\u2019\u201d\u201cThis just sums up the job so well,\u201d she said in a sub-sotto-voce whisper.If dictionaries are a form of information technology, the building is in some ways a catalog of obsolescence. A downstairs gallery includes a 1934 poster advertising the second edition of the Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, billed as \u201cone of the thickest books ever printed.\u201d (The technology needed to bind it, Ms. Stamper said, no longer exists.)There are also oddities like an asymmetrically bound Seventh New Collegiate from 1969, designed so it could hold itself up \u2014 an innovation that failed to catch on, probably because if you open it too far from the center, it falls over.The dictionary industry itself has been listing of late, as printed dictionaries have given way to online dictionaries, many of them free. Merriam-Webster, a subsidiary of Encyclopaedia Britannica, itself announced layoffs just as she was finishing her manuscript. (It currently has 70 employees.)There are only about 50 lexicographers working at dictionary companies in the United States today, Ms. Stamper estimated. But their work, she believes, remains as vital as it was in Noah Webster\u2019s day.\u201cThere\u2019s something to having a bunch of nerds sitting in an office dispassionately reading lots and lots of material and distilling the meaning of a word as it\u2019s been used in lots of places,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really is this weird democratic process.\u201dAn article on Thursday about Merriam-Webster, the oldest dictionary publisher in America, described the current edition of the company\u2019s unabridged dictionary incorrectly. It remains in print; it is not an online-only publication. (Future updates to the dictionary, however, will be made only online.)Advertisement"}

(Check out how stylish this car looks! Doesn\u2019t everyone seem to be having a great time while drinking this beer?) In a perilous political climate, however, some advertising agencies have decided to use their marketing acumen in service of advancing cultural and political causes, rather than selling products.It is not unusual for agencies to work with nonprofit groups or create public service announcements, pro bono, but this new activism entails a deeper level of involvement.The campaign included a 60-second video directed by Mr. Linklater \u2014 the tagline: \u201cI pee with L.G.B.T.\u201d \u2014 and 15-second versions, which are being disseminated through targeted Facebook advertising.\u201cOur goal with this, ultimately, is to get people to reach out to their legislators,\u201d said Duff Stewart, the chief executive of the agency, GSD&M, which is spearheading the campaign. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s an important issue for Texas.\u201dPointing to North Carolina as an example, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s also an economic-impact issue. It\u2019s going to have a detrimental effect to the economy in the state of Texas, and the ability to recruit and maintain talent.\u201dFor the agency, though, the impetus to get involved goes beyond that. \u201cFrom a cultural perspective, being open and kind and accepting of our fellow human beings is, I think, what we\u2019re about,\u201d Mr. Stewart said.Other advertising professionals who have taken on more issue- or cause-related projects also see the work as a kind of affirmation of their principles and beliefs in the Trump era.\u201cYou sort of have this feeling of being helpless when something goes off the tracks in the country, so it\u2019s nice to be able to do something,\u201d said Neil Kraft, president and creative director of KraftWorks, which last year developed a platform to support female entrepreneurs in collaboration with Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Day.KraftWorks created the concept for choosewomen.org, which helps impoverished women finance business ventures, and recruited corporate partners, like Sephora and Lilly Pulitzer, willing to donate a portion of sales made through the site. \u201cIt was a deeper involvement, and it was more personal,\u201d Mr. Kraft said.\u201cWe\u2019re storytellers, so if we\u2019re going to create a movement, we\u2019re going to do it through stories,\u201d Ms. Flanik said.These kinds of forays into social issues do carry some risk.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many people would make their decision about an ad firm based on this one way or another, but some people who are more involved in politics might be upset,\u201d said William Benoit, professor of communication studies at Ohio University. In today\u2019s social-media-driven culture, anything that carries even a whiff of political opinion carries the potential for opposition, he said, pointing to the ire that Nordstrom department stores faced over curtailing sales of Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories.The flip side, though, could be an increase in business from clients whose viewpoint aligns with that of the agency.\u201cI think there are some risks in the sense of potentially alienating a client or a potential client if the agency has decided to put a stake in the ground,\u201d said Jeremy Rosenberg, a managing director at the public relations firm Allison & Partners. He added that an ancillary risk could be alienating employees opposed to a particular cause. \u201cI think agency principals would have a good pulse on their employee base, but I think that is a potential concern as well.\u201dAgencies that have allocated resources to social projects say, however, that their employees are eager to participate.Mr. Kraft said his millennial employees were especially enthusiastic. \u201cThey\u2019re in a lot of ways more idealistic than I am and really like this and working on stuff like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it helps everyone feel good about selling other stuff all the time.\u201dUltimately, though, advertising executives say, the motivation is more about feeling compelled to use their industry\u2019s skills to draw attention to issues that matter in a divided culture.\u201cIf we don\u2019t speak up, somebody else will,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cThis last election is evidence that we cannot be complacent. We have to talk about and stand up for our beliefs. If you\u2019re not speaking up, you\u2019re not going to be heard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shekaba Hashimi, who was up late helping her children study for their university exams, was convinced it was the Taliban. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, God, there is another attack in this area,\u2019\u201d she said.Half of the city seemed to have the same fear, as sleepy Kabulis piled onto social media to share notes on the gunfire as it moved through town.Hours later, the Kabul police sheepishly admitted that it was only another government big shot on another drunken rampage. In this case, the culprit was said to be Lalai Hamidzai, a member of Parliament who once led its committee on the advancement of the rule of law.Kabul\u2019s police chief, Maj. Gen. Hassan Shah Frogh, said that Mr. Hamidzai had been drunk and had chased through town after someone he was angry at, and ended up firing into a hotel where his quarry had taken refuge. Then, in a cover-up effort, he fired into the air at his own house a few miles away to make it look as though he were the one who had been attacked, General Frogh said.Whether celebrating a cricket victory, expressing anger at being turned away from a wedding or protesting a roadblock, such politicians\u2019 response has on numerous occasions been gunplay and violence \u2014 often fueled by liquor, even though it is illegal to possess or consume alcohol in Afghanistan.Arrests in such cases are rare because those responsible usually have powerful allies in the government, and the authorities are loath to challenge their armed bodyguards, who act as mini-militias.No one has been arrested in the episode involving Mr. Hamidzai, although a police spokesman, Abdul Basir Mujahid, said an investigation was underway.On Saturday, the children of another member of Parliament, Zaheer Sadat, a doctor from the Panjshir Valley with a history of brawling, got into a fight with the neighbor\u2019s children. The adults in both houses opened fire on one another with automatic weapons, said Gen. Salem Almas, the head of the Kabul Police criminal investigation division. Five people were wounded, he said.Dr. Sadat was not present at Saturday\u2019s shooting, the police said. But in November 2015, when his convoy was stopped by the police, his bodyguards badly beat three of the officers, the police said. Dr. Sadat said that the officers had tried to attack him; the police said he was just angry at being stopped.\u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d said Mirdad Nejrabi, the head of Parliament\u2019s Internal Defense Committee. \u201cBeing a member of Parliament does not mean one has immunity to do whatever he or she can to disrupt law and order.\u201dJust over a week ago, a brother-in-law and an associate of Mr. Hamidzai\u2019s were stopped by the police while driving through the city drunk, according to a police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired for discussing the case.They beat up the officers and the police commander of the area who tried to intervene, the official said.Senior security officials have also been accused of disturbing Kabul\u2019s peace. In January, the head of the Kabul Garrison, Lt. Gen. Gul Nabi Ahmadzai, and his men were reported to have indulged in widespread celebratory firing after his son got engaged. The shooting was so intense that many in the city thought a terrorist attack was underway.General Ahmadzai could not be reached for comment, but an aide who answered the phone in his office said, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t fire in the air in Afghanistan? Everyone does.\u201dThere has long been a culture of impunity among Afghan politicians, but the weak coalition government has greatly worsened it.As the frequency of such episodes rises, fed-up police officers are pushing back by going public. In an interview, General Almas, the head of the criminal investigation unit, disputed Mr. Hamidzai\u2019s claims that the video evidence of his shooting up the hotel had been faked.General Almas said he was at the scene on Friday night, trying to persuade a drunken Mr. Hamidzai to calm down and stop shooting. \u201cWe have the proof,\u201d General Almas said. \u201cHe cannot deny anything.\u201dZahra Nader and Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The bill, she said, would produce \u201ca big transfer of wealth to the wealthiest people in our country,\u201d cutting their taxes while increasing costs for others.It is not unusual for controversial bills to be written by the majority party, with little or no input from the minority. But Democrats relished the opportunity to turn the tables on Republicans.In 2009 and 2010, Republicans excoriated Democrats for making \u201cback-room deals\u201d to pass the Affordable Care Act. Democrats, defending the bill they had written with President Barack Obama, were shouted down at town hall-style meetings by Tea Party members chanting, \u201cRead the bill.\u201dRepresentative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, denied he was hiding the bill or doing anything out of the ordinary. Republicans, he said, \u201care continuing to discuss and refine draft legislative language.\u201dAsked if he was hiding the bill, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a bill. We\u2019re continuing to work with the Congressional Budget Office and our members on the final product.\u201dRepublicans had promised an open process. Speaking on the House floor on Jan. 13, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, said the health law had been enacted \u201cafter months of back-room deals, in the middle of the night, last-minute deals, and without giving the American people enough time to even read the bill.\u201d\u201cThat is not what is going to happen this time,\u201d he said.The Congressional Budget Office has not completed an estimate of the cost of the repeal bill or its effects on coverage, and Republicans are still trying to narrow their differences on issues like Medicaid and tax credits to help people buy insurance. But, as of Thursday, they were determined to move ahead.\u201cWe are going to mark up the legislation next week,\u201d said Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, after a closed-door meeting of House Republicans. \u201cThey say we\u2019ll be there all night. I\u2019m going to bring an air mattress.\u201dMr. Ryan presented members of his party on Thursday with a timeline leading to passage of the bill by the House within three weeks. The Senate is working closely with House leaders.Mr. Ryan told House Republicans that President Trump supported the bill drafted by House Republican leaders, according to aides who were in the room.Ever since Mr. Obama signed the law in March 2010, Republicans have been trying to uproot it. When Congress convened this year, Republicans thought they could achieve their goal with a quick strike on the law, which has provided insurance to some 20 million Americans. The task has proved more difficult than they expected. Polls show the law has become somewhat more popular as Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans try to kill it.Under a draft of the bill that became public last week, the government would offer tax credits to help lower the cost of insurance for people who did not have access to coverage through an employer or a government program. The tax credits, as initially proposed, would be available to people regardless of their income.Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee, said the credit should not be available to people with incomes above a certain level, around $118,000. \u201cI don\u2019t think I need a tax credit, with my salary,\u201d Mr. Roe said. As a member of Congress, he has been paid $174,000 a year.Advertisement"}

The Salton Sea, straddling the Imperial and Coachella Valleys, is the latest incarnation of a body of water that has been drying and refilling over eons with water from the Colorado River.Native Americans once fished and camped on Lake Cahuilla, a prehistoric and larger version.The Salton Sea was born in the early 1900s after a canal burst sent water from the Colorado flooding into the valley over a period of two years.Beginning in the 1950s, entrepreneurs transformed it into a tourist mecca, building marinas and resorts. There were beauty pageants and boat races. Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra visited.But in time, runoff pollution, drought and blistering heat conspired to end the fun. As the saline lake evaporated, its salt concentration soared, killing fish en masse. The blooming and decomposition of algae had a powerful stench.Today, the Salton Sea is surrounded by abandoned buildings.The particles are so fine that they cannot be coughed up, threatening the health of local children whose asthma rates lead the state.The other is the threat to wildlife. The Salton Sea is a precious way station for more than 400 species of migrating birds.Part of the solution, said Mr. Cohen, lies in restoring habitat \u2014 essentially moving earth around in ways that keeps the dust from flying while providing the birds with places to stop and refuel.A $9.6 billion revitalization plan endorsed by state officials has been on the back burner for years.Mr. Cohen said he was often asked why we don\u2019t just let nature take its course.\u201cAre we fighting nature? Yes,\u201d he said.But, he said, pristine wilderness really no longer exists \u2014 all of California is manipulated in some way by humans. \u201cSo from that perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need to make sure those places that are valuable for wildlife are preserved.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)We asked if you liked the idea. Hundreds of emails poured in, with opinions sharply divided.Here is a sample:\u201cTerrible idea. While there are many conscientious bicyclists, I regularly see bicyclists who are simply reckless. Many times I have seen bicyclists go right through red lights, at great risk to themselves and others. This measure would embolden them to engage in such dangerous behaviors, and raise the risk of crashes and serious injuries.\u201d\u2014 Paul D. Lerner, Beverly Hills\u201cYes, this would be a welcome change. Safety hardly ever requires a full stop by bikes at a stop sign. Because of that, most bicyclists currently don\u2019t surrender their hard-earned momentum by making full stops at stop signs where the traffic does not warrant them. The result is that the existing law requiring full stops at stop signs is rarely observed or enforced, which encourages disrespect of the law and stokes the resentment of motorists already annoyed by the presence of bikes on their streets and roads.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a 30-plus year San Francisco bike commuter. I am dubious about the rolling stop rule. I often see cyclists roll through stops when pedestrians are in crosswalks. A law change, I fear, will make this worse.\u201d\u2014 Alyson Jacks, San Francisco\u201cCyclists are well aware of the risks they assume when \u2018sharing the road\u2019 with vehicles.

{"Headline": "Health Care Is Front and Center in Democrats\u2019 Response to Trump Address", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byIn responding to President Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday, Democrats had to navigate between the expectations of their angry base in America\u2019s cities and the need to appeal to a broader array of voters in parts of the country where the president is far more popular.The party handed that task to former Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky, an emblem of the sort of largely rural state that Democrats lost in last year\u2019s presidential election. Delivering the party\u2019s official response, Mr. Beshear, dressed in khakis and a blue shirt, sat in a Lexington diner and offered down-home references to Friday night football, Sunday morning worship and life as a preacher\u2019s kid.Mr. Beshear noted that the Americans who had gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, a law he championed in his state, were the sort of \u201cfriends and neighbors\u201d he surrounded himself with in the diner.Before the law was passed, \u201cthey woke up every morning and went to work, just hoping and praying they wouldn\u2019t get sick,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they knew they were just one bad diagnosis away from bankruptcy.\u201dNow, he vowed, \u201cDemocrats are going to do everything in our power to keep President Trump and the Republican Congress from reneging on that commitment.\u201dReporters from The New York Times fact checked the Democrats' response to President Trump's address to Congress, which was delivered by former Gov. Steve Beshear of Kentucky.The decision by the congressional Democratic leadership to invite Mr. Beshear, 72, who has been out of office for more than a year, was a departure from tradition for the opposition party, which usually chooses a rising star to offer the televised response to the president\u2019s speech.But Democratic leaders are determined to make health care \u2014 particularly Medicare and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the centerpiece of their attacks against Republicans leading into next year\u2019s midterm elections. And as Mr. Beshear alluded to, he has a compelling story to tell about the effect of the health law in a conservative-leaning state.But congressional Democrats are struggling to keep a tight grip on their most impassioned voices, just as Republicans did with the rise of the Tea Party in opposition to President Barack Obama.So while Mr. Beshear devoted a substantial portion of his remarks to health care, he also turned away from his easygoing tone with strongly worded remarks on immigrants and refugees that he may have avoided were he facing re-election.\u201cPresident Trump has all but declared war on refugees and immigrants,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can protect America without abandoning our principles and our moral obligation to help those fleeing war and terror without tearing families apart.\u201dAnd Mr. Beshear castigated Mr. Trump over the president\u2019s incendiary rhetoric.\u201cWhen the president attacks the loyalty and credibility of our intelligence agencies, the court system, the military, the free press, individual Americans simply because he doesn\u2019t like what they say, he\u2019s eroding our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s reckless.\u201dThe former governor was not the only prominent voice on the left responding to the president\u2019s address to Congress. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has perhaps the most intense following of any currently serving liberal, delivered a rejoinder via Facebook Live.\u201cThe Republicans are now on the defensive, and we have to continue to push them back,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, invoking issues such as climate change and mass incarceration, which Mr. Trump made no mention of but are particularly important to many liberals.And Astrid Silva, an immigration activist who came to America as an undocumented immigrant, delivered the first ever Spanish-language response to such a presidential address, saying, \u201cImmigrants and refugees are the heart and soul, and the promise, of this country.\u201dMr. Sanders, a political independent, has been made a member of the Senate Democratic leadership, so his remarks were not of the same renegade nature as those delivered in 2011 by Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota congresswoman at the time, who offered a Tea Party-flavored speech after Mr. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. The Republicans\u2019 official response that year was delivered by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.Still, many rank-and-file Democrats, and some elected officials, believe Mr. Trump was illegitimately elected and are focused more on how to quickly expel him from office than on promoting a poll-tested message against him and other Republicans on health care.Representative Maxine Waters, the veteran California Democrat, said the demands from liberal voters were growing only more intense.Reporters from The New York Times fact checked President Trump\u2019s first address to Congress.\u201cEven though many of my Democratic colleagues are not ready to talk about impeachment, in the grass roots I\u2019m hearing a lot about impeachment \u2014 and treason,\u201d said Ms. Waters, who boycotted Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, adding that she shared their desire to drive him from the presidency.\u201cI believe he can be found guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, with the interaction and the collusion that is taking place with Russia and the Kremlin,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to keep on it, and I think I\u2019m going to be proven to be right.\u201dBeyond Ms. Waters\u2019s absence, there were other signs of quiet protest that illustrated how uneasy Democrats are with a historically unpopular new president. Many of the female Democratic lawmakers in the audience were clad in white to honor the women\u2019s suffrage movement.And some of the House Democrats known in the past to stage an endurance test to be seen on camera shaking the hand of the president bypassed the rite, leaving mostly Republicans to greet Mr. Trump when he walked down the center aisle to deliver his speech.After his remarks, among the few Democrats to greet the president was a grinning Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, perhaps the most conservative member of his party in Congress.Representative Joe Crowley of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, was less pleased.\u201cWe don\u2019t agree with much of anything he said tonight,\u201d he said.Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Museum about the agency\u2019s roots in World War II, to wonder if Hemingway, with his love of adventure, had ever spied for his country. \u201cAnd then I learned something that surprised me,\u201d Reynolds writes in the book: \u201cHe had signed on with another intelligence service, one that did not fit the conventional narrative of his life. That service turned out to be the Soviet N.K.V.D., the People\u2019s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, the predecessor of the better-known K.G.B.\u201d Hemingway, a Soviet spy? \u201cI was a traditional product of the Cold War,\u201d Reynolds told me. \u201cThere was little sympathy for Communism in our house. So I felt like le Carr\u00e9\u2019s character George Smiley, who learns of yet another betrayal: I felt like I had taken an elbow deep in the gut.\u201d But the more Reynolds dug, the murkier the picture became. Hemingway seems never to have provided any secrets to the Soviets, and was probably motivated more by anti-fascist politics than by any love for the Soviet Union or antipathy to America. The biography, then, is Reynolds\u2019s attempt to tease out how his subject\u2019s undercover life fit into the more familiar world of his work. \u201cHemingway did not write much about his spying, at least not for public consumption,\u201d he told me. \u201cHis interest in intelligence emerges mostly from his letters, especially those to his close friend Gen. Buck Lanham, which include comments on Cold War espionage and the Red Scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s.\u201d Hemingway\u2019s voice, he added, \u201cwas uniquely American \u2014 and revolutionary only for its effect on the English language.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Not everyone reaches this milestone, and even if they do, without constant vigilance a relapse is almost inevitable \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0in fact, some of my subjects experienced repeated relapses and near-death experiences before they found solace in recovery.Another way I found subjects was through the director of a halfway house.

Yet half the images in your series thus far do not reveal faces. Most identify your subjects with initials or partial names. Why?During our photo session my main focus is for my subject to fully comprehend my intentions, which are to celebrate her and bring social awareness to the fact that genuine recovery is achievable and exists. But the project is a collaboration of sorts. Once they agree to share their story, I ask them to select a location for the shoot. Some choose a space that brings them peace and comfort.

The same goes with respect to anonymity. It is not my place to question why they want to remain anonymous. The decision is theirs, but I can guarantee you it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not from shame, nor does it negate such accomplishments and relentless efforts to conquer their addiction and reach, as you said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe other side.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat do you intend to do with this project? Exhibit? Book?First, I need to accumulate as many stories as I can. The challenge is locating the subjects. I have applied for grants so I can travel the country and expand the diversity of the women. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a firm believer that not every project needs to become a book. So for now I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t envision that path. In a perfect world, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d travel and photograph at least 100\u00c2\u00a0subjects to complete the photo portion. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d then produce a documentary where I follow one woman the entire first year of her recovery. I want to bring balance to my project so it shows both spectrums of addiction: the celebrations of long-term sobriety alongside the painstaking journey of a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first year in recovery.Can you describe the difficulties of remaining in recovery that make sobriety such a compelling subject?I celebrated nine years of sobriety Dec. 29, 2016. I nurture my recovery like a newborn child. I attend a 12-step program, therapy, and practice unconventional forms of meditation or prayer. People who survive the claws of addiction are considered miracles, because long-term recoveries are rare and addiction is on the rise.For me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear the odds are against us. Ten years of recovery is nothing compared to the millions who die. And there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a deficit of imagemakers covering those stories thoroughly and with visually stunning images. It is the sporadic and humble success of my exemplars that inspires my recovery and this project."}

Expert at Baidu, Andrew Ng, Resigns From Chinese Search Giant", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In 2014, Baidu announced a hiring coup in the world of artificial intelligence: It had brought in the Stanford and Google alumnus Andrew Ng to lead a new research lab in Silicon Valley.His departure is a blow to Baidu, which has been betting big on artificial intelligence, a technology that is expected to undergird a range of others, like voice recognition and driverless cars.In a post on Facebook and Twitter, Baidu said: \u201cAndrew Ng joined Baidu with a shared goal, to improve life through artificial intelligence. Today, that goal remains strong. Thank you, and all the best on your new chapter!\u201dThe company now has more than 1,300 employees dedicated to A.I. In a signal of just how critical the efforts are to the company, it said in January that it had hired Qi Lu, a former executive at Microsoft and an A.I. specialist, to become the chief operating officer.The resignations underline how that trend never materialized. Few American tech executives followed them, and China\u2019s internet behemoths remain mostly focused on their home markets.In his post on Tuesday, Mr. Ng struck a positive note: \u201cBaidu\u2019s A.I. is incredibly strong, and the team is stacked up and down with talent; I am confident A.I. at Baidu will continue to flourish.\u201dMr. Ng wrote that he would continue working to ensure A.I. made \u201clife better for everyone.\u201d He wrote that he saw the technology\u2019s impact going far beyond large tech companies like Google and Baidu.\u201cIn addition to transforming large companies to use A.I., there are also rich opportunities for entrepreneurship as well as further A.I. research.\u201dMr. Ng is part of a still-small coterie of researchers who are experts in deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that seeks to use computers to emulate the functions of the human brain. During his time at Baidu, Mr. Ng said the lab at Silicon Valley had helped create two different business units, one that works on speech recognition and another focused on driverless cars.As China\u2019s most dominant search engine, Baidu has long had a lock on a profitable section of online advertising. Yet as more Chinese consumers picked up smartphones, the company has struggled to keep its hold on ad spending. In a bid to surpass its rivals, the company has poured money into A.I. technology that executives say will support next-generation products.Mr. Ng wrote that the lab he helped start and is now leaving is working on many of those technologies, \u201csuch as face-recognition (used in turnstiles that open automatically when an authorized person approaches), Melody (an A.I.-powered conversational bot for health care) and several more.\u201d\u201cAs the principal architect of Baidu\u2019s A.I. strategy, I am proud to have led the incredible rise of A.I. within the company,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "It began in 1926 with a simple question her grandfather Shadrach Emmanuel Lee asked in a Brooklyn high school history class. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis question was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Where are the African-Americans in this history book?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the answer he received was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, African-Americans have done nothing to merit inclusion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take that as a legitimate answer. So he was expelled for his impertinence. And his pride was so wounded that he just never went back.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Lee never finished high school but did become a visual artist and pursued a career as a jazz bassist playing with Billy Eckstine, Lionel Hampton, Count Basie and others. To support his family, he also worked as a janitor, including for a time at Temple University in Philadelphia.   When Ms. Lewis began teaching on race and photography at Harvard last September, the United States had a black president and almost all pundits expected Hillary Clinton to become the first female president. Ms. Lewis challenged students to explore how photography, art and design formed concepts of racial identity from slavery to today.  As the campaign gained in intensity and issues of racial and religious identity came to the fore, she shifted the final classes to address students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns about the tenor and substance of the political debate. When surrogates for then-candidate Donald J. Trump brought up the internment of Japanese Americans as a precedent to justify a proposed Muslim ban, Ms. Lewis shared Dorothea Lange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images of Japanese-American internment and discussed how photographs that were made for the  government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s War Relocation Authority subverted the intended mission to legitimize the roundup.The students, Ms. Lewis said, displayed a remarkable sophistication, confirming her hunch that being raised on the Internet and social media can lead to a greater visual literacy.When the class considered the famous image of Trayvon Martin wearing a hoodie, her students immediately realized that it was taken at an Apple store because, she said, they \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould read the ceiling lighting above his head, and the angle at which he was positioning his face\u00e2\u0080\u009d relative to a computer screen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are able to read pictures in ways that are almost unconscious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.She told her class that to speak about race, you have to speak about whiteness. She traced the beginning of the use of the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite identity\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the United States Naturalization Act of 1790 that limited citizenship for those born abroad to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree white persons of good character.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we say race, we tend to mean those that are not white, where whiteness is itself a race category,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe idea that race equals nonwhite is a notion that we have to just jettison. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold water.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Lewis hopes that her course at the library will lead to a curriculum on visual literacy and race that can be used by others to help make sense of the sheer number of images they encounter daily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be an \u00e2\u0080\u009ceffective citizen today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you have to understand the history of images \u00e2\u0080\u009cas tools or even weapons of both limitations and liberation\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  That her lecture tonight is in the same borough where her grandfather was punished for challenging a teacher about the exclusion of African-Americans from history books is \u00e2\u0080\u009cindescribably moving for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Lewis said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly redemptive, to say the least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said."}

{"Headline": "How Liberian Women Delivered Africa\u2019s First Female President", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byMONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 Bernice Freeman was chatting with some market women, trying to explain why it was so important that they leave their food stalls to vote for the first woman to be elected president of an African country, when she noticed some boys laughing nearby, waving something white.It was October 2005, the first presidential election after 15 years of a hideous civil war in Liberia. On the ballot was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Harvard-educated global technocrat with so much government experience it practically oozed from her pores, and a group of men, most notably the professional soccer player George Weah.Like many of the 1.5 million women in Liberia who had survived the civil war, Ms. Freeman had personally witnessed acts of violence so brutal she still had nightmares. Soldiers had gutted her 8\u00bd-months-pregnant cousin. Drugged-up rebels wearing Halloween masks had murdered her friends. Ms. Freeman herself had knelt in the dirt, praying, while henchmen loyal to the president had chambered rounds of their machine guns on orders to shoot her and the other women praying with her one afternoon.Ms. Freeman had seen it all. But even so, she was unprepared for the sight of the young men laughing nearby as she campaigned for a female president. The boys had taken women\u2019s panties, had smeared the crotches with tomato paste and were waving them at the women \u2014 their unsubtle way of saying that a woman could not be president.But instead of making Ms. Freeman and the other women embarrassed, the heckling only angered them.\u201cYou know what?\u201d one of the undecided women told Ms. Freeman, looking at the boys in disgust. \u201cWe will vote. Don\u2019t worry, we will vote.\u201dAnd vote they did. Close to 80 percent of the Liberian women who flooded the polls during the country\u2019s first postwar presidential election voted to usher a woman into power for the first time on a continent that for centuries had been the world\u2019s most patriarchal.Eleven years before Pantsuit Nation became a secret Facebook group for women who supported Hillary Clinton in America and \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d buttons and bumper stickers sprouted on lapels and S.U.V.s, the women of Liberia held a master class in how to get a woman elected president. Now, as the American women who supported Mrs. Clinton grapple with the whys of last November\u2019s election, the story of how, 4,500 miles away, the women of Liberia upended centuries of male rule to accomplish what their American counterparts could not has acquired a sharp and keen relevance.The Liberia story is one of extremes. It is almost as if for Liberians to contemplate installing a woman as president, the country needed to first go over a cliff so steep that there seemed nowhere left to drop. Mothers saw their children kidnapped, drugged and forced to take up arms in the country\u2019s never-ending civil war. More than 70 percent of Liberian women were raped during the war years. Starving young girls gnawed on tree bark for sustenance, while horrified children were forced to watch their sisters, mothers and grandmothers gang-raped in front of them.What happened in the war years so devastated Liberian women, who blamed the men who waged the war for the ensuing horrors, that many of them came to view Mrs. Sirleaf not necessarily as the better of the presidential candidates but, rather, as the only alternative to putting a man back in power in a place that men had just run into the ground.Masawa Jabateh, who had seen her 3-year-old daughter die from malnourishment during the war, said her despair became infused with a blind fury when she saw men campaigning to be president in 2005, especially since the leading candidate was Mr. Weah. \u201cThose men want put some grona boy in the chair who don\u2019t know what we doing? So we can go back to war again? No,\u201d she said.Her thought process was straightforward: She was \u201cvoting for woman,\u201d she said.\u201cVote for Woman,\u201d in 2005, became the de facto campaign slogan of Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s run for the presidency. It all started on the morning of May 2, 2005, a week into the voter registration period for the looming presidential elections, when Vabah Gayflor, the minister for gender, woke up to discover that women had not been registering to vote.A string of men were tossing their hats into the ring for the presidency, including Mr. Weah, a renowned athlete who had won the Ballon d\u2019Or and been named FIFA world player of the year and African player of the century.Unlike his rivals, Mr. Weah was not tainted by any association with those who had brought Liberia to ruin over the past 15 years, but he had no college education. (His listing of a bachelor\u2019s degree in sports management from Parkwood University in London was a subject of a scandal after news accounts surfaced calling the school an unaccredited diploma mill requiring no actual study.)At the other end of the spectrum was Mrs. Sirleaf. A former finance minister and jailed dissident, she had a pedigree that included the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. She had transformed herself from an abused wife, cowering and hunched in the front seat of her husband\u2019s car while he slapped her, to an international bureaucrat attempting what no woman had ever done before: winning, by popular vote, the right to lead an African country.To the Weah supporters, there was no contest. Grandmother versus soccer star? But to women like Ms. Gayflor, Ms. Jabateh and Ms. Freeman, there was also no contest. \u201cYou will take our country, our baby, and throw the baby away to football player? I beg you, no,\u201d Ms. Gayflor said.Ms. Gayflor\u2019s job as gender minister was supposed to be about helping women and children get access to health care, school feeding programs (in a postwar country with hardly any schools) and rape support.But she decided to redefine her role: getting a woman elected president. And she was not happy with the news from the National Elections Commission: Of the 100,000 Liberians who had registered to vote in the first week of the monthlong registration drive, only 15 percent were women.Who was registering instead? Former combatants, from all the armed groups that had fought in the war. Ms. Gayflor was appalled.Huddling with Etweda Cooper, the women\u2019s activist known throughout Liberia as \u201cSugars,\u201d Ms. Gayflor knew they had to take action fast.The men were holding mass rallies. But market women didn\u2019t have time to go to mass rallies. They were busy making market. Ms. Gayflor and Mrs. Cooper realized they would have to try a different strategy.Quickly they organized a group to use the radio stations to plead: \u201cWomen, oh women! Y\u2019all got to register to vote.\u201d They fanned out to the Monrovia markets.At first, some of the market women balked; they had their wares and their babies to tend. But Mrs. Cooper was ready for them with babysitters and stall tenders. \u201cWe will mind it for you,\u201d she said. \u201cGo register.\u201dIt was not enough to stay in Monrovia. The Liberian bush loomed, large, imposing and filled with village women. The women bought bullhorns and scattered their troops along the road. \u201cWomen, oh women!\u201d they yelled into the bullhorns. \u201cGo register.\u201dBy the end of the registration period, the final figures came out: Some 1.5 million Liberians out of the country\u2019s population of three million had registered to vote.Fifty-one percent of those registered were women.Unlike American presidential campaigns, the Liberian campaign season begins two months before Election Day. Liberian election rules dictate that a winning candidate has to get 50 percent of the vote \u2014 a quirk that guaranteed that in a crowded field of 22 candidates, there would be a runoff. So the key for Mrs. Sirleaf was to survive the first round by coming in second at least, so that she would then stand alone against Mr. Weah.As a government minister, Ms. Gayflor was not allowed to show favoritism for any candidate, let alone campaign on one\u2019s behalf. So she and Mrs. Cooper devised a strategy: They would present their efforts as simply an attempt to empower women. Ms. Gayflor would not sully her cabinet position by telling women whom to support. (She left that to Mrs. Cooper.) Instead, she would simply encourage women to exercise their right. She organized women\u2019s rallies where she gave speeches exhorting the crowd to vote.\u201cI\u2019m not telling you who to vote for, women!\u201d she said. \u201cJust make sure you vote.\u201dRight after Ms. Gayflor spoke, Mrs. Cooper \u2014 not constrained by any neutrality vows \u2014 shouted at the crowd, \u201cVote for woman!\u201dEverywhere, the women\u2019s rallies followed the same script:Ms. Gayflor: \u201cWomen, oh women! If y\u2019all got to tie your baby on your back soon in the morning, I beg y\u2019all, go vote!\u201dMrs. Cooper: \u201cVote for woman!\u201dMs. Gayflor: \u201cEven self your baby got poo-poo diapers, put it down, go vote!\u201dMrs. Cooper: \u201cVote for woman!At the rallies, the women passed out plastic bags of drinking water, a rare and precious commodity in a place where people regularly drank from unsanitary wells and dirty rivers.The rainy season was ending, but the air was still stewy when Election Day dawned. Of the 1.5 million people registered to vote, some 900,000 showed up at the polls. They came in wheelbarrows and wheelchairs. They came with babies on their backs. They came the night before, some sleeping on the hard ground outside the polling booths so they could vote when morning came.The results began to trickle in that night. As expected, Mr. Weah was in first place. But he wasn\u2019t close to 50 percent. And Mrs. Sirleaf was right behind him, where she needed to be.Time for the real battle. The soccer player versus the 67-year-old grandmother.The men fell in line behind Mr. Weah and complained that the women supporting Mrs. Sirleaf were sexist. Given the choice between a soccer player with no credible college education and a Harvard-educated development expert, the top male presidential candidates who fell short of the runoff, with one exception, endorsed the soccer player.In the meantime, Mr. Weah, honing a message explaining why he, and not Mrs. Sirleaf, should run Liberia, settled on an \u201ceducated people failed\u201d theme.But what the men who endorsed that strategy failed to realize was how much that very idea was angering the market women. Those women may not have been educated themselves, but they worked in the fields and the market stalls to send their children to school. Now the men were telling them that education wasn\u2019t important. Just as the men fell in behind Mr. Weah, the women fell in behind Mrs. Sirleaf.The market women went door to door, passing out T-shirts and fliers. They slept on the side of the road at night, curled up on their mats. They walked from village to village, calling out the now familiar mantra \u201cVote for woman!\u201dMr. Weah\u2019s supporters responded by promising that if he lost, the country would go back to war. \u201cNo Weah, no peace!\u201d they chanted.Thus the runoff started resembling past elections, like the one in 1985, in which Samuel Doe\u2019s supporters had suggested the same thing: Vote for Mr. Doe or the country goes back to war.Except that in November 2005, this tactic appeared to have met its match. Because the women had their own tricks, tricks that would make Mr. Weah\u2019s threats look like boys\u2019 play.\u201cYou want beer? Just give me your voter ID card; I will buy you beer.\u201d\u201cI say, we buying voter ID cards, oh. Ten Liberty dollars for one.\u201d\u201cWho looking for money? Just bring your voter ID card.\u201dA group of women had stationed themselves at a bar near a major intersection, luring young men in a time-honored fashion. Except this time the women were the ones with the cash, and the young men were the ones with the commodity for sale.\u201cSome of those boys were finish stupid,\u201d a market woman, Nancy Nagbe, recalled with a smirk. \u201cWe were crafty, oh!\u201dMany of the young men thought they were done with voting after the first round and didn\u2019t understand that they would need their IDs again. Others knew and did not care; late in the evening of a muggy hot day, the lure of a crisp, cold and malty Club Beer far outshone whatever benefits they thought their voter card could bring them.As for the ones who were too smart to sell their voter card \u2014 their mothers simply stole them, recalled one gender ministry official, Parleh Harris.One market woman said she sneaked into her son\u2019s room while he was sleeping, slipped his voter ID out of his wallet and buried it in the yard.\u201cYeah, I took it. And so what?\u201d the woman said. \u201cThat foolish boy, what he knew? I carried him for nine months. I took care of him. I fed him when he was hungry. Then he will take people country and give it away?\u201dMs. Gayflor, by now, was sailing perilously close to getting fired for illegally campaigning as a government minister. A few days before the runoff, she called a meeting in a room at the gender ministry. She invited every female political candidate, no matter what party she belonged to, along with market women, female lawyers and anyone else she could think of who lacked a Y chromosome.That night, in the stuffy room, the women all stood, one by one, and pledged to support Mrs. Sirleaf, who was so overcome afterward she could barely stand upright. \u201cIf I were a crying woman,\u201d she said, \u201cI would be crying right now. You have humbled me.\u201dThe repercussions came the next day. Ms. Gayflor arrived at work to find reporters camped out on the ministry\u2019s steps. The questions came furiously.Ms. Gayflor was past the point of backing down. \u201cYou take a former football player and give him our country?\u201d she shot back. \u201cLiberia is not a learning ground!\u201dShe had one last shot to fire. \u201cLet me give you a goodbye statement,\u201d the soon-to-be-former minister said. \u201cMrs. Sirleaf will be the next president of this country.\u201dOn Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2005, the people of Liberia went to the polls for the second time in four weeks. There was a palpable sense in the air that something big was happening. International observers stationed themselves at polling places and voting booths; some 230 agencies, from the Carter Center to the European Union, showed up to chronicle the proceedings. Helicopters from the United Nations mission hovered overhead, a constant presence above the voting booth lines.But the helicopters could not see what was going on at a polling station in Sinkor. Helpful poll workers were allowing pregnant women and nursing mothers to cut to the front of the line. So Ms. Freeman \u2014 who had been heckled weeks before by the young men waving white panties smeared with tomato paste \u2014 and a handful of other women were passing around babies and toddlers.\u201cYou want borrow the baby?\u201d Ms. Freeman grinned at one woman, sneaking a furtive look over her shoulder. \u201cPut the baby on your back.\u201d To another woman, she advised: \u201cAct pregnant. If they think you pregnant you can vote in front.\u201dIt was unclear whether the poll workers noticed how many different women were carrying the same baby to vote on that Election Day in November 2005.And when the National Elections Commission, on Nov. 23, announced the election results \u2014 Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s 59.4 percent to Mr. Weah\u2019s 40.6 percent \u2014 Ms. Freeman wore a smile on her face.Helene Cooper, the Pentagon correspondent for The New York Times, grew up in Liberia before emigrating to the United States in 1980.

{"Headline": "A Boom in Rock Climbing, Minus the Rocks", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurship\u201cRight foot. You\u2019ve got to put your right foot on the pink hold.\u201d So a young woman coached a friend who was trying to scale a 30-foot wall at the Brooklyn Boulders outpost in Long Island City, Queens, on a recent Saturday morning.\u201cThere you go, guy,\u201d called another member of the group. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there. You got it, bro.\u201dWell, not quite. Bro lost his footing, dropped to a padded surface, grinned ruefully and prepared to try again. Elsewhere in the 25,000-square-foot space, a father watched his son and daughter clamber partway up a 19-foot wall, and a fitness instructor led a class that was heavy on push-ups.Once a niche sport, indoor rock climbing is becoming more and more mainstream, thanks in part to facilities like Brooklyn Boulders, which also has gyms in Brooklyn, Chicago and Somerville, Mass. Plans for other locations are on the drawing board, the company\u2019s president, Lance Pinn, said.But the 16 percent growth that Climbing Business Journal anticipated in 2016 was overly optimistic; expansion did not quite hit 7 percent. Would-be owners have a tough climb of their own: finding and financing real estate with the right dimensions, never mind the high cost of building a wall (no, not that kind of wall).Another challenge: How do you get people to sign up for an activity that many view as difficult, if not downright dangerous? And what\u2019s with all the lingo \u2014 lead climbing? Belaying?On that Saturday at Brooklyn Boulders, a staff member gave an orientation tour to half a dozen first-timers, most of them millennials. She pointed out the cardio room, the yoga studio, the co-working spaces and the walls pocked with molded-plastic grips in many shapes and colors.And she discussed the various means of ascent with and without ropes and harnesses: bouldering (climbing without ropes); top-roping (ascending a wall with a rope anchored above); lead-climbing (ropes and harness, but no anchor above); and belaying (helping the lead climber by means of rope). There is also chimney climbing (think Jackie Chan).Mr. Pinn and two former classmates from Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., were inspired to establish a rock-climbing gym in New York City in 2008 when they were put off by the high costs and limited options around town.\u201cWe started a Facebook page called \u2018New York Needs a Rock-Climbing Gym,\u2019 and we got 300 friends overnight,\u201d Mr. Pinn, 32, said. \u201cThis told us there was a lot of interest in climbing.\u201dHe said he and his partners \u201cdid the math, and thought we could build a 6,000-square-foot facility for bouldering and a little bit of top-rope climbing for 300 members.\u201dThey ended up opening for business in 2009 in a garage in Brooklyn formerly owned by The Daily News. It had a pop-up roof (ideal for their purposes) and 18,000 square feet of space. Success came quickly, as did the decision to expand the gym\u2019s offerings to include yoga, Pilates, fitness classes and exercise machines. A day pass is $32; a monthly membership is $135.Brooklyn Boulders has an average of 1,000 visitors a day in each of its locations, and \u201c90 percent of people will interact with the wall while they\u2019re here,\u201d Mr. Pinn said.But building one is an enormous undertaking. Thomas Betterton, 33, the majority owner of the Denver Bouldering Club, recalled the reluctance of landlords when, in 2009, he opened the first of his two locations.\u201cIt was hard to get anyone to take us on as tenants, because they didn\u2019t know what a bouldering business was,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd trying to get a small business loan was an uphill battle, because this is a nontraditional business.\u201dIt is an expensive one, too. \u201cYou\u2019re talking millions of dollars for the walls \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of engineering,\u201d said Kevin Goradia, 26, the owner of Crux Climbing Center, a nine-month-old, 22,000-square-foot gym in Austin, Tex.\u201cYou need a lot of space, and you have to find a place where you will be allowed to construct a tall building,\u201d Mr. Goradia continued. \u201cMost small-business owners don\u2019t have the ability to fork out that kind of money.\u201dHe funded Crux himself, thanks to a stake in his family\u2019s petrochemical business. The center offers three climbing \u201cproducts\u201d: bouldering, top-roping and auto-belay. A bar and a sauna are in the works.Mr. Pinn has backing from the private equity firm North Castle Partners. \u201cWhen we were raising money for the first two facilities, we would hear: \u2018Climbing is a fad. It\u2019s going to go out of style,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut climbing facilities have been a constant in the U.S. since 1987, and maybe before that.\u201dThe steep upfront costs persuaded Bradley Speaks and Blake Maddux, both 31-year-old climbers and entrepreneurs in Louisville, Ky., to think small. Their company, Elemental Climbing, which opened in July, has a mobile sport-climbing wall that can be rented.That wall, which is 26 feet high and can accommodate four climbers at a time, has been deployed for events sponsored by the local government and by Boys and Girls Clubs, as well as for team-building activities at high schools.\u201cThe interest people have had in our business has shown us there\u2019s a market,\u201d Mr. Speaks said. \u201cBut brick-and-mortar isn\u2019t an imminent move for us.\u201dOwners of rock-climbing facilities are selling a lifestyle as much as a physical challenge, a community as much as a gym, social climbing as much as rock climbing.\u201cPeople come for the climbing, but also to be with friends,\u201d said Taki Miyamoto, 39, an owner and the general manager of Salt Pump Climbing in Southern Maine. \u201cYou can only climb so much, so the atmosphere is important.\u201d His 10,000-square-foot gym, which opened in 2015, has exercise and yoga classes and a cafe.But do not count Ms. Lee out. \u201cA shattered fibula (I still have a metal rod and two screws in my leg a year later) certainly won\u2019t keep me away for the long haul,\u201d she said in an email.Climbing facilities do not want to dismiss the hazards, nor do they want to make the sport seem like the province solely of the young and the restless. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to explain that this is something anyone can do,\u201d Mr. Miyamoto said.The Denver Bouldering Club may have an easier sell than most. Bouldering \u2014 its sole climbing option \u2014 involves neither ropes nor harnesses.\u201cThere\u2019s a lower barrier of entry with bouldering,\u201d Mr. Betterton said. \u201cWith rope climbing, there\u2019s more equipment, and there\u2019s safety information and instruction just to get started.\u201dThe fitness classes, the yoga rooms and the saunas at Brooklyn Boulders and Salt Pump Climbing are safe havens for the acrophobic. They are also a way for climbing gyms to hedge their bets.\u201cThe older generation of owners just had climbing walls,\u201d said Mr. Goradia of Crux Climbing Center. \u201cThe newer generation is saying, \u2018We have to add more amenities to bring people in.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chuck Berry, Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Pioneer, Dies at 90", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byChuck Berry, who with his indelible guitar licks, brash self-confidence and memorable songs about cars, girls and wild dance parties did as much as anyone to define rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2019s potential and attitude in its early years, died on Saturday at his home near Wentzville, Mo. He was 90.While Elvis Presley was rock\u2019s first pop star and teenage heartthrob, Mr. Berry was its master theorist and conceptual genius, the songwriter who understood what the kids wanted before they knew themselves. With songs like \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d and \u201cRoll Over Beethoven,\u201d he gave his listeners more than they knew they were getting from jukebox entertainment.His guitar lines wired the lean twang of country and the bite of the blues into phrases with both a streamlined trajectory and a long memory. And tucked into the lighthearted, telegraphic narratives that he sang with such clear enunciation was a sly defiance, upending convention to claim the pleasures of the moment.In \u201cSweet Little Sixteen,\u201d \u201cYou Can\u2019t Catch Me\u201d and other songs, Mr. Berry invented rock as a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit). In \u201cPromised Land,\u201d \u201cToo Much Monkey Business\u201d and \u201cBrown Eyed Handsome Man,\u201d he celebrated and satirized America\u2019s opportunities and class tensions. His rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was a music of joyful lusts, laughed-off tensions and gleefully shattered icons.Mr. Berry was already well past his teens when he wrote mid-1950s manifestoes like \u201cRoll Over Beethoven,\u201d \u201cRock and Roll Music\u201d and \u201cSchool Day.\u201d Born Charles Edward Anderson Berry on Oct. 18, 1926, in St. Louis, he grew up in a segregated, middle-class neighborhood there, soaking up gospel, blues, and rhythm and blues, along with some country music.He spent three years in reform school after a spree of car thefts and armed robbery. He received a degree in hairdressing and cosmetology and worked for a time as a beautician; he married Themetta Suggs in 1948 and started a family. She survives him, as do four children: Ingrid Berry, Melody Eskridge, Aloha Isa Leigh Berry and Charles Berry Jr.A variant of an old country song by the same name, \u201cIda Red\u201d had a 2/4 backbeat with a hillbilly oompah, while Mr. Berry\u2019s lyrics sketched a car chase, the narrator \u201cmotorvatin\u2019\u201d after an elusive girl. Mr. Chess renamed the song \u201cMaybellene,\u201d and in a long session on May 21, 1955, Mr. Chess and the bassist Willie Dixon got the band to punch up the rhythm.Chuck Berry was an inventor of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and a songwriter who understood what the kids wanted before they knew themselves. With indelible guitar licks and brash self-confidence, Mr. Berry defined rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2019s potential and its attitude the moment it was born.\u201cThe big beat, cars and young love,\u201d Mr. Chess outlined. \u201cIt was a trend, and we jumped on it.\u201dThe music was bright and clear, a hard-swinging amalgam of country and blues. More than 60 years later, it still sounds reckless and audacious.Mr. Berry articulated every word, with precise diction and no noticeable accent, leading some listeners and concert promoters, used to a different kind of rhythm-and-blues singer, to initially think that he was white. Teenagers didn\u2019t care; they heard a rocker who was ready to take on the world.The song was sent to the disc jockey Alan Freed. Mr. Freed and another man, Russ Fratto, were added to the credits as songwriters and got a share of the publishing royalties. Played regularly on Mr. Freed\u2019s show and others, \u201cMaybellene\u201d reached No. 5 on the Billboard pop chart and was a No. 1 R&B hit.In Mr. Berry\u2019s groundbreaking early songs, his guitar twangs his famous two-stringed lick. It also punches like a horn section and sasses back at his own voice. The drummer eagerly socks the backbeat, and the pianist \u2014 usually either Mr. Johnson or Lafayette Leake \u2014 hurls fistfuls of tinkling anarchy all around him.From 1955 to 1958, Mr. Berry knocked out classic after classic. Although he was in his late 20s and early 30s, he came up with high school chronicles and plugs for the newfangled music called rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.No matter how calculated songs like \u201cSchool Day\u201d or \u201cRock and Roll Music\u201d may have been, they reached the Top 10, caught the early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll spirit and detailed its mythology. \u201cJohnny B. Goode,\u201d a Top 10 hit in 1958, told the archetypal story of a rocker who could \u201cplay the guitar just like ringin\u2019 a bell.\u201dThrough the 1950s, Mr. Berry had pop hits with his songs about rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and R&B hits with less teenage-oriented material. He spun surreal tall tales that Bob Dylan and John Lennon would learn from, like \u201cThirty Days\u201d and \u201cJo Jo Gunne.\u201d In \u201cBrown Eyed Handsome Man,\u201d from 1956, he offered a barely veiled racial pride. His pithiness and humor rarely failed him.In 1957, Mr. Berry bought 30 acres in Wentzville, where he built a short-lived amusement park, Berry Park, and a restaurant, the Southern Air. In 1958, he opened Club Bandstand in the theater district of St. Louis.In the early 1960s, Mr. Berry\u2019s songs inspired both California rock and the British Invasion. The Beach Boys reworked his \u201cSweet Little Sixteen\u201d into \u201cSurfin\u2019 U.S.A.\u201d (Mr. Berry sued them and won a songwriting credit.) The Rolling Stones released a string of Berry songs, including their first single, \u201cCome On,\u201d and the Beatles remade \u201cRoll Over Beethoven\u201d and \u201cRock and Roll Music.\u201dBut by the time his music started reaching a new audience, Mr. Berry was in jail.He had been arrested in 1959 and charged with transporting a teenage girl \u2014 who briefly worked as a hatcheck girl at Club Bandstand \u2014 across state lines for immoral purposes. He was tried twice and found guilty both times; the first verdict was overturned because of racist remarks by the judge. When he emerged from 20 months in prison in 1964, his wife had left him (they later reconciled) and his songwriting spark had diminished.He had not totally lost his touch, though, as demonstrated by the handful of hits he had in 1964 and 1965, notably \u201cNadine,\u201d \u201cNo Particular Place to Go,\u201d \u201cYou Never Can Tell\u201d and \u201cPromised Land.\u201d He appeared in the celebrated all-star 1964 concert film \u201cThe TAMI Show,\u201d along with James Brown, the Rolling Stones, Marvin Gaye, the Beach Boys and the Supremes.While he toured steadily through the 1960s, headlining or sharing bills with bands that grew up on his songs, his recording career stalled after he moved from Chess to Mercury Records in 1966. He remade some of his old hits and tried to reach the new hippie audience, recording \u201cLive at the Fillmore Auditorium\u201d with the Steve Miller Band, billed as the Steve Miller Blues Band at the time. When he returned to Chess in 1970, he recorded new songs, like \u201cTulane\u201d and \u201cHave Mercy Judge,\u201d that flashed his old wit but failed to reach the Top 40.In 1972, Mr. Berry had the biggest hit of his career with \u201cMy Ding-a-Ling,\u201d a double-entendre novelty song that was included on the album \u201cThe London Chuck Berry Sessions\u201d (even though he recorded the song not in London but at a concert in Coventry, England). The New Orleans songwriter Dave Bartholomew wrote and recorded it in 1952; Mr. Berry recorded a similar song, \u201cMy Tambourine,\u201d in 1968, and is credited on recordings as the sole songwriter of the 1972 \u201cMy Ding-a-Ling.\u201dIt was a million-seller and Mr. Berry\u2019s first and only No. 1 pop single. It was also his last hit. His 1973 follow-up album, \u201cBio,\u201d was poorly received; \u201cRockit,\u201d released by Atlantic in 1979, did not sell. But he stayed active: He appeared as himself in a 1979 movie about 1950s rock, \u201cAmerican Hot Wax,\u201d and he continued to tour constantly.He had further legal troubles in 1990 when the police raided his home and found 62 grams of marijuana and videotapes from a camera in the women\u2019s room of his restaurant. In a plea bargain, he agreed to a misdemeanor count of marijuana possession, with a suspended jail sentence and two years\u2019 probation.By the 1980s, Mr. Berry was recognized as a rock pioneer. He never won a Grammy Award in his prime, but the Recording Academy gave him a lifetime achievement award in 1984. He was in the first group of musicians inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.Around his 60th birthday that year, he allowed the director Taylor Hackford to film him at his home in Wentzville for the documentary \u201cHail! Hail! Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll,\u201d which also included performances by Mr. Berry with a band led by Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and special guests. \u201cChuck Berry: The Autobiography\u201d was published in 1988.Mr. Berry continued performing well into his 80s. He usually played with local pickup bands, as he had done for most of his career, but sometimes he played with fellow rock stars. When the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum opened in Cleveland in 1995, Mr. Berry performed at an inaugural concert, backed by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.In 2012, he headlined a Cleveland concert in his honor with a genre-spanning bill that included Darryl McDaniels of Run-D.M.C. and Merle Haggard. Although he told reporters before the show, \u201cMy singing days have passed,\u201d he performed \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d and \u201cReelin\u2019 and Rockin\u2019\u201d and joined the other musicians for the closing number, \u201cRock and Roll Music.\u201dHe made a surprising announcement on his 90th birthday, Oct. 18, 2016: He was planning to release his first studio album in almost 40 years. The album, called simply \u201cChuck\u201d and scheduled for release in June, was to consist primarily of new compositions.Christopher Mele contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Ways to Be More Effective in Meetings", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byMeetings!Those endless blocks of time during the workday in which we are given tacit approval to zone out but that we cannot skip.\u201cAn excess of meetings is a symptom; it\u2019s not a problem in and of itself,\u201d said Michael Mankins, an author of \u201cTime, Talent, Energy: Overcome Organizational Drag and Unleash Your Team\u2019s Productive Power\u201d and a partner at Bain & Company.That problem, Mr. Mankins said, is \u201ceither a culture that rewards collaboration for collaboration\u2019s sake, or more commonly, an organizational structure that basically necessitates more people being involved in critical activities than should be required.\u201dJustin Rosenstein, who worked at Google and Facebook and was a co-founder of Asana, a productivity management tool, said even those vaunted tech icons of productivity fall into the trap.\u201cIt was really sad the amount of time we spent not doing work, but doing work about work,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if a 30-minute meeting seems innocuous, context-switching is so hard, and it\u2019s hard to get back into the rhythm of things.\u201dDoing away with meetings altogether would be counterproductive, so the trick is to get more out of the meetings you attend.Here\u2019s how to do it.After accepting a meeting invitation, the first thing you should always do is ask for an agenda well in advance.Your best tool for doing well in meetings is relentless preparation, and studying the agenda will help you plot the moments for your contributions, said Jill Flynn, founding partner at Flynn Heath Holt Leadership, a consulting firm focused on training female leaders.\u201cThink of a couple of ways you hope to add value or your point of view ahead of time,\u201d she said. \u201cMeetings don\u2019t always go the way you anticipate, but it definitely helps to be mentally prepared.\u201dWhen you are bringing a new idea, try to build support for it in casual chats before the meeting begins. If you face resistance, you will already have someone in your corner to back you up.\u201cEverybody knows, although women often do not, that the real meetings happen before the meeting,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cYou need to have conversations with the key players before you ever get in the room.\u201dThe first few minutes of a meeting are paramount, too.\u201cYou want to get your voice in the room as early as you can,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cA lot of times people wait and think, \u2018Oh, I have to wait because I have to have something really, really insightful to say.\u2019 \u201dBut the direction of a meeting, including who will be contributing, is often decided in the first few minutes of a meeting, so it is important to participate early, she said.If you must be in a meeting and you have done your homework, you can still end up being sidelined by what one former chief executive coach calls the \u201ctyranny of the most verbose\u201d: a meeting\u2019s agenda being dictated by those who speak most forcefully, and often those who speak first.\u201cBy not speaking up, you\u2019re withholding something valuable from the team,\u201d said Kim Scott, the chief executive of Candor and the author of \u201cRadical Candor.\u201d\u201cSilence is not an act of generosity when you have a great idea,\u201d she said.For timid or more junior employees \u2014 or those marginalized by a workplace\u2019s culture \u2014 speaking up can be at best nerve-racking and at worst a terrifying experience. But expressing confidence through body language and word choice can make it easier to jump in.To appear more engaged, sit toward the front of your seat and do not lean back, Ms. Flynn said. Think about ditching the laptop; sometimes it can set up a barrier between you and everyone else.When the moment comes to speak up, try to use \u201cmuscular language.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re the junior member, or the only person of color, or the only woman, our tendency is to be way too deferential and use a lot of qualifiers,\u201d she said. \u201cGet to the point, be factual, persuasive, use a sense of humor if you\u2019re good at that. But be factual and clear and don\u2019t use deferential language and filler words.\u201dPointing out obvious but uncomfortable truths is never easy, but it is nearly impossible in a setting with your peers and colleagues. But that is all the more reason to go for it.\u201cPeople bumping up against each other is what helps us not just improve our work product but also ourselves as human beings,\u201d Ms. Scott said, noting the often-cited \u201cobligation to dissent\u201d at McKinsey & Company, the renowned management consulting firm.The benefits here often far outweigh the risks, even if your workplace has not embraced dissent as a necessary tool for improvement. If something does not feel right to you, odds are it is not just you.\u201cI\u2019ve seen meetings where I know that everyone in the room is thinking something, but no one feels comfortable saying it,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said. \u201cWe want to hear people say things like \u2018I don\u2019t know exactly why yet, but I have a weird feeling about this idea.\u2019 \u201dThat will not win any debates, but sometimes acknowledging an elephant in the room can be all that is needed.\u201cIt\u2019s become sort of a part of corporate culture that if you\u2019re not invited to a meeting, it must be that you\u2019re not important,\u201d Mr. Mankins said. \u201cThat reinforces the behavior of wanting to be invited even if you play no role.\u201dThe first step to recovery is, obviously, going to fewer meetings. That is easy for managers, but what about their employees?The most tactful technique, experts said, is to acknowledge the invitation and express your appreciation, then politely explain that you are unclear about how your presence will add anything and suggest that you skip it. Frame your absence as an opportunity for others to add more to the meeting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "International Women\u2019s Day: Calls to Action, Protests and Words of Praise", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byThe events were all centered on International Women\u2019s Day on Wednesday, and people and governments across the globe observed it in an outpouring of support for women\u2019s equality and empowerment. But amid the celebrations, protests were brewing.Demonstrations were scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in dozens of cities across France. In Paris, protesters planned to march from the Place de la R\u00e9publique to the Op\u00e9ra Garnier.Unions, student organizations and feminist associations were calling for women to start striking at 3:40 p.m. \u2014 symbolically the time of day when Frenchwomen stop being paid, they argue, because of an average 26 percent pay gap with men.With the coming presidential election, the protest organizers unveiled a list of 20 demands, including salary increases, less temporary work and better enforcement of penalties for companies that discriminate against women, including when they are pregnant.In Buenos Aires, small groups of women began taking to the street at noon in preparation for a march later in the afternoon. Tens of thousands of people were expected to attend.Laura De Marinis, a 30-year-old lawyer, clapped and blocked a road alongside other protesters. \u201cI left my kid at home with my husband,\u201d she said, emphasizing one of the key points of the demonstration: Domestic work continues to fall disproportionately on women.Many of those present said they had witnessed a change in attitudes. \u201cWomen are starting to stand up for themselves more, and we are realizing that we don\u2019t have to put up with a culture that oppresses us just for being women,\u201d said Luc\u00eda D\u2019Agostino, 48, a psychologist.In Tbilisi, Georgia, women demonstrated under a symbolic \u201cglass ceiling\u201d to illustrate limitations on women\u2019s empowerment.Thousands marched in Rome on Wednesday evening, in what was the largest of dozens of demonstrations in various Italian cities. Wearing pink boas, waving placards with figures of matryoshka dolls in various guises and chanting slogans from the 1970s, women of all ages, as well as some men, took to the streets to protest discrimination, wage inequality and violence against women.\u201cThere are so many young women, it\u2019s transgenerational. That\u2019s bellissimo,\u201d said Maria Brighi of Rome\u2019s International House of Women, and one of the organizers of the march.Organizers said that some 20,000 people had participated in the protests, which started from the Colosseum and wove through parts of downtown Rome, blocking traffic and shutting down public transportation.To mark the deaths of women killed by ex-husbands and former partners, flags were flown at half-staff in front of Italy\u2019s lower house, Montecitorio.\u201cEven today, on International Women\u2019s Day, you are still caught up in your routine, working tirelessly, always on time. We often ask ourselves: How do they manage it all?\u201dIn Yogyakarta, Indonesia, women danced during a celebration.In Colombo, Sri Lanka, traditional dancers performed.Outside a Roman Catholic church in Manila, women wore masks smudged with fake blood to call for an end to violence against women. At a rally near the United States Embassy, female police officers holding shields stood guard as a women\u2019s group, Gabriela, held a rally.The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has made inflammatory remarks about sexual assault, gave a speech praising women \u2014 though he also lashed out at the country\u2019s highest-ranking female elected official, Vice President Leni Robredo, and at a political rival, Senator Leila de Lima.Another senator, Risa Hontiveros, accused Mr. Duterte of allowing a \u201cpervasive culture of sexism, misogyny and gender bias.\u201dOne of the most unusual events occurred in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over a ceremony in honor of 10 \u201cclean warriors,\u201d all women who had campaigned to improve rural sanitation. They included Sushila Khurkute, 30, who recently gained prominence when, seven months into her third pregnancy, she spent three solitary days chipping away at the rocky ground with a stick to make her family a toilet.A group of Unicef volunteers touring the area began documenting her efforts and her story. The toilet, she told them, was crucial to the welfare of her child. Because women defecating in open fields are vulnerable to sexual assault, she said, she had starved herself during her two previous pregnancies, weakening her babies.The images rippled across India, where around 300 million women still defecate in the open.As Ms. Khurkute\u2019s story was widely shared online, news outlets joined the discussion, nominating women like Kajal Roy, who mortgaged her jewelry and used the money to build 100 toilets, and Kunwar Bai, whose age was reported as 105 and who had sold two goats to build herself a toilet, despite never having used one. In a constellation of villages in the northern part of the country, elders recently voted to impose a new regulation \u2014 no daughters would be given away in marriage to a household that did not have a toilet.In Guinea-Bissau, the United Nations sponsored a bicycle race and ceremony as part of a workshop on women in the workplace. Far fewer than half of all workers in the nation are women. Many work in the informal economy, with low pay and no social protection.In six African countries, however, legal protection for women against domestic violence does not exist. In 2013, African women and girls accounted for 62 percent of all deaths around the globe from preventable illnesses tied to pregnancy and childbirth.If current trends continue, the report said, almost half of the world\u2019s child brides in 2050 will be African.Elsewhere in the world:\u25a0 Marches for reproductive rights took place in Dublin, Warsaw and other cities.One Facebook user asked, according to the BBC: \u201cWhy do we have to celebrate men on International Women\u2019s Day?\u201d Others were supportive of her post, with one user writing: \u201cMa\u2019am, despite the backlash you\u2019re taking over this, I\u2019d like to say thank you for the spirit of inclusion it was clearly meant in.\u201dOthers commemorated the day on Twitter:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "On the streets of Manila, the body count rises daily as journalists document the crusade of President Rodrigo Duterte.The commander accidentally wrote on a slide screen with a marker as he mapped out a route for the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operation in a crowded Metro Manila neighborhood. The screen was sacrificed for nothing: the swarm of heavily armed SWAT officers on motorcycles got lost en route to the staging area, earning a very public dressing down after reassembling a half-hour later. This is President Rodrigo Duterte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u201cwar on drugs\u201d in action. Fierce. Massive. And more than a bit haphazard. Police officers, rifles in hand, rounded up dozens of young men trying to keep cool in the doorways of their modest homes, herding them onto a basketball court. The local police call this a One Time, Big Time \u2014 a large show of force in a Philippine community said to be plagued by drugs. The young men aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suspects, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly terrified. With reason. Since taking office on June 30, President Duterte has made it open season on drug dealers and users, calling for the police and vigilantes to kill suspects. I was in Manila in early December to film a short documentary on that violent campaign. By then, the official death toll had reached nearly 3,000, though independent observers and journalists said that may only be half the actual toll.As the armed officers ask the corralled men to \u00e2\u0080\u009cvoluntarily\u00e2\u0080\u009d register their names, Chief Inspector Ed Palaylay boasts of the success of Mr. Duterte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavy hand. In just six months, the police had cut crime by half in Pasig City, a sprawling area of Metro Manila.I mention to the inspector that he has left a seemingly important number out of his calculus: Since July, more than 90 bodies have been found on Pasig City streets, all homicide victims. There have been no arrests, charges or trials. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this an embarrassment for him and his comrades? No. Inspector Palaylay explains that all of the victims were involved in drugs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but he deflects any request for proof, since none of the deaths were actually investigated. Did they deserve their fate? \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo comment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Interview over.The disconnect between the successes touted by the commander and the mounting death toll stuck with me. But none of the local news photographers I met that night were surprised when I recounted this. Nearly every night since President Duterte took office, they have decamped at police headquarters, sipping stale coffee and smoking, waiting for a call. They often arrive at the crime scene before the police or the local funeral homes \u2014 with the body or bodies lying alone on the street, often mummified in duct tape. The police often unconvincingly report that the deceased had pulled guns on them during a buy-and-bust operation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president promised this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Raffy Lerma, one of the deans of the Night Beat corps of local reporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe promised that people will die.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe president and his bloody campaign remain wildly popular, and that bothers the Night Beat. This tight-knit tribe believes that their audience needs to be bothered, too. So they have put normal life on pause to document death, sometimes more than five times in a single night. Many follow up the next morning to photograph wakes and funerals and to meet with surviving family members. These interviews and images don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often make the paper, but the photojournalist Raffy Lerma tells me that being there is a bracing dose of the victims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 humanity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something he said the president and the police have tried to scrub from the story. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a convention in journalism that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally bad form for reporters to report on other reporters. Doing so can be self-referential. But every good story has conflict. And the more I looked into what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in the Philippines, the more I saw dedicated journalists like Mr. Lerma and his friends on the Night Beat as some of the boldest voices challenging the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bloody rhetoric."}

{"Headline": "Reporting From Syria, an American With a Point of View and a Message", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 On a stretch of road in northern Syria, a missile screamed from the sky and obliterated a car, killing an Islamist militant and leaving a wreck of twisted metal in an olive grove.Soon after, a skinny, bald and bearded African-American convert to Islam and former stand-up comedian from New York arrived to document the scene.Addressing a video camera with thinly veiled outrage, Bilal Abdul Kareem showed missile fragments that he said indicated an American drone strike, adding that it had put children who were playing nearby into the hospital.\u201cSome people here don\u2019t think that that was a good idea,\u201d he said of the strike, asking whether there was \u201copen warfare\u201d on Syrians as long as countries like the United States could \u201cget their man.\u201dAlong the way, Mr. Abdul Kareem has interviewed foreign fighters from Britain, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere and survived the siege of eastern Aleppo by government forces last year.Such interviews have led critics to brand Mr. Abdul Kareem a jihadist propagandist.That played into the strategy of Syria\u2019s Qaeda affiliate, the Nusra Front, to blend in with the wider rebel movement by changing its name, announcing a break with Al Qaeda and merging with other factions \u2014 moves that have not convinced the United States that the group has changed, Mr. Fernandez said.\u201cBut to the broader world, inside of Syria and on social media, there is an effort to reinvent them as kinder, gentler jihadists,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Abdul Kareem was part of that effort.Mr. Abdul Kareem begged to differ.When I contacted him about his work, he jokingly suggested that I drop by for dinner \u2014 at his place in northern Syria.In a series of Skype interviews, he discussed his work and explained how he had grown from a churchgoing kid in Mount Vernon, N.Y., with a knack for \u201cyo\u2019 mama so fat jokes\u201d into an unlikely correspondent in a Middle Eastern war.He insisted that he was an independent journalist who belonged to no militant group, opposed violence against civilians and did not bear arms.\u201cDo you think this war needs one more black guy with no hair on his head blasting with a Kalashnikov?\u201d he asked, laughing.But he acknowledged that he speaks with members of Syria\u2019s Islamist factions, including Al Qaeda, to provide Western audiences with a window into their views.Too often, he said, the West dismisses Islamist fighters as \u201cterrorists\u201d without understanding what motivates them, just as Islamists fail to understand the United States. That has locked the two sides in an endless, \u201close-lose\u201d battle, he said, which he believes can be solved only through dialogue.He acknowledged that such an initiative was a long shot \u2014 especially with President Trump in the White House. Mr. Trump has called for stepping up the war with what he calls \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d so dialogue with Islamists seems unlikely.\u201cI can have these conversations with Al Qaeda members, and sometimes you convince them and sometimes they are not convinced,\u201d he said. \u201cI wonder how welcome I would be if I walked into Washington and said, \u2018Hey guys, I want to talk to you about Al Qaeda.\u2019 I wonder if I would get the same tea with one spoonful of sugar in it.\u201dMr. Abdul Kareem was born Darrell Lamont Phelps and raised by his mother in Mount Vernon. A 1988 yearbook photo from his high school shows a grinning young man in a tuxedo and bow tie.As Mr. Abdul Kareem tells it, he moved to New York City, where he dabbled in music, theater and stand-up comedy before converting to Islam, attracted to its conception of God and its emphasis on clean living.In 2012, he went to Syria to document how Islamist fighters who held territory were operating, and Syria has been his focus since. Early on, he collaborated with Western news outlets to produce reports about foreign fighters. But he felt that they only wanted \u201cbad guy stories\u201d that sensationalized the fighters, he said.Now 46, Mr. Abdul Kareem is married with five children, who live with their mother outside Syria. He declined to say where for fear that their association with him could cause them problems with the authorities.Besides his family and being able to communicate with people in English, he misses \u201cItalian pizza from New York,\u201d he said.He has covered different aspects of the war, including civilians wounded in airstrikes, the destruction caused by rocket attacks and the views of fighters, often near the front lines.Running through his work is the view that the battle against the government of President Bashar al-Assad is a just Islamic cause against a brutal oppressor, and outrage that the world is not doing more to help out.\u201cIt\u2019s a sectarian war and don\u2019t let anyone tell you that it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they tell you that it\u2019s not, they don\u2019t know or they are lying.\u201dMr. Abdul Kareem\u2019s profile rose significantly last year when he became trapped in the siege of eastern Aleppo by government forces and filed dispatches almost daily about the deteriorating humanitarian situation.\u201cYou get up to brush your teeth and a fight kicks off,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s normal.\u201d\u201cYou all blew it, and you had a golden opportunity,\u201d he said.\u201cWooooo, apples!\u201d Mr. Abdul Kareem said.Since then, he has remained in rebel-held parts of Idlib Province in northwest Syria, where he hopes his work will prompt a conversation between Islamic militants and the United States.\u201cIf the two sides decide that the only way forward is to just launch strikes on each other, then that is just what they decided to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a good cup of tea and some dialogue never hurt nobody.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, Hwaida Saad from Beirut and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.

{"Headline": "Turkey to Investigate Antitrust Complaint Against Google", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byGoogle faced another regulatory challenge on Monday when the authorities in Turkey opened an investigation into whether the search giant\u2019s popular Android software had broken the country\u2019s antitrust rules.Google denies that it has broken any laws, saying that its digital services like search and online maps do not hinder those of rivals.The new Turkish investigation relates to how Google provides some of its digital services as part of a package of software related to Android, the mobile operating system that powers more than 75 percent of the smartphones worldwide.The complaint was filed last year by Yandex, a Russian competitor to Google. Yandex has charged that makers of cellphones are obliged to use Google\u2019s services if they want to use the latest version of Android, but that such obligations are unfair because they create an uneven playing field.The regulator, the Turkish Competition Authority, had initially declined to investigate Yandex\u2019s complaint, but it said on Monday that it would look at whether Google\u2019s use of Android to promote its other digital services infringed on the country\u2019s competition rules. It is unclear how long the investigation will take.That inquiry by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, focused on a Google requirement that some cellphone manufacturers preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone app store. The commission also found that Google had given the companies unfair financial incentives to favor its services on their mobile devices.\u201cGoogle has abused its dominant position,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition chief, said last year when announcing the charges against Google.

Our digital crude is a rich brew of mundane, everyday activities \u2014 our searches, texts and tweets \u2014 along with the GPS coordinates from our phones, the biometric information we share with fitness devices, even the IP addresses of our connected refrigerators. To the average person, this raw material is undetectable noise. But for organizations that know how to identify signals, there\u2019s immense value in refining what has become an unlimited supply.Understanding what data we create, and how others exploit it, is vitally important. Soon, powerful machine-learning algorithms and artificially intelligent systems will analyze our data to reach decisions about and for us: whether we qualify for a bank loan, whether we\u2019re likely to commit a crime, whether we deserve an organ transplant. And unlike us, machines aren\u2019t burdened with an emotional attachment to privacy.The popular old data-as-oil idea opens Andreas Weigend\u2019s new book, \u201cData for the People,\u201d an exhaustive and insightful look at how data is collected and used, often without our knowledge and almost always without our input. Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon, details the \u201csocial data\u201d that emanates from billions of cameras, sensors and other devices, as well as social networks, online retailers and dating apps. Data refineries \u2014 those companies and people who turn our digital crude into profitable information \u2014 hunt for patterns, then sort us into buckets based on our behavior: what we might buy, what we\u2019ll watch, whom we might fall in love with. As Weigend points out, this exchange benefits everyone: If we let ourselves be mined, we receive personalized recommendations, connections and deals. Yet there\u2019s an imbalance of power. Companies make a lot of money from our data, and we have very little say in how it\u2019s used.Weigend argues persuasively that in this \u201cpost-privacy\u201d world, we should give our data freely, but that we should expect certain protections in return. He advocates a set of rights to increase data refineries\u2019 transparency and to increase our own agency in how information is used. Companies like OkCupid, WeChat and Spotify should perform data safety audits, submit to privacy ratings and calculate a score based on the benefits they provide \u2014 a sort of credit score for the companies that mine our data. Meanwhile, we should have the right to amend, blur and import or export our own data into any system we please.Not everyone believes that our information should be freely available as long as we agree to the terms of use. In \u201cThe Art of Invisibility,\u201d the internet security expert Kevin Mitnick advocates the opposite. Mitnick notes various reasons we may want to hide our data: We\u2019re wary of the government; we don\u2019t want businesses intruding into our lives; we have a mistress; we are the mistress; we\u2019re a criminal. Mitnick, who served five years in prison for hacking into corporate networks and stealing software, offers a sobering reminder of how our raw data \u2014 from email, cars, home Wi-Fi networks and so on \u2014 makes us vulnerable. He describes basic privacy protections (using a strong password, avoiding public computers) along with more advanced techniques (encrypting files on a hard drive, using a VPN and Bitcoin for online purchases). Most will seem familiar and perhaps rudimentary to those with any technical savvy. For everyone else, he offers an uncomfortable view of how data can be exploited.Both books are meant to scare us, and the central theme is privacy: Without intervention, they suggest, we\u2019ll come to regret today\u2019s inaction. I agree, but the authors miss the real horror show on the horizon. The future\u2019s fundamental infrastructure is being built by computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and security experts just like Weigend and Mitnick, who do not recognize their own biases. This encodes an urgent flaw in the foundation itself. The next layer will be just a little off, along with the next one and the one after that, as the problems compound.Right now, humans and machines engage in \u201csupervised learning.\u201d Experts \u201cteach\u201d the system by labeling an initial data set; once the computer reaches basic proficiency, they let it try sorting data on its own. If the system makes an error, the experts correct it. Eventually, this process yields highly sophisticated algorithms capable of refining and using our personal data for a variety of purposes: automatically sorting spam out of your inbox, say, or recommending a show you\u2019ll like on Netflix. Then, building on this foundation of data and algorithms, more teaching and learning takes place.But human bias creeps into computerized algorithms in disconcerting ways. In 2015, Google\u2019s photo app mistook a black software developer for a gorilla in photos he uploaded. In 2016, the Microsoft chatbot Tay went on a homophobic, anti-Semitic rampage after just one day of interactions on Twitter. Months later, reporters at ProPublica uncovered how algorithms in police software discriminate against black people while mislabeling white criminals as \u201clow risk.\u201d Recently when I searched \u201cC.E.O.\u201d on Google Images, the first woman listed was C.E.O. Barbie.Data scientists aren\u2019t inherently racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. But they are human, and they harbor unconscious biases just as we all do. This comes through in both books. In Mitnick\u2019s, women appear primarily in anecdotes and always as unwitting, jealous or angry. Near the end, Mitnick describes trying to enter Canada from Michigan, and wonders if he\u2019s stopped \u201cbecause a Middle Eastern guy with only a green card was driving.\u201d (He might be right, but he doesn\u2019t allow for the possibility that his own criminal record could also be responsible.)Weigend\u2019s book is meticulously researched, yet nearly all the experts he quotes are men. Early on he tells the story of Latanya Sweeney, who in the 1990s produced a now famous study of anonymized public health data in Massachusetts. She proved that the data could be traced back to individuals, including the governor himself. But Sweeney is far better known for something Weigend never mentions: She\u2019s the Harvard professor who discovered that \u2014 because of her black-sounding name \u2014 she was appearing in Google ads for criminal records and background checks. Weigend could have cited her to address bias in the second of his six rights, involving the integrity of a refinery\u2019s social data ecosystem. But he neglects to discuss the well-documented sexism, racism, xenophobia and homophobia in the machine-learning infrastructure.The omission of women and people of color from something as benign as book research illustrates the real challenge of unconscious bias in data and algorithms. Weigend and Mitnick rely only on what\u2019s immediate and familiar \u2014 an unfortunately common practice in the data community. University computer science, math and physics departments lack diversity in staff and coursework. Corporate data science is homogeneous. So are professional and academic conferences, where the future of data is discussed. If the people mining and processing our data are nothing like us, and if the machines learn only from them, our data can yield only warped caricatures, like the zombies you see on TV.As a futurist, I try to figure out how your data will someday power things like artificially intelligent cars, computer-assisted doctors and robot security agents. That\u2019s why I found both books concerning. Think of all the characteristics that make up who you are: how much coffee you drink, how fast you drive, how often you open your refrigerator, your respiratory rate, what slang you use, the random strangers you\u2019ve friended on Facebook. You may look like Weigend and Mitnick and therefore may not have experienced algorithmic discrimination yet. You, too, should be afraid. We\u2019ve only recently struck oil.Amy Webb, chief executive of the Future Today Institute, is the author of \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Bet G.O.P. Will Regret Opposing Scrutiny of Trump", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byCongressional MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump gives Democrats in Congress an ideal adversary, one who can set off impassioned protests and ignite their supporters with a single Twitter post.But with the Democrats\u2019 power severely limited by their minority status, they cannot conduct congressional investigations. The chances their bills will even get a vote are slim.What they do possess, they hope, is the power to shame. So they have been offering up bills that stand virtually no chance of passing, like ones forcing Mr. Trump to release his tax returns, with the clear intent of putting Republicans on the record now in hopes that voters will punish them later.Last week, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, vowed a weekly vote on the matter. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to pound away,\u201d she told colleagues in a closed-door meeting, according to an aide who was present.The results so far are modest. On Friday, two House Republicans signed a Democratic letter requesting the release of the president\u2019s tax returns, becoming the only Republicans to do so.During the first six weeks of the Trump administration, Republicans have supported the president with a watch-what-he-does, not-what-he-says approach. It has largely been a policy of muted assent.\u201cI think we\u2019re going at it from all angles, hoping that whether it\u2019s the pressure or wanting to do the right thing,\u201d Republicans will join them, said Representative Eric Swalwell of California, one of the two Democrats who introduced the bill.Democrats say the tax returns provide a nexus between concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s personal financial conflicts of interest and his campaign\u2019s ties to the Russian government, issues that have troubled members of the president\u2019s own party.\u201cI\u2019m for transparency,\u201d Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, told a few hundred people in a high school cafeteria in Denham Springs, La., on a recent afternoon, stopping well short of a call for legislation.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has led the chamber\u2019s efforts to disclose Mr. Trump\u2019s returns, a push he said was driven by constituent outrage. \u201cPeople just kind of gasp,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cI can tell you it comes up at every one of my town meetings. People think it is very much linked to the Russia issue.\u201dIn the House, Democrats have pressed the issue on several, so far fruitless fronts. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr. of New Jersey, who wrote the letter that has drawn two Republican signatures, introduced a measure that would compel the House Committee on Ways and Means to request Mr. Trump\u2019s tax documents, as it is empowered to do.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has resisted calls to, as he described it to reporters, \u201crummage around in the tax returns of the president.\u201dA few Republicans have broken from their party on investigating connections between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. Representative Darrell Issa of California, who narrowly won re-election in November and is considered vulnerable in 2018, recently called for an outside investigation. The House and Senate intelligence committees will conduct their own inquiries.Representative Walter B. Jones of North Carolina \u2014 who, with Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, signed Mr. Pascrell\u2019s letter and voted \u201cpresent\u201d on his measure \u2014 said he wanted to send a message to Republican leaders that he intended to keep \u201can open mind.\u201dMr. Jones is also the sole Republican co-sponsor on Mr. Swalwell\u2019s independent commission bill, calling Russian interference in the election \u201cserious business.\u201d (\u201cHere you go again, Walter,\u201d he recalled a couple of Republican colleagues saying to him.)\u201cIf they would not let the politics drive their thinking and let the needs of the American people drive their thinking, then I think some of them would join this effort,\u201d he said.With control of what legislation comes to the floor in both the House and Senate, Republican leaders have easily fended off Democrats. A House measure seeking more information on Mr. Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest and his ties to Russia was sent to the Judiciary Committee, where it was rejected along party lines last week.The vote came at the end of the committee\u2019s meeting, hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress, when many lawmakers were having dinner. When the live stream on the committee\u2019s website temporarily failed, Democrats streamed the meeting on their Facebook pages, a low-yield guerrilla-style tactic.While Democrats argue that they are giving voice to concerns about the Trump administration, pressuring rivals to cast votes on a contentious subject is a standard political strategy.Democrats are hoping to use the Republican votes against forcing disclosure of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, and on other issues, in the 2018 midterm elections.\u201cNow he is the president, he is their standard-bearer,\u201d said Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats. \u201cThey\u2019ll have real votes on his agenda, from helping him hide his tax returns to helping him hide his connections to Russia.\u201dBut Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the House Republicans\u2019 campaign organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee, said their incumbents had established themselves with their voters, who care more about economic issues than whether a particular lawmaker pushed to see Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns.\u201cVoters won\u2019t be swayed by these legislative tactics,\u201d Mr. Gorman said. \u201cThey\u2019re stunts.\u201dMr. Jones said he saw the efforts to answer lingering questions about the election as a \u201cservice\u201d to the Trump administration, as well. \u201cWe are an equal branch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an obligation to the American people, just like the president has. And to me, I think the sooner we start dealing with this situation, the better off we are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We seem to like these places, and so do social media companies \u2014 they keep us clicking from one self-affirmation to another. But now our bubbles are being blamed for leading us toward the most divisive presidency in recent memory, and suddenly, the bubble doesn\u2019t feel so inviting anymore. So media and tech companies are pivoting, selling us a whole suite of offerings aimed at bursting the bubbles they helped to create.It will be more difficult to entice Trump supporters to consider alternative perspectives, and not just because the president himself has declared the mainstream media the \u201copposition party.\u201d As members of the winning team, Trump supporters have no urgent need to understand the other side. Besides, it\u2019s not too hard to find left-of-center perspectives in the news media.

Whether those sentiments make their way into every feed remains to be seen \u2014 after all, Facebook became an internet superpower by serving up easy, compulsively clickable content.

{"Headline": "In New York, Bringing Broadband to Everyone by 2018", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byHALCOTT, N.Y. \u2014 It\u2019s about 15 miles from here to a dairy testing facility in Roxbury, or about one hour and 20 minutes round trip if you know these dusty mountain back roads like Chris DiBenedetto, a dairy farmer. He has been going back and forth for years, ferrying a sample of fresh milk for a federally mandated drug test before he can start processing each batch.But what stressed him the most were the valuable daylight farming hours lost to the journey, while he was stuck in his car or waiting for the results.Now, Mr. DiBenedetto gives a sample to a driver heading that way to do the drop-off, letting the new fiber wiring hanging over his old route do the simple document delivery for him via email.The dairy farmer in this speck of a town about 140 miles north of New York City was one of the first beneficiaries of an ambitious initiative to extend broadband to every household in the state by 2018 \u2014 no matter how rural or far-flung the address \u2014 which would make New York the first state to reach that high-speed internet milestone.For years, this town was like many isolated spots in New York and across the country, left sitting on the shoulders of the digital highway unable to access the broadband speeds that so many businesses and households count on. But now under a state-led program, towns like Halcott, with fewer than 300 residents, are getting wired, giving residents faster access to the internet and opening new opportunities for businesses.Two Stones Farm, a small goat farm here, has created an online store to offer more products, including artisanal cheese. \u201cI look at it this way: It\u2019s very much like electricity was at one time,\u201d said Alan White, 54, who owns Two Stones Farm with his wife. \u201cElectricity would have never come to our valley if it was based strictly on population. It\u2019s not a luxury. It\u2019s a necessity that we need to operate.\u201dThe problem is worse in poorer and rural areas: At least 30 percent of people in Mississippi and Arkansas do not have access to broadband, and sparsely populated states like Montana have similar access rates.The challenge in the United States is that it has vast tracts of sparsely populated regions where the cost of laying new fiber and cable wiring for broadband significantly outweighs the profits \u2014 39 percent of Americans living in rural areas lack broadband access, compared with 4 percent of those living in cities, according to the F.C.C.Under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s \u201cBroadband for All\u201d initiative, New York\u2019s program is one of the most aggressive broadband expansions in the country, and is designed to help stem any losses a private company incurs through what is known as a reverse auction process.Using data from the Federal Communications Commission to identify both unserved and underserved areas, the program divides the state into census blocks. The state then auctions off grant money for each census block, awarding the financing to the private company that seeks the lowest state subsidy.The system has attracted different providers, including major telecommunication companies like Fairpoint and Frontier, as well as smaller utilities like Middleburgh Telephone Company, known as Midtel, and Margaretville Telephone Company.Along the two-lane roads winding through Delaware County in the Catskills, Midtel trucks are following a path similar to one they took years ago, threading fiber optic cables for broadband across the valley.\u201cAll the served, underserved and unserved areas don\u2019t end up in a nice row,\u201d said Jim Becker, the president of the company, which has existed for more than a century and is still overseen by his 94-year-old grandmother, Marge Becker. \u201cSometimes you have to build through somewhat of a served area to get to an unserved, and vice versa.\u201dTurning on broadband can transform lives in rural places.Here in Halcott, a hamlet in the Catskills, the broadband has allowed Mr. DiBenedetto to broaden his business online \u2014 a yogurt company in Brooklyn recently contacted him about a single source contract. His daughter, Elena, was able to help out on the farm while getting a master\u2019s degree online.\u201cIn today\u2019s technology-driven world, access to high-speed internet is essential to building strong communities, growing the economy and supporting our everyday lives,\u201d Governor Cuomo said. \u201cNew York is leading the nation with the largest state broadband investment program in history \u2014 ensuring high-speed internet access for all residents, especially those in rural areas, and empowering students, entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive in our global economy.\u201dUnder New York\u2019s program, providers must offer 100 mbps speed \u2014 fast enough to download a movie in high definition in 90 seconds \u2014 for $60 a month. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the F.C.C., acknowledging that it was a reasonable price given that prices elsewhere could be much higher. \u201cBut if you\u2019re really poor, can you afford it? I don\u2019t know. If you are a poor rural person living in Appalachia, that\u2019s a big bite out of your budget.\u201dBut many rural businesses in New York have jumped at the chance for faster internet.About an hour from Halcott lies the Beaverkill Valley Inn, a historic hotel sitting on the banks of the Beaver Kill river, a world-famous fly-fishing spot in Lew Beach, N.Y. There\u2019s no cellphone service, so for years the inn and its guests shared a satellite internet connection.\u201cWe were competing with our guests\u2019 need and our own need to do business,\u201d said Kathy Bryant, one of the inn\u2019s managers. She noted that despite a sprawling property well suited for corporate retreats and meetings, the inn was unable to attract such business because of its limited internet.After years of pleading with local officials and telecommunications providers for a broadband connection, the inn was connected to high-speed internet by the Margaretville Telephone Company last August. Today, flush with retreats, weddings and guests spending an extra day or so \u201cworking from home,\u201d the inn just had the most successful year in its 120-year history.\u201cNow, we just reassure them that they can still unplug while they\u2019re up here,\u201d Ms. Bryant said with a laugh.Advertisement"}

Ms. Conway is loathed by many Clinton aides as the architect of a presidential campaign that they felt used overtly and implicitly sexist messages. Mr. Trump repeatedly denigrated women for their appearance and, after taking office, directed his female staff members to \u201cdress like women.\u201d\u201cI think some of the reticence that might be coming across in not a huge chorus of defense of Kellyanne Conway in the face of these sexist comments is the feeling that she doesn\u2019t have our back,\u201d said Gillian Thomas, a senior staff lawyer of the Women\u2019s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d Ms. Thomas continued. \u201cIf women were more united and speaking up at this behavior, including when it\u2019s perpetrated by the left, we\u2019d all be a lot better off.\u201d\u201cLadies & Gents, I disagree with her as much as anyone,\u201d wrote someone identified as Melissa Mae. \u201cIt would be nice to see comments sticking to valid points instead of ALWAYS going after women on the basis of \u2018looks.\u2019\u201dMirya R.

And its prominence after the election drew attention to the proliferation of false and misleading news, much of it politically charged, that circulated on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\u201cTo my knowledge today, neither Mr. Alefantis, nor his restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking, as was part of the theories about Pizzagate that were being written about in many media outlets and which we commented upon,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cWe apologize to the extent our commentaries could be construed as negative statements about Mr. Alefantis or Comet Ping Pong, and we hope that anyone else involved in commenting on Pizzagate will do the same thing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster of emotion and fear,\u201d Mr. Alefantis said, in a telephone interview on Saturday, noting that he was still receiving daily threats online. \u201cGood days and bad days.\u201dMr. Alefantis said his restaurant has spent nearly $70,000 on two guards to stand at the entrance during business hours. A neighbor who runs a security company helped install an alarm system and a network of cameras \u2014 both inside and outside the restaurant \u2014 as well as panic buttons to alert the local police.Last weekend, about 10 Pizzagate theory adherents held a protest in front of the restaurant. Mr. Alefantis said no one but Mr. Jones has ever apologized to him.\u201cHonestly I wouldn\u2019t wish this on anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThese lies and falsehoods spread about me and my restaurant exist all over the place. The damage that has been done to my company and business and my community, all will remain forever.\u201dStill, Mr. Alefantis said, the community has been rallying around his restaurant. Only one of his more than 40 employees decided to leave after the shooting incident in December. And he said he hoped things would continue to return to normal.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to go back to our world of making food and serving our customers and being a happy place,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Case Could Be a Watershed for Women in Tech", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtStill, the Uber scandal feels different. It feels like a watershed. For gender-diversity advocates in the tech industry, Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations, and the public outcry they have ignited, offer a possibility that something new may be in the offing.What could happen? Something innovative: This could be the start of a deep, long-term and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women \u2014 not just at Uber but across the tech business, too.But precisely for those reasons, Ms. Kapor Klein argued that if Uber mounted an honest investigation into its culture and pledged to transparently remake what ails it, it could become a model for the industry.\u201cThey did ask me, \u2018Has anyone gotten it right in tech?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said not yet. And that means an opportunity for Uber.\u201dUnlike many aggressive start-ups that have come before it \u2014 Amazon and Facebook, for instance, were no pushovers \u2014 Uber is not a natural monopoly. It sells a service that has ready substitutes, and it has well-funded competitors in many of its major markets. Its rivals have put their supposedly friendlier brands at the center of their competitive strategy. They are all waiting for Uber to fail, and every time Uber finds a way to lower its reputation even further, competitors can peel off customers, drivers and engineers.Finally, there\u2019s the Trump factor. Ever since the presidential election, people in the tech industry have been amped up. Employees and customers have learned to take up arms against companies that don\u2019t espouse their values, and companies have started to listen.\u201cLeft-leaning Silicon Valley has been embracing the Women\u2019s March and had this heightened awareness about issues that women face due to misogynistic men,\u201d said Karen Catlin, a former software engineer who is now an advocate for women in the tech industry. Now the same social-media energy aimed at President Trump is being marshaled against Uber, better known on Twitter as #deleteUber.Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, and others at the company appear to understand the gravity of the threat. The company moved swiftly to open an investigation into Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations. Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur who sits on Uber\u2019s board, were among those it appointed to find out what\u2019s going wrong at the company.All of this could be for show. To a lot of people, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s word no longer carries much weight. But you don\u2019t have to just trust him. If Uber is serious about remaking its culture, we can watch for concrete action.Ms. Kapor Klein is looking for several steps. She wants Mr. Holder\u2019s report to detail for the public everything he\u2019s found at the company. She wants to see new policies for how Uber hires people, ones that put more weight on the diversity of its work force. She wants the company to offer more formal and informal ways for employees to report problems to management, including allowing them to do so anonymously in order to avoid retribution. She also wants Uber to offer more training for employees, and better workplace surveys to get a sense of what\u2019s going wrong.Finally, Ms. Kapor Klein said, she would be scrutinizing Mr. Kalanick\u2019s own actions.\u201cYou need unequivocal commitment from the top,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone does something abhorrent, do you fire your best performer? That is the litmus test.\u201dAn Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the outcome of Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation, which is just beginning, but said that all of Ms. Kapor Klein\u2019s recommendations were on the table.Whatever Uber does in the next few weeks will only be a start. People who fight for diversity in the tech industry point out it is a hard problem to solve; it could take years of careful and publicly embarrassing actions for Uber and other companies to become more hospitable to women.\u201cThis stuff is deeply entrenched,\u201d Ms. Kapor Klein said, relaying a story she had recently heard about a group of programmers at a different tech company. \u201cI heard about this engineer who said that what he and his friends do at work for fun is rate women job applicants according to who they wanted to marry, or who they wanted to kill, and there was a third thing.\u201d Suffice it to say the third thing was not the women\u2019s qualifications for the job in question.\u201cThat just goes to show you the backdrop we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d she said. \u201cFixing this will be a marathon, not a sprint.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Renting Your Home Out, By the Hour", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported by360 ViewFor New Yorkers who want to make money off their apartments, but are reluctant to skip town to do it, these companies offer a viable alternative to vacation rentals. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wash your bedsheets, you don\u2019t have to find another place to sleep,\u201d said Yashar Nejati, 31, the founder of Thisopenspace, a company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that opened in New York last year. \u201cYou can rent out your space while you go run errands.\u201dSplacer, which started in Tel Aviv, has attracted 700 New York City listings since it entered the marketplace in 2014. A third of the spaces are residential, and the rest are commercial, like restaurants, galleries and warehouses. Peerspace, a San Francisco-based company, arrived in New York in November 2015 and now has 600 listings in this market, about 150 of which are residential. And about a third of Thisopenspace\u2019s 300 listings in the city are residential.The sites operate much like Airbnb. Hosts list their property online, uploading photographs, a description of the space and the rental price. All three companies charge hosts a commission. Peerspace and Thisopenspace charge the guests a fee, too. These companies are tapping into a trend that has become a hallmark of the so-called sharing economy: With a clever app and a smartphone, everyday objects in our lives can become viable revenue streams.\u201cYour apartment is standing vacant 14 hours a day,\u201d said Adi Biran, 45, who started Splacer in 2014 with Lihi Gerstner, 41. \u201cWhy not use it?\u201dUltimately, the debate about the merits of short-term rentals is not really about legal statutes, but about how people want their apartments, buildings and neighborhoods used. While supporters see short-term rentals as a relatively painless way to help pay the rent in an expensive city, critics argue that the trend turns homes into hotels. People who live next door to an apartment that is used for short-term rentals often complain about a rotating cast of endless guests diminishing their quality of life.So, as far as the neighbors are concerned, is a site like Peerspace really all that different from Airbnb? If your neighbor turns her living room into a venue for corporate retreats, the guests may leave at nightfall, but the vibe is still altered. \u201cIt used to be that you had a group of people, and this was going to be their homes, and they had a common interest in preserving it,\u201d Ms. Weisberg said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s gone.\u201dNot all parties go as planned. About a year ago, Ms. Story walked in the door of her townhouse at midnight to find that a party that was supposed to end at 10 p.m. was still going strong. Added to that, about 70 people were in her home, well over the 30-guest limit. \u201cI was like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Ms. Story recalled. \u201cThey were supposed to be in the cleanup phase. The guy gave me an attitude.\u201d The bathroom was flooded. Ms. Story insisted that the group pay for a maid service.All three companies provide liability insurance, and hosts can request that their guests leave a security deposit. While many hosts have renters or homeowners insurance, a residential policy may not cover damage from a commercial use. Corporate guests generally have insurance, too.She lists the space, with a hammock and a rope swing hanging in the living room, on all three sites for around $100 an hour. As for the potential for mishaps, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that you have to take when you do this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "If Everything Can Be \u2018Weaponized,\u2019 What Should We Fear?", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsPolitics is something like an art, if you ask those who practice it, and it\u2019s something like a science, if you ask those who study it. But to the journalists who cover it, it has always been something like something else: a sport. Writing in 1968, Milton Rokeach, the social psychologist, articulated what would become a perennial complaint. \u201cThe kinds of data obtained by public-opinion research and disseminated in the mass media seem designed more to entertain than to inform,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe quality of the information conveyed seems not much different from that conveyed in the sports pages or, better yet, the daily racing form.\u201d The press, especially during election years, frequently failed to exercise \u201cjournalistic conscience\u201d; it had internalized a \u201cracehorse philosophy.\u201dNearly half a century later, Rokeach\u2019s assessment still echoes in our gripes about political news. His chosen metaphor, however, has been beaten to death. Coverage is now turning away from a language of sports and toward a language of war. The horse race has given way to an arms race, in which everything, and everyone, have the potential to be \u201cweaponized.\u201d\u201cWeaponization\u201d works as a throwing up of the hands, and as a suggestion \u2014 or an admission, or a strategic claim \u2014 that the discourse has failed us. Or, more accurately, it suggests that the discourse has become something dangerous: no mere fight but a terminal conflict without decorum or limits. The language of sports had a maddening tendency to flatten and trivialize the serious consequences of politics, creating constant suspense but obscuring life-or-death stakes. Militarized language moves in a different direction: It intensifies the news it\u2019s describing while simultaneously obscuring actual threats. \u201cWeaponization\u201d is used to describe both rhetoric that might incite violence and criticism of violent rhetoric. It is lodged against the state, with its legal monopoly on violence, but also, incoherently, against those who challenge the state. It is a shortcut to false equivalence, and it manufactures excuses for those with a vested interest in drawing blood themselves.As a metaphor, \u201cweaponization\u201d creates paranoia and the impression that nothing is immune from conscription. Suddenly tools for violence are hiding everywhere, waiting to be brandished by your enemies, taken up for self-defense or fatally mishandled by the blind or na\u00efve. The fabric of civilian life is now wrapped in a linguistic fog of war.Its first documented appearance in front of a wide audience came in 1957, in an Associated Press interview with Wernher von Braun, the former Nazi engineer who would become an integral figure in the American space program. Von Braun explained to the unnamed reporter that his work had been to \u201cweaponize\u201d the military\u2019s ballistic-missile technology. Army rocketry was, of course, always destined for war, so von Braun\u2019s use of the word suggested the fulfillment of a plan, more than a conversion. Over the decades that followed, \u201cweaponization\u201d proliferated alongside nuclear warheads, describing their constantly multiplying delivery systems, and lingered through the late stages of the Cold War. But it has periodically re-entered the lexicon to address fresh fears: anxiety about new infectious diseases being put to sinister ends; weapons of mass destruction, during the run-up to the first and second American wars in Iraq; and of course, 21st-century terror attacks, in which horrifying and surprising things \u2014 passenger planes, trucks \u2014 were converted into instruments of slaughter.Recently, as the word has crept into civilian life to describe an anxiety about the future, it has brought uncanny echoes of history along with it. In that 1957 interview, von Braun used the word in response to a question about the Soviet Union\u2019s technological advantages. Today it is Russia that is described \u2014 by American intelligence figures \u2014 as leading the way in a very different form of cutting-edge weaponization: of hackers, leaks, data dumps, social media and information in general, all aided by the machinery of the internet. This rhetorical conversion of the entire internet into a field of battle dovetails neatly with our deepening fears about technology and privacy. The notion that a state could weaponize social media for political ends is easy to understand in the familiar terms of online harassment, which turns seemingly inert platforms like Twitter or Facebook into tools for invading privacy and inflicting fear. Similarly, a nation using malware to interfere with a rival power\u2019s missile launches resembles, more than superficially, a hacker\u2019s plot to conscript your wireless baby monitor into a malicious botnet, and worries about pervasive state surveillance bring to mind our ambivalent relationships with the online services to which we hand over our most personal information. Both lines of thinking look at our technological, social and political acceleration with an extreme but appealingly simple pessimism: Whatever this is, it ends badly.But even as a metaphor, far away from missiles and drones and nerve agents, weaponization is disorienting. That social media can be described within a single year as having been \u201cweaponized\u201d by Barack Obama and by ISIS, by and against Hillary Clinton, by governments and by brands, by Donald Trump and by the protesters challenging him, by bots and marketers and malicious trolls targeting other users with explicitly violent threats \u2014 all of this is a testament to how \u201cweaponization\u201d scrambles power in ways that tend to favor the actually violent. It places weapons in the hands of everyone around them, annexing their targets into a war zone where anything is permissible.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Michael D. Shear, a White House correspondent for The Times, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As a White House reporter, you must be bombarded with news about the Trump administration. What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat?Now, no matter where I am \u2014 at my desk, at a restaurant, or in a van waiting for POTUS to play a round of golf \u2014 I have access to cable news reports and live streams from the White House.What do you like about the setup, and what could be better about it?I like the fact that Sling TV works just about everywhere. There are apps for my iPhone 7 and my iPad Air, as well as my MacBook Pro and the Apple TVs and Rokus I have at home.The apps load quickly and even work behind the firewall at work.I do have a few gripes. For now, you can\u2019t pause most shows on Sling TV, and there\u2019s no recording of shows. (The company has a DVR beta in the works, but I haven't been able to get in.) And there are often hiccups. The audio and video are often, frustratingly, out of sync, especially for MSNBC and NBC. And there are times that the channels say \u201cunavailable\u201d for a few seconds, or a few minutes, with no explanation. Also, because of licensing issues, I can get NBC and Fox, but not ABC or CBS.As a political reporter, how do you keep messages, contacts and phone calls secure from surveillance?I\u2019ve always been pretty careful about electronic security. I have two-factor authentication turned on for all of my accounts \u2014 email, iCloud, etc. And I\u2019m as careful as I can be to avoid being trapped by a phishing scam. I rarely click on any link from an email, and I\u2019m pretty aggressive about sending emails that I don't recognize to spam.How do you keep on top of President Trump\u2019s Twitter?Having covered the White House since the beginning of 2009, I\u2019m definitely having to adjust to a new rhythm. I have about a dozen Twitter accounts set to alert me to every tweet, including the @POTUS and @RealDonaldTrump accounts, as well as the president\u2019s senior staff like @Presssec (Sean Spicer), @KellyannePolls and others. I had to adjust my Do Not Disturb settings on my iPhone so that notifications resume earlier \u2014 at 5:30 a.m. now. (There are overnight editors who can call me if he tweets between midnight and 5:30 a.m.)I also make extensive use of my Apple Watch to keep tabs on the president\u2019s Twitter habit throughout the day. I generally keep the speaker on mute, but the watch\u2019s haptic engine taps my wrist anytime he or his aides tweet.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?So far, I use it as a timer when I cook. I find it much easier to simply say \u201cHey, Google, set a timer for 30 minutes\u201d than to use the old-fashioned timer on my oven.We also have fun using Google Home for our grocery shopping list. Throughout the week, as we notice things we need at the store, any of us can say, \u201cHey Google, add orange juice to the shopping list.\u201d It\u2019s eerily accurate, even on stranger items. The list is automatically compiled in a Google Keep note that all of us have access to. (I will admit that my 14-year-old daughter is having fun putting weird items on the list to surprise me when I go to the grocery.)What could be better about it?The problem with Google Home \u2014 and the reason it often sits, neglected, on the counter \u2014 is that it just doesn\u2019t do that much. It can\u2019t send emails or text (yet). It can do some limited shopping, but isn\u2019t connected (for obvious competitive reasons) to our Amazon shopping account. It can\u2019t (yet) be used as a convenient speakerphone. The news sources that it accesses are limited (no New York Times headlines read aloud).And there is one, serious limitation that has to be fixed for Google Home to be really useful in a home with more than one person: It needs individual profiles. It has a nice feature that reads out the appointments for your day, but it links to only one calendar. That means only one of us can use the feature.The internet is flooded with fake news. What\u2019s your advice for readers for distinguishing good information from bad information?First, read The New York Times.But more broadly, I guess my advice would be to constantly crosscheck what you see and hear on the internet. If you read a fantastic-sounding allegation in a Facebook post or a tweet, or on a no-name internet site, try to see whether that allegation is also being reported by The Washington Post or Fox News. Go to the fact-checkers at various news organizations. Look around on Twitter to see whether the allegation has been debunked.If it sounds like something is \u201ctoo good to check,\u201d it probably means it\u2019s not real. But check it anyway!Advertisement"}

The disaffected Jason, who never moved out of his parents\u2019 house, was one kind of loner, while Ginnifer is another \u2014 the dutiful daughter who valued family enough to nurse her ailing mother and now has no husband or children of her own. Which would be fine if Ginnifer were O.K. with it, but she\u2019s not.Directed by Jonathan Silverstein, this is a cold production, and maybe that\u2019s intentional; Ginnifer is certainly apart from us up there. Ms. Baron wrote the piece with projections (designed here by Justin West) in mind, but I kept wondering how much more sense Ginnifer\u2019s meandering confidences might make if we were huddled close in a more intimate room. Seemingly foiled by the remove, Ms. Reeder races through the text.\u201cWhen It\u2019s You\u201d is partly about cultural guilt by association.

{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s RT Network: Is It More BBC or K.G.B.?", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The London newsroom and studios of RT, the television channel and website formerly known as Russia Today, are ultramodern and spacious, with spectacular views from the 16th floor overlooking the Thames and the London Eye. And, its London bureau chief, Nikolay A. Bogachikhin, jokes, \u201cWe overlook MI5 and we\u2019re near MI6,\u201d Britain\u2019s domestic and foreign intelligence agencies.Mr. Bogachikhin was poking fun at the charge from Western governments, American and European, that RT is an agent of Kremlin policy and a tool directly used by President Vladimir V. Putin to undermine Western democracies \u2014 meddling in the recent American presidential election and, European security officials say, trying to do the same in the Netherlands, France and Germany, all of which vote later this year.But the West is not laughing. Even as Russia insists that RT is just another global network like the BBC or France 24, albeit one offering \u201calternative views\u201d to the Western-dominated news media, many Western countries regard RT as the slickly produced heart of a broad, often covert disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about democratic institutions and destabilize the West.Watching RT can be a dizzying experience. Hard news and top-notch graphics mix with interviews from all sorts of people: well known and obscure, left and right. They include favorites like Julian Assange of WikiLeaks and Noam Chomsky, the liberal critic of Western policies; odd voices like the actress Pamela Anderson; and cranks who think Washington is the source of all evil in the world.But if there is any unifying character to RT, it is a deep skepticism of Western and American narratives of the world and a fundamental defensiveness about Russia and Mr. Putin.Analysts are sharply divided about the influence of RT. Pointing to its minuscule ratings numbers, many caution against overstating its impact. Yet focusing on ratings may miss the point, says Peter Pomerantsev, who wrote a book three years ago that described Russia\u2019s use of television for propaganda. \u201cRatings aren\u2019t the main thing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are campaigns for financial, political and media influence.\u201dRT and Sputnik propel those campaigns by helping create the fodder for thousands of fake news propagators and providing another outlet for hacked material that can serve Russian interests, said Ben Nimmo, who studies RT for the Atlantic Council.Whatever its impact, RT is unquestionably a case study in the complexity of modern propaganda. It is both a slick modern television network, dressed up with great visuals and stylish presenters, and a content farm that helps feed the European far right. Viewers find it difficult to discern exactly what is journalism and what is propaganda, what may be \u201cfake news\u201d and what is real but presented with a strong slant.A recent evening featured reports of Britain refusing to condemn human rights violations in Bahrain and a \u201cmainstream media firestorm\u201d over Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s chats with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Other reports included the \u201cliberation\u201d of Palmyra by the Syrian Army with \u201cthe support of the Russian Air Force;\u201d an interview with former British ambassador to Syria and a United States critic, Peter Ford; and a report about a London professor decrying the fall in British living standards.Mr. Bogachikhin and Anna Belkina, RT\u2019s head of communications in Moscow, insist it is absurd to lump together RT\u2019s effort to provide \u201calternative views to the mainstream media\u201d with the phenomena of fake news and social media propaganda.\u201cThere\u2019s an hysteria about RT,\u201d Ms. Belkina said. \u201cRT becomes a shorthand for everything.\u201dFor example, she says, while RT was featured heavily in the American intelligence report, it was largely in a seven-page annex (of a 13-page report) that was written more than four years ago, in December 2012, a fact revealed only in a footnote on Page 6.She flatly denies any suggestion that RT seeks to meddle in democratic elections anywhere. \u201cThe kind of scrutiny we\u2019re under \u2014 we check everything.\u201dFor RT and its viewers, the outlet is a refreshing alternative to what they see as complacent Western elitism and neo-liberalism, representing what the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov recently called a \u201cpost-West world order.\u201dWith its slogan, created by a Western ad agency, of \u201cQuestion More,\u201d RT is trying to fill a niche, Ms. Belkina said. \u201cWe want to complete the picture rather than add to the echo chamber of mainstream news; that\u2019s how we find an audience.\u201dNearly all the mainstream media came out against Mr. Trump during the campaign and much of the news coverage about him was negative, she said.\u201cThis is why we exist,\u201d Ms. Belkina said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to watch RT to hear alternative voices. You might not agree with them, but it\u2019s important to try to understand where they\u2019re coming from and why.\u201dA French legislator, Nicolas Dhuicq, who has appeared on RT and went to Russian-annexed Crimea in 2015 as part of a delegation of French legislators, said that RT\u2019s aim was \u201cto make the voice of Russia heard, to make the Russian point of view on the world heard.\u201dStill, Mr. Dhuicq said, \u201cthe impact of RT, in my opinion, is very low.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is enormous paranoia when we imagine that RT will change the face of the world, influence national or other elections.\u201dAfshin Rattansi, who hosts a talk show three times a week called \u201cGoing Underground,\u201d came to RT in 2013 after working at the BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera and Iran\u2019s Press TV. \u201cUnlike at the BBC and CNN, I was never told what to say at RT,\u201d he said. There have been two cases of RT announcers quitting because of what they said was pressure to toe a Kremlin line, especially on Ukraine, but not in London, Mr. Rattansi said.Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who was the United States ambassador to Russia during the Obama years, said that RT should not be lightly dismissed. \u201cThere is a demand in certain countries for this alternative view, an appetite, and we arrogant Americans shouldn\u2019t just think that no one cares.\u201dBut there is a considerably darker view, too. For critics, RT and Sputnik are simply tools of a sophisticated Russian propaganda machine, created by the Kremlin to push its foreign policy, defend its aggression in Ukraine and undermine confidence in democracy, NATO and the world as we have known it.Robert Pszczel, who ran NATO\u2019s information office in Moscow and watches Russia and the western Balkans for NATO, said that RT and Sputnik were not meant for domestic consumption, unlike the BBC or CNN. Over time, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s more about hard power and disinformation.\u201dThe Kremlin doesn\u2019t care \u201cif you agree with Russian policy or think Putin is wonderful, so long as it does the job \u2014 you start having doubts, and of 10 outrageous points you take on one or two,\u201d he said. \u201cA bit of mud will always stick.\u201dProbably more important than RT, Mr. Pszczel said, are Sputnik and local language outlets sponsored by Russia, like the Slovak magazine \u201cZem a Vek,\u201d known for its conspiracy theories. Sputnik is the largest source of raw news in the Balkans, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a free product in local languages.\u201d And \u201cthen they set up some friendly association, at some small university, which holds seminars, and then a number of strange websites start promoting the product, like an industrial marketing operation.\u201dBut RT is also helpful in another traditional Moscow effort: making friends with useful people, and not just Mr. Assange, Mr. Pomerantsev said. \u201cRT made Mike Flynn feel good after losing his job\u201d as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he said, paying him a reported $40,000 to come to RT\u2019s anniversary celebration in Moscow and sit near Mr. Putin. And Mr. Flynn, for a time, was national security adviser of the United States.Mr. Nimmo of the Atlantic Council noted RT\u2019s small reach in Germany, where Angela Merkel, a Putin critic, is facing a tough re-election fight, and where there are up to 3.5 million Russian speakers. \u201cI strongly suspect that RT Deutsch has a trivial effect compared to Russian-speaking Germans watching Russian television,\u201d he said.Stefan Meister, who studies Russia and Central Europe for the German Council on Foreign Relations, agreed that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t overestimate RT. The main success of the Russians is the link to social media through bots and a network of different sources.\u201d That network, he said, is \u201cincreasingly well organized, with more strategic and explicit links between sources and actors \u2014 Russian domestic media, troll factories, RT, people in social networks and maybe also the security services.\u201d\u201cOpen societies are very vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Meister said, \u201cand it\u2019s cheaper than buying a new rocket.\u201dRT is part of the reality of the 21st century, Mr. Pomerantsev said. \u201cEveryone will do it soon. It\u2019s the world we have to live in.\u201d Hacks and leaks are much more disruptive, he said. \u201cIf you can take out the electrical grid in Ukraine, that\u2019s scary. It\u2019s hard to get too scared about Larry King on RT.\u201dMr. Pomerantsev agrees with Ms. Belkina that RT is not inventing popular mistrust about Western democracy. \u201cThe Russians are about sowing mistrust about institutions that is there already, feeding it,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we make our institutions more trustworthy?\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Crossing the Border? Here\u2019s How to Safeguard Your Data From Searches", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byTech FixTravelers, beware: When you take your gadgets abroad, maintaining the security of the data on your devices is just as important as protecting yourself from muggers.For whatever reason, foreign and domestic governments may have an interest in your personal data, including your social media accounts.Legally, citizens are not required to unlock their cellphones or share their passwords with United States government officials. But rules may vary depending on where you are traveling to and from. And any stopping by a government official can be inconvenient, and even intimidating.What to do? There\u2019s one thing all the experts agree on: Do not lie to government officials about your passwords or social media accounts.\u201cThey\u2019d make your life miserable if they found that out,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company.But there are methods for safeguarding your cellphones, tablets and computers from invasive searches, all while remaining honest. Here are some of the best tips, based on interviews with security and forensics specialists.The best way to prevent your information from being searched is to travel with a device that never had any of your data in the first place.It\u2019s a wise idea to invest in a so-called travel device, a cheap smartphone or computer that you use only abroad: You don\u2019t want your nice equipment to get lost or stolen while traveling, anyway, let alone searched by border agents. So leave your fancy equipment \u2014 along with your photo album, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter apps \u2014 at home.That\u2019s because in the United States, law enforcement agencies have successfully used warrants to compel people to unlock their cellphones with a fingerprint. But because of your right to remain silent, it would be tough (though not impossible) for the federal government to force you to share your passcode. So disabling your fingerprint sensor when traveling is generally a safer move.The best way to protect your passwords is to not know them. When resisting a data frisk, it is easier to say you didn\u2019t memorize your password as opposed to refusing to provide it to border agents, Mr. Grossman said.\u201cIf you don\u2019t know them it\u2019s hard to compel you to give them over if you don\u2019t know how,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somebody put a gun to my head, I don\u2019t know it.\u201dHowever, Mr. Grossman said you are better off traveling without your password management software loaded on your devices so that you won\u2019t be asked to hand over the master password to your vault. You could store a copy of the password vault on a cloud service like Dropbox and get access to your vault of passwords when you reach your travel destination, he said.An alternative to using a password-managing app is to write your passwords down and leave them with someone you trust. After getting through customs, contact that person and ask him or her to read off your passwords.In the unlikely event that you are asked to provide a password to your email or social media account, having two-step verification enabled will act as an extra safeguard \u2014 assuming that you left your primary cellphone at home.With two-step verification turned on, whenever you enter your password, you will receive a text message with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in. Because the message containing the code would be sent to your phone at home, a customs agent wouldn\u2019t be able to log in to your account even if you gave up your password.Of course, two-step verification could make logging in to your accounts difficult for yourself if you left your primary cellphone at home. You could always leave your phone with someone you trust and contact them to ask for codes when you are trying to log in. However, it would generally be wiser to stay off your social media accounts while traveling to avoid leaving any traces of data on a burner device.Whether you are using a burner device or your own, always make sure to lock down the system with encryption, which scrambles your data so it becomes indecipherable without the right key.Desktop apps like BitLocker or Apple\u2019s FileVault let you encrypt your hard drive, requiring a passphrase to decrypt your files. To avoid surrendering this passphrase, you could jot it down and hand it to a friend and contact that person for the passphrase after crossing the border.When you\u2019re traveling, at minimum you will need access to your address book and calendar, and you may also want to take some photos. But this is all sensitive information that border patrol agents could get their hands on.Your best option is to back up your data to a cloud service and then wipe, or erase, all the data from your device before arriving at the border, Mr. Zdziarski said. After passing through customs, you could then restore your information from the online backup.Advertisement"}

They force me to dig under the cushions a bit, dig into the cracks and into the margins to find my own reality.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat impulse took Mr. van Agtmael, in trips around the country from 2009 to 2016, to places \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and post-Katrina New Orleans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where the discrepancies between America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated values and its policies are often devastatingly apparent. The result is a portrait of a people living in the brutal shadow of racism, killings and economic inequity.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the one hand, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m searching for subjects that are emblematic or symbolic, but when I arrive in those situations, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what will be revealed through the photographs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the mystery of photography, in a way. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also what I love about photography.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. van Agtmael admits that his worldview is characterized by a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep wariness of humanity\u00e2\u0080\u009d rooted in early brushes with juvenile cruelty. His skepticism, as a result, colors even the most outwardly joyful facets of American leisure, including the Kentucky Derby and the Fourth of July. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have enough artificial narratives that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re exposed to all the time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a particular desire to contribute to the fantasy world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why for a colorful photo of a balloon dart game at CityFair in Portland, Ore., Mr. van Agtmael wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe attraction is of course fixed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in fact, it is known as one of the most persistently rigged games at a fair.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. van Agtmael grew up, like many boys, avidly collecting model soldiers, airplanes and military vehicles. The obsession didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wane with time, and after studying history at Yale, he wrote, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesire to photograph war became too strong to ignore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He took his first assignment covering Iraq in 2006, and he returned to combat zones in the region for much of the next decade, despite a heavy toll on his psyche.Mr. van Agtmael has since taken a conscious step back from the turbulence. Last year, he said, was the first in a decade in which he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cover a conflict. But the impact of those experiences sometimes comes to the fore in the book, as in a 2016 photo of the Nigerian photographer TY Bello playing with her sons. Arms outstretched, her cloaked figure brought immediately to Mr. van Agtmael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind the iconic image of the tortured Abu Ghraib prisoner Ali Shallal al-Qaisi.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy memories of traumatic experiences come to me less and less, but they are always defined by their sudden invasiveness into otherwise idyllic settings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. van Agtmael wrote.For the majority of Mr. van Agtmael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images, his captions, which are included in a separate booklet, provide historical context or an anecdote about how the image was made. But Mr. van Agtmael occasionally finds that words aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessary, as in the photo of a girl outside a laundromat in Gainesville, Fla. Bathed in golden light, her face points skyward and her eyes are closed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a simple gesture, it seems, of gratitude for the sunshine.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe way I see my role as a photographer and documentarian isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily to reflect too much on beauty for beauty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. van Agtmael said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I do it from time to time, of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

In advertising, in movies, even on smartphones.But there is one problem: Americans are having less sex.From the early 1990s into the early 2000s, Americans generally had sex from about 60 to 65 times a year, according to the study. But after 2002, Americans appeared to lose interest. While the decline has been nearly across the board, one group seems to be pulling everyone else down: married couples.Married couples generally have sex more often than single people, but that advantage is declining. Married couples had sex an average of 56 times a year in 2014, down from 67 in 1989. But more people are staying single \u2014 meaning there is less sex \u2014 and the couples who do walk down the aisle are making fewer trips into the bedroom.The report highlighted several cultural changes in recent years that could have contributed to the decline. Americans have far more options these days for different kinds of pleasure \u2014 like browsing Facebook and social media, playing video games or watching Netflix.Still, there is no clear reason for the decline, but the report did rule out two possibilities: longer hours at work and pornography. Americans work longer days, but a busy work life was actually connected with higher sexual frequency. The consumption of pornography, which is now more accessible than ever before, was also tied with a busier sex life.Despite all the declines, one age group showed no interest in slowing down: people over 70. They had sex nearly 11 times during 2014, up from an average of 9.6 times in 1989.Advertisement"}

As of Friday, the publisher had yet to resume marketing with Google, which takes a percentage from the ads placed on YouTube and the over two million sites in its display network, though it was \u201cvery likely\u201d to reinstate search ads soon, he said.\u201cWe needed to react very, very quickly,\u201d Mr. Nicklin said. \u201cWe knew the next day that our brand, which is fundamentally important to us, was about to be splashed over the Times front page for all the wrong reasons.\u201dAd agencies have seized on this moment to emphasize their value as middlemen between brands and the likes of Google and Facebook, which have become two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies through online ad sales, and to attempt to pressure the internet companies into providing them with more access to closely guarded data and metrics.\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see now is a conversation in the advertising industry, which we\u2019re definitely seeing in the U.K. and have for the last few weeks, around how do we start valuing context and quality, and how do we start factoring that into our decision-making when we start buying media?\u201d he said.He added, \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think YouTube is the only one here that\u2019s got challenges. I think it\u2019s relevant to every single ad tech company that buys inventory at scale that\u2019s very, very targeted at low costs.\u201dTo be sure, publishers are limited in how much they can extricate themselves from technology companies \u2014 even as The Guardian pulled its ads, it still used Google\u2019s AdX ad exchange to select advertisements on its own website. Mr. Nicklin said there was a fine balance between relying on Google as a partner and \u201cusing them as an advertising tool in our own right.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re all reliant on Google in this ecosystem,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But that stuff is for the followers of Adventure B, relying on fact-based journalism from seasoned reporters with deep contacts and established (and, yes, sometimes imperfect) protocols for fact-checking \u2014 all of which the Adventure A people view with deep suspicion that the president is only too happy to stir.As Mr. Stephanopoulos told me when we spoke by phone over the weekend, the trend may have been heading this way for a while \u2014 you don\u2019t need an algorithmic feed to turn on Fox News or to catch Rush Limbaugh. But in the era of the curated digital news stream, the choose-your-news phenomenon has \u201cended up in a whole new place,\u201d Mr. Stephanopoulos said.It\u2019s easy to overdo it, he noted, given that no specially tailored plotline can fully tune out the contradicting details of another one. \u201cFilters do have to contend with each other in some way, too,\u201d he said.Really, arguments between adherents of the different adventure plots are the stuff of cable news programming, with each narrative vying for supremacy in debates that too often become arguments over established facts that should be indisputable.Because, after all, one of the plots we\u2019re talking about here is of the sort that democracy depends on \u2014 that would be Adventure B, the one based on established facts that exist in the real world \u2014 and the others are of the sort that threatens to undermine any shared sense of truth while driving us into our corners.At South by Southwest here, a lot of words have been spilled on what to do about it, and just how urgently this multidimensional view of reality needs to be addressed \u2014 and how to do so.Just watch out for that wall you\u2019re about to walk into IRL (in real life).

Underground, they scurry along the subway tracks. They live rent-free, with a constant supply of food.They\u2019re synonymous with New York.But a quick run to a tasty trash bag could mean a death sentence when the staff of the Rat Reservoir program is on patrol. The goal of the team, which received $2.9 million in 2015 from the city, is to reduce the rat population.How?\u201cIt is not something that is easy or that just one agency can do,\u201d said Caroline Bragdon, director of neighborhood interventions and pest control services for the New York City Department of Health. The team also meets with landlords, tenants and building managers to teach them how to avoid creating the perfect environment for rats, by not leaving garbage out at night and not overwatering outdoor plants.\u201cIf everyone did their part, we could get rid of more rats,\u201d she said.We recently went out with Ms. Bragdon on the Upper East Side to learn how the city searches for rat burrows.First, we looked for signs of rat life. It wasn\u2019t hard to find. As we walked on East 87th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, Ms. Bragdon pointed to black, softball-size holes on the edge of a tree pit, in front of a building on Park Avenue and near freshly planted tulips.\u201cThe rats eat the roots of the plants for water,\u201d Ms. Bragdon said.She stopped at a catch basin and pulled up a white wire tied to the iron grate to show an \u201cold way the city would poison rats.\u201d Exterminators would hang rodenticide on a wire and hope the rats would eat the poison as they climbed up.She knocked against a street curb with her work boot, trying to find hollow points in the sidewalk to identify nests.Then, once a neighborhood is cased, the baiting begins. Exterminators hired by the Rat Reservoir program place a funnel in a burrow opening and drop pellet-shaped poison into the rat nest. A funnel is used to direct the placement of the poison to protect other wildlife from eating the pesticide.As we made our way to East 88th Street and Park Avenue, we walked past a pile of bags filled with trash. The rats on 87th Street would feast another day.Here\u2019s what else is happening:It\u2019s still soggy.Rain showers and thunderstorms could moisten your morning commute. Fog, too.Hair forecast: Roughed-up rodent.But imagine if New York City had no highways, becoming a place where we\u2019d get around on underpasses, overpasses and pedestrian paths, by foot or by bicycle.\u201cThis map inverts those priorities \u2014 putting the pedestrian and the cyclist first \u2014 allowing you to see a fantasy scenario of what it would feel like to walk around New York City or map out your commute if you didn\u2019t have to account for these giant, immovable highways in the way.\u201dBut rest easy, drivers. It\u2019s not so much about getting rid of our highways as it is about exploring what lies beneath.Advertisement"}

There, a year and a half ago, he opened Packsun Halal Chicken with a resolutely American menu of rotisserie and fried chicken and burgers, along with the occasional pakora.Soon after, he split with his business partner in the Bangla Bazaar space. He took the Neerob name with him and unfurled it in Packsun\u2019s window to the delight of customers who had been chiding him for the lack of Bangladeshi dishes.His head chef from the original Neerob, Mohammed Islam, is in the kitchen now. And the steam table is loaded three rows deep, with more platters crowded on top: whole fish bronzed with turmeric, under kinked ribbons of caramelized onions; small curls of shrimp peeking from a dark thicket of spinach; shutki, sun-dried fish hardly the length of a finger, broken down in a pan with eggplant just enough that you can still taste the eggplant\u2019s meatiness and feel the crunch of tiny bones.Some of the most profound flavors come in the side dishes, like a thick, jet-black mash of kali jira seeds, better known in the West as nigella. The taste of the seeds is delicate, a faint suggestion of charred onion and fennel. Over this snaps the electric current of mustard oil, with a sting that is neither quite flavor nor fragrance, blossoming inside the nose and under the eyes.The bounty changes daily. If you\u2019re in luck, there may be khichuri, hunks of goat and hard-boiled eggs stained pink in a velvety meld of rice and moong dal. Or chicken roast, named for its status as the center of a feast rather than its preparation: pan-fried and simmered in a creamy masala that\u2019s a happy feud of sweet and hot.None of the dishes are labeled, but the women behind the counter patiently identify in English what ingredients they can, while their male colleagues greet customers with \u201cYes, brother\u201d and warn those not of South Asian heritage against the omnipresent chiles.The dining room is not exactly cozy, yet people linger. On the walls hang framed newspaper articles singing the praises of the first Neerob. An A.T.M. sits in a corner; a TV mutters. Signs in unexpected places deliver mantras like \u201cEnjoy the little things,\u201d and pakoras may appear, unbidden, at the start of your meal, along with an iceberg lettuce salad that would be perfunctory but for its topping of whole green chiles.Mr. Rahman left Dhaka, Bangladesh, for New York 25 years ago at 19. Only a few thousand Bangladeshi immigrants lived in the city then. By 2009, when he opened Neerob on Bangla Bazaar, the population had grown tenfold.He still remembers one of his first jobs, washing dishes at an Indian restaurant run, like many in the city, by a Bangladeshi immigrant. He asked his boss, \u201cHow come you make another country\u2019s food?\u201d The reply: \u201cNobody knows Bangladesh.\u201d Mr. Rahman decided to prove him wrong.Meanwhile, the fried chicken has not been forgotten.

{"Headline": "Democracy, Disrupted", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byAs the forces of reaction outpace movements predicated on the ideal of progress, and as traditional norms of political competition are tossed aside, it\u2019s clear that the internet and social media have succeeded in doing what many feared and some hoped they would. They have disrupted and destroyed institutional constraints on what can be said, when and where it can be said and who can say it.Even though in one sense President Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 fulfilled conventional expectations \u2014 because it prevented a third straight Democratic term in the White House \u2014 it also revealed that the internet and its offspring have overridden the traditional American political system of alternating left-right advantage. They are contributing \u2014 perhaps irreversibly \u2014 to the decay of traditional moral and ethical constraints in American politics.Such a regime, in his view, would keep the trappings of democracy, including seemingly free elections, while leaders would control the election process, the media and the scope of permissible debate. \u201cWhat you get is a country that is de facto less free.\u201da great thing for getting additional layers of transparency. It was true for Donald Trump as it was for Bernie Sanders; the internet ended smoke-filled back rooms, deal-cutting moved from back room to a true campaign, with a more general population. Maybe an unwashed population, but that\u2019s the beauty of American politics with 350 million people.Goodstein noted, however, \u201ca horrible development on the internet\u201d last year:In this cycle you saw hate speech retweeted and echoed, by partisan hacks, the Jewish star used in neo-Nazi posts. There is no governing body, so I think it\u2019s going to get worse, more people jumping into the gutter.According to Persily, the Trump campaign was \u201ctotally unprecedented in its breaking of established norms of politics.\u201d He argues thatthis type of campaign is only successful in a context in which certain established institutions \u2014 particularly, the mainstream media and political party organizations \u2014 have lost most of their power, both in the United States and around the world.The Trump campaign is the most recent beneficiary of the collapse of once-dominant organizations:The void these eroding institutions have left was filled by an unmediated, populist nationalism tailor-made for the internet age. We see it in the rise of the Five Star Movement in Italy and the Pirate Party in Iceland. We see it in the successful use of social media in the Brexit referendum, in which supporters were seven times more numerous on Twitter and five times more active on Instagram. And we see it in the pervasive fears of government leaders throughout Europe, who worried well before the American election that Russian propaganda and other internet tactics might sway their electorates.The influence of the internet is the latest manifestation of the weakening of the two major American political parties over the past century, with the Civil Service undermining patronage, the rise of mass media altering communication, campaign finance law empowering donors independent of the parties, and the ascendance of direct primaries gutting the power of party bosses to pick nominees.Neither party appeared to have a mechanism of internal correction. Neither could muster the wise elders to steer a more conventional course. Neither could use its congressional leadership to regain control of the party through its powers of governance. Neither could lay claim to financial resources that would compel a measure of candidate loyalty. Neither could even exert influence though party endorsements.The result:The parties proved hollow vehicles that offered little organizational resistance to capture by outsiders. And what was captured appeared little more than a brand, certainly not the vibrant organizations that are heralded as the indispensable glue of democratic politics.Issacharoff was even more concerned about the future of democratic politics in a talk, \u201cAnxieties of Democracy,\u201d that he gave in February at the University of Texas law school.\u201cWe are witnessing a period of deep challenge to the core claims of democracy to be the superior form of political organization of civilized peoples,\u201d he told his audience:The current moment of democratic uncertainty draws from four central institutional challenges, each one a compromise of how democracy was consolidated over the past few centuries. First, the accelerated decline of political parties and other institutional forms of engagement; second, the weakness of the legislative branches; third, the loss of a sense of social cohesion; and fourth, the decline in democratic state competence.In a phone interview, Issacharoff cited the emergence of internet-based methods of communication as a major contributing factor in the deterioration of political parties.\u201cTechnology has overtaken one of the basic functions you needed political parties for in the past, communication with voters,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media has changed all of that, candidates now have direct access through email, blogs and Twitter,\u201d along with Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and other platforms.Teams of hackers, operating with varying levels of resources and at various distances from the central chain of command, had a lot of license to poke and prod and see what they could come up with. Some of these people found it easier to do certain kinds of things \u2014 like break into Podesta\u2019s emails \u2014 than they had expected. Having obtained a windfall, they were then given license to push it even further.The question now is who benefits more from the digital revolution and the ubiquity of social media, the left or the right?It seems to me this is not a question about ideological placement but more about organizational or movement strategy. As long as I am in opposition, the payoff is higher in investing in digital infrastructure and thereby channeling the activities and enthusiasm of my supporters than when in power. So I would expect a re-emergence of political activity, for example in the form of alternative news sources, on the liberal side in the coming years.By qualitatively expanding the pool of participants, social media may thus be substantially contributing to some of the vivid examples of political disruption that we have witnessed over the past few years across and beyond the Western world: from the spread of protest movements to the sudden rise of new parties such as the Five Star Movement in Italy and Podemos in Spain, from the ascent of populist leaders all across Europe to electoral upheavals such as the Brexit referendum and the surge of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in the United States 2016 Presidential elections.The internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern, and television, radio, magazines, books, gave us the one-to-many pattern, the internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.Shirky continues:The second big change is that, as all media gets digitized, the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media, meaning that phone calls migrate to the internet, magazines migrate to the internet, movies migrate to the internet. And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium. Put another way, media is increasingly less just a source of information, and it is increasingly more a site of coordination, because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well.And the third big change, according to Shirky, is that members of the former audiencecan now also be producers and not consumers. Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well, because the same equipment \u2014 phones, computers \u2014 let you consume and produce. It\u2019s as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free; it\u2019s like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons.There is good reason to think that the disruptive forces at work in the United States \u2014 as they expand the universe of the politically engaged and open the debate to millions who previously paid little or no attention \u2014 may do more to damage the left than strengthen it. In other words, just as the use of negative campaign ads and campaign finance loopholes to channel suspect contributions eventually became routine, so too will be the use of social media to confuse and mislead the electorate.Of course, this problem goes much deeper than the internet. Sam Greene of King\u2019s College London put it this way in an email:Our politics are vulnerable to nefarious influences \u2014 whether of the Kremlin variety or the Breitbart variety \u2014 not because our information landscape is open and fluid, but because voters\u2019 perceptions have become untethered from reality. For reasons that are both complex and debatable, very many voters have stopped seeing government as a tool for the production of the common good, and have instead turned to politicians (and others) who at least make them feel good. Thus, the news we consume has become as much about emotion and identity as about facts. That\u2019s where the vulnerability comes in, and its roots are in our politics \u2014 not in the internet.Advertisement"}

This conversation has been edited and condensed.How did you find out that Mr. Simmons had stopped showing up at Slimmons?Richard and I were still friendly. We were still calling and emailing. He stopped returning my emails. I just thought: \u201cBummer. I guess, he\u2019s not interested anymore.\u201d Then I realized that he had stopped returning everybody\u2019s calls. Then it was just a gradual process of talking to people and reading the odd one-line news report and realizing that he had disappeared.How did the idea to do a podcast come together?Richard and I were talking about doing a documentary from the very first day we met. We met at Slimmons. I asked him if he would ever do a documentary with me.Did you go to the class to work out? Or to pitch the documentary? Or both? I went to the class because I heard you could. I thought, \u201cWell, I have to do this.\u201d I thought he was amazing, and I couldn\u2019t believe he was still teaching a class for $12 a class. But I was a producer for 15 years, and I was looking to do a feature documentary, and the minute I took the class, I knew that was something I wanted to pursue with him. And so we started talking about it right away.What made you decide to shift from the original intent of doing a documentary to going into the podcast realm?I didn\u2019t want to do a first-person documentary. I think it\u2019s really hard to pull those off without them being self-indulgent. It just didn\u2019t feel right. But a podcast is superflexible as a format, and it needs a narrator. It needs somebody to tell the story. And so it was a way for me to show that it was coming from a place of love and coming from a place of real concern, and show my point of view without making it about me. It\u2019s still about Richard.The four theories of his disappearance: 1. He is being held hostage by his housekeeper. 2. He is recovering from knee surgery. 3. The death of his dog sent him into a depression. 4. He just wants out of public life. Anything I\u2019m missing?The podcast explores all the possible reasons Richard Simmons would stop being Richard Simmons. And some of them are outlandish. Some of them make total sense. And some of them are a little sad.What do you think is going on?I\u2019m not limited to those four. The podcast is us exploring many theories of what they are. I have my own theory, but we get to that toward the end. And it\u2019s not really something that people have discussed, and it speaks less to this sort of weird mystery that nobody ever wanted in the first place.What have Mr. Simmons\u2019s representatives said?Richard\u2019s people say very little. But what they do say is that he\u2019s fine.It\u2019s possible, for sure. I think our skepticism of the more outlandish parts of that theory are clear in that episode. It had been reported before, and others who know Richard didn\u2019t dismiss it out of hand, so we clearly needed to raise it.But I also think Richard\u2019s friends are genuinely, deeply concerned for Richard and the eerie wall of silence around him. That is very real. And Richard\u2019s rep pretending that everything is normal \u2014 \u201cnothing to see here\u201d \u2014 feels a little false, too.Why do you think people are so intrigued by Mr. Simmons and the podcast?It\u2019s people who have been reminded or are being just told for the first time that Richard Simmons is a special, important and fascinating person. And I think people feel for him. I think he\u2019s always been this way. He just exudes kindness and genuineness.If Mr. Simmons truly wants to be out of the spotlight, as he told the \u201cToday\u201d show a year ago, then should you just leave him be?The concern is that he is not just taking time off. He\u2019s not just retired. He\u2019s not just stepping away from the spotlight. The concern is that he\u2019s cut off every person he knows. It\u2019s impossible not to be concerned about that. And every person I\u2019ve talked to, every friend who\u2019s known him for years, everybody is concerned.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Rapping Barber, a Defiant Teenager and a Release for War-Weary Afghans", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byKabul JournalKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 One is a barber, 22, who found his voice in rap, his passionate rhymes expressing the angst of a generation that has known nothing but war. His religious mother disapproves of music, switching the channel when a song comes on.These are the unlikely stars of a music competition modeled after \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d that provides weary Afghans a much-needed release on weekend nights.But amid an escalating battle with extremists, entertainment like this is a risky business, especially in a conservative society that looks down on music as vulgar. And especially when it includes women.The show\u2019s judges drive around in armored vehicles. The contestants are provided with safe housing inside a compound for the duration of the show. Audience members go through multiple security checks.Still, war has a way of disrupting the music.During one recent episode, a female contestant changed her upbeat song to a mournful one that she performed dressed mostly in black. Her uncle had been killed in a suicide bombing in front of the Afghan Parliament that week.\u201cWe told her she didn\u2019t need to perform that week,\u201d said Massoud Sanjer, the head of Tolo\u2019s entertainment wing. \u201cShe said, \u2018No, life continues.\u2019 But she changed her song selection.\u201dNone of this dissuades contestants like Zulala Hashemi, the 16-year-old who was raised by her widowed mother in Jalalabad, a city so conservative that women are rarely seen on the streets \u2014 and when they do venture out, almost always in burqas.Between recordings, on the occasions the mother and daughter return home, they put on their burqas and disappear into anonymity.Zulala always sang at home, but never took formal music lessons. This year, when she saw an ad for \u201cAfghan Star\u201d tryouts, she asked her mother if she could participate. She was surprised to win a spot on the show, which would bring her to Kabul.\u201cShe has a voice that is very particular to Afghanistan\u2019s geography,\u201d said Waheed Qasemi, a revered Afghan artist who is the show\u2019s music director. \u201cIt\u2019s a mountainous voice.\u201dBut for her voice to be recognized, Zulala has had to put up with the resistance of her relatives, including her brother, who is a police officer. She is also afraid of facing her teachers and classmates because \u201cthey may get angry\u201d with her.\u201cI knew they wouldn\u2019t give me permission, and until this day they haven\u2019t given me permission,\u201d Zulala said about her relatives. \u201cBut I wanted to show my talent to the people; I didn\u2019t want my talent to go in vain.\u201dWhat made it all possible was the support of her mother, Mermen Hashemi, who has a degree in economics and has worked in many senior jobs in the province, including running the government archives. Mrs. Hashemi has raised nine children on her own since her husband died of an illness 16 years ago, and she said she would not put up with meddling from relatives.\u201cI have earned with my own hands, and I have defended myself and my children,\u201d Mrs. Hashemi said. \u201cNo one has given me anything, and I have not given anyone time to say anything about my children.\u201dMrs. Hashemi has been with her daughter in Kabul over the last three months, following her \u201clike a shadow,\u201d according to Mr. Sanjer. She is in the green room when Zulala performs on stage, and she follows her into the dressing room when Zulala needs to change between performances.Zulala is one of the three remaining contestants in the competition, which is set to end on the Persian New Year\u2019s Eve in mid-March.His rising fame has made his mother relent: She will watch him perform, but only if he stays away from vulgarities and there are no women gyrating in his video clips.Mr. Mubarez discovered rap only four years ago. At his barbershop, he would rap along to the Iranian artists playing on his sound system as he cut hair. Their words of protest spoke to him.About two years ago, Mr. Mubarez started writing his own verses. A purist, he has since stopped listening to other rap to make sure his words come from the heart. He writes at night, and if he can\u2019t get a piece done in one 90-minute sitting he drops it as forced.\u201cIf I get up from writing it and say I will complete it another time, that rap cannot be written later,\u201d Mr. Mubarez said.He has gained a large following in just four months on the show, a remarkable rise in a country that is only beginning to discover rap music. He sticks to subjects that speak to the people.Many of his raps are inspired by personal stories, like one he wrote about his lack of education. Mr. Mubarez had a cousin as a classmate in school who later went on to university, while Mr. Mubarez, the oldest son in the family, worked jobs from the age of 12 \u2014 churning asphalt, clearing snow \u2014 to bring money home to his father.Years later, the cousin with the university diploma stayed with Mr. Mubarez\u2019s family. Mr. Mubarez said he was nervous around him, feeling backward and ashamed. After he dropped off the cousin at the bus station one evening, he put his feelings to verse.\u201cFrom the earth to the sky is the difference between us/Don\u2019t say why I didn\u2019t study \u2014 just go, let us be.\u201dFrom his barbershop, he posted the rap on YouTube and shared it on Facebook so people, particularly the cousin, could see \u201cthat if Jamal didn\u2019t study, it was because his life was different than yours.\u201dEven male stars like Mr. Mubarez feel the heavy pressure of society when performing. That was on display during a recent episode, when he performed a duet with Aryana Sayeed, the Afghan pop sensation who is a judge on the show.Ms. Sayeed, who has spent much of her life abroad, is known as much for her bold style as for her music, pushing the boundaries of a conservative society with her close-fitting dresses.On the day of the performance, she was wearing a blue dress that accentuated her curves; Mr. Mubarez, in a red New York Yankees cap over a white bandanna, was wearing red shoes, white pants and his signature black leather jacket.Midway through the performance, much to the pleasure of the audience, the two singers broke into a little dance, shimmying as they stepped left and right.When viewers tuned into the show after the taping, they found no trace of the performance. The executives had cut it out, apparently because Ms. Sayeed\u2019s appearance had been too provocative.\u201cThey are a little uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Mubarez said. \u201cMy mother is unhappy.\u201dFahim Abed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Mommy, Come Wipe Me!\u2019 and Other Perils of Working From Home", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byProfessor Robert E. Kelly, a political-science professor at Pusan National University in South Korea, sat down on Friday in what appeared to be his home office for a BBC World interview via Skype on a serious subject: the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.Soon after the segment began, video footage shows, a toddler casually strolled into his office, punching the air with her elbows. She was soon followed by a baby in a walker. Then his wife slid frantically into the room, grabbed the two kids and herded them out as Professor Kelly remained mostly composed.Many readers said they could relate to the slapstick interruption of Professor Kelly\u2019s serious moment, sharing stories of disruptions not only from kids, but pets and naked spouses, too.I was on a long conference call with a colleague and some clients, calling in from home as I had a sick child sleeping in the next room. As a subject matter expert, I only had about five minutes of the call in which I actually had to speak, and everything seemed to be going along fine, until my child suddenly woke up, came looking for me to tell me that he felt sick and proceeded to vomit all over the stairs. Which coincided with my colleague asking me to provide the crucial information the client needed from my area of expertise.I took the phone off of mute and calmly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my child has just thrown up on the stairs; can I have five minutes?\u201d Client was very gracious, got my kid cleaned up and tucked back in bed then chimed back in acting every bit the total professional.As a playwright with a new production coming up, I was doing a telephone interview on live radio on the home phone. I thought my baby Sam was asleep in his crib when his deafening cries started. As the interviewer began his next question, I dropped the phone receiver, ran into Sam\u2019s room, shoved the pacifier in his mouth, ran back to the phone and started answering a question I hadn\u2019t heard, trying to use impressive sounding abstract theater jargon that might be applicable. I loved this video, and it made me and thousands of other worker parents feel less alone!Once upon a time I was presenting our monthly numbers to the sales team when I heard a loud bang over and over. I looked up to see my 1-year-old rolling down the stairs with my wife chasing after her. She picked her up and raced back up the stairs. I continued with my presentation and never heard a cry. She logrolled and didn\u2019t hurt herself at all, thankfully!I am glad professor Kelly was not applying for a job. I was once a member of a panel hiring a school director. We were interviewing a candidate via Skype, and in the middle of it we could all hear a door being pounded. It turned out the candidate had locked his children out of his apartment in an attempt to have a quiet environment for his interview: The kids just couldn\u2019t take it, and started banging the door. It was not a determinant factor in the hiring, but it did cause an impression, and I am afraid it was not positive.This happens to me sometimes when I have to take a call and I\u2019m working from home. My office door opens and I hear, \u201cDaddy, whatcha doing?\u201d Any shushing just prompts him to ask louder. I either put the phone on mute or ask if I can call the person later. Worse is when my two kids get into a screaming match.I once had a Skype interview and, in the middle of the interview, the interviewer\u2019s husband walked into the frame completely nude. I tried my best to keep a straight face while he figured out that I could see him. I\u2019m not certain she knew I had just seen her husband, but we both pretended nothing happened and faked our way through the rest of the interview.Needless to say, I did not get that job.My mom likes to tell a story of taking me to work with her when I was little. I couldn\u2019t go to school, but she had a deadline that couldn\u2019t wait. She set me up in a conference room and told me to read and color quietly until she was done. Angry at being shut up all by myself, I made a sign saying, \u201cI HAVE LICE\u201d and taped it to the window of the conference room for all her co-workers to see. Kids are unpredictable.When I was doing an important telephone interview at home for my newspaper, my youngest son decided I wasn\u2019t paying enough attention to him, and after trying to get my attention and failing to do so, he began rolling his toy trucks over my toes. I can fully relate to this situation. I think it\u2019s hilarious. It\u2019s what comes with having kids.Oh, this brings back memories. My favorite was when I was on a call with the executive team of the Fortune 500 health insurance company I worked for discussing health care reform when one of my children yelled from the bathroom, very loudly, \u201cMommy, come wipe me!\u201dI don\u2019t work from home unless I\u2019m on call. I once took a phone call and stepped outside to get some quiet. My toddler decided to take his clothes off and run around the front yard and then start down the street. So I chased a naked child for a few minutes before negotiating with him to put clothes on. I did a pretty good job of keeping the phone muted when I didn\u2019t need to talk. Except for one time when I said: \u201cO.K. fine, you can stay out here with me, but you have to put clothes on. At least shorts.\u201dI am on the phone all morning while working from home. My talking puts my two dogs fast asleep, and other than the occasional snoring, they are quiet. The cats, however, show no respect. There is a piano just outside my work area, and during a call when I was training a group, the cat decided to jump up on the keyboard and slowly walk on the keys, playing his own tune. Luckily, everyone on the call enjoyed the show and we continued on after completion of the interlude.Advertisement"}

Johnny Hernandez, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, and Barron Casteel, the mayor of New Braunfels. The driver of the pickup, the truck\u2019s only occupant, and one other were injured, Lieutenant Hernandez said.

Shares opened at $24 on Thursday and closed at $24.48, a 44 percent jump from the offering price the company had set.But industry analysts grew leery of the slowing user growth the app experienced last year.The initial public offering of Snap, which is based in Los Angeles, was the most eagerly awaited arrival since Twitter entered the market in 2013.In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said its app had 158 million daily users in its fourth quarter, up 48 percent from the prior-year period. But Wall Street has become skittish about future growth.The app\u2019s rate of user growth slowed during 2016, with just five million new users in the final quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the app had added 13 million.Snap blamed the slowing growth late in the year on technical problems, saying the launch of several products and the release of multiple updates had hurt the performance of its app.Social media companies have had mixed success since their initial public offerings. Where Facebook has soared, Twitter has struggled to find its way.Facebook, which debuted on Wall Street in 2012, has had its ad revenue and its user base grow quickly. Twitter, which had its initial public offering in 2013, has experienced stalling revenue growth, and since the return of its co-founder Jack Dorsey, the company has cut costs and shuffled its leadership.Twitter is now valued at $11 billion while Facebook is valued at $395 billion.Snap, upon its public offering, became more valuable than stalwarts like American Airlines, Macy\u2019s and Xerox.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Backpage\u2019s Sex Ads Are Gone. Child Trafficking? Hardly.", "Date": "2017-03-11", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Since she was 14, Tiffany says, she has been sold for sex, offered via hundreds of advertisements on Backpage.com, a website that grew rich on classified ads for services like escorts, body rubs and exotic dancers. Far from being a marketplace for consensual exchanges, Backpage, the authorities said, often used teasers like \u201cAmber Alert\u201d and \u201cLolita\u201d to signal that children were for sale.Even so, Tiffany \u2014 a street name \u2014 did not stop using the site, she said. Instead, her ads moved to Backpage\u2019s dating section. \u201cNew in town,\u201d read a recent one, using words that have become code for selling sex. \u201cLooking for someone to hang out with.\u201d Other recent dating ads listed one female as \u201c100% young\u201d and suggested that \u201coh daddy can i be your candy.\u201dIn the fight against child sex trafficking, shutting down an epicenter like Backpage was a major victory, but one against a relentless foe that quickly unfurled new tentacles. The demise of Backpage\u2019s adult ads undermined the trade, but it also illustrated how difficult it is to stamp out the practice of selling children for sex. The crime is rarely punished with the full force of the law \u2014 charges like rape or statutory rape \u2014 officials say; in many places it leads to just a citation, instead of an arrest.For Tiffany, 18, the demise of Backpage\u2019s adult listings has made things far more unpredictable \u2014 and dangerous, she said. The old ads allowed her to try to vet customers by contacting them before meetings, via phone or text message. With far fewer inquiries from the dating ads, she said, her first encounters with men now take place more often on the street as she gets into cars in red light districts around the Bay Area.\u201cIt\u2019s harder to catch a date now,\u201d she said. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s daddy puts them on the street.\u201dEric Quan, a sergeant in the human-trafficking unit with the San Jose Police Department, said there had been a conspicuous rise in street prostitution in San Jose, where Tiffany is often forced to work.\u201cWhen Backpage was running adult ads, we used to get tips, but that has dropped off,\u201d Sergeant Quan said. \u201cIt makes it a lot more complicated for us to figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cI do see more girls on the street, but we\u2019re not sure why,\u201d he said, referring to all females, not specifically minors. \u201cThere\u2019s more guys out there, too, because there\u2019s more girls to choose from.\u201dAdvocates said that while the elimination of the listings was a step forward, by itself it was more an inconvenience than a crippling blow.\u201cIt was such a huge marketplace that any way to eliminate the widespread distribution of ads is progress,\u201d said Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, a human-rights organization focused on gender-based violence. \u201cBut until we see a more comprehensive solution, it is going to pop up elsewhere.\u201dFew jurisdictions keep data on the men arrested in such cases. But one area that keeps track, King County in Washington, found that 79 percent of the men charged with seeking to pay for sex with a minor from 2013 to 2015 were white, while 44 percent of those they were accused of propositioning were African-American. The county\u2019s population is 7 percent African-American.\u201cWe educate our judges that although there is no single buyer profile, buyers are predominantly white, educated, married men,\u201d said Victoria Sweet, a lawyer for the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges.It is unclear how many minors are forced into prostitution each year, but the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said reports of online child sex trafficking had increased by more than 800 percent from 2010 to 2015. The organization said this was \u201cdirectly correlated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for sex.\u201d\u201cThe shutdown of Backpage\u2019s adult classified advertising is an assault on the First Amendment,\u201d the company\u2019s statement read in part.In Oakland, International Boulevard is among the busiest strips in the nation for the trafficking of minors, part of a network whose spokes extend to similar strips in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Seattle and Reno, Nev.In warm weather, Tiffany said, she can often be found there, dressed in little more than a halter top and panties.Tiffany said she had been sent as far away as Pennsylvania and Florida, usually via Backpage ads. Once she was given a cross-country bus ticket while her pimp took a plane, she said.Tiffany, who spoke on the condition that her real name not be used, said she was trying to quit the business. But without a high school diploma, her job prospects are slim.During an interview, she spoke matter-of-factly about the last four years, recounting the threat of violence from both pimps and the men who buy her. But she also said she had been in love with some of her pimps, most of them men, one a woman.Within the span of a few seconds, she burst into tears while talking about the betrayal she felt when one pimp punished her by having his brother touch her, then had a fit of laughter while reading complimentary text messages from men who had purchased her for sex.With her long fingernails, hair extensions and a preoccupation with the fashionable, she could easily be mistaken for an unremarkable teenager. She said she would be \u201ctoo bored\u201d to work a regular job.Tiffany\u2019s mother, who she said might have worked as a prostitute, gave her to her grandmother the day she was born. Her father, she said, is a pimp.At 14, she was lured by two Facebook acquaintances to a party that became a gang rape, she said. Since then, she said, she had been conditioned \u2014 through beatings, gang rapes and other violence \u2014 to please her pimps, many of whom found her by perusing Backpage.\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m good at,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce you bust a first date, you\u2019re likely to bust another. You have power, and you know you\u2019ll never be broke again.\u201d (As it happened, though, pimps generally kept all her money.)For years, Tiffany said, she habitually took Ecstasy, which she said made her \u201chappy and numb\u201d \u2014 a state that she said enabled her to work long hours and forget the fact that she was being sold for sex.At 16, she was placed in the custody of Awaken, a Christian nonprofit organization that works to end sexual exploitation, but she repeatedly ran away to return to pimps.

{"Headline": "March, Huddle, Fight: Why Feminism Is Back in a Big Way", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byWomen TodayPeople have been declaring feminism dead forever, and after Donald J. Trump\u2019s election victory it was tempting to wonder if the naysayers were onto something.While 94 percent of black women and 68 percent of Hispanic women who voted chose Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump \u2014 despite his long record of misogynous insults, sexist statements and gross behavior, despite his pledge to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which gave millions of women access to birth control, mammograms and other benefits, and despite his promise to nominate justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 won the support of 53 percent of white women voters, only 3 percent less than gentlemanly, sane Mitt Romney.Flash forward a few months, though, and wow. The women\u2019s movement is back, and not a moment too soon. Started by a Facebook post and organized in just 11 weeks, the Women\u2019s March was arguably the biggest demonstration Washington had ever seen, to say nothing of the huge marches the same day in other cities. And then, while commentators predicted that the marches were just a one-off, came the Huddles \u2014 small neighborhood groups, mostly of women, who helped kicked off what has come to be called the Resistance. \u201cBefore the march, I hadn\u2019t been to a demonstration since 1980,\u201d said a participant in the Huddle I attended down the street from my home in Manhattan. \u201cI hadn\u2019t demonstrated since the Vietnam War,\u201d said another. That\u2019s a long time between marches.What activated these women and the many millions like them? There was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss \u2014 not just the fact that she lost despite winning three million more votes, but the misogynist attacks on her. There was the threat to women\u2019s rights, especially abortion rights, and to 50 years of progress on civil rights and civil liberties, religious tolerance, anti-racism, health care and L.G.B.T. rights. There was the permission Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has given to louts and bullies to push women around. In short, there was the whole dark cloud of reactionary politics that is Donald Trump, of which male entitlement is a signal part. Women see that entitlement in their daily lives. Even women who voted for him acknowledged it was there, but seemed to shrug it off as an unchangeable fact of life.But there\u2019s something more. Feminism has changed. It\u2019s lost its earnest, been-there-done-that aura (undeserved, but there you are). When my daughter was in college 10 years ago, she was one of only two or three girls who raised their hands when their sociology professor asked if any of them called themselves a feminist. And this was Wesleyan, a famously liberal school. I recently visited a sociology seminar at New York University, and asked the same question. All the students raised their hands \u2014 including the two men. \u201cFeminism is cool now,\u201d explained one young woman, citing the movement against sexual assault on campus as one factor and the influence of pop culture idols like Beyonc\u00e9 and Emma Watson as another. The goals may be the same as ever, but the movement feels different. It is more interracial, younger, queerer and far more internet savvy than it was a decade or so ago.But feminism did not become cool all by itself. Increasingly, it\u2019s part of a bigger grass-roots movement for racial justice, immigrant rights, prisoners\u2019 rights, labor rights and more. The concept of intersectionality, which is the idea that people have multiple identities and that all oppressions are connected, has helped bring women together. So has the concept of reproductive justice, which is gradually replacing choice as the lens through which to look at reproductive rights: It isn\u2019t enough to give women the means to control their fertility, they also need to be supported in their motherhood, and that means fighting poverty and racism.This broadened agenda makes it hard to identify a single issue as the most urgent: It\u2019s all connected and it all matters. Voting rights matter and so does electing more women. (Emily\u2019s List, an organization which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights, says an astounding 10,000 women have contacted it to say they want to run for something.) Reproductive rights are crucial; donations to Planned Parenthood are through the roof. Also crucial is protecting pregnant workers\u2019 rights, and putting a halt to the bigotry that leads to attacks on transgender women and women wearing head scarves.The list goes on and on. The new activism takes many forms: For some, it means crowding into town hall meetings to give their congressional representatives a piece of their mind about attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act; for others it meant taking part in the International Women\u2019s Strike on March 8. Indeed, maybe these are a lot of the same people. I think I glimpsed some \u201cpussyhats\u201d in video reports of the crowds who descended on airports when Mr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban came down.But I believe a great motivation of the activism we are seeing today is sheer outrage that a man who represents everything we\u2019ve been fighting against for decades, an admitted molester who hurls vile insults at any woman who displeases him and who wants to send us all back to the 1950s, now sits in the White House.\u201cThe massive power of the American state is about to be marshaled to put women in their place,\u201d she wrote.That could still happen. Republicans control the White House, both houses of Congress and all branches of 25 state governments, and look likely to control the Supreme Court and dozens of seats on the federal bench as well. It is hard to imagine that four years from now America will be a fairer, kinder, more equal place for women. But at least we\u2019re not going down without a fight.Katha Pollitt is a poet, essayist and a columnist at The Nation.

{"Headline": "Facebook and Twitter Could Face Fines in Germany Over Hate Speech Posts", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Social media giants including Facebook and Twitter are not doing enough to curb hate speech on their platforms and could face fines of up to $53 million if they do not strengthen their efforts to delete illegal posts, a German government minister said on Tuesday.For tech companies and free speech campaigners, this global regulatory push could limit how individuals communicate online by restricting people\u2019s digital activities and allowing governments to expand their control over vast parts of the internet.Yet for a growing number of policy makers in Europe, the United States and elsewhere, social media companies have a responsibility to block harmful content from their digital platforms, and they must respect national rules that often run counter to Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to operate across borders.On Tuesday, Heiko Maas, Germany\u2019s minister of justice and consumer protection, said he would propose a law that would impose stiff fines on companies whose social media platforms did not respond swiftly enough to complaints about illegal content. Mr. Maas has been a vocal critic of how companies treat online content that violates the country\u2019s strict rules on hate speech.\u201cThis will set binding standards for how companies running social networks must handle complaints and require them to delete criminal content,\u201d Mr. Maas said of the proposal.If the law is approved, tech companies may face fines of up to 50 million euros, or $53 million, for not combating hate speech, potentially the highest such penalty in the Western world.It would require social media platforms to make it easy for users to report contentious material, and to respond to those requests promptly. It calls for \u201cobviously criminal content\u201d to be deleted or blocked within 24 hours, while companies would have seven days to remove posts that are less clear-cut.Communications experts in Germany welcomed the move.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the internet will no longer be a free space,\u201d said Birgit Stark, head of the institute for communications at the University of Mainz. \u201cYou can\u2019t just defame people, just because it is the internet.\u201dThe development followed the publication on Tuesday of the results of a study that showed that Facebook and Twitter failed to meet the German target of removing 70 percent of hate speech within 24 hours of being alerted to its presence.The yearlong study noted that while the two companies eventually erased nearly all illegal hate speech, in January and February, Facebook managed to delete 39 percent in the time frame sought by the German authorities and Twitter 1 percent. Google\u2019s YouTube video service fared the best, taking down within 24 hours 90 percent of all content flagged.Since September, the figure for Facebook has fallen by seven percentage points, while Twitter\u2019s takedown rate has not changed. The issue has taken on new urgency as Germany gears up for parliamentary elections in September.Tech companies deny playing fast and loose with national hate speech laws, saying they have taken down illegal material when it has been flagged by users. They also argue, however, that there is a fine line between complying with a country\u2019s rules and outright censorship.\u201cWe are doing far more than any other company to try and get on top of hate speech on our platform,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe, said in an interview late last year. \u201cWe recognize that this is a work in progress.\u201dGermany, where it is illegal to promote Nazi ideology or to deny the Holocaust, has been at the center of the debate about what can be published on social media platforms and who is responsible for such content.Many Germans \u2014 among the most engaged users of these services \u2014 also remain overtly wary of how much information American tech companies routinely collect about their online activities. Facebook and Google have run into problems with local lawmakers over what can be disseminated on their social networks and on video sites like YouTube.\u201cWe are disappointed by the results,\u201d Klaus Gorny, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday referring to the German government study. \u201cWe have clear rules against hate speech and work hard to keep it off our platform.\u201dAl Verney, a YouTube spokesman, said that the company was analyzing the proposed legislation and that the video service\u2019s procedures for taking things down were robust. Twitter declined to comment on Mr. Maas\u2019s proposal.The German criticism over how social media companies handle hate speech and other illicit content online is part of a wider global pushback.\u201cTrust is one of the main assets that social media has,\u201d Andrus Ansip, a European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital agenda, said in an interview last month. \u201cIf people can\u2019t trust these channels, then they will stop using these platforms.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Richard Allen.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "I was on a bus heading back to New York when I got news from Egypt that my brother Abdullah had been released from solitary confinement. I was so overwhelmed with joy, all I could do was scream hysterically. Then I realized: Our friend and colleague Shawkan wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so lucky. I grew quiet, as the thought of Shawkan still imprisoned left me wondering. When would Shawkan and his family have their moment of relief and happiness? While covering Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s riots and turmoil, I thought we could rid ourselves of the police state that was imposed under Mohammed Hosni Mubarak, who held power for three decades. Like countless others, I wanted a lasting change. Then came the unthinkable: the 2013 Egyptian coup d\u2019\u00c3\u00a9tat. I witnessed mass arrests and the brutality of Egyptian security forces who shot peaceful protesters. During this horrific time, I was arrested twice. After my second arrest, I knew I had to go into exile or share the fate of some of my colleagues. It has now been three years since I left Egypt \u00e2\u0080\u0094 living in Lagos and Istanbul before settling in New York. Only God knows if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ever return.During my exile, not a day has passed without thinking about Shawkan. I had met him in prison, while visiting my brother. Eventually I would visit them both, as I figured out I now had not one, but two brothers in jail. He faced charges of \u00e2\u0080\u009cvandalism, attempted murder, and planning an armed insurrection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which could lead to a death sentence. I wondered how this could happen. How could an innocent man lose years of his life for crimes he did not commit? Why are journalists like Shawkan considered criminals in my country? Shawkan has now been imprisoned for three years, without a fair trial, and I pray it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stretch into a fourth. In that time, he could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finished school, traveled the world, and maybe even settled down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I leave this dark hole I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shawkan said in a 2015 phone call, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to you, travel and shoot photos together. \u2026 I promise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I have not heard from him since. I am heartbroken to think that Shawkan and my other colleagues are struggling to survive despite authorities having testimony that can prove their innocence. As the current situation prohibits the truth from surfacing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our duty to make sure that their stories are told and their voices heard beyond the walls and cells that keep them silent. Our profession must be safeguarded.  In times like these, the world needs photojournalists who risk their lives in selfless pursuit of the truth. We might be arrested, abducted, traumatized or even killed, yet we continue to document the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tragedies and to document the truth. Sometimes I wonder if Shawkan can forgive me for my shortcomings. I wonder if he thinks I could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done more. I do know we cling to the hope that Shawkan and the others will be freed soon, and that they will enjoy their basic rights.  It may seem unrealistic, but if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold on to that sense of hope, we will go insane. Without hope, we have nothing else to live for. "}

Now They\u2019re Accused in Her Murder.", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byThey spread out across 11 beach towns, like a hundred flecks of hope on a desperate quest: combing a stretch of the Jersey Shore for Sarah Stern, a 19-year-old from Neptune City who had been missing for a week.Among the search party of family, friends and neighbors who braved the freezing cold in December were two high school friends of Ms. Stern\u2019s, Liam McAtasney and Preston Taylor. Mr. Taylor had taken Ms. Stern to the junior prom. Mr. McAtasney had listed her under the \u201cfamily\u201d section of his friends on Facebook.Ms. Stern\u2019s body has still not been found, but now Mr. McAtasney, 19, has been charged with her murder, based on a recorded conversation with a friend. Mr. Taylor, also 19, was charged with helping to conceal the murder and discard her remains.\u201cIt was kind of a shock, to say the very least,\u201d said Michael Stern, Ms. Stern\u2019s father, recalling how he felt when he learned that the two men \u2014 who had been her friends since grade school \u2014 had been accused in her death. At the initial hearing, he fought back tears, despondent that his only daughter was dead and had not simply \u201cleft without telling anybody.\u201dMs. Stern\u2019s killing has gripped the small shore town where she lived, a grim account filled with sordid twists and turns involving a six-month plot, petty robbery and buried cash boxes that have kept it in the news and left residents grappling with a familiar sensation after such events: How could this happen here?The trail that led investigators to the two young men began the night the police found the car that Ms. Stern had been driving, a 1994 Oldsmobile, abandoned atop the highest point of a bridge along Route 35 that crosses the Shark River in Belmar. Helicopters, police officers and firefighters immediately scoured the area, but found no trace of Ms. Stern.According to prosecutors, Mr. McAtasney had killed Ms. Stern at her home the day before the police found the car, the culmination of a six-month plot to murder her after robbing her of $7,000 she kept in a safe deposit box at a bank.In a recorded conversation with a friend that was entered into evidence by prosecutors, Mr. McAtasney bragged about strangling Ms. Stern, describing how he lifted her off the ground before laying her down and watching for 30 minutes as she died.Mr. Taylor confirmed the recorded conversation in a statement to court officials, saying that Mr. McAtasney had called him as he was carrying out the murder.Mr. McAtasney then called him a few hours after strangling Ms. Stern, prosecutors said, begging Mr. Taylor to look for his cellphone because he feared he had left it somewhere in her home. He also asked for help getting rid of the body, prosecutors said.Mr. Taylor then dragged the lifeless woman outside and hid her in a bush for a few hours while the two men finished plans. Later, under the cover of night, they propped up Ms. Stern\u2019s body in the front seat of her car and drove to the bridge, where she was cast off, the authorities said. Her car was abandoned with the keys still inside.\u201cShe just had a fantastic art teacher in high school, and her talent just blossomed over the last two or three years,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cI would say, had her career continued, she would have become one of the top artists in the world.\u201dThe search for Ms. Stern has continued. Relying on Mr. Taylor\u2019s confession, the police have recovered two buried safe boxes, one in Sandy Hook containing about $7,000 and another in Shark River Park containing Ms. Stern\u2019s clothing.Both men are being held without bail. In the meantime, the town remains engrossed by the case.\u201cEverybody is still talking about this,\u201d said Charles Stone, a lawyer and friend of the Sterns. \u201cI\u2019ll run into people that I don\u2019t know who had seen me being interviewed on TV and ask me about the case. And I\u2019ve gotten emails from people that were just concerned about the family and offered to help in any way, shape or form.\u201dThe killing has shocked those who knew the two defendants in high school, who were described as \u201cjokesters\u201d by classmates and friends. Mr. McAtasney was also a talented trumpet player who learned instruments quickly while in marching band.Mr. Taylor was a \u201ccarefree kid\u201d who surfed from time to time and was interested in skateboarding, according to an uncle.Those who know them say they enjoyed having a good time like most high school students, drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.Friends and neighbors say both men had a middle-class childhood and, from appearances, weren\u2019t wealthy but also weren\u2019t struggling, leaving many to wonder how they could be accused in Ms. Stern\u2019s killing.\u201cI have like an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and I was trying to hide them away from all this stuff,\u201d said Steven Staloff, 43, an uncle of Mr. Taylor.

The company was valued at a premium to Facebook\u2019s valuation when it went public despite Snap\u2019s burning about $1 billion over the last two years and its rapidly slowing user growth.Others have taken note. Easy money allowed private companies to raise funds at high prices in 2014 and 2015. Over 60 private firms surpassed the $1 billion valuation threshold \u2014 making them unicorns in Silicon Valley parlance \u2014 in those two years, according to CB Insights. That spigot is shutting, however. Only a dozen joined the club last year, and established firms found it harder to raise new funds. Rising markets since the election are increasing public appetite for riskier assets.Several are taking the public-market plunge. MuleSoft, a producer of software that allows companies to connect different applications, is the best of the lot. Underwriters estimate it is worth $2 billion. The company lost $59 million last year. It has about $100 million in the bank, and much of its costs are related to equity compensation. But it could use more cash. Okta and Yext cannot wait. The cloud-based security company and the smaller firm, which makes sure clients\u2019 information appears correctly on third-party sites, are suffering accelerating losses.While public investors now lack self-esteem, tech firms are not filled with joy either. Happiness is relative, and they look wistfully at the rapidly rising private valuations of a few years ago. Snap\u2019s valuation per share when it went public was not much higher than its last private fund-raising round. Alteryx, which makes data-analytic software, has tentatively priced itself at around $800 million, close to where it was valued privately two years ago.Snap\u2019s fall since its I.P.O. \u2014 it trades nearly 15 percent below its first-day closing price \u2014 may make it even harder for private companies to raise more money than they had previously.

But the Haggler has never encountered a business that delights in calling its customers wrong, and then insults those customers in obscenity-filled emails and YouTube videos.Well, he hadn\u2019t. Until now.Q. For Christmas in 2014, I bought a knapsack that holds a gun and ammunition, for my adult son, from a company in Tennessee called Special Operations Equipment. It cost $177. Days later, I asked via email when the item would be shipped, and this totally incensed John Willis, the owner of S.O.E., who wrote back that the site had stated plainly that the company didn\u2019t know when the item would be in stock. He told me he would denounce me in a YouTube video, which he did, without using my name.A year passed. I wrote asking for a refund. Mr. Willis replied that there would be no refund and that I\u2019d need to wait until the product was restocked. When I then said I would post a complaint to the Better Business Bureau\u2019s site, he wrote back and called me a derogatory word that can\u2019t be published here. He added that he would post my name and a link to my bureau complaint to social media sites, and then run a sale in which customers who used my name as a coupon code would get 25 percent off.I doubt that I can get my money or the knapsack at this point. But perhaps people need to be warned about S.O.E.Anita Allen Jacksonville, Fla.A. Before the Haggler starts, he must confess that he likes the idea of a sale in which customers can get a discount by entering the Haggler\u2019s name as a coupon code, which this column will surely inspire. (Note to S.O.E.: Please name the sale after the windy nitwit whose name is attached to this column. He\u2019s awful. Seriously. Nobody likes him.)The Haggler will also confess that he finds something perversely appealing about a company owner who revels in tweaking his customers. Yes, the insults and name calling are straight out of a playbook that a high school sophomore would find infantile. And at the root of many of his conflicts with the buying public is his petulance and very thin skin. Sporting a graying beard that sprouts from his chin like a desert shrub, he has a you-should-know-better look in his eye and gets surprisingly angry, surprisingly fast.But there are only a few molds for anyone who wants to prosper in the retail world, and on some level you need to salute Mr. Willis for making a mold of his own. Especially because, based on the evidence of his YouTube channel, he is succeeding.\u201cI bought this and paid this one in full,\u201d he says, walking around the car and sounding inexplicably sour. \u201cI didn\u2019t even want this car, really. I mean, I wanted it. It\u2019s a neat toy.\u201dHow does verbally attacking customers, online and in videos, work for Mr. Willis? The Haggler is going to take a guess based on a few of Mr. Willis\u2019s videotaped monologues, some of which have more than 100,000 views. In them, he states that customers who complain about him online draw attention in \u201cforums,\u201d and then get \u201cdog-piled\u201d by fans of S.O.E. This attracts gawkers who are won over by his brash style and head to his online store, where they buy stuff.\u201cThat\u2019s why I do this,\u201d Mr. Willis said in the \u201cHaters\u201d video, referring broadly to his stratagems. \u201cI know it works. We sit around and laugh about it every morning.\u201dThis is grumpiness elevated to performance art. But Mr. Willis is apparently the kind of artist who likes to choose his stage. He did not return the Haggler\u2019s emails or calls last week. Maybe he was really busy. Or on vacation. Or he was buying a new car with money from \u201chaters.\u201dYou need to really like a guy to watch this show.In short, the picture here is nuanced.

But now his crowds are growing, as 200 people recently gathered with him to celebrate the country\u2019s fascist past and call fascist-era greetings \u2014 \u201cNa Straz!\u201d or \u201cOn the guard!\u201d Mr. Svec is so emboldened that he is transforming his movement into a political party, with plans to run for Parliament.\u201cYou are ours, and we will forever be yours,\u201d Mr. Svec said at the foot of the statue, having declared this as the Year of Jozef Tiso, dedicated to rehabilitating the image of the former priest and Nazi collaborator, who was hanged as a war criminal in 1947.They are still on the edges of European politics, yet offer another reminder of how turbulent politics have become. Just as the rise of far-right parties is forcing many mainstream politicians to pivot rightward, so, too, has the populist mood energized the most extremist right-wing groups, those flirting with or even embracing fascist policies that trace back to World War II.\u201cBefore, pro-fascist sentiments were kept hidden,\u201d said Gabriel Sipos, director of Transparency International Slovakia. \u201cParents would tell their children, \u2018You cannot say this at school.\u2019 Now, you can say things in the public space that you couldn\u2019t say before.\u201d\u201cNow, extremists and fascists are part of the system,\u201d said Grigorij Meseznikov, president of the Institute for Public Affairs, a liberal research group.Pre-election polls showed his party getting less than 3 percent of the vote, but his result \u2014 8 percent \u2014 was built on strong support from young people and other first-time voters. More recent polls show his support nearing 13 percent. He had already stunned Slovakia in 2013 by winning the governorship of Banska Bystrica, one of Slovakia\u2019s eight regions.\u201cThey used to turn up at gay pride parades, show their muscle, turn up the heat,\u201d said Michal Havran, a television talk-show host and political commentator. \u201cNow, they don\u2019t go; they are worried about their image.\u201dBut the underlying message of groups like Mr. Kotleba\u2019s and Mr. Svec\u2019s has not shifted \u2014 Slovakia was better off under a fascist government.\u201cSomething very dark and very troubling from the past is coming back,\u201d Mr. Havran said. \u201cThey feel they are fighting for something very pure, something very old and sacred. A few years ago, they were ashamed to talk about it. Now, they are proud.\u201dIn Banska Bystrica, Mr. Kotleba\u2019s powers as governor include overseeing schools, cultural institutions and some infrastructure projects.\u201cIf you are a white, heterosexual man, you probably don\u2019t notice any difference living in a place where Kotleba is governor,\u201d said Rado Sloboda, 26, one of a group of Banska Bystrica activists opposing Mr. Kotleba under the banner \u201cNot in Our Town.\u201d \u201cIf you are a minority, like a Roma, you feel it more keenly. There is a feeling that they are even less welcome in the center city.\u201dThe muscular receptionist outside Mr. Kotleba\u2019s office said this month that no entry was possible without an appointment, although the governor almost never grants interviews. When told that repeated calls had not been returned, he asked the name of the newspaper. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cThat explains it.\u201dMr. Kotleba\u2019s party has been especially effective on social media, with more than 140 interconnected Facebook pages. When a local retiree, Jan Bencik, 68, began blogging to expose the country\u2019s neo-fascists, his name appeared on a list of \u201copponents of the state.\u201d\u201cThey called me a Jew, said that I should die, die, die,\u201d Mr. Bencik said. \u201cThey said that people like me would be dealt with in the future.\u201dOne of the ironies of Mr. Kotleba\u2019s coming to power in Banska Bystrica is that it was the center of the anti-fascist Slovak National Uprising during the war and is home to the national museum commemorating that event.Stanislav Micev, the museum director, characterized Mr. Kotleba\u2019s message as \u201cfascism with elements of Nazism,\u201d mixing Mussolini\u2019s strongman rule with Hitler\u2019s demonization of minorities.\u201cThey are against Americans, Hungarians, Jews, black people and yellow people,\u201d Mr. Micev said. \u201cHis current positions are right on the edge of what is legal.\u201dAs a newcomer on the neo-fascist political scene, Mr. Svec regards Mr. Kotleba as a potential rival for the same angry vote. At the Jozef Tiso memorial ceremony, the top officials in Mr. Svec\u2019s movement wore matching dark suits with white shirts and bright red ties. A table in the back of the room did a brisk business selling Slovak Revival Movement patches, stickers, key rings, calendars, cookies and bottles of wine (white only) labeled \u201cYear of Jozef Tiso.\u201d\u201cThe people in power want Slovaks to be ashamed of their history,\u201d said Martin Lacko, a historian and supporter of Mr. Svec. \u201cThey want them to keep apologizing. That\u2019s why they keep talking about deportations of Jews during the war and other negative things.\u201dA group of gray-haired singers in folk costumes, accompanied by a clarinet and an accordion, performed a series of patriotic favorites. \u201cSlovak moms, you have beautiful sons,\u201d they sang.A pair of university students with floppy hair and denim sat in the back corner, whispering during the speeches and snatching pastries from a nearby table during breaks. Both said they considered themselves devout and conservative, and did not believe Mr. Svec and Mr. Kotleba were extremist in any way. They also pointed to the election of President Trump as a good thing.\u201cI have to say, the U.S. election results made me extremely happy,\u201d said Martin Bornik, 23.In an interview after the ceremony, Mr. Svec rejected the notion that his group is neo-Nazi.\u201cWhen Americans bring their flags to parks or to public events, nobody says anything,\u201d Mr. Svec said. \u201cWhen we do it, they call us neo-Nazis. You know, labeling someone is the easiest thing to do.\u201dA picture caption last Monday with an article about the rise of neo-fascist groups in Europe misidentified Robert Svec, the leader of the Slovak Revival Movement. He was shown second from the right, not third.Miroslava Germanova contributed reporting from Bratislava, Slovakia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Missing Richard Simmons,\u2019 the Morally Suspect Podcast", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookFor decades, the fitness guru Richard Simmons was Hollywood\u2019s most accessible celebrity. He was a talk show fixture, a leader of weight loss cruises and an instructor of $12 classes at his Beverly Hills workout studio, Slimmons. He greeted tour buses in front of his mansion and called fans to support their weight loss attempts. Then, three years ago, he abruptly retreated from public life. Dan Taberski, an acquaintance of Mr. Simmons (and a Slimmons regular), wants to know why.The podcast has been compared to \u201cSerial,\u201d the real-time murder investigation (and podcasting\u2019s breakout hit). But while \u201cSerial\u201d dug into a serious crime and possible miscarriage of justice, Mr. Taberski instead relentlessly pesters Mr. Simmons and friends for personal details pertaining to his mental and physical health. It\u2019s not quite a public shaming; Mr. Taberski is careful to express respect for Mr. Simmons. Call it a public hounding.But that isn\u2019t good enough for Mr. Taberski. So he rifles through Mr. Simmons\u2019s social network, interviewing people who crossed his path and publicizing their speculation about his mental state. He urges listeners to call in with \u201cany theory you think we missed.\u201d Various potential personal crises \u2014 like the suggestion that his physical decline has made Mr. Simmons depressed, or that he\u2019s grieving the deaths of his dogs \u2014 are raised like clues, turned over by Mr. Taberski and pals, and often dismissed as unserious. Though Mr. Simmons has acknowledged suffering from depression before, that wouldn\u2019t justify a \u201ccomplete and total retreat,\u201d Mr. Taberski decides, which conveniently excuses him to keep digging.Most disquieting is a \u201cclue\u201d teased in the first episode, when a former Slimmons client says that \u201cfor the last two or three months, he was showing up in drag.\u201d In a forthcoming episode, Mr. Taberski digs into a tabloid report that Mr. Simmons is transitioning to female. He takes a moment to note that Mr. Simmons\u2019s gender identity is nobody\u2019s business but his own, then forges right ahead.Mr. Taberski ultimately decides that the report is false \u2014 Mr. Simmons himself rebutted the story on Facebook \u2014 but regardless of its veracity, it feels exploitative to spread it while simultaneously championing the podcast\u2019s great respect for Mr. Simmons\u2019s privacy. A serious journalistic transgression \u2014 outing a person \u2014 is played here as just another sensational twist to be picked apart for podcast fodder. Mr. Taberski ends the segment with a jokey shrug: \u201cBut if he is transitioning? Mazel tov. But he\u2019s not. I don\u2019t think?\u201dIs this what friends do? Turn their loved one\u2019s personal crisis into a fun mystery investigation and record it for a hit podcast? (It has topped the iTunes podcast charts for four straight weeks.) Despite his claims, Mr. Taberski is not principally a \u201cfriend\u201d to Mr. Simmons. In the podcast, he presents himself as a regular at Slimmons Studio who became friendly with the instructor, but really he was always a documentarian circling a sensational subject. (Talk of a film documentary dissolved when Mr. Simmons cut off contact with Mr. Taberski.)\u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d speaks to both the possibilities and the limits of the emerging prestige podcast form. Many of the podcast\u2019s tropes \u2014 the mystery framing, the crowdsourcing of clues from the audience and a format that focuses on the narrator as much as his subject \u2014 are borrowed directly from \u201cSerial.\u201d By turning a journalist into a friend and casting a man\u2019s personal life as a mystery, \u201cMissing Richard Simmons\u201d has retooled the stale Hollywood documentary as an addictive media sensation. But it\u2019s also turned it into a morally suspect exercise: An invasion of privacy masquerading as a love letter. Mr. Simmons is a public figure, and that gives journalists a lot of latitude to pry. But a friend who claims to want to help Mr. Simmons should probably just leave him alone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Than Just Marines Behaving Badly", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAs someone who served for six years in the Marine Corps, I\u2019ve seen my share of this kind of behavior among Marines in person and on the internet. The problem is not Facebook as a platform or \u201ca few bad apples.\u201d It\u2019s the culture the Marine Corps has created and done little to change.The Marine Corps, unlike every other service branch, segregates recruits by sex during basic training. When I went through boot camp in 2008, my fellow male Marines and I were taught to look down on our female counterparts. In my all-male platoon, my drill instructors called female Marines sluts and told stories about women\u2019s supposedly poor personal hygiene out in the field. The message we got was clear: Female Marines are disgusting and worthless and physically unsuited for the service.We rarely encountered the women or saw them train, and we were given the strong impression that the female recruits underwent less rigorous training than us. Obstacle course stations would have what my drill instructors described as the \u201cfemale,\u201d or easier, version alongside the \u201cmale,\u201d or more difficult, version. The drill instructors for the female recruits made them chant embarrassing cadences such as \u201cPrance like a pony!\u201d while half-stepping their formation past us, to humiliate them. Every interaction I had with female Marines in basic training, and every reference to them, seemed intended to foster contempt.My platoon even had a \u201cslut wall.\u201d This drill-instructor-approved bulletin board was where recruits posted photos of girlfriends who broke up with them during training. The unspoken, but clearly understood, rule was that the raunchier these photos were, the better.Once I completed training and joined my unit, the pattern didn\u2019t change. Receiving a \u201cDear John\u201d letter from a girlfriend or wife was a common experience, but the reactions often took on a toxic flavor of revenge. Text message chains including photos of a naked woman who allegedly cheated on her Marine partner came with instructions to share the photos far and wide to \u201cmake her famous.\u201dOn overseas bases, Marines circulated hard drives that held everything from pirated copies of popular TV shows to pornography. Among the pornography, there was almost always a collection of photos of naked fellow service members.When I was a junior lance corporal, my sergeant explained to me that these photos would end up on the hard drives when servicewomen would email them from communal computers to boyfriends and husbands back home, and then not fully delete them. Enterprising Marines would check the computers for these photos and add them to the universe of circulating hard drives, without the knowledge of the women.If our leaders are serious about making the Marine Corps the best it can be, and if they want to avoid repeated scandals, they must change the culture. They should start by fully integrating recruit training, instituting gender-neutral standards and making clear up and down the chain of command that this kind of behavior isn\u2019t a joke or a normal part of building cohesion but a weakness \u2014 and a betrayal of our core values of honor, courage and commitment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is President. Now Encrypt Your Email.", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn the weeks after Donald J. Trump won the election, a schism threatened to break my group of friends in two. Not a political argument brought about by the president-elect, or a philosophical fight over the future of the country, but a question of which app we should be using to chat: GroupMe or Signal?Though it\u2019s still not challenging Facebook Messenger atop the most-downloaded rankings, Signal, an open-source secure-messaging service produced by Open Whisper Systems, had a 400 percent increase in downloads in the days after the election, an incredible spike for an app developed by a small team funded by grants and donations. \u201cMillions of people used Signal before the election,\u201d Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper, told me recently, \u201cbut there has never before been a single event that resulted in such a dramatic and sustained day-over-day increase in new Signal users.\u201dSignal isn\u2019t alone in its newfound popularity. ProtonMail, a respected secure-email start-up based in Switzerland (a country with particularly strict privacy laws), has seen a sustained boost of new email sign-ups \u201cin the ballpark of a 100 percent increase compared to before Trump,\u201d according to Andy Yen, the chief executive of ProtonMail\u2019s parent company. \u201cTrump, and the U.S. election as a whole, was clearly a catalyst that brought the issue of email privacy to the forefront globally.\u201dEight years of a broadly likable president lulled liberals into information-security complacency, even as Barack Obama expanded the executive branch\u2019s surveillance powers \u2014 and made heavy use of them at home and abroad. We should have been paying closer attention to how much of our data and our communications were exposed to the government, especially after the Snowden leaks revealed the scale and extent of the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance. After those same leaks revealed the involvement of major private technology companies in government spying efforts, we should have been more careful in our use of them.But the technology was so new \u2014 in 2008, the iPhone was a year old and Gmail was still in beta \u2014 that by the end of Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, Americans were only just coming to terms with the consequences of having indiscriminately turned over the basic functions and intimate details of our lives to a handful of powerful corporations. And besides, the president just seemed like a good guy.Mr. Obama\u2019s judicious persona, which made rationalizing away his intelligence agencies\u2019 mass-surveillance programs easy, has now been replaced with the plainly vindictive and paranoid character of President Trump, who has inherited his predecessor\u2019s well-oiled security apparatus unencumbered by restraint, nuance or even a professed respect for civil liberties.This is more than a philosophical concern about the hypothetical violation of privacy rights; it\u2019s a practical one, and not just for groups who have specific fears of federal intrusion \u2014 undocumented immigrants, say, who want to communicate with family or lawyers away from the predatory gaze of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or journalists seeking to protect confidential sources.As lawyers and civil libertarians point out, federal criminal law is so vast and complicated that it is easy to unwittingly violate it, and even innocent conversation can later be used to build a criminal case. Encrypting your communication isn\u2019t a matter of hiding criminal activity; it\u2019s a matter of ensuring innocuous activity can\u2019t be deemed suspicious by a zealous prosecutor or intelligence agent. Telling a friend that a party is really going to \u201cblow up\u201d when you arrive is less funny when it\u2019s being entered into evidence against you.Even so, for many of the people now signing up for Signal or setting up encrypted email accounts, fears of an aggressive federal government are relatively minor concerns. In some sense, as the Signal skeptics in my group of friends pointed out, people are taking part in a kind of security-state LARPing \u2014 taking up security practices the way live-action role players take up plastic swords in the park.But the federal government isn\u2019t the only security threat on the internet. And for most people it\u2019s far from the most worrying. Social media is infested with roving bands of malicious hackers, far less concerned with intercepting communications for surveillance purposes than with wreaking havoc and embarrassing targets.The hacks that exposed tens of thousands of emails from the accounts of the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, and Democratic Party staff members were as loud an alarm as Mr. Trump\u2019s election. When libraries of correspondence are dumped online unedited, they\u2019re invitations to be picked apart, taken out of context and turned into the building blocks of bizarre and damaging pizza-based conspiracy theories. While the fantasy of oppressive government surveillance is appealing to the little Winston Smiths inside us \u2014 and is much more than a fantasy for many activists and journalists \u2014 practically, what most of us should fear isn\u2019t Big Brother reading our emails, but everyone else.But even if we\u2019re overly paranoid \u2014 even if there\u2019s nothing to fear from either the feds or random alt-right trouble makers \u2014 what\u2019s wrong with security LARPing? Often without realizing it, Americans have exposed vast and previously private information about ourselves to enormous tech companies, the government and, in all likelihood, malicious actors looking to mess around. If a President Trump is what it takes for liberals to think more clearly about the security of our data and communications, so be it. At worst, security LARPing \u2014 like using Signal when GroupMe would do \u2014 is an exercise in mindfulness: a daily check on your exposure. At best, it\u2019ll actually prevent a security breach.In the end, my friends and I split the difference, based on our particular threat model: We upgraded our subscription to the workplace chat software Slack. Slack doesn\u2019t have end-to-end encryption, so our messages could theoretically be intercepted, but it does include the security features we wanted most (two-factor authentication and automatic message deletion) and a handful of others we found useful (side chats dedicated to discussing various science-fiction and fantasy franchises). But we were far from the only people reconsidering our messaging choices.These days, when I open Signal, my contact list is filled with dozens of friends, many of whom aren\u2019t the journalists or activists who make up the app\u2019s theoretical core user base. A few weeks ago, I asked one why he uses Signal. \u201cYa gotta these days,\u201d he wrote back. \u201cAnd my weed guy uses it. It\u2019s why I downloaded it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gavin Grimm: The Fight for Transgender Rights Is Bigger Than Me", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byOp-ED ContributorJust over two years ago, I started my sophomore year of high school. The summer before, I had come out to my family and friends as a transgender boy. I also came out to the school administration, telling them who I was and asking them to respect my gender identity. They assured me that teachers and administrators would call me Gavin, and use male pronouns when referring to me, and if anyone gave me any kind of trouble, it would be resolved right away. By the time I started school, I had legally changed my name and I was poised to start testosterone.However, I was still anxious. I come from a fairly conservative community, and I wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d be accepted for who I am. Because of this anxiety, I did not ask permission to use the boys\u2019 restroom. I was not yet accustomed to advocating for myself, and I worried that I would be asking for too much, too soon. Instead, I used the restroom in the nurse\u2019s office.The office was far away from my classrooms that year. It took far too much time out of my day to use the restroom, especially when, in any class, I was just down the hall from a perfectly good boys\u2019 room. So I approached the administration again. This time, I asked to use the bathrooms that correspond to my gender identity. My principal told me the following day that I was free to use the boys\u2019 restrooms, and I did. For a period of roughly seven weeks, I went in and went out with no altercations of any kind. No physical or verbal confrontation. No restroom misconduct by or against me. This seven-week period showed me what it was like to be embraced by your school, and it gave me confidence that I would be able to live out a normal school year, unencumbered by restroom politics.This was, unfortunately, a false sense of security. After that seven-week period, the school board held a meeting \u2014 a public conversation about my genitals and restroom usage \u2014 without notifying me first. My mother and I found out by chance less than 24 hours before the meeting was to happen. An old friend of my mother\u2019s had noticed a post going around Facebook, a rallying cry by adults in my community urging people to show up to the meeting in order to \u201ckeep that girl out of the boy\u2019s room.\u201dI went to the meeting, in November 2014, and spoke at it. Family and a few friends stood by me, but nothing could have prepared that insecure 15 year old for what was to come. People speaking out against me made a point of referring to me with female honorifics and pronouns. They warned me that I was going to be raped or otherwise abused. They suggested that boys would sneak into the girls\u2019 room and harm their children. At a second meeting, a month later, the rhetoric was even more inflammatory. Word had spread throughout the community and people turned up in droves. After each frenzied remark, clapping and hollering reverberated throughout the room. I sat while people called me a freak. I sat while my community got together to banish a child from public life for the crime of harming no one. I sat while my school board voted to banish me to retrofitted broom closets or the nurse\u2019s restroom.And then it was over. At least it felt like it, back then. I was back to being exiled. I heard sneers and whispers about me in the hallways. My school board had invalidated me in perhaps the most humiliating way possible.But two years later \u2014 two crazy, stressful, busy, breathtaking, rewarding, beautiful, fantastic years later \u2014 I stand stronger and prouder than ever. I stand not only with my family and friends, but with millions of supporters who stand with me. I stand with so many wonderful people at the A.C.L.U. that I proudly call my family. I know now what I did not know then; I will be fine. Regardless of what obstacles come before me, regardless of what hatred or ignorance or discrimination I face, I will be fine, because I have love on my side.This case will not be resolved until after I graduate. But this fight is bigger than me. I came to realize that very early on, and it is truer now than it ever has been. This fight is for other trans youth in my high school. It is for other trans youth in Virginia. It is for all trans youth who are in school or one day will be. It is for the friends and loved ones of these youth, who want these children to be happy and healthy, rather than at risk and in danger as so many trans people are.I am often asked if I regret my actions, or if I would do anything differently if I had the chance. When people ask that, I immediately think about the hundreds of parents who have reached out to thank me on behalf of their children. I think of the hundreds of young people who have thanked me themselves. I think of the countless #StandWithGavin messages on social media, and the countless hugs and handshakes at school and on the sidewalks of my town. I think of people I\u2019ve gotten to meet and grown to love. I think of how honored I am to carry the voice, in some way, of a community so rich and so colorful and so important. I think of how I\u2019ve grown from that 15-year-old child, sitting in fear as he waits to hear what his future will be, into the young man who stands hand in hand with a huge community as we all prepare to take the next step in this fight. I think of my parents, unwavering and strong as pillars in my success and growth. And I say, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dGavin Grimm is a senior at Gloucester High School in Virginia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Miners Found a 706-Carat Diamond in Sierra Leone. Who Should Get the Profit?", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 Fist-size and lumpy, the rock that a team of miners came upon recently in the diamond fields of Sierra Leone was orange with red speckles that looked like tiny droplets of palm oil.They almost tossed it aside. The rock didn\u2019t seem like the kind of gem that diggers typically unearth in a nation with a reputation for having some of the highest quality and most transparent diamonds in the world. But the rock was unusual enough to take to a local diamond dealer.\u201cThe look on his face when he saw the rock made me believe that we discovered something extraordinary,\u201d said the Rev. Emmanuel Momoh, a pastor who runs the team of diggers who found the rock.The strange lump turned out to be one of the biggest diamonds ever uncovered in Sierra Leone \u2014 an estimated 706 carats, valued at as much as $50 million. But Mr. Momoh\u2019s decision to hand the diamond over to the Sierra Leone government to handle the sale, instead of quietly selling it himself, has set off a debate in a country where suspicion of officials runs high.Sierra Leone allows miners to sell diamonds up to a certain size, but requires them to turn over larger stones to the government to sell, with the proceeds, in theory, going to the ones who found them, minus an unspecified government tax. Often, diamonds \u2014 both large and small \u2014 are sold on the black market, depriving the government of sorely needed revenue.People on social media have been abuzz about Mr. Momoh and his discovery. Some have praised him for turning over the diamond, figuring that more money will go toward rebuilding a country that has been devastated by war and, more recently, by Ebola. But others thought he was crazy to give it up, especially to a government they think has done little for the people of the country.\u201cWhat has the government done anything for me to give them the diamond?\u201d one person posted on Facebook.President Ernest Bai Koroma, who appeared on television brandishing the gem, has tried to calm those fears, saying that the government would act in the best interests of all involved.\u201cI believe a diamond like this should be publicly sold in the country so that we know the value of it, what is due to the government and what is due to the people so that everyone can have their share,\u201d Mr. Koroma said.Diamonds \u2014 especially so-called conflict, or blood, diamonds used by warlords to fund wars that have racked the region \u2014 have long been at the center of controversy in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa.The rock uncovered by Mr. Momoh\u2019s crew is not the first big gem to surface in Sierra Leone, or the first to generate controversy.Mr. Momoh is a preacher in a small church in Kono, a district in eastern Sierra Leone, and sells peanuts as a side business. He also owns a mining license for a small diamond field and has been running a crew of miners for the past six years.In many diamond-mining communities in Sierra Leone, those owning the land where gems are buried are required to secure a government-issued license to mine them. But mining licenses are cumbersome to obtain and can be expensive, so landowners and chiefs often work with entrepreneurs such as Mr. Momoh to buy the licenses. The entrepreneurs have almost total ownership of whatever is mined, paying a negotiated percentage of the take to the landowners.Even so, miners and license holders also tend to receive very little revenue for their discoveries \u2014 which are the result of very hard work. Miners work under harsh conditions, using heavy tools to dig out sacks of dirt to create large pits that often collapse, causing deaths or severe injuries.And when diamonds are found, the miners are so desperate for money they will often accept far less than the market value of the stones. In Kono, the nation\u2019s main diamond mining district, dealers are still predominantly foreign \u2014 including Lebanese, Guineans, Gambians and Malians \u2014 and officials say that they spirit the diamonds out of the country to avoid paying taxes to the government.\u201cThe entire diamond business is dominated by foreigners,\u201d said Paul Saquee, the head chief in Tankoro, in Kono District. \u201cI don\u2019t want to indict all of them, but they discourage local miners from handing diamonds to the government in order to smuggle them out the country.\u201dLocal miners and license holders also accuse the government and traditional leaders of keeping proceeds of diamond sales for themselves and accepting bribes from foreign companies.In 2003, a miner found a rock that was believed to be a huge diamond. Excitement about the discovery spread across the country, amid expectations that the proceeds would go to much-needed infrastructure projects.But experts cited by the government said the stone was corundum, another mineral. Many citizens believed that individuals within the government lied in order to keep the proceeds for themselves.When the miners in Koyadu, a small village in eastern Sierra Leone, found their rock, they handed it over to Mr. Momoh so that he could have it examined.Mr. Momoh, accompanied by the miners, took it to a Lebanese businessman who had a reputation for buying without delay. The dealer confirmed it was a diamond, and a major discovery.Everyone cheered.Mr. Momoh wanted to alert the village chief to the gem, he said, but an argument broke out in the dealer\u2019s shop.The dealer proposed keeping the discovery quiet so that the men who had uncovered the diamond could find a buyer and take the proceeds for themselves without paying tax, according to Mr. Momoh. Discussions over what to do stretched for hours.Eventually Mr. Momoh and the dealer agreed to take the diamond to the chief of the village, who insisted that the gem, because of its size, be handed over to the government.Government officials placed the diamond, and a document attesting that Mr. Momoh was its owner, in a vault at the country\u2019s central bank.Last week, an official statement from the government said proceeds from the sale would benefit the country.Officials have already contacted interested buyers, said Alhaji Ajibu Jalloh, the deputy spokesman for the government. The government will update the public on the sale with radio and television broadcasts, he said.\u201cWe understand there are doubts as to who will benefit from this diamond \u2014 that is why the government is doing everything in public and in a transparent way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pastor will have his share, the community where the diamond was discovered will have its share and everyone else involved will have their share of the proceeds.\u201dMr. Momoh said government officials have regularly been in touch with him and have repeatedly promised to give him his share of the proceeds, but he\u2019s worried: So far no one has told him what his cut will be.\u201cI want to contribute in the development of my community, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to be a beggar in about 10 or 15 years from now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But the changes, which will be introduced in the coming weeks, highlight the difficult balance between protecting Google\u2019s advertising business while also allowing free speech.By giving brands more say over where their ads appear, experts say, Google is acknowledging that it has not done enough so far to police the material on its sites.Last year, Alphabet made $19.5 billion in net profit, a 23 percent annual jump, almost all of which was generated from Google\u2019s advertising business.Google\u2019s public mea culpa follows the pulling of ads by Havas, a French advertising multinational. Havas withdrew spots for several of its clients from the search giant\u2019s digital services in Britain after failing to receive assurances that they would not be shown next to offensive material.As part of the advertising revamp, Google said that it would rigorously vet online content that could be considered hate speech or derogatory content. That would include giving brands greater say over where their ads would be shown online, and powers to remove them if companies were still not satisfied.The company said that it would hire more staff members to police its advertising standards, adding that it would also use artificial intelligence and other technology to remove harmful content.\u201cWe believe the combination of these new policies and controls will significantly strengthen our ability to help advertisers,\u201d Mr. Schindler said.Google refrained, however, from saying that it would actively remove material before it had been flagged by users, a move that some policy makers, notably in Europe, have called for.Google\u2019s stance has come under increased scrutiny in recent months with the rise of so-called fake news and with hate speech connected to elections in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.Some freedom of speech campaigners have urged Google to stand its ground, but policy makers around the world have called on the company to do more to combat the spread of offensive material on the internet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Ben Still Tolled", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 I was leaving work and putting on my motorcycle jacket when news broke of an attack on Parliament. As a print and video journalist, I always carry a \u201cgo bag\u201d of notebooks, camera equipment and a phone charger, especially after London\u2019s police chief warned last year that a terrorist attack in the city of my birth was \u201ca case of when, not if.\u201d So I ran straight to the motorcycle.As I rode across town, I received phone calls and text messages confirming an attack, so I sped toward Westminster and slammed the bike onto the last side street before Parliament Square itself. All still seemed very calm. \u201cBloke with a knife. Someone\u2019s down,\u201d a maintenance worker vouchsafed as he sat eating his sandwich outside the Red Lion pub. And then he went on with his sandwich.London, innit?It is a very strange feeling to report on a city that you have known for decades, both as a news reporter and as a media consumer of its biscuit-tin, iconic images. Big Ben almost isn\u2019t a real thing to me anymore; it\u2019s ever-present on television and movies and social media, much like the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building. It has become more of a symbol, a celluloid emoji used by tourists and filmmakers as a shorthand way of conveying time and place.My 6-year-old daughter puts her pocket money into a miniaturized version of the clock tower. Then people suddenly die beneath it, and reality crashes headlong into artifice.Yet there is work to be done. That sounds easy enough, in the middle of a major city. But in the journalistic trinity of \u201cget it first, get it right, get it out,\u201d the get-it-out part is harder than it sounds. For the newspaper and the website, emailing quotes and facts back to the office is relatively easy; it\u2019s all done on cellphone, or a laptop balanced on a window ledge.But transmitting video clips, far bigger packets of information, is next to impossible when thousands of people are all simultaneously trying to use the same cellphone network in the same place to send photographs, to scroll through news websites or to update their Facebook safety status. One bar of reception in a war zone can be more accommodating than four bars beside the River Thames in a world capital.Once I had spoken to the witnesses, the only option was to move away from Parliament and find a sweet spot of cellphone reception, far enough away from the area of heavy phone use and yet near enough to have a continuing sense of what was happening. Not least for the possibility of a secondary attack on that inviting maelstrom of emergency workers, survivors, witnesses, bystanders and journalists. And sealing the whole area off, a cordon of police officers, some old enough to remember the Irish Republican Army attacks of decades past, some brought up in the era of jihadist violence.At one point, during a live video interview near Parliament, it was too dark for me to read the time on my watch clearly. Then behind me came seven bongs from Big Ben \u2014 which is the bell, not the clock, as every Londoner knows. It is a symbol, and yet it is also Westminster\u2019s working timepiece.Of course, the symbolic status of the Parliament building and its democratic institutions also make the landmark site a target for those who want to send a loud message by attacking it.So far, so very, very London.Past us walked Kirsten Hurrell, who sold newspapers opposite the Parliament building. She was moving briskly, carrying for refreshment a glass containing an ample measure of some amber liquid. Behind her, police officers emerged from Parliament Square pushing everyone back and shouting, \u201cMove back, back, all the way back past Downing Street.\u201dJust ahead was the jarring sight of a scarlet ambulance helicopter parked on the grass of Parliament Square itself, right next to the bronze statue of Sir Winston Churchill.The deaths caused on Wednesday by Khalid Masood saddened and chastened everyone in the city lucky enough to be able to go about their business that day. Yet violence, and the threat of it, are nothing new. Parliament itself has come under attack before. In 1605, Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the palace of Westminster using barrels of gunpowder. And a courtroom directly opposite the Parliament building used to display a list of judges dating all the way back to George Jeffreys, the Hanging Judge, who in 1685 had more than 100 people executed at the Bloody Assizes following a failed rebellion.Two months before Mr. Masood plowed his vehicle into innocent people on Westminster bridge, that same bridge had to be closed while an unexploded World War II bomb was dredged up from the river, a stark reminder of the tens of thousands of Britons killed in London and other cities by German bombing raids during the Blitz from September 1940 to May 1941.That is still within living memory. I am too young to remember \u201cthe war,\u201d as it is still called, but there was still a bomb shelter at my school in the 1960s, reminding us. Every Londoner is brought up on tales of defiance and resolution showed by the city\u2019s civilian population during that era. And all Londoners now commute daily past the statues, buildings and memorials that stand like pieces on a chessboard, commemorating centuries of war, conflict, empire and colonialism, of violence meted out, violence suffered and violence defied.Furthermore, many who are now Londoners have in recent years fled conflicts in the Balkans, Middle East, South Asia and elsewhere, having experienced atrocities far more recent than most of us.So no, the city did not panic.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Revolution? What Revolution?\u2019 Russia Asks 100 Years Later", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin plans to sit out the centenary of the Russian Revolution.Never mind that the upheavals of 1917 transformed the country and the world, abruptly ending the long rule of the czars, ushering in the Communist era and spawning an ideological confrontation with the West that still resonates.There will be no national holiday on Sunday, March 12, the date generally recognized as the start of the uprising. Nor will there even be a government-issued official interpretation, like the one mandating that World War II was a \u201cGreat Victory.\u201dThe official reason proffered for ignoring the event is that Russia remains too divided over the consequences of that fateful year.The more likely explanation, some Kremlin officials, historians and other analysts say, is that President Vladimir V. Putin loathes the very idea of revolution, not to mention the thought of Russians dancing in the streets to celebrate the overthrow of any ruler. Moreover, 1917 smudges the Kremlin\u2019s version of Russian history as a long, unified march to greatness, meant to instill a sense of national pride and purpose.For the record, the Kremlin is sticking to the official line of avoiding domestic discord.\u201cFor one group of people, the revolution was the death knell of Great Russia \u2014 it was \u2018Brexit,\u2019 when we stopped our development in Europe,\u201d said Mikhail Shvydkoy, Mr. Putin\u2019s special representative on cultural matters, in an interview in the wood-paneled cafe at the Central House of Writers, a prerevolutionary mansion. \u201cFor many other people, the Soviet past was the best time of their lives.\u201dMr. Putin strives to unite the country, he said, whereas \u201cany festivities on the state level would deepen those divisions.\u201dDespite the widespread perception that the czar was overthrown in what the Soviets called the Great October Socialist Revolution, there were two revolutions in 1917. The February Revolution (now falling in March, given a different calendar) deposed the czar and replaced him with a provisional government that introduced liberal reforms like universal suffrage. Eight months later, Lenin and his marginal Bolshevik faction engineered a remarkable coup that gave rise to the world\u2019s first communist state.Mr. Putin\u2019s critiques of the revolution contrast markedly with his usual glowing tributes to Russian history.\u201cWe know well the consequences that these great upheavals can bring,\u201d he said in his state of the federation speech in December. \u201cUnfortunately, our country went through many such upheavals and their consequences in the 20th century.\u201dAt an earlier public forum, after disparaging Lenin, he said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t need the world revolution.\u201dThe president shunted the anniversary off into the realm of academia, appointing a special committee to organize seminars and the like.Previously, the official narrative was an essay written by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, in which he argued that deep distrust between the court and the educated elite along with German meddling brought about catastrophe.The latter fits the Kremlin narrative that Russia has long been besieged by foreign aggressors and that the West strives to implant friendly governments everywhere by sponsoring \u201ccolor revolutions.\u201d Columnists have been lumping 1917 among more recent color revolutions in places like Georgia and Ukraine, naturally listing the United States among the suspected agitators.There is also a damning lack of heroic figures in the revolution. Czar Nicholas II was deposed and thus weak. Alexander F. Kerensky, the central figure in the provisional government, proved ineffective. Lenin fomented appalling bloodshed and destroyed the Russian Orthodox Church, a pillar of Mr. Putin\u2019s support.\u201cVladimir Putin cannot compare himself to Nicholas II, nor to Lenin nor to Kerensky, because that is not Russian history to be proud of,\u201d said Mikhail Zygar, a Russian journalist and the author of a best-selling book, \u201cAll the Kremlin\u2019s Men,\u201d which details the inner workings of the Putin government. \u201cIn terms of 1917, nothing can be used as a propaganda tool.\u201dIn comparison, the Kremlin has turned World War II into the apogee of national unity.In the absence of official spin, other factions are only too happy to provide some, often referring to current events. At one recent forum, Vladimir R. Medinsky, the conservative minister of culture, said the revolution underscored the dangers of letting liberals rule, because they always put self-interest above Russia.Metropolitan Hilarion of the Russian Orthodox Church, speaking at the same event, lambasted those who destroyed the czarist state rather than seeking compromise.Liberals retort that a repressive government ignoring vast income disparity and curbing basic rights should be worried about history repeating itself.\u201cThe authorities cannot celebrate 1917,\u201d said Nikita Sokolov, a historian. \u201cWhatever might have happened, the impulse of the revolution was social justice. A country with such inequality can\u2019t celebrate this. Also, the authorities think that any revolution is a color revolution.\u201dFor the Communist Party \u2014 an ever-weaker link in the loyal opposition \u2014 the establishment of the Soviet Union was a singular achievement. It plans to celebrate not least with parades in Moscow and elsewhere on Nov. 7, which in Soviet times was the main national holiday.Amid the mudslinging, there are efforts to bring the momentous events to life.Mr. Zygar, a former editor in chief of the independent TV Rain news channel, established one of the more ambitious projects, called Project 1917.On March 8, for example, as the St. Petersburg bread riots gathered steam, there is Nicholas II lamenting that his children have the measles. Others focused on the mushrooming chaos. Mikhail Rodzianko, the head of the Duma, or Parliament, wrote, \u201cSomething was broken today, and the state machine derailed.\u201dOn March 15, the day of his abdication, the czar wrote, \u201cAll around there is treason, cowardice and deceit.\u201d The next day he mentioned reading a book about Julius Caesar, then avoided political references until April, Mr. Zygar noted.If the emperor was phlegmatic, scores of others are more stimulating. It was the era of Russian giants in literature, ballet, painting, music and movies \u2014 people like Serge Diaghilev, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Eisenstein, Vladimir Mayakovsky and Kazimir Malevich. Political figures such as Lenin, Maxim Gorky and Leon Trotsky weigh in often.\u201cAlmost all the most famous Russians known in the world happened to live at that time,\u201d said Mr. Zygar, who was first inspired to write a history of the epoch called \u201cThe Empire Must Die,\u201d and then dreamed up the website to try to reach a wider audience.Many historians and others note that Russia lives with a certain ambivalence toward 1917. Although many perceive it as having wrecked the country, its symbols are still enmeshed in the fabric of daily life.At a recent forum, Leonid Reshetnikov, a historian and retired lieutenant general in Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, described trying to explain to his granddaughter why the city of Yekaterinburg had a church dedicated to the czar and his family, who were canonized by the church, as well as a monument to Yakov Sverdlov, the local Bolshevik commander believed to have ordered them shot there.\u201cWe live in historical schizophrenia, with these monuments to Lenin, to all of them,\u201d he said, going on to denounce any street protesters as potential revolutionaries.\u201cHow do we explain to young people that they must not be revolutionaries, that they must be loyal citizens \u2014 yes, fight for Russia, wish it well, but under no circumstances plot, overthrow, march, kill?\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on March 11 about the Kremlin\u2019s plans to sit out the centenary of the Russian Revolution misidentified, in some editions, the subject of a statue in the city of Yekaterinburg and the man who a historian said had ordered Czar Nicholas II and his family shot there. The statue is of Yakov Sverdlov, a local Bolshevik commander, not Lenin. And while it has never been firmly established who issued the order to kill the royal family, the man the historian was referring to was Sverdlov, not Lenin.Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "What would it mean to shed light on a part of history that remains largely invisible because it was conducted in secret and under cover of night? This was the challenge faced by Colson Whitehead, for example, in his award-winning novel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Underground Railroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A clandestine and loosely organized network of activists, safe houses and secret routes, the actual Underground Railroad shepherded as many as 100,000 slaves to freedom in the six decades before the Civil War. Its route would eventually traverse free states from Maine to Iowa, extending as far north as Canada. Through the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program, a number of associated sites along the route have been identified and preserved. We also know the names of some of the brave black and white \u201cconductors\u201d who guided fugitive slaves, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstation masters\u00e2\u0080\u009d who ran safe houses in barns, churches, homes, caves or dug-out riverbanks. But the visual experiences of this journey have remained relatively obscure.In Mr. Whitehead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel, which tells the story of a teenage slave named Cora, an abiding metaphor allowed him to summon a magical, dreamlike vision of this passage: He imagined the Underground Railroad as an actual train operated by engineers and conductors, transporting fugitives beneath the southern soil to liberation in the North. For the photographer Jeanine Michna-Bales, however, the challenge was more concrete: how to portray the paths and havens that, two centuries ago, had functioned as an itinerary for emancipation.Ms. Michna-Bales\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quest has led to an evocative book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThrough Darkness to Light: Photographs along the Underground Railroad\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Princeton Architectural Press). While much has been written about the subject, there has been little visual documentation, an absence that makes the book even more consequential, both from the standpoint of history and of our contemporary understanding of slavery in pre-Civil War America. The book also includes a foreword by Andrew J. Young, a civil rights leader, a history of the Railroad by the historian Fergus M. Bordewich, and a recounting of the journeys of three former slaves, including Frederick Douglass, by the scholar Eric R. Jackson.A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.In her book, Ms. Michna-Bales envisions a single passage north, from Louisiana to Ontario. Her photographs are dark, atmospheric and haunting, depicting the 1,400-mile trek through forests, swamps, safe houses and other refuges along the way. They evoke both a sense of the adventure and peril of this journey, one that would have dire consequences if unsuccessful.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrowing up in the Midwest, the Underground Railroad was understandably an important part of our school curriculum given that some of the routes ran literally through our backyards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Ms. Michna-Bales. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI became fascinated with the topic and often imagined what it must have been like to walk thousands of miles for the chance to be free.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYears later, Ms. Michna-Bales, who is white and among a small number of white artists committed to exploring the issues of race in America, began to imagine \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat the journey north to freedom on the Underground Railroad would have looked like through the eyes of one individual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While conducting research at the Indiana Historical Society library she stumbled on a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgold mine\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094  a clip file that contained newspaper articles, photocopies of research papers, and other documents relating to the Railroad. In the early Fall of 2012, while visiting her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family in Tennessee, Ms. Michna-Bales made her first photographs in the series. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had some prints made after returning home, and one image stood out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled in the book. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a forest at night that evoked such a sense of mystery and foreboding that I knew this was exactly how I wanted to shoot the entire series.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer photo essay progresses dramatically: a ramshackle cabin on the Magnolia Plantation in Louisiana glows against the backdrop of the night sky; a slave cemetery in Jefferson County, Miss.; an upward and hopeful glance at a star-filled sky in Colbert County, Ala.; twisted thicket emerging from the forest floor in Tennessee; the first view of a free state, the gently rolling hills along the Ohio River crossing into Indiana; the \u00e2\u0080\u009cOld Slave House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which belonged to the Rev. Guy Beckley in Lower Town, Mich.; and finally, freedom, represented as verdant trees photographed against a bright but cloudy sky in Sarnia, Ontario. These dark and brooding photographs also evoke the radical underground\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groundbreaking activism: though devoid of people, they suggest the acts of bravery done in the shadow of an ever-powerful and dangerous white supremacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Underground Railroad has been described as the first civil rights movement in the United States because it blurred racial, gender, religious and socio-economic lines and united people in the common cause of ending the injustice of slavery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Mr. Young.There is one striking difference, however, between the two movements: If the modern struggle for civil rights was arguably the most visually documented American political movement of its time, the Underground Railroad was undoubtedly one of the least.

Everyone\u2019s behavior in this story is problematic: the man who burned the Quran, the prosecutor who charged him with blasphemy and the free-speech advocates railing against the charges.On the other hand, curtailing free speech is the wrong way to combat sectarianism.Yet regulating speech to stem extremist sentiments is no answer either. It will only reinforce the nationalists\u2019 claim that they are the true defenders of people\u2019s liberties against the oppression of political correctness by the elite. And even narrow restrictions on speech set a dangerous precedent: They can be turned into a terrific tool to suppress other political and religious views.After Mr. Hedegaard was shot at in 2013, various Muslim groups spoke out against the attack and defended his right to express his views, no matter how offensive to them. That position \u2014 full openness, not regulation \u2014 is the best way forward, and it\u2019s inspiring that Muslim groups that have been targeted verbally, and perhaps insulted, are making the case.

We don\u2019t have very many possessions at this point since we move every couple of months. We are staying in a small one-bedroom apartment since it\u2019s just my husband and 4-year-old.We spend our extra money attacking our debt while also nurturing the hobbies that we finally have time for. For me that\u2019s books, music, hiking and traveling. Plus, my job is kind of like a working vacation sometimes! I don\u2019t want to work just to survive. That\u2019s not life.We will continue to live below our means when it comes to our \u201cset costs\u201d like housing and transportation. We don\u2019t spend much on material goods. Our disposable income will go toward enjoying life and doing what we love.I drive an older car, have a roommate, rarely eat (or drink) out in order to save money to fund trips, buy hobby-related toys, and build a runway to allow pickiness in the future job market. I also prioritize living in a cool place with lots of hiking opportunities over income, relative to most people.Also having a blast in grad school, when I (presumably) could be making more going into some more lucrative field. Ditto for choosing majors in undergrad (though I\u2019d have done that differently, in retrospect).Buying our ranch-style house newly-built in an older, established neighborhood saved us a lot of money in the home-buying process. We don\u2019t have the biggest house in the neighborhood, but it is comfortable, modern and adequate for our needs. The best thing we\u2019ve done financially is refinance our mortgage few years ago.We are not taking a big vacation for the next four years until our oldest child graduates from college debt-free thanks to a fully-funded scholarship for grad school and attending a service academy for her undergraduate degree. Part-time work throughout the year allows us to increase our savings. These savings allow us to add additional money to our principal and pay our house off even quicker.My husband and I are in our early 40s and our house will be paid off when we turn 50. Saving money and trading off now so we can enjoy the value of not having to pay a mortgage is what I am most looking forward to.My husband, daughter, two cats and I live in a travel trailer in a campground \u2014 $600/month covers rent, utilities, water, sewer, trash, and cable. Plus there is a year-round pool and hot tub! While we work on downsizing more, our other possessions are stored.My husband and I live in the Bay Area and just bought a condo. That was a trade-off. We wanted a single family home. We planned to have two kids, but with the cost of day care here at $1,800 to $2,000 a month for infant care we don\u2019t plan on expanding our family for quite awhile.We budget for food every week and keep our costs down. Lots of our friends with disposable income do more activities, but we don\u2019t do that as I am a teacher. We don\u2019t have cable, but we have Hulu, Netflix, and internet. We always put our son first \u2014 that is our number one. We budget for everything, and we don\u2019t take vacations unless to see family.Every time I spent hundreds of dollars on classroom supplies, that was money I could have put toward saving for my own family, which stings now that we\u2019re ready to start one. My husband, also a teacher, and I have actually talked at length about how to get by in our classrooms while refusing to spend any more of our own money on supplies. My classes have been pretty bare bones lately.I\u2019m a solo mom, so it\u2019s just my income and no child support. I meal-plan for the week, so I only buy what I need at the grocery store. I cook 3-4 days out of the week, and then we do leftovers the other nights. My daughter packs all of her lunches on Sunday so that we don\u2019t need school lunch. I bring my drinks, breakfast bars and lunch to work.We have no TV/internet because we are rarely home, and I like for us to be outdoors, or my daughter is constantly reading. I skip a lot of invitations because it costs too much to go out to eat.I do all of this because my daughter chose to swim competitively. So, between paying for before/after school care and her swimming, there isn\u2019t much left (after rent, utilities, etc.). We do live in a nice house, and I love to provide that for her. I\u2019m very fortunate that I have family that will watch her for free and shuttle her from school to practice, as needed.My daughter has been in love with polar bears her whole life, and she even collected donations in lieu of gifts one year for Polar Bears International. I want to save money so she can see them in the wild before it\u2019s too late.I\u2019m retired and single, so I have to be careful with my money. Instead of paying for cable TV, I watch DVDs from the library, stream stuff over the internet or read a book. I make coffee at home instead of going to Starbucks, and I shop at the thrift store.My car, bought in 2001, was paid for long ago, and I plan to keep driving it until it drops. I save enough each month to visit my granddaughter once in a while. I have a pension, Social Security and retirement savings. I also have health insurance through Medicare and my former employer. I\u2019m one of the lucky ones.My trade-off is living abroad. I would be living paycheck to paycheck in the same position in the U.S. I am able to save money, travel, and do so many things I enjoy because I work in Beijing.Advertisement"}

The \u201cwhump\u201d is the sound of the thickened filling bumping against the top crust as it bubbles at a steady pace.\u201cI call it the heartbeat of the pie,\u201d she said.Ms. McDermott, who is 63 and lives in Port Angeles, Wash., leads intensive baking seminars across the country. But before she became a pie coach, she was a professional musician. \u201cI experience the world primarily through sound,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to pies since I started baking them.\u201dAny experienced cook knows that there is much more to cooking than just taste. There is touch (tapping the top of a pie to make sure it is completely firm), smell (inhaling the changing scents of the crust as it bakes), sound (listening to its heartbeat) and sight (watching for the juices to turn thick).Learn to use all five senses in the kitchen and you\u2019ll become a better cook \u2014 especially if you sharpen the ones that are less associated with cooking: hearing, touch and smell.\u201cIt\u2019s like my fingertips have become my eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cI can learn so much more by touch than I would have thought.\u201dMs. Ha, who lives in Houston, learned to cook only after she could no longer see. Like about 90 percent of visually impaired people, she is not completely blind: She can see some light and color, and describes her view of the world as \u201clike looking into a steamy mirror.\u201d All the more impressive, then, that in 2012 she won the third season of the frenetic television cooking competition \u201cMasterChef.\u201dShe started cooking with her late mother\u2019s deep-fried spring rolls, reverse-engineering them through touch and hearing as well as taste and smell. Her fingers test the pliability of the wrappers; she listens for the sound the bubbling oil makes when she throws in a bit of filling to test its heat; she taps the frying rolls with tongs to test whether the shells are crisp and blistered.David Linden, a neurobiologist at Johns Hopkins University and the author of the book \u201cTouch,\u201d confirmed that the fingertips become more sensitive in people who are blind from birth and in those who learn to read Braille. \u201cHearing and touch become more acute in the absence of sight,\u201d he said. The part of the brain dedicated to gathering information from the eyes actually shrinks in size, while the parts that receive signals from the ears and touch-sensitive nerve endings grow larger.Dr. Linden said, however, there is no comparable adaptation for people who lose their ability to taste and smell, a condition called anosmia. \u201cPeople who become anosmic are much more likely to stop cooking and eating than people who become deaf or blind,\u201d he said; anosmics are also at much greater risk for depression and suicide. \u201cThe shared experience of food seems to be one of the things that makes us human.\u201dKate Crohan, who teaches cooking at the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, Mass., said that culinary education for the blind often relies on heating prepared foods in microwaves \u2014 a safe and practical option, but one that eliminates much of the sensory experience. Ms. Crohan, 68, has been blind since birth, but she took over the family kitchen when she was 11, after her mother\u2019s death, cooking for her father and five siblings. She has been cooking without sight for so long that she is entirely comfortable around sharp knives, boiling water and raw ingredients.\u201cAn organized kitchen is more than half the battle,\u201d said Ms. Crohan, who has memorized the location and shape of key ingredients like baking soda, flour and onions. \u201cI don\u2019t waste a lot of time finding things.\u201dThese workarounds can be useful to any cook. Many of the important cues in any kitchen have nothing to do with sight or taste: distinguishing the sound of a boil versus a simmer; knowing the feel of a rare steak versus a medium-well one; biting into pasta as it cooks to catch the brief, perfect moment between chewy and soft.For most of human history, children learned those cues simply by being near the stove. But today, unless they spend a lot of time in a kitchen, their sensory cooking skills may be limited to listening for the moment when the microwave popcorn stops popping. Those children grow up to be cooks who focus on reading and rereading recipes, often at the expense of paying attention to the stove.But recipes are inherently limited when it comes to sensory information. An instruction like \u201csimmer over low heat for 30 minutes, until thickened\u201d can produce endlessly different results. The recipe doesn\u2019t know what your stove considers \u201clow\u201d heat. It doesn\u2019t know what your pan is made of. It doesn\u2019t know what \u201cthickened\u201d looks like to you.That\u2019s why the best cooks learn to work not just with their minds and their taste buds, but also with all their senses.The cooking teacher James Peterson uses a chicken breast to teach students how to feel for doneness, because it has thick and thin areas. \u201cAs it cooks in the skillet, keep your fingers moving from the thin part to the thick,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to feel how the heat gradually moves through the meat.\u201dEdna Lewis, the doyenne of American Southern cooking, taught that listening to a cake is the best way to know when it\u2019s done. A cake that is still baking makes little bubbling and ticking sounds, but a finished cake goes quiet.Like any chef, he knew how to braise a collagen-rich cut of meat to make it meltingly tender and umami-rich. But he wanted more: the crust of a steak and, for good measure, the juiciness of prime rib. Eventually, by steaming the meat in big pieces and applying a coat of cracked peppercorns, he reached his goal. (According to Dr. Linden, this quest makes sense: The most universally liked mouthfeel across human cultures is a crispy crust around a soft interior, like Middle Eastern falafel, Japanese tempura, Italian arancini, Indian samosas and French fries.)In Mr. Smillie\u2019s thrice-roasted chicken recipe (cooked first on the stovetop, then in the oven, then back to the stove to be basted in butter), all three steps move the dish toward a particular mouthfeel as well as flavor. Well before the cooking begins, the chicken is brined (for juicy flesh), then air-dried in the refrigerator (for crisp skin). All along the way, Mr. Smillie is touching, listening, sniffing, prodding: paying attention to all the cues that make the dish transcend the category of \u201croast chicken.\u201d\u201cSensory cooking is the opposite of technique,\u201d Mr. Smillie said. \u201cThe formulas you learn in culinary school won\u2019t make you a chef, but cooking with all your senses will.\u201dThe most recent multisensory development is the connection between food and autonomous sensory meridian response, or A.S.M.R. A newly defined sensory state, A.S.M.R. is a kind of pleasurable shivering or tingling that spreads along the scalp, upper back and shoulders in response to soothing repetitive sounds. Originally, these included soft whispering, pages turning or having one\u2019s hair brushed.A.S.M.R. may provide a pleasurable new way for Ms. McDermott to experience pie. She learned that she had celiac disease in 2006 and can no longer eat most of the pies she teaches others to make (though she has devised a gluten-free crust recipe). When a particularly beautiful specimen comes out of the oven, she said she appreciated it nonetheless.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I can\u2019t eat this pie,\u201d she said. \u201cI can see it, I can smell it, I can touch it. The only sense I can\u2019t have for it is taste.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture credit with this article misidentified the photographer for Christine Ha\u2019s portrait.

Thus, in a manner of speaking, did he provide the dead with an afterlife.That was his official job. Unofficially \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and surreptitiously \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he recorded the devastating realities of ghetto life: Public hangings. A boy collapsed in the street from hunger. Corpses and body parts laid out in a morgue. People herded into cattle cars for deportation to death camps at Chelmno nad Nerem and Auschwitz.He captured those images at no small risk to his safety. Sometimes he shot through holes in walls or cracks in doors. On occasion, he flicked open his overcoat, took a photo, then quickly covered up his camera.Sensing that the end was near, Mr. Ross put 6,000 of his negatives in canisters, placed them in a wooden container lined with tar, and buried them by his house on Jagielonska Street. There needed to be \u00e2\u0080\u009csome record of our tragedy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said years later.On Jan. 19, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated the ghetto, by then a shell of its former self. The Nazis, ever meticulous, had conducted a census in June 1940 and counted 160,320 Jews. By the liberation, only 877 had survived, Henryk Ross among them. That March, he dug up his trove of visual testimony. About half of the 6,000 negatives had been ruined by moisture. Others were in various states of deterioration. But enough of them survived to make good on Mr. Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vow to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleave a historical record of our martyrdom\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to show how those who perished once lived.Not all of his images were grim. There are pictures of birthday parties, of a young woman smiling in a garden, of a little girl on a swing, of a couple kissing. Some of Lodz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jews lived comparatively well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for a while, anyway \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including the families of men who served in the police force and other branches of ghetto administration. Ultimately, of course, death awaited nearly everyone.Still, some things are eternal. One photo in the exhibition is particularly striking. It is also, appropriately, the last image in a book of Mr. Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work that the Ontario gallery published with Yale University Press in 2015. It shows a man standing atop the rubble of a destroyed synagogue in Lodz. He is carrying a Torah scroll that he had managed to save from the ruins.

{"Headline": "In Battle for Digital India, Vodafone Teams Up With Idea Cellular", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byIndia is fast becoming the new battleground for global technology and telecommunications giants, as Facebook, Vodafone and others vie to connect the country\u2019s population of 1.2 billion to the internet.The fight took another turn on Monday when Vodafone, a British carrier, announced that it was combining its Indian unit with Idea Cellular, a local operator, in a $23 billion deal that would create one of the world\u2019s largest cellphone providers, with roughly 400 million subscribers in India.The country\u2019s cellphone industry is undergoing a drastic overhaul, as more Indians make the digital leap.In recent years, the use of smartphones, which can be bought for as little as $20, has ballooned, and Indians have rushed to digital services like Google and Facebook. India is already Facebook\u2019s largest market, based on number of users. Local start-ups like Flipkart, a growing e-commerce player, have taken on the likes of Amazon.\u201cWhen I get home, if my kids need help with their homework, they Google it on my phone,\u201d said Sikendar Kumar Jha, 37, a chauffeur in Mumbai whose family lives near the border with Nepal. \u201cMy wife and kids live here with me, but I video chat with my brothers in my village.\u201dThe explosion of internet usage has created cutthroat competition among carriers seeking ever faster mobile networks and cheaper data packages in a country where consumers are particularly sensitive to price. And the dynamic has prompted a flurry of investments and deals.\u201cConsolidation in the Indian market is the name of the game,\u201d said Rishi Tejpal, an analyst in Gurgaon, India, for Gartner, a technology research company. \u201cThe survival of 10 to 12 local operators isn\u2019t a long-term reality.\u201dThe companies said the merger would allow them to invest heavily in faster mobile networks across India. Those networks, called fourth generation, or 4G, are a basic requirement for movie streaming and watching TV programs on smartphones.While many in India already have so-called feature phones \u2014 rudimentary devices with limited, or no, access to the web \u2014 operators are trying to coax people to invest in budget smartphones that can take advantage of mobile data. Such services offer higher returns than carriers\u2019 traditional voice or text message offerings.\u201cWe have responded effectively to the newcomer,\u201d Vittorio Colao, Vodafone\u2019s chief executive, said on Monday, referring to Reliance Industries and its free offerings. \u201cAnyone who gives anything away for free in life has to charge, inevitably.\u201dThe merger is expected to close by late 2018. Vodafone would retain a 45 percent stake in the business, while the Aditya Birla Group, Idea\u2019s majority shareholder, would hold a 26 percent stake. Idea\u2019s other shareholders would own the remaining stock.The promise of India\u2019s large market has caught the attention of some of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest companies, too.Analysts say the main instigator for the latest merger was the entrance of Jio last year. Jio quickly drew about 100 million subscribers, thanks largely to its free voice and data packages for new users.Reliance has invested at least $25 billion to build a fast mobile network across India, and that has forced rivals to cut their prices and to spend big to try to keep pace. Reliance plans to pare back its free offerings by the end of March. Instead, it will encourage users to buy low-cost monthly data plans, in which voice calls are expected to remain free of charge.For Indians, the price war has led to a flurry of mobile data offers, allowing many to connect to the internet at significantly discounted rates. That has allowed subscribers to use digital services, such as those from Google and Uber, that would previously have been prohibitively expensive.Varun Mahtani, 30, a stock trader in Mumbai, signed up with Jio in December, combining the carrier\u2019s free data plans with his existing Vodafone subscription.Mr. Mahtani uses a smartphone with a so-called dual SIM that allows him to toggle back and forth between the two carriers, depending on which one offers him the best rate. That strategy has let him cut his Vodafone cost by 75 percent, to just $6 a month, while increasing his average internet usage.\u201cI use data constantly \u2014 Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube \u2014 in addition to work,\u201d said Mr. Mahtani, adding that if Jio cut back on its free offerings, he would likely switch to another provider. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be a consumer.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from MumbaiAdvertisement"}

I am deeply saddened that she will never get to enjoy grandchildren, a long retirement and growing old gracefully. My advice to all is to live for the moment, show love for your significant other every day, and recognize that life is too short to be angry for more than 10 minutes.I hope that the remaining time with my wife is as awesome as the first 31 years.As a 24-year-old single man, it is hard for me to truly relate to what a great marriage is. But this gave me a strong picture of what I want in my future relationship. A selfless, loving, compassionate and supportive partnership.You show the utmost love for Jason by writing this and knowing that one day another woman may come around for him. It is unlikely that Jason will ever find another woman such as you, but to hope he does speaks volumes of how much love you have for each other.I greatly appreciate you, Amy, for writing this and for giving me a perspective on what I hope for one day.Six years ago, at 39, I lost my lover, husband, best friend, adventure partner and co-parent. Yet even in the depths of my grief, I assumed then that in six years, I would have found a new life and new love. Yet here I still am, alone, because I cannot find anyone who even comes close to my Dave. It may be that Jason will feel that way, too. And that is O.K. You\u2019ve given him enough love for a lifetime.I, too, had a Jason. I lost him in 2009. We were together for 36 years, married for nearly 34 of them. As one of my kids says, I was spoiled. He was gorgeous and brilliant and a man of many facets and accomplishments.My incredible husband could never be replaced, and I have never even considered replacing him.Perhaps your Jason will feel the same way.I have Stage 4 terminal breast cancer, and while my husband and I haven\u2019t had the strength to have a conversation like this, I know it\u2019s coming. I am responding well to maintenance chemo, so the end seems distant to us, but that is foolish. We are playing Russian roulette.Time is all I ask for \u2014 daily. You are so brave, wise and witty, words that people use to describe me. I\u2019m not ready to do what you have done on these pages. You may have been a catalyst to get the conversion started sooner rather than later. Thank you for that.I lost my wife of 28 years in 2015. Like Amy and Jason, we shared an amazing marriage.While my wife is no longer here, her presence is still vivid. And I am the man I am because of our relationship. Surprisingly, moving on and remaking my life isn\u2019t harder because I loved my wife so much, but easier. I am sure Jason will find it the same, remaking his life in Amy\u2019s honor.I am now in a relationship with a woman I love that is very different from my wife and in some ways the same. I won\u2019t ever replace my wife, but I am half of a whole again, and I know she would be very happy about that. All the best Jason and Amy.When my mother was dying of cancer at age 44, she put together a list of eligible women for my father to consider as a future wife. She also wrote out menus for dinners and dinner parties for groups of varying sizes, something my parents had done throughout their adult lives together. It was, as was your article, permission to a beloved spouse to grieve and to keep living.As someone who is fighting Stage 4 cancer, I have once in a while logged on to dating sites to see if there is someone that would be a good fit for my wife.Jason is as lucky as me to have a wonderful wife.I\u2019m 55 and still haven\u2019t quite given up hope that someday, I\u2019ll find that kind of friendship and love. He sounds like a phenomenal person. (Someone who can cook dinner, flip pancakes and make happy faces is a treasure, indeed.) He may not be able to find someone like you, where you bring out the best in each other. You might be the one.I hope you know the remarkable gift you\u2019ve given me. The reminder that this is all temporary and nothing is given. Helping me remember all the Jason-esque things my husband always does, which I often forget to see and appreciate through the hustle and bustle of the daily grind and the inevitable frustrations associated with keeping early careers and young ones alive and well.Your writing about your story helped me get some perspective of our own. Thanks for your wisdom and perspective. Sending much love to your family.Advertisement"}

The Islamic State, which rejects peace and coexistence, described Mr. Masood on Thursday as a disciple and a hero for the assault carried out a day earlier in the shadow of Big Ben.On Thursday evening, another seriously injured victim died, bringing the total number of dead to five, including Mr. Masood.The authorities emphasized that they thought the assailant had acted alone, and that they did not expect any further attacks. But they raided six properties across the country, detaining eight people in London and Birmingham.At the United Nations, where the Security Council observed a minute of silence, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said, \u201cThe world is united to defeat the people who launched this attack and to defeat their bankrupt and odious ideology.\u201dEven as the British capital returned to its daily rhythms, and as Parliament resumed business, police officers were trying to learn whether they had missed signs of Mr. Masood\u2019s radicalization.He was born on Dec. 25, 1964, in Kent, in southeastern England, and had recently lived near Birmingham, historically known for its automotive industry and now home to many South Asian and Caribbean immigrants and their children. It was there, in the Spring Hill neighborhood, that Mr. Masood rented from an Enterprise branch the Hyundai Tucson that he used in the attack.Mr. Masood had a record of convictions, from 1983 to 2003, for assault, weapons possession and violations of public order. But he was not the subject of any current investigation, and \u201cthere was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack,\u201d the London police said.The Home Office made support for the Islamic State a criminal offense in June 2014, when Mrs. May was home secretary, and experts on radicalism said that the change had driven many extremists underground.Mrs. May visited victims at a hospital in London for 40 minutes on Thursday, according to her office. Details about most have not been released, but some information has dribbled out.\u201cKeith Palmer was killed while bravely doing his duty \u2014 protecting our city and the heart of our democracy from those who want to destroy our way of life,\u201d London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said.Kurt W.

He called Mr. Cochran \u201ca good man and a loving husband.\u201dAysha Frade, 43, a British teacher who lived in London, was fatally injured as she was heading to pick up her two daughters. She taught Spanish not far from Westminster Bridge, according to the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, and she had family in Spain, according to the Spanish Foreign Ministry.The injured also included three 10th-grade boys from the Brittany region of France who were on the bridge with other visiting students and who sustained leg and arm fractures. On Thursday, the French Education Ministry said that their conditions were no longer life-threatening.An aerial view of the Westminster Bridge after a driver plowed through pedestrians and crashed outside the British Parliament.Five South Koreans were wounded when they were mobbed by a crowd fleeing the attack site, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. Four of them \u2014 three women and a man in their 50s and 60s \u2014 suffered fractures and other injuries. A 67-year-old woman, however, required surgery for a head injury, according to South Korean news reports.The two Romanian victims, Andreea Cristea, 31, and Andrei Burnaz, 32, were from the Black Sea port city of Constanta, according to the Romanian news agency Mediafax, which quoted an official saying they had been visiting London to celebrate Mr. Burnaz\u2019s birthday.Ms. Cristea was rescued after she plunged off the bridge into the Thames as the assailant careened the S.U.V. through the crowd, and news reports said she suffered serious head injuries and lung damage. Mr. Burnaz\u2019s foot was fractured.An area outside Parliament remained a large crime scene on Thursday, as police officers examined the pavement stones for clues.While ISIS has claimed responsibility for the London attack, it is too early to say what level of contact, if any, the attacker had with ISIS operatives.The Palace of Westminster, which includes the Houses of Parliament, is a bewildering warren of corridors, and the work of ensuring that it was clear of assailants took time in the immediate aftermath of the assault. A group of visiting schoolchildren \u2014 some in tears \u2014 were among those caught up in the confusion, which lasted for hours.Lawmakers were confined to specific areas, where they were given water and in some cases sandwiches. But what some lacked most of all was the power to communicate, and to check that their staff was safe.Over all, the atmosphere was one of calm and cooperation, however. \u201cPeople appreciated the gravity of the situation,\u201d said Nigel Evans, a Conservative lawmaker.That may have been partly because an attack of this type had not been completely unexpected. Security has been noticeably tightened in Parliament in recent years, with large barriers placed in front of parts of the building to thwart the threat of a truck bomb. Police officers with submachine guns patrol the grounds routinely.But the complex is by a busy street, and some lawmakers still wonder whether some of the security was designed with the idea of fending off the type of attacks once mounted by the Irish Republican Army, which in 1979 assassinated a Conservative lawmaker, Airey Neave, using a car bomb in Parliament.\u201cI am shocked, but I am not surprised,\u201d Chris Bryant, a Labour lawmaker, said of the latest attack. \u201cWe have always known that a marauding attack by an individual would be the most difficult to prevent.\u201dOn Thursday, with tightened security, lawmakers crowded into the parliamentary chamber determined to show that they would not be deterred. Ed Miliband, a former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the mood had been one of \u201cshock and determination and also admiration for the job that the security people are doing.\u201d\u201cI think we are seeing people\u2019s increased determination to carry on with their normal business,\u201d he said.Dan Bilefsky, Hannah Olivennes and Ceylan Yeginsu reported from London, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from Birmingham, England.

{"Headline": "Why I\u2019m Moving Home", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 In recent months, I\u2019ve frequently found myself in places hit hard by manufacturing job losses, speaking to people affected in various ways. Sometimes, the conversation turns to the conflict people feel between the love of their home and the desire to leave in search of better work.It\u2019s a conflict I know well: I left my home state, Ohio, for the Marine Corps when I was 19. And while I\u2019ve returned home for months or even years at a time, job opportunities often pull me away.Experts have warned for years now that our rates of geographic mobility have fallen to troubling lows. Given that some areas have unemployment rates around 2 percent and others many times that, this lack of movement may mean joblessness for those who could otherwise work.The brain drain also encourages a uniquely modern form of cultural detachment. Eventually, the young people who\u2019ve moved out marry \u2014 typically to partners with similar economic prospects. They raise children in increasingly segregated neighborhoods, giving rise to something the conservative scholar Charles Murray calls \u201csuper ZIPs.\u201d These super ZIPs are veritable bastions of opportunity and optimism, places where divorce and joblessness are rare.As one of my college professors recently told me about higher education, \u201cThe sociological role we play is to suck talent out of small towns and redistribute it to big cities.\u201d There have always been regional and class inequalities in our society, but the data tells us that we\u2019re living through a unique period of segregation.It\u2019s easy to dismiss these questions as the ramblings of \u201cfake news\u201d consumers. But the more difficult truth is that people naturally trust the people they know \u2014 their friend sharing a story on Facebook \u2014 more than strangers who work for faraway institutions. And when we\u2019re surrounded by polarized, ideologically homogeneous crowds, whether online or off, it becomes easier to believe bizarre things about them. This problem runs in both directions: I\u2019ve heard ugly words uttered about \u201cflyover country\u201d and some of its inhabitants from well-educated, generally well-meaning people.I\u2019ve long worried whether I\u2019ve become a part of this problem. For two years, I\u2019d lived in Silicon Valley, surrounded by other highly educated transplants with seemingly perfect lives. It\u2019s jarring to live in a world where every person feels his life will only get better when you came from a world where many rightfully believe that things have become worse. And I\u2019ve suspected that this optimism blinds many in Silicon Valley to the real struggles in other parts of the country. So I decided to move home, to Ohio.It wasn\u2019t an easy choice. I scaled back my commitments to a job I love because of the relocation. My wife and I worry about the quality of local public schools, and whether she (a San Diego native) could stand the unpredictable weather.But there were practical reasons to move: I\u2019m founding an organization to combat Ohio\u2019s opioid epidemic. We chose Columbus because I travel a lot, and I need to be centrally located in the state and close to an airport. And the truth is that not every motivation is rational: Part of me loves Ohio simply because it\u2019s home.I recently asked a friend, Ami Vitori Kimener, how she thought about her own return home. A Georgetown graduate, Ami left a successful career in Washington to start new businesses in Middletown, Ohio. Middletown is in some ways a classic Midwestern city: Once thriving, it was hit hard by the decline of the region\u2019s manufacturing base in recent decades. But the town is showing early signs of revitalization, thanks in part to the efforts of those like Ami.Talking with Ami, I realized that we often frame civic responsibility in terms of government taxes and transfer payments, so that our society\u2019s least fortunate families are able to provide basic necessities. But this focus can miss something important: that what many communities need most is not just financial support, but talent and energy and committed citizens to build viable businesses and other civic institutions.Of course, not every town can or should be saved. Many people should leave struggling places in search of economic opportunity, and many of them won\u2019t be able to return. Some people will move back to their hometowns; others, like me, will move back to their home state. The calculation will undoubtedly differ for each person, as it should. But those of us who are lucky enough to choose where we live would do well to ask ourselves, as part of that calculation, whether the choices we make for ourselves are necessarily the best for our home communities \u2014 and for the country.J. D. Vance is the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "William Powell, \u2018Anarchist Cookbook\u2019 Writer, Dies at 66", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byWilliam Powell was a teenager, angry at the government and the Vietnam War, when he walked into the main branch of the New York Public Library in Manhattan in 1969 to begin research for a handbook on causing violent mayhem.Over the next months, he studied military manuals and other publications that taught him the essentials of do-it-yourself warfare, including how to make dynamite, how to convert a shotgun into a grenade launcher and how to blow up a bridge.What emerged was \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook,\u201d a diagram- and recipe-filled manifesto that is believed to have been used as a source in heinous acts of violence since its publication in 1971, most notably the killings of 12 students and one teacher in 1999 at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.Throughout his manual, Mr. Powell fashioned a knowing voice that suggested broad experience in warfare, sabotage or black ops, mixed with an extremist\u2019s anti-establishment worldview.\u201cAs almost everyone knows, silencers are illegal in virtually all the countries of the world,\u201d he wrote before describing how to build a silencer for a handgun, \u201cbut then a true revolutionary believes that the government in power is illegal, so, following that logic, I see no reason that he should feel restricted by laws made by an illegal body.\u201dHe declared that his book was an educational service for the silent majority \u2014 not the one identified by President Richard M. Nixon as his middle-American constituency, but the disciplined anarchists who were seeking dignity in a world gone wrong. To them, he offered how-to plans for weaponry and explosives as well as drugs, electronic surveillance, guerrilla training and hand-to-hand combat \u2014 a potent mix that attracted the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The book found a big audience. More than two million copies have reportedly been sold, and still more have been downloaded on the internet.\u201cIt was inevitable that he did it,\u201d James J. F. Forest, a professor of security studies at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said in a phone interview. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have. It\u2019s human behavior to tap into a dangerous stream of knowledge, and in his case he was inspired to make that dangerous information available to anyone else who was interested.\u201dHe chose a career as a teacher, not a revolutionary, specializing in working on behalf of children with special needs.His family reported the death on Facebook, but few if any obituaries followed. His son Sean said that the people who needed to know had been told, and that the family had not thought of reaching out to newspapers.The director, Charlie Siskel, said he had interviewed Mr. Powell over a week in 2015.\u201cWhat interested me was: How do you go through 40 years of your life with his dark chapter in the background?\u201d Mr. Siskel said on Monday. \u201cHow does one sleep at night or get through the day?\u201dOn camera, Mr. Powell seemed to struggle to absorb the idea that his book had apparently had an influence on a number of notorious criminals. One was Zvonko Busic, a Croatian nationalist who hijacked a TWA flight in 1976 while carrying phony bombs after leaving a real one at Grand Central Terminal that killed a police officer who tried to deactivate it.Others included Thomas Spinks, who was part of a group that bombed abortion clinics in the 1980s; Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995; Eric Harris, one of the Columbine attackers; and Jared Loughner, who killed six people during his attempted assassination of Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona in 2011.\u201cWhen \u2018The Cookbook\u2019 has been associated with Columbine and the later characters and killing, I did feel responsible, but I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Powell told Mr. Siskel, adding: \u201cSomebody else with a perverted, distorted sense of reality did something awful. I didn\u2019t.\u201dWilliam Ralph Powell was born on Long Island, in Roslyn, on Dec. 6, 1949. His father, William Charles Powell, was a press officer at the United Nations; his mother, the former Doreen Newman, ran a phobia clinic at a hospital in White Plains.Mr. Powell told Mr. Siskel that after his father was transferred to Britain, he attended a school where bullying was commonplace and where the headmaster had caned him. When the family returned to the United States, he said, he felt alienated as an outsider. His fifth-grade teacher mocked his British accent. At a prep school in Westchester County, N.Y., he said, he was molested by the dorm master.He was working at a bookstore in Greenwich Village in late 1969 when he decided to quit his job to research and write \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook.\u201d\u201cMy motivation at the time was simple,\u201d he wrote in The Guardian. \u201cI was being actively pursued by the military, who seemed single-mindedly determined to send me to fight, and possibly die, in Vietnam. I wanted to publish something that would express my anger.\u201dThe book, a precursor to more recent publications like \u201cThe Mujahideen Poisons Handbook\u201d and \u201cMinimanual of the Urban Guerrilla,\u201d was at times angry, but it also came with cautionary notes (\u201cThis book is not for children or morons\u201d) and common-sense tips, like one he appended to the 14 steps for manufacturing TNT.\u201cThe temperatures used in the preparation of TNT are exact,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand must be used as such. Do not estimate or use approximations. Buy a good centigrade thermometer.\u201dIn an interview at the time of the book\u2019s publication, Mr. Powell told The Bennington Banner in Vermont, \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as crazed or bomb-throwing, though I could be if driven into a corner.\u201dBy 1971, when Lyle Stuart \u2014 considered a renegade for his belief that the American people had a right to read anything \u2014 published \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook,\u201d Mr. Powell was attending Windham College in Putney, Vt. After graduation, he received a master\u2019s degree in English from Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.Sean Powell said in an interview that his father did not exile himself from the United States because of \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook.\u201d\u201cThe book came out in 1971,\u201d he said, \u201cand he went to Saudi Arabia in 1979. Why would he take eight years to go into exile?\u201dIn addition to his wife, the former Ochan Kusuma, and his son Sean, Mr. Powell is survived by another son, Colin; four grandchildren; a brother, Christopher; and his mother. His first marriage ended in divorce.But agents could find no reason to take action against Mr. Powell. Though he did, as the F.B.I. wrote, \u201csubmit for consideration recipes for nearly every type of explosive\u201d whose manufacture and distribution violated federal law, there was no evidence that he had been guilty of either.An obituary on Thursday about William Powell, the author of \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook,\u201d misstated his age in some copies. He was 66, not 67. (As the obituary correctly noted, he was born in December 1949 and died in July 2016.) The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}

To begin with, the proper declension of the passage is \u201cCommunists, Social Democrats, trade unionists, Jews.\u201d (Catholics are sometimes included, which is not only a misquotation but historically inaccurate; the Nazis never \u201ccame for\u201d German Catholics in anything like the sense that they did for these other groups.) Niem\u00f6ller was referring specifically to the events of the year 1933, when Hitler \u2014 aided and abetted by the Reichstag fire \u2014 concentrated on eliminating all organized political opposition to his regime before he got down to the work of so-called \u201cracial purification.\u201dAlso, the quotation is not originally from a sermon (as many people believe) or, as the review has it, a poem (although these days it is often presented as a poem). It was tossed off almost casually one evening in Niem\u00f6ller\u2019s living room, as he led an informal discussion group of divinity students on the theme of what it means to be a practical Christian in modern times.Niem\u00f6ller cast the statement in the first person, at least in part, out of a sense of guilt. As a former U-boat commander in World War I, Niem\u00f6ller\u2019s pre-Nazi politics tended strongly toward the nationalistic and the conservative, and he was a critic of the Weimar regime. As Sibylle said ruefully: \u201cMy parents saw the evil of National Socialism right from the start.

However, I was disheartened to see that your review of \u201cRobert Lowell, Setting the River on Fire\u201d (March\u202f5) used antiquated terms like \u201cstark raving mad,\u201d \u201cgoing mad\u201d and, worst of all, \u201ccrazy\u201d outside of the historical quotations from the book. Those terms unnecessarily perpetuate stigma against mental illness that affects millions of Americans.GEORGE PETRIDESNEW YORK\u2b25Reading RorschachsTo the Editor:I appreciated Ruth Whippman\u2019s thoughtful review of Damion Searls\u2019s \u201cThe Inkblots\u201d (March\u202f19). But she, and Searls as well, may have failed to note that it takes an especially gifted and sensitive clinical psychologist to interpret the results of a Rorschach test. In my experience over the past decades when the Rorschach was in vogue, there were only a handful of clinicians who were right on target in their diagnostic assessment of a Rorschach protocol. Others \u2014 the more pedestrian, average clinicians \u2014 were guided less by their own clinical acumen and sensitivity than by their reliance on a cumbersome system of \u201cobjective scoring\u201d (as dictated by the prevailing positivist science that has dominated our field and, in this instance at least, failed miserably).LEO GOLDBERGERHOUSATONIC, MASS.The writer is a professor emeritus of psychology at New York University.\u2b25Paris WalksTo the Editor:The review of Lauren Elkin\u2019s \u201cFl\u00e2neuse\u201d (March 5) brought back wonderful memories of the many times I found myself in Paris over a weekend after the week\u2019s business was done. Sometime in the late \u201990s, I saw posters for a book fair and read in Time Out Paris about how the French admire American writers, some of whom would be reading at the event. I found my way to the large venue and into the back of the room where Allen Ginsberg was reading \u201cHowl,\u201d accompanied by Philip Glass, his longtime friend and collaborator.

{"Headline": "A Life Sentence in Cambodia, but Kem Ley\u2019s Murder Is Far From Solved", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 A Cambodian court sentenced a man to life in prison on Thursday for the brazen killing of a prominent government critic last year, a murder that has come to symbolize a growing crackdown on dissenting voices here.Court monitors said the case was rife with troubling inconsistencies that judges or investigators had not questioned. Even the defendant\u2019s name was in doubt.Mr. Kem Ley, a popular commentator who helped found a political party catering to farmers, was shot as he was having his morning coffee at a convenience store inside a gas station, at a busy intersection in central Phnom Penh. The man arrested, seemingly confused and brandishing an expensive Glock pistol, identified himself to the police as Chuob Somlab, an improbable moniker that means \u201cMeet Kill.\u201dHis trial this month was brief, with just 10 witnesses called to the stand, seven of whom were police officials. The defendant admitted killing Mr. Kem Ley, but glaring holes in his story went unchallenged, said Kingsley Abbott, a lawyer who observed the trial for the International Commission of Jurists.\u201cWhat was missing from the trial was a proper establishment of the truth,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cWhat happened was that the accused provided a version of events which were totally improbable, and they weren\u2019t explored in any meaningful way.\u201dThe defendant insisted in court that Chuob Somlab was his real name. He said that he was an unmarried orphan who grew up in a province on Cambodia\u2019s western border and that he had earned the money to buy the Glock by working on a cassava plantation in Thailand.But nearly every detail of that story was contradicted by his mother and his wife. They said he was neither an orphan nor a migrant worker but a former forest ranger and soldier from an entirely different province. They said they had never heard the name Chuob Somlab before, and they produced a fingerprinted identity card indicating that the man in the dock was really Oeuth Ang, 44.The defendant said he was seeking revenge against Mr. Kem Ley over a $3,000 debt, though the families of both men said that was highly improbable and insisted the two had never met. No financial or telephone records were presented in court, nor were several crucial witnesses called, including a man the defendant named as Pou Lis (\u201cPolice\u201d in Khmer). According to the defendant, that man introduced him to Mr. Kem Ley and even provided the commentator\u2019s license plate number so the defendant could track him down.And although the gas station where the killing took place was equipped with multiple surveillance cameras, most of the footage seems to have disappeared, with only a brief snippet from one of the cameras shown in court.A group of Cambodians affiliated with the political opposition here have mounted a case in a United States court to force Chevron, which operates the gas station, to release the full footage. Judge Donna Ryu of the Northern District of California approved a subpoena in February ordering Chevron to turn the video over, but the company was given until the end of this month to respond.Chevron, however, has said that the Cambodian police confiscated all the surveillance footage. \u201cThe digital video recorder along with the recording it contained were removed by the police within hours of the incident and have not been returned,\u201d the company said in a statement on Thursday.The police chief of Phnom Penh, Chuon Sovann, the head of the team investigating the killing, said Thursday that the police gave the footage to the court. He said he did not know what happened to it after that or why it was not shown during the trial. \u201cThey would do this in any country \u2014 there is nothing strange about it,\u201d he said.The inconsistencies in the gunman\u2019s story were apparently accepted by Judge Leang Samnat, who said before announcing the verdict that it was clear the defendant had killed Mr. Kem Ley, whatever his name, background or occupation. Based on the footage from the convenience store, \u201cthe suspect on the video looks exactly the same as the suspect here,\u201d he said.\u201cKem Ley mastered the art of communication to perfection,\u201d Astrid Noren-Nilsson, a lecturer at Lund University\u2019s Center for East and South-East Asian Studies, wrote in an email.He had also been campaigning against Vietnam\u2019s supposed theft of borderlands \u2014 a highly delicate topic here \u2014 and writing a collection of mordant political fables.They were set in a surreal version of Cambodia populated by talking animals and characters like Uncle Strong, Aunty the Farm\u2019s Gone and Mr. Microfinance, a world in which an assassin named Meet Kill would fit right in. Mr. Kem Ley called them \u201cpolitical jokes,\u201d but usually the joke was on the common people, who were continually being duped by tigers, lions and rapacious rulers.In one, a man called Hostile Takeover accrues endless resources for himself and his family. Another, published the day before his killing, is set in a garden where \u201cgood and gentle animals are constantly killed\u201d by a small cadre of thieving predators.While Mr. Kem Ley always had a following, he has become a household name in the eight months since his death. His funeral procession attracted tens of thousands of mourners who marched through the streets of Phnom Penh, a display of collective anger that had not been seen since postelection protests in 2013. Photomontages featuring quotes and images of Mr. Kem Ley are widely shared on social media, collections of his fables have been printed and distributed, and absurd puns on Meet Kill\u2019s name are a favorite new political joke at coffee shops.\u201cThe sheer fact that it is so easy to share a picture on Facebook and get an instant response means that Kem Ley\u2019s portrait has quickly become iconic: Sharing it means protesting against everything that is perceived to be wrong with Cambodia today,\u201d Dr. Noren-Nilsson said.Questioning the official narrative of Mr. Kem Ley\u2019s death, meanwhile, has become risky. This month, a group of students were briefly arrested after screening an Al Jazeera documentary that positioned the killing amid a broader wave of political violence directed at opposition voices.Mr. Kem Ley\u2019s wife and five sons \u2014 the youngest born after he died \u2014 have fled Cambodia and applied for refugee status with the United Nations. His wife, Bou Rachana, said she was certain her husband had never met the man calling himself Meet Kill, much less received thousands of dollars from an impoverished migrant worker.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the Cambodian court system \u2014 and it\u2019s not only me. The people of Cambodia don\u2019t either,\u201d she said, laughing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Platform Companies Are Becoming More Powerful \u2014 but What Exactly Do They Want?", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyDuring a February ride in San Francisco, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was recorded arguing with and eventually berating an Uber driver from the back seat of his car. The driver, who had been working with the company since 2011, accused Kalanick of undercutting drivers of high-end cars like his, plunging him into bankruptcy. Kalanick responded with a lecture about the basic economic logic of his company: Soon, the supply of luxury cars on the app would be reduced, causing demand to increase. Besides, he went on, if the company hadn\u2019t added a lower-priced tier, it would have been beaten by competitors. This did not satisfy the driver, which seemed to enrage Kalanick, who erupted into a moralizing tirade. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own [expletive],\u201d he said, before leaving the car.Uber, like so many other successful tech companies in 2017, is a \u201cplatform business,\u201d one built around matchmaking between vendors and customers. If successful, a platform creates its own marketplace; if extremely successful, it ends up controlling something closer to an entire economy. This is intuitive in a case like eBay, which connects buyers and sellers. Airbnb, too, resembles an age-old form of commerce, connecting property owners with short-term lodgers. TaskRabbit and Fiverr connect contractors with people looking to hire them. Some of the largest platforms are less obviously transactional: Facebook and Google connect advertisers with users, users with one another, software developers with users. But while the transactions that happen on their platforms largely take a different form \u2014 taps, shares, ads served and scrolled past \u2014 the principles are essentially the same, as are the benefits. These businesses are asset- and employee-light, low on liability and high on upside. They aspire to monopoly, often unapologetically, and have been instrumental in rehabilitating the concept. (The logic is seductive and often self-evident: Facebook is more useful if everyone is on it, therefore everyone should be on Facebook.)Predictably, platforms have long been intoxicating to investors. They\u2019ve also been the subject of rapturous popular business writing. In their 2016 book \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms,\u201d the economists David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee cast the subject in revolutionary terms, calling for a \u201cnew economics\u201d to account for businesses that are \u201ctransforming economies\u201d around the world, \u201cmaking life easier and better for billions of people\u201d \u2014 the sort of broad and ideological claim previously reserved by economists for capitalism as a whole.Amid the cheerleading, a comprehensive criticism of the platform model has been slow to emerge. Nick Srnicek\u2019s \u201cPlatform Capitalism,\u201d published in December, tries to situate the rise of platforms in a broader history of capitalism and to project those lessons forward. Srnicek recasts a few features of platform businesses as potentially problematic. Among them is their tendency to metastasize from transaction enablers to, with sufficient success, participation gatekeepers. A food-delivery app like Seamless begins its life with promises of liberation, connecting customers with nearby restaurants, taking care of payments and eliminating phone calls. But in the cities where it has been most successful, its customer base becomes too big to ignore, even for restaurants that struggle to afford its steep commissions. In other industries, the stakes are much higher. An insurgent Airbnb feels as if it\u2019s enabling new types of transactions between previously unconnected people. A dominant Airbnb might come to resemble something between a superintendent and a landlord for millions, not to mention a force reshaping cities in its image.Platform companies have themselves hired economists to help conceptualize and manage the economies they\u2019ve created. Google, Airbnb, Uber and Amazon have aggressively recruited professors and researchers to help understand what, exactly, they have on their hands, and how to expand, regulate and exploit it. Within a rigidly structured platform like Uber, for which the company sets prices, the economic problems are somewhat akin to those of a command economy: How low can we push the cost of a ride before drivers stop participating? (Quite low, for now.) How do we deal with sudden increases in demand? (Surge pricing, controversially.) How might new drivers be both induced to join the platform and more deeply compelled to stay? (Through the introduction of vehicle-financing programs and short-term loan services.)Platforms are, in a sense, capitalism distilled to its essence. They are proudly experimental and maximally consequential, prone to creating externalities and especially disinclined to address or even acknowledge what happens beyond their rising walls. And accordingly, platforms are the underlying trend that ties together popular narratives about technology and the economy in general. Platforms provide the substructure for the \u201cgig economy\u201d and the \u201csharing economy\u201d; they\u2019re the economic engine of social media; they\u2019re the architecture of the \u201cattention economy\u201d and the inspiration for claims about the \u201cend of ownership.\u201dBut the tensions that platforms like Uber create with their customers, their workers and the world that surrounds them will soon become harder to ignore as these companies foment economic and social change, the consequences of which will increasingly be thrust into spectacular display. The Kalanick video was a P.R. nightmare not just for Uber but also for the platform economy in general, posing grand questions about the world it promises, or threatens, to create. The zeal for platforms, combined with the technology industry\u2019s internalization of their merits and inevitability, will push them into areas where the tensions they create become starker and the ideologies they carry become more apparent.Nowhere is that ideological dimension more clear than in the Kalanick video from February. Driver and founder sat inches apart, alienated from each other by the system over which one presides and within which the other toils: the founder explaining to the driver how the platform works and must work; the driver appealing to this person for better pay. It resembles nothing more than one man remarking on the rain while the other thinks, \u201cDon\u2019t you control the weather?\u201d Platforms seek total control even as they abdicate responsibility. In other words, they\u2019re perfect.For now, the tensions that platforms can breed have been obscured \u2014 or at least ignored \u2014 in large part because platformized labor has arrived first in sectors where employment was already widely precarious and contract-based, like taxi driving. As the model expands, these tensions may become more visible as workers with more political and social capital are subjected to them. The recent history of platforms, however, has been defined by the failure of all but a few smart or lucky people to imagine just how successful and powerful they can be.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Family Adventure in Medical Tourism", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byFrugal FamilyIt is hard to recommend taking a 19-hour flight with a toddler to get a root canal with a straight face. But after going on just such a mission in December, I will aim to get all future dental work done in Thailand.Our 16-day trip began as a search for savings. Not for a budget vacation, but for affordable dentistry. Between my husband, Tim, and I, both freelancers, we needed $5,000 to $6,000 in routine, but nonetheless prohibitively costly, dental care. Frustrated at our situation, I tossed out a tongue-in-cheek Facebook post announcing my intention to become a \u201cdental tourist.\u201d I was half joking, but within minutes, recommendations for hospitals, clinics and hotels in Bangkok were rolling in.Even within my immediate circle of friends and family, a surprising number of people had traveled abroad to get fillings and crowns, whitening and implants. With good reason, it turns out. If the work needed is extensive enough, it is possible to save money even after accounting for the cost of travel. In other cases, the savings are just enough to pay for a tropical vacation, which is compelling when you are staring down the barrel of subfreezing temperatures.8 Photos\u201cDo it,\u201d a friend wrote. \u201cIt makes total sense \u2026 I mean cents.\u201dEgged on, I booked flights and made appointments. The plan was to spend a few days in Bangkok getting our initial round of work done, then take a weeklong side trip to Ko Kut, which was relatively near and said to be among the most beautiful of the country\u2019s hundreds of islands, where we would swing in hammocks, drink fresh coconut water, splash in the Gulf of Thailand and recover from our root canals.Between the long flight, jet lag and dental work, the first few days of our trip were grueling. I scheduled our itinerary with an irresistible, but perhaps ill-advised, 24-hour layover in Seoul, South Korea, which I had long wanted to visit. What I hadn\u2019t realized is that it would be 23 degrees and snowing when we landed \u2014 70 degrees colder than Bangkok. Our first flight, an intimidating 13 hours, was surprisingly smooth thanks to an airline-provided baby bassinet that snapped into the bulkheads. I had requested this at the urging of a friend. Also, the Korean Air flight attendants, immaculately dressed in powder blue satin shirts, tailored pencil skirts and coifed updos, were there to scoop up Roxie from our arms at the first sign of fussiness.By the next day, however, we had exhausted our luck. Halfway through the seven-hour flight to Thailand, Roxie got sick. All over Tim. All over me. All over the airplane seats. And all over herself.Tim and I spent our first full day in Thailand taking turns with Roxie, who rebounded immediately from her mystery ailment, while the other underwent the dentist\u2019s drill. Having been warned that Bangkok was hot, loud, polluted and crowded, our plan was to spend as little time there as possible. Normally, the warnings would have only intrigued me. But exploring a fascinating, but exhausting metropolis while recovering from a root canal and caring for a jet-lagged toddler is no one\u2019s idea of a good time.We arrived in the late afternoon after a four-and-a-half-hour drive. Concerned about the safety of Thai buses, we paid $120 for a transfer \u2014 a private, car-seat-equipped sedan and driver. After taking the comfortable, air-conditioned bus on our return ($7.50 each), I probably wouldn\u2019t bother with the private car again.Like most of Trat\u2019s guesthouses, Artist\u2019s Place sold ferry tickets to the nearby islands, which included transportation to a nearby pier. But when our taxi arrived, it wasn\u2019t a car, which I was already conflicted about taking \u2014 even a short distance \u2014 without a car seat. Instead, it was a songtaew, a pickup truck with a metal cage around the cab and two benches lining the bed.After erring so strongly on the side of caution the day before, I found myself standing on the street in Trat trying to decide whether to ride with Roxie in a pickup\u2019s open back. I felt like an idiot. But having traveled 8,000 miles, plus a day\u2019s drive, to this town near the Cambodian border, I also knew that we had already committed. So, I climbed in, strapped Roxie to my chest in her carrier and held on.A 45-minute boat ride later, Ko Kut rose from the Gulf of Thailand, a green hump ringed by an undeveloped beach and statuesque boulders that looked as if they had been designed for diving into the sea. The boat deposited us at the mouth of a river lined with decaying wooden fishing boats strung with drying clothes. There, we met another songtaew, one of the few full-sized vehicles on an island where most people get around by motorbike.Despite flowing pants and reading glasses, Uncle Joe, the patriarch of the Ngamkho family, could be a gruff character, ruling the resort with a charming but semi-authoritarian air. But it soon became clear that Uncle Joe was a softy. While he barked at customers for failing to remove their shoes, as is Thai custom, he treated his beloved dogs \u2014 six roamed the Ngamkho grounds \u2014 to massages. Roxie, who was 17 months old, shared Uncle Joe\u2019s love of dogs; she became an honorary member of the family during our short stay.After two days of happily doing almost nothing, we arranged a songtaew to drive us to a village across the island. The previous night, a French climbing instructor had raved about a multicourse meal he had had there. While I had been nervous about taking pickup taxis in Trat, Ko Kut was largely carless and its narrow, hilly roads were driven at what seemed a mule\u2019s pace.As the songtaew crawled up the steep incline, the ride felt like being in aging wooden roller coaster. It creaked and squeaked as it climbed, rattling as it slid back to sea level. We passed roadside restaurants and signs pointing to bays, beaches and resorts before descending to Ao Yai, a fishing community built on stilts over the water. We got lost among the boardwalks before ending up at Sea the Sun, where Roxie helped as we pointed to this silver-skinned fish or that oversized shrimp, which were then netted from squat tanks. Twenty minutes later, beautifully prepared platters of whole fish and shell-on crustaceans arrived dressed in purple flowers. Among the great meals of my life, this one cost just over $20, including large, cold bottles of watery Singha beer.Rarely have I felt as conflicted about leaving a place as I did in Ko Kut. I would have happily spent the remaining weeks of 2016 at Ngamkho eating banana roti, getting daily massages ($11) and teaching Roxie to swim. But our return trip was made relatively painless with a Boonsiri catamaran-bus transfer package ($25 each), which had us back in Bangkok in six hours.After two more days of dental work, Tim and I were finally done. My jaw was still numb, but it was our last night in Thailand and I couldn\u2019t resist one more visit to the glowing tents and converted shipping containers of the night market, where vendors sold high-waist jean shorts and trendy tote bags and a dozen or so bars competed for musical dominance. We went stall to stall, compiling a dinner of tender baby octopus, papaya salad, mango with coconut sticky rice, oyster mushroom tempura and salmon sashimi with a spicy chile sauce.At the rooftop patio of one of the nearby bars, we unpacked our spread ($10). But as I was opening the plastic baggy of chile sauce, a hole opened in the bottom and the fiery red and green liquid shot directly into Roxie\u2019s face. From shock or pain, she immediately began screaming. Slices of pepper ran down her face and clumped in her blond curls. She clawed at her face, smearing sauce into her eyes. Tim and I yanked off her dress, frantically bathing her hands and face with wipes.Having heard the commotion, a waitress arrived with a pitcher of water. We threw Roxie\u2019s head back, drenching both her and me. Then, without saying a word, the server whisked Roxie, dripping, red-faced and wearing only a diaper, downstairs. She was immediately surrounded by five women who went to work as if this happens all the time, rubbing her in what looked like lotion. Did they have some secret miracle ointment? Soothed, Roxie was returned, a couple shades paler, and we had our answer. \u201cOnly in Thailand,\u201d Tim said, \u201cwould a bar be stocked with baby powder.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Tracking down these specific places was difficult as government record-keeping for black Americans was poor to nonexistent during Jim Crow and slavery. The white side of my family is brimming with accurate government documentation.The next day I took Amtrak for 31 hours from Jackson up to Detroit and thought about what it would have been like to cross into Illinois during Jim Crow, then walk into what was moments before a whites-only car.In Detroit I tracked down my mother\u2019s childhood home and high school, but at this point in my life I hadn\u2019t been able to find any maternal family members. I\u2019d never met them and everyone lost touch when she left Detroit as a young woman. She recently passed away.Five months later, a first cousin of mine in Detroit found me on Facebook via my Ancestry.com family tree. I was elated! She\u2019d been doing the same genealogy research all this time, wondering if she\u2019d ever find me. I met my long-lost family over Thanksgiving last year and truly feel like I\u2019ve turned a new page.Sarah Enelow, Brooklyn\u2014In 1950, when I was about five years old, my family traveled from Wilmington, Del. to Richmond, Va., for a family event, the nature of which I no longer remember. My parents decided I was too young to attend the event, so I was left in the care of an older cousin at my great-aunt\u2019s house. While I was there, I was taken upstairs to meet Mary Jones. She was a very old African-American woman who was living in my great-aunt\u2019s house. For whatever reason, meeting her made an impression on me, and I have remembered it these 67 years.When my father was a baby, his family moved into his maternal grandmother\u2019s home, and Mrs. Jones was their cook. When she became too old to work, she was guaranteed a home there for the rest of her life. She died in 1961. She was thought to have been about 100 years old.The memory of meeting her spurred me to unravel my family\u2019s genealogy and our involvement in American slavery. It turns out that John Veneable Hardwicke, my father\u2019s maternal great-grandfather held three people in slavery in 1860: a young woman and her two young sons. I believe, though I cannot prove, that this young woman was Mrs. Jones\u2019s mother and that Mrs. Jones was the last living person to have been enslaved by my family. Slavery was not all that long ago.Subsequent research has uncovered the truth that one branch or another of my family held people in slavery from our arrival in the Virginia Colony in the 17th century until Emancipation. I know the names of about 40 of these people, and, of course there are more whose names I do not know. I have written a book containing this family history and my reflections on the legacy of slavery that I am attempting to get published.Rev. Dr. Kenneth W. Collier, Santa Barbara, Calif.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Is Trump\u2019s Next Target, Administration Says", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byThe Trump administration served notice on Thursday that its next move to deregulate broadband internet service companies would be to jettison the Obama administration\u2019s net neutrality rules, which were intended to safeguard free expression online.The net neutrality rules, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015, aimed to preserve the open internet and ensure that it could not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.Supporters of net neutrality have insisted the rules are necessary to protect equal access to content on the internet. Opponents said the rules unfairly subjected broadband internet suppliers like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter to utility-style regulation.In a news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, mentioned the net neutrality rules affecting telecommunications and cable internet services, noting that the Obama administration had \u201creclassified them as common carriers.\u201dMr. Spicer said President Trump had \u201cpledged to reverse this overreach.\u201d The Obama-era rules, Mr. Spicer said, were an example of \u201cbureaucrats in Washington\u201d placing restrictions on one kind of company \u2014 internet service suppliers \u2014 and \u201cpicking winners and losers.\u201dTelecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as common-carrier utility services, which are subject to anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules. They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers.Mr. Spicer remarked on the rollback of privacy rules before he spoke more broadly about regulations on broadband internet services. President Trump, he said, will \u201ccontinue to fight Washington red tape that stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth.\u201dExcerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.Mr. Trump earlier this year appointed Ajit Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon and a minority Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, as chairman of the agency. Mr. Pai voted against the net neutrality rules as a commission member in 2015.Since becoming chairman, Mr. Pai has indicated that he plans to either roll back or decline to enforce many consumer protection regulations created during the Obama administration, including those regarding net neutrality.Getting rid of the net neutrality rules, policy experts said, will be more difficult than peeling away the privacy regulations. Congress, in a vote mainly along party lines, and by a narrow margin, overturned the privacy rules enacted last fall, using a streamlined process under the Congressional Review Act.But that faster procedure will not apply to the net neutrality rules, which were approved by the F.C.C. two years ago, beyond the timetable for such reviews.Another path to repeal would be for Mr. Pai, who now leads a Republican-majority commission, to revisit the issue at the F.C.C.Politically, net neutrality might be a bigger challenge as well. When it was weighing the rules in 2014 and 2015, the F.C.C. received more than one million public comments. The vast majority of them endorsed strict nondiscrimination rules that supporters viewed as necessary to preserve the democratic ethos of an open internet.That wave of response influenced the Democratic-majority commission. \u201cNet neutrality could be a volatile and explosive issue,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Trump administration appreciates that it addresses nondiscrimination for all kinds of speech, as much for Breitbart and Newsmax as it is for MSNBC and CNN,\u201d referring to news sources that are staunch backers of the Trump administration and ones often seen by Republicans as harsh critics.Opponents of the net neutrality rules say the rules were mainly the result of a very effective lobbying campaign by powerful internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. They have deep pockets and could pay more for fast lanes for their services, they say, but used the net neutrality campaign to avoid that expense.\u201cRegulations result in the allocation of wealth by the government,\u201d said Jeffrey Eisenach, an economist and visiting scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who was also an adviser to the Trump transition team. \u201cThey are often an opportunity for one group of firms to grab an advantage over another group.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The High Price of Leaving Ultra-Orthodox Life", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "FeatureYoung adults who decide to abandon their cloistered Jewish communities have only one another \u2014 and a single organization \u2014 to help them navigate the alternate reality of modern-day New York.Supported byThe group was facilitated by a Footsteps social worker, Jesse Pietroniro, soft-spoken and kind, who had told me that he had his own conflicted religious upbringing. He allowed the attendees to democratically settle on a loose theme for the evening. One woman in her early 20s brought up sexuality. She had started to date and wasn\u2019t quite sure what the norms were. A young man talked about how hard it was for him to interact with women casually outside his community, since he was taught that sexual desire outside the intent to procreate means that one is a sexual predator, so anytime he was attracted to someone, he worried he was going to do something untoward, or that he was a kind of monster. The young woman who had suggested the theme said she didn\u2019t know when exactly to submit to kissing \u2014 the first date? The second? Is she a slut if she kisses at all? Is it still bad nowadays to be a slut? She\u2019d heard girls talking on the subway and calling each other sluts, and they were laughing. Are there rules for this? A few of them made sex jokes. The O.T.D.ers, newly alive in a world of puns and innuendo, love a junior-high-grade sex joke. The social worker narrowed his eyes and pursed his lips and tapped a finger to his chin and nodded and opened the question up to the group. (I was allowed to document the meeting on the condition that I wouldn\u2019t publish anyone\u2019s name or descriptive information.)Another woman in her early 20s, sitting on the sofa in jeans with one leg slung over its arm, told us she had spent most of her life being molested by her father. She told the group that recently she had taken to advertising online, saying she followed the laws of family purity \u2014 going to a ritual bath after menstruation, not having sex during her \u201cunclean\u201d week \u2014 and that she was available for sex in exchange for money. Ultra-Orthodox men visited her at all hours, and they cheated on their wives, having sex with this ritually pure young woman in her apartment. When the men finished, they told her what a shame it was that she was off the derech, that she seemed nice, that she should try again at a religious life.A man, 30ish, still with a beard that he now trimmed closely to his face, talked about staying with his religious wife, who knew he was no longer religious but wouldn\u2019t join him on the other side. He knew the marriage should be over, but he wouldn\u2019t leave, and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to cheat on her, and he wanted to know if he was unable to cheat on her because he was bound up by his religious values or because he was innately a good person. Another married man said that you don\u2019t need to be taught in a religious context not to cheat on your wife \u2014 it\u2019s a tenet of secular marriage as well, and what the whole operation often depends on.\u201cI guess I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a good person because I\u2019m a good person,\u201d said the guy who wanted to cheat but might not, \u201cor if I\u2019m a good person because I was taught to be a good person.\u201dThey went around in circles for many minutes, most of them summoning scriptural sources on whether morality is inherent, then other sources to make or disprove that point, then laughing at the fact that they\u2019d summoned Scripture. The married man who was deciding if he should have sex outside his marriage put his head in his hands, then through his hair and made a great, guttural noise of frustration.They all took a breath and laughed at themselves again, and then they went silent, and in their silence was their uncertainty, now familiar, of whether these questions would ever be answered, and if they could talk enough about it to the point where they would ever feel normal. God, would it ever feel normal?But just because she left her community didn\u2019t mean that she felt part of the secular one. She started Footsteps as a drop-in group right there at Hunter and told a couple of formerly religious friends what she was doing. About 20 people showed up to the first meeting. Soon they had a G.E.D. study group \u2014 and a human-sexuality-and-relationships group, so that they could learn about sex education, which was normally taught to the ultra-Orthodox only in the days leading up to their weddings. Footsteps became a chrysalis for them through which they would leap into their new lives, just as soon as they figured out exactly how to live them.Schwartz eventually left the organization in the hands of nonprofit professionals \u2014 Footsteps was a chrysalis for her, too \u2014 and went to law school. Today, Footsteps is a 501(c)(3) with an executive director, social workers, scholarships, court-companion programs and special events like fashion nights, at which members learn about modern style outside the realm of black-and-white dresses and suits and hats. Ultra-Orthodox communities, whose leaders stand vigil against outside influences, know about Footsteps; about half the people I met in Footsteps first heard of it when they were accused by someone in their family of being a member.It\u2019s hard to talk about O.T.D.ers as a group, because like the rest of us, like ultra-Orthodox people, too, they are individuals. No two people who practice religion do it exactly the same way, despite how much it seems to the secular world that they rally around sameness; and no one who leaves it leaves the same way, either. In the region of New York City, New Jersey, and the Hudson Valley that Footsteps serves, 546,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews live in one of about five different sects. With a few exceptions, like the Skver sect in New Square, N.Y., which has actual boundaries and operates its own schools, the ultra-Orthodox live not in cloistered neighborhoods, but among secular America in Crown Heights, Flatbush and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and beyond. Perhaps it\u2019s easiest to think of them as living in a different dimension \u2014 occupying the same space but speaking a different language (Yiddish, for the most part), attending different schools, seeing their own doctors, handling judicial issues among themselves and eating their own food from their own markets.So once they leave, if they leave, they learn how ill equipped they are for survival outside their home neighborhoods, and that has a lot to do with the ways that ultra-Orthodox communities are valuable and good: the daily cycle of prayer and school and learning; how people share goals about family and values; how neighbors support one another during times of need. Once that\u2019s gone, and all a person has is her mostly Judaic-studies education and little familial support and no real skills, life gets scary. For those who leave and are married with children, the community tends to embrace the spouse left behind and help raise funds for legal support to help that person retain custody of the children. You could be someone with a spouse and children one day and find yourself completely alone the next.I learned about Footsteps in 2015, after the very public suicide of one of its young members. Her name was Faigy Mayer, and on a hot night in July, she went to the top of 230 Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron district, where there\u2019s a rooftop bar, and jumped. In death, she became something of a brief symbol (and also a lightning rod) for the O.T.D. movement, with her story plastered across local papers, many illustrated by a Facebook image of her holding a paintbrush and standing in front of a newly painted mural that said \u201cLife is Beautiful.\u201dAs news of her death broke in the New York tabloids and the Jewish papers, seemingly all the ultra-Orthodox and Orthodox people I know (who number in the hundreds \u2014 but more on that later) converged on my Facebook page to wonder if the suicide of Faigy Mayer was a case of mental illness or if suicidal tendencies were a condition inherent to the kind of person who would leave a secure and comfortable community in favor of a large world with no guarantees, a world that you\u2019d been warned would reject you. What kind of person wants to leave safety and start from the beginning, sounding different from everyone else, not knowing what to say, not knowing how to make a living \u2014 not knowing how to read past a sixth-grade level, because English is taught as an afterthought, if at all, in many of these schools?The conversation on my Facebook page was like the ones that happen between Republicans and Democrats after mass shootings: Half the posts said that we should not be looking at religious society as a cause of mental illness. The other half responded that in many ultra-Orthodox communities, the mentally ill don\u2019t get help not because it isn\u2019t available to them but because there\u2019s a stigma of bad genetics that could make a person less attractive in later marital matchmaking. And does someone have to be mentally ill to feel hopeless after being rejected by her family? Does someone have to be extraordinarily sick to succumb to the despair she feels after having ventured out into a world where she is all alone, without the skills to survive?There were two notable O.T.D. deaths in the last few years. A year and a half before, it was Deb Tambor, who overdosed on pills and vodka, surrounded by the pictures of the three children she lost custody of when she left her Skver sect in Monsey. A year after that, Joey Diangello, 34, overdosed after becoming a powerful force in protesting child abuse in ultra-Orthodox communities; he said he was raped in a ritual bath by an adult when he was 7.After I heard about Faigy\u2019s death, I interviewed people who knew her, hoping to be able to paint a portrait I ultimately couldn\u2019t. Her family relationships had been too contentious, and only a few of her family members would speak with me. Her friends told me different stories, but ultimately, the only thing I could say about her was that she was sick and didn\u2019t get the care she needed. On the night of a Footsteps Thanksgiving celebration, I returned home to news that Faigy\u2019s older sister, Sara, who was religious and had just been released from a psychiatric facility, had hanged herself in her parents\u2019 home.Shmuly was among the Footsteps members who knew Faigy. By the time of her memorial service, he had been O.T.D. for several years, having understood since elementary school that there was a world beyond 60th Street in Borough Park, Brooklyn. All he ever wanted was to know more about it. He was afraid of being married off after high school and so went to Israel for yeshiva (and then to India and then to Thailand) and staved off marital offers, until one day he found Footsteps and enrolled in the G.E.D. course there.Shmuly had known he wanted to go to college ever since he was sneak-reading $7 best sellers he found on the rack at Duane Reade. He loved the story \u201cThe Cop and the Anthem,\u201d by O. Henry; he read the abridged version of \u201cThe Call of the Wild\u201d over and over. But his school would not release his transcripts for college applications, and so he spent a year of intense study in the computer labs at Footsteps, starting with the English language and basic long division and ending with his G.E.D. He couldn\u2019t learn enough about philosophy and art. He loved the 20th-century avant-garde, like secessionist art and Dadaism; he loved the tension between the old and new ideas of the art world, and how certain art was rejected as if it were corrupting or dangerous. He enrolled at Hunter College to study art history.He\u2019s 27 now, tall and smiley and soft-spoken and polite. His English is noticeably inflected with Yiddish: His T is aspirated and dentalized instead of glottalized \u2014 in \u201ccertain\u201d and \u201cbutton,\u201d he pronounces the T, whereas most Americans just swallow it in the back of our mouths. His O vowel is less diphthongized than most American speech, and he tends to avoid contractions. He says words like \u201chair\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d as \u201chear\u201d and \u201cbeer.\u201d It doesn\u2019t bother Shmuly that he sounds different; \u201cYiddish is very hipster now,\u201d he says.I also met Malky, who knew Faigy Mayer but hadn\u2019t been close with her. Malky was from a prominent family who lived in an Israeli community so strict that when tourists walked through in short sleeves and shorts, they literally stoned them. In the summer, Malky would complain about the black tights she had to wear, how hot a Middle Eastern July could be, and her mother would say, \u201cWell, hell is hotter.\u201d When they moved to the States, Malky taught art classes to ultra-Orthodox children and wore skirts that were not black, and this marked her as a difficult marital match. Finally her parents found someone who would marry her, but Malky took one look at him and said no. It wasn\u2019t her choice, though. Her parents, whom she loved very much, promised her to this man anyway. \u201cWho\u2019s going to want you?\u201d she remembers her father, who was equally bereft, telling her. \u201cYou\u2019re 22. You\u2019re wearing green skirts. We had no choice.\u201dHer parents told her that she would get used to the man once she was married. On her wedding night, as her husband approached her, Malky ran to the bathroom and cut her gums, smearing the blood on her underwear and coming out and saying she couldn\u2019t consummate the marriage because she had her period. The day after her wedding, Malky went to her parents\u2019 house, and her mother shaved her head, a custom in some sects. Malky begged her mother to let her come home, but her mother pleaded with her to make her marriage work. Malky continued to refuse her husband, and after seven weeks, she again found Footsteps.She left her husband, got a divorce and went to live on her own, but she remains vexed by her love for her family and her fear of embarrassing them. She\u2019s an artist now, but for the longest time she wouldn\u2019t put her name on her paintings or participate in an art show, because she knew how much that would damage her family\u2019s reputation. On Friday nights she covered her head and walked over to her parents\u2019 house, where her nieces and nephews would ask where her husband was and why she didn\u2019t have children. She still goes every Friday night, but they don\u2019t ask anymore.\u201cDo you know when people are in love and they say, \u2018This person is going to kill me, he\u2019s not good for me,\u2019 and then they never want to break up?\u201d she asked me. She cried and shook her head helplessly. When we spoke, her hair was curly, and highlighted, but still growing in after being shaved. \u201cThis is what I have with my family. It\u2019s like, I love them so much, but they are horrible for me. They stop me in everything in my life.\u201dThree and a half years ago, Shmuly and Malky met at a Footsteps-sponsored birthday party, and they became friends and running partners. Shmuly realized he thought of Malky as more than a friend, but Malky wouldn\u2019t consider a romantic relationship with him; she told me she couldn\u2019t allow herself to belong to a man ever again.It was clear to everyone that religious practice just never took with me, and I waited out my time in my house until the day I left for college, when I swore I\u2019d never wear a skirt again or rush around in anticipation of sundown on a supposed day of rest. I swore I would rid myself of the vestiges of what was taught to me, which was to be afraid of an angry God who made me a certain way and then disavowed that way in the hope that I\u2019d be some ideal of a person who committed arbitrary acts of blind devotion \u2014 eating kosher food only; not turning the lights on during Saturdays; not wearing linen and wool together, which is an actual and serious Torah law. I\u2019ve been only marginally successful in keeping this oath.I was taught that I was innately bad and that I had to work at these rules in order to become something approaching good. In the ultra-\u200bOrthodox school I attended in ninth grade, I was taught to use the bathroom quickly, lest my exposed unmentionables lead me to sinful acts of self-examination. I left that school, but in a more modern one, I received more or less the same lessons. I was taught that humans were the ultimate intellectuals, unless you asked questions that extended beyond what was in the Torah. I was taught that if I ever ate a legume or a piece of risen wheat on Passover, my children would be cut off from their legacy as Jews. No one knew for sure what that meant, but over the years, the collected guesses I got from teachers included: infertility, miscarriage and having to watch my children die before I did. I no longer keep a strict version of Passover, yet each time a legume passes my lips during those eight days, I wonder if I should be hedging my bets, and so an internal war flares inside me over some hummus. After years of confused and at times contentious discussion, my husband and I now identify as something like Conservative Jews; we are incredibly ambivalent but active (read: dues-paying) members of a synagogue.When I left Orthodoxy, there was some shock of re-entry into regular society, even though I never really left it. I had negotiated to keep a TV in my mother\u2019s house, and my mother, may God and all the rabbis whose graves she prays over bless her a million times, understood that fundamentalism wasn\u2019t something I could get behind. So I watched \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210,\u201d and \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and \u201cA Different World\u201d to see how regular secular Americans related to one another.I had friends who weren\u2019t as lucky \u2014 some who had to change out of pants into skirts as they rode the elevators up to their apartments as teenagers; some who still can\u2019t visit their parents on a holiday if they\u2019re going to drive. And yet even under my best-case-scenario O.T.D. circumstances, so much of my previous life remained part of me that even when I didn\u2019t wear a skirt and even when I didn\u2019t observe Shabbat and even when I just went right out and ate nonkosher foods like shrimp, the fears and worries persisted that I was doing something wrong, that I had only departed because there was something lazy about me, that I was too prone to evil inclinations. Even in my lucky circumstances I am left with flickers of superstition and magical thinking, no matter how long it has been since I\u2019ve realized that most of what I was taught as a child is not something I agree with as an adult. And still, every night, I place my hand over my sleeping children\u2019s eyes and I recite the Shema bedtime prayer on their behalf. Every year, I fast on Yom Kippur and apologize for the ways I can\u2019t bring myself to be what I was told God wanted. I do it just in case, or because I\u2019m a coward, or at least because I\u2019m not as courageous as your garden-variety Footsteps member. All of which is to say that I don\u2019t know if it will ever feel normal.The morning of Faigy\u2019s funeral, her father stood up next to the wooden box that held her body. Her O.T.D. friends weren\u2019t allowed into the service at first, but one of them spoke to the bouncerlike guy at the front and assured him, in Yiddish, that they didn\u2019t want any trouble. They just wanted to mourn their friend. Before Faigy\u2019s father began the eulogy in Yiddish, he addressed them, notable for their lack of black hats and their lack of beards. \u201cThank you very much for coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t prepare anything in English, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAfter the funeral, the cedar box that held Faigy\u2019s body was taken to New Jersey, off a main road in view of a Coca-Cola bottling plant, where she was buried among other Hasidim, which, it seems safe to say, is exactly where she never wanted to be. The gravestone carries an acrostic of her name, talking about how she suffered, how good she was. One line reads, \u201cMay the psalms she read with such devotion bring peace to her dear soul.\u201d When I visited the site, next to her was a freshly filled grave with a temporary marker for her sister, Sara. The two graves were a sight that, though I knew to expect it, made me step backward and put one hand to my mouth. I said Kaddish from muscle memory, though I\u2019m sorry for it, because I feel fairly certain Faigy wouldn\u2019t have wanted that, either.Malky had planned to go to dinner the next night, with Shmuly and another friend, at the French restaurant Daniel for her birthday. Malky and Shmuly loved learning about new foods and wine outside ritual use. But the day came, and Malky felt that having such an extravagant meal in light of the news was unseemly. When she called the restaurant to reschedule, however, she learned that it was booked so far out that they weren\u2019t taking new reservations. They kept the date.That night, they luxuriated in the lives that they were somehow still living, having come out on the other side of something. So much had happened to them, but they were young, and one day, the years of living the lives they wanted would outnumber the years they\u2019d lived the lives they didn\u2019t want. They drank five bottles of wine among the three of them, and when it was time to go home, Malky and Shmuly decided to take a yellow cab back to Brooklyn instead of a train. They stopped first to drop off Malky before heading to Shmuly\u2019s house, but when Malky got out of the car, she asked Shmuly if he wanted to come upstairs with her. He left the car, and she took his hand and led him up the stairs, and he has remained there, with her, ever since.Advertisement"}

But after 30 years of ranching, Mark and Mary Kaltenbach were not ready for what met them after a wildfire charred their land and more than one million acres of rain-starved range this month.Dozens of their Angus cows lay dead on the blackened ground, hooves jutting in the air. Others staggered around like broken toys, unable to see or breathe, their black fur and dark eyes burned, plastic identification tags melted to their ears. Young calves lay dying.But for many, the first job after the fire passed was loading a rifle.\u201cWe did what had to be done,\u201d Mr. Kaltenbach, 69, said. \u201cThey\u2019re gentle. They know us. We know them.

Mr. Kaltenbach would wake up at 4:30 a.m. without an alarm clock. Another family down the road, the Wilsons, checked on the cows between jobs at the hospital and the telephone company. The Wilsons invited their whole family over each spring to round up the calves, vaccinate and tag them.\u201cIt\u2019s our life,\u201d Mrs. Kaltenbach, 57, said. \u201cWe lost our routine.\u201dBeyond the toll of the fire, a frustration also crops up in conversation after conversation. Ranchers said they felt overlooked amid the tumult in Washington, and were underwhelmed by the response of a new president who had won their support in part by promising to champion America\u2019s \u201cforgotten men and women.\u201d\u201cThis is the country that elected Donald Trump,\u201d said Garth Gardiner, driving a pickup across the 48,000-acre Angus beef ranch he runs with his two brothers. They lost about 500 cows in the fires. \u201cI think he\u2019d be doing himself a favor to come out and visit us.\u201dMr. Gardiner voted for Mr. Trump, and said he just wanted to hear a presidential mention of the fires amid Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets about the rapper Snoop Dogg, the East Coast blizzard and the rudeness of the press corps.\u201cTwo sentences would go a long way,\u201d Mr. Gardiner said.Weeks without snow or rain and late-winter temperatures scraping 80 degrees are threatening to create even more blazes in Western states grappling with the growing fire danger posed by climate change. Hundreds of homes were evacuated this weekend because of a wildfire that erupted in the dry hills near Boulder, Colo. By Monday, the fire was about 80 percent contained.The Kansas fires \u2014 the largest in state history \u2014 burned more than 400,000 acres here in Clark County alone. Ten days later, Mr. Gardiner was still burying cows on his family\u2019s ranch. One by one, an orange loader scooped them off the bare sandy soil and trundled them to a pit being dug by a backhoe.Ranchers said the cattle they had lost were worth more than the $2,000 they could fetch at an auction. Each cow was an engine that drove their farms and finances, giving birth to new calves every year or producing embryos through artificial insemination that could be implanted into other cows.But at about $10,000 per mile, Mr. Gardiner said, new fencing alone may cost his ranch about $2 million. His total losses could reach $5 million to $10 million. Like many ranchers out here, he had insurance on his home and equipment, but said insuring so many livestock and so much fence was impossibly expensive.\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for freebies here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work our tails off to get this thing rebuilt. We\u2019re going to get the blisters on our hands and roll up our sleeves and do the labor.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe could use a little help.\u201d\u201cThis is our Hurricane Katrina,\u201d Mr. Sawyers said. The political response to the fires convinced him that Washington, even with an administration supported by 83 percent of Clark County voters in the election, was still \u201cout of touch and didn\u2019t care about us.\u201d\u201cNone of them are worth a damn, Republicans or Democrats,\u201d he said.The governors of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have declared emergencies, and members of Congress from the affected states have toured the damaged area and promised help. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s office said that officials were adding up losses to request a presidential disaster declaration.But help did arrive. Thousands of donated hay bales, to feed surviving animals bereft of their grasslands, have been rolling into town on the backs of tractor-trailers. Firefighters arrived from Colorado to help contain and extinguish the blaze. Farming and ranching groups from across the Great Plains sent skeins of fence wire and new metal posts to drive three feet into the soil. Members of 4-H clubs and National FFA Organization chapters drove down to help with the cleanup, sleeping in guest bedrooms and on living-room floors around the towns of Ashland, Meade and Protection.\u201cWe don\u2019t like to receive,\u201d said Kendal Kay, the mayor of Ashland and president of a community bank here. \u201cIt\u2019s a time we\u2019re realizing we need to receive.\u201dMary Kaltenbach, 57, said she was not a hugger, but had been embracing neighbors for much of the past week. \u201cYou just do it,\u201d she said.In all, the Kaltenbachs lost 130 cows and about 70 calves. About a dozen of their heifers \u2014 younger females \u2014 are now penned in just behind their house, which was spared, near the scorched foundations of two barns that did burn. One evening, the couple grabbed a bucket of feed pellets to check on them. Most romped to eat, but two smaller black cows hung back behind a gate, hobbling forward.\u201cFeet hurt,\u201d Mrs. Kaltenbach said grimly of one. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to work.\u201dAbout seven miles east, the house that Matt Wilson\u2019s forebears built when they homesteaded in 1884 had withstood financial panics, droughts, the Dust Bowl and other fires, but it burned to ashes in the wildfires. His family also lost eight cows and calves, part of a small herd of about 100 that the family raises in addition to holding full-time jobs.The newer house where the Wilsons and their six children lived also was destroyed. But they managed to save 1890s photographs of Mr. Wilson\u2019s great-grandfather: standing in front of the original house, atop a horse on an empty plain, at a county rodeo. They are planning to rebuild and keep ranching.By way of explanation, Mr. Wilson pointed to the photos: \u201cThey didn\u2019t start with much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Dearth of I.P.O.s, but It\u2019s Not the Fault of Red Tape", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe confirmation hearing last week for Jay Clayton, who has been nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, focused on the continued sluggishness of the market for initial public offerings. Senators pushed the nominee to do something, anything, to revive it.The problem is that there is no magic wand \u2014 including deregulation \u2014 that can fix the decline.The problems were recently documented in a research note by Credit Suisse titled \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks.\u201d The bank documented that the total number of companies listed on the United States stock market plummeted by nearly half, to 3,671 last year from 7,322 in 1996.Such shrinkage has prompted hand-wringing for over a decade. At Mr. Clayton\u2019s hearing, at least five senators brought it up, pointing to the regulatory burdens on companies going public.There\u2019s only one problem with casting regulation as the villain: There\u2019s not much evidence for it.Moreover, the JOBS Act has done nothing to revive the market for small companies, those with a market capitalization of under $75 million. They still number less than a handful each year.And while fingers get pointed at regulation like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the number of initial public offerings fell off the cliff in 1996 \u2014 years before either bill was passed. So there must be something more here.Those who have examined this issue have come up with a number of possible reasons.The Credit Suisse paper also brings up this theory, noting that mergers are the major cause for companies to be delisted from a stock exchange. It appears that this deal activity has spread to the private markets, co-opting the process of taking companies public.For example, Cisco Systems purchased AppDynamics on the eve of its market debut. And acquirers seem willing to pay top dollar in these instances, as research and development by many large corporations now consists largely of acquiring smaller, usually private, companies.This is aptly illustrated by the buying sprees of Google and Facebook, which took candidates to go public \u2014 like Instagram, Nest, Waze and WhatsApp \u2014 out of contention.In 1996, average proceeds for an initial public offering were $85.7 million, and 54 percent of these offerings were considered small, with a market capitalization below $75 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 2014, however, average proceeds were $186.4 million and only 4 percent of offerings were small.The market for new issues has moved toward liquidity and bigger stocks. Mutual funds prefer making big investments rather than small ones for liquidity and administrative purposes \u2014 lots of small investments simply require more people and more monitoring.A third possibility is that companies simply no longer need the public market. The private markets are more efficient, and financing is readily available from venture capitalists and banks.There are even markets and mechanisms that exist not only to allow for financing, but to allow for selling employees\u2019 and founders\u2019 shares in private markets. In addition, the JOBS Act allowed companies to expand the number of shareholders and still be private, a change that encouraged companies to remain private.There are other theories. One of these notes that the 1990s saw a surge in I.P.O. activity and that we are just back to what the activity was in the 1970s and \u201980s. Who is to say what is a normal market?Another possible reason is that companies are shying away from the public markets to avoid shareholder activism, short-termism and the glare of public scrutiny.Yet the growing use of dual class shares and staggered boards by new companies, measures that help founders retain control, argues against this need. And they are tools that can be used by any company \u2014 even Shake Shack went public with dual-class stock.The bottom line is that while there might be rational reasons to reduce regulation on capital raising \u2014 to make it easier and less expensive \u2014 we are kidding ourselves if we think that simply deregulating will bring back initial public offerings.The task is much harder. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, could help build an infrastructure for buying small company offerings. Allowing mutual funds more latitude to buy illiquid small investments and to change their compensation structures if they do would be a big step.Then there is the argument that maybe we shouldn\u2019t do anything, given how hard it will be. The idea behind the public markets is to provide capital funding. But if the private markets are now efficient and capable of providing even less expensive capital at lower cost, maybe we should be fine with the current state of affairs.Still, that overlooks the fact that for most of us, our retirement money is in the public markets. We should be worried about all of this money flowing into a smaller and smaller group of companies.One answer is to allow mutual funds to invest more in private companies. Already 26 mutual fund groups had $11.5 billion invested in late-stage companies in 2016, according to Credit Suisse.That\u2019s one answer, but that will result in yet more intermediaries. The better solution is to push more companies to the public markets. Deregulating is one thing, but the real work will require more innovative thinking from market regulators. That\u2019s your homework, Mr. Clayton.On a personal note, I\u2019ve been writing the Deal Professor column for DealBook for over nine years now, and this will be my last column before I take an extended sabbatical to work on other projects.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "Discord at Middlebury: Students on the Anti-Murray Protests", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byOn CampusFilm & Media Studies and English, \u201919Economics, \u201917I helped organize the lecture through Middlebury\u2019s American Enterprise Institute Club. Mr. Murray was invited to discuss his 2012 book, \u201cComing Apart,\u201d about class divisions in the United States \u2014 a topic that is particularly prescient given the recent political changes in the country.Economics and French, \u201917The anger over the event was really about Murray\u2019s previous book, \u201cThe Bell Curve.\u201d In that work, Murray and his co-author, Richard Herrnstein, argued that a high I.Q. is the most important predictor of individual success. Low I.Q., they argued, is to blame for poverty, welfare dependency, crime and unwed pregnant mothers. The book also seemed to endorse a dangerous theory of genetic superiority: At the time it was published, the average I.Q. of black people was 15 points below whites, but the authors dismissed the idea that it could be caused by bias in testing. There is also lots of debate about whether I.Q. scores even have scientific merit.Philosophy, \u201917 For too long, a flawed notion of \u201cfree speech\u201d has allowed individuals in positions of power to spread racist pseudoscience in academic institutions, dehumanizing and subjugating people of color and gender minorities. While I defend Murray\u2019s right to speak his mind, the fact that the college provided an elevated platform for him did more harm than good. To that effect, I do not think Middlebury made sufficient avenues for students to engage with the implications of Mr. Murray\u2019s ideas.First, the event was co-sponsored by the political science department and featured opening remarks by the president of the College, elevating the speaker\u2019s institutional legitimacy. While students have the right to bring speakers of all kinds to campus, the university itself must be responsible and academically honest when giving such events a show of approval through cosponsorship. Much of Murray\u2019s work is not peer-reviewed and his assertions are not scientifically proven.Second, and more important, the format of Murray\u2019s talk did not allow for equal discussion. Were students, especially students of color, expected to just sit and listen for 45 minutes to an individual who has written that they are inferior to whites? Do Asians have to accept Murray\u2019s assertions that we have \u201chigher IQ\u2019s\u201d than other races, and as a result become the metaphorical \u201cpunching bag\u201d for issues surrounding race and class? Where was the avenue to speak out against such ideas? How could students engage in debate on an equal playing field when Mr. Murray had a stage and a microphone, and we were just members of the audience? Without a platform for legitimate discussion, it seems that students had few non-disruptive tools to get their voices heard.Economics, \u201917The pre-talk rally began at 3:35 p.m. Two students, a townsperson and a professor spoke, standing before a line of people that stretched a little over 200 yards up the hill. They talked about the symbol of the platform Middlebury was giving Murray, and about how the power structures in our society and on our campus routinely prop up white male voices over other members of the community. It made a lot of sense. Systemic racism and sexism do permeate all levels of society and power always seems to favor the rich white man.As we waited to be let in, protesters chanted: \u201cWho is the enemy? White supremacy!\u201d I joined in a few of these chants, but sporadically. White supremacy is certainly the enemy, yet it felt like many students really meant: \u201cWho is the enemy? Charles Murray.\u201d Another chant \u2014 \u201cRacist! Sexist! Anti-gay! Charles Murray, go away!\u201d \u2014 irritated me. I\u2019d been reading articles about Murray, interviews with him and excerpts from his work all week and had found no evidence he was anti-gay. In fact, he had urged the Republican Party to support gay marriage. I chanted \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d wholeheartedly; it is one of those things that you should always reaffirm when you can.International Politics and Economics, \u201917I fully believed that Middlebury should honor its institutional commitment to academic freedom and debate by letting Charles Murray speak. But I also believed that students\u2019 voices should be integral to this dialogue and so I planned to protest before the talk and ask Murray tough questions in the Q. and A. that followed his presentation.My plans changed when I arrived at the event and sat next to an activist friend. When Murray began his speech, she said, protesters would stand, turn their backs on him, read a statement in opposition, and then do a few chants. I was hesitant, but when the protesters began to read their statement, many of the students in the room stood with them, me included.I joined in the chants \u2014 \u201cWho\u2019s the enemy? White supremacy!\u201d \u2014 but felt uncomfortable that my actions went against my original plan. Still, I didn\u2019t sit down as the noise became louder and more raucous and students began to dance in the event hall.The choice appeared stark: I could either protect Murray\u2019s academic freedom and our college\u2019s commitment to intellectual debate, or I could stand up for those students \u2014 black, Latino, female and lower income \u2014 whom Murray, in his book \u201cThe Bell Curve,\u201d claimed are in an unequal position in society seemingly because of their genetic inferiority.I feared that by not participating in this effort, by not expressing my solidarity with marginalized people, I would become what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called the \u201cwhite moderate\u201d in his \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail\u201d \u2014 someone who \u201cis more devoted to \u2018order\u2019 than justice.\u201d Someone who \u201cconstantly says: \u2018I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action.\u2019 \u201dBut as the protests continued, and Murray stayed silenced, I grew more and more concerned. It is easy to paint \u201cResist\u201d on a poster, but harder to define what that should mean. If I resist a speaker like Charles Murray, despite the fact his views have been used in the service of \u201cwhite nationalism,\u201d am I also resisting intellectually open inquiry? Aren\u2019t we more akin to authoritarian countries if we begin to choose whose speech is acceptable or not? It\u2019s Charles Murray today, but what if it were a communist speaker tomorrow?Geography, \u201917I felt good about the questions I had prepared for the talk. The first one, which I developed after reading Murray\u2019s essay \u201cWhere Are the Female Einsteins?\u201d was about why he discounted research in social psychology that attributed differences in performance to the socialization of gender. Girls do worse than boys on math tests when you remind them that girls are stereotypically bad at math. Why not consider that as an explanation for a dearth of \u201cfemale Einsteins\u201d?I had left cartography lab early on Thursday to attend the pre-talk protest and get a good spot in line. Students passed out signs, and I gladly took one small enough to bring in that read \u201cRespect Existence.\u201d A friend and I made our way to the back of the bleachers: We wanted a good perspective and felt no desire to be on the ground with those leading the protest. Tensions were clearly running high.Alas, as we know, there was no opportunity to ask questions, let alone to hear Murray speak. He walked onstage, and I was surprised to see a huge group of students stand and turn their backs. As they recited a statement that had been distributed outside, I stood and joined. Then the chants erupted. I felt conflicted. Should I stand and join in for the sake of solidarity with a protest that \u2014 at the beginning \u2014 I supported with full force? Or should I do what I wished everyone else would do: Sit down and wait. I chose the latter. I sat, holding my sign on my lap, looking straight ahead.Enough students remained standing and chanting so that Murray never spoke. We could have proved our maturity and commitment to justice by asking hard, well-researched questions \u2014 something Middlebury College students tend to do really well. We had let an opportunity for intellectual protest and resistance pass us by.After students stood up and chanted, I began streaming the event on Facebook Live. Murray stayed at the podium for 20 minutes, waiting. He was then ushered out: The speech was to be delivered via livestream from a secret location instead.The protesters quickly found the new venue. I went there and saw a student scale the side of the building, hang off a windowsill and yell: \u201cMr. Murray, are you in there? Hello? I\u2019m trying to have a dialogue.\u201d Inside, students were still singing, stomping and chanting to interrupt the talk. In comments on my social media posts, students who were watching the livestream said they could hear the protesters over the feed.I was one of over 300 students who watched the livestream of Murray\u2019s talk from a room in the basement of the student center. I think that much of Charles Murray\u2019s work is unscientific and has only helped fuel inequality. I am horrified that it has been cited by groups to advance white nationalism.What Murray focused on in his speech, however, was how America was founded on a certain type of egalitarianism: Even if you were upper class, you did your best to never let that be known and you still lived and worked with people of all classes. He said that America now is more economically segregated (which is true) and liberals, like the ones that were protesting outside, are out of touch with the way most of America lives (also true).Liberal students are worried about many of those same societal issues, but we use different language (born of different ideology) to express our concern. We students are self-critical of our \u201cprivilege.\u201d Murray\u2019s phrasing \u2014 that we are \u201cout of touch with most of America\u201d because of \u201ceasy upbringings\u201d and \u201celite education\u201d \u2014 describes the same phenomenon with a different vocabulary. On Thursday, Murray talked about an increasingly stable, wealthy upper class that institutionalizes its power at the expense of ordinary Americans, concerns similar to those expressed by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and other progressives we idolize.So let\u2019s seize every opportunity we can to agree: rising systemic inequality is harmful. We can organize around that.I do not consider Murray\u2019s views scientifically or morally sound, and I condemn all white nationalist and white supremacist ends it has been used for. This does not negate, however, that he is right about the educated elite and our isolation from the rest of America. As a group we need to learn to interact with, if not the views of people like Charles Murray, then at least the reality that there are people who hold these views. We must learn to communicate effectively and authentically, if for no other reason than to make progress over the next four years.Nearly every major media outlet has now written about the event. A video I posted of students preventing Murray from delivering his lecture has been viewed over 60,000 times and has been shared and featured nationally. It\u2019s an interesting experience watching your name appear next to Tucker Carlson\u2019s face.Most of the coverage does not capture the conversations and soul-searching here at Middlebury. National coverage presents a big picture, but what we are learning here is that the big picture obscures its own truth, for it is actually made up of many contrasting points of view.The protest has caused the student body to ponder the values of Middlebury as an institution, and what the implications were of providing a platform to a speaker whose work has been accused of empowering hateful rhetoric.As a young journalist who strives to be objective, watching my peers have these conversations has been eye-opening. It has made me understand in a visceral way that no story can truly cover every angle, not every view can be reported.The violence against Murray and Stanger is terrible. The details around the event are murky, with some students saying that public safety officers escalated the situation, while the school administration (and the press) has laid the blame squarely on the protesters. The first line of this newspaper\u2019s report on the event made it sound as though hundreds of students participated in violent rioting. The debate about what exactly happened, however, overshadows what I see as the most powerful questions for all us to consider: How can we distinguish unpopular ideas from hateful or discriminatory ideas? How can we have \u201crhetorical resilience\u201d \u2014 President Patton\u2019s favorite term for using free speech to debate our way to a more inclusive society \u2014 while recognizing and combating the systems that support some voices and silence others? How should we balance the right to protest and the right to speak? How can we heal the current rift between the administration and much of the student body?I feel compelled to write about this now because both the left-leaning and right-leaning media have demonized Middlebury students, calling them a violent mob and ignoring the real emotional and intellectual concerns of marginalized students who protested.Many such voices are missing from the national conversation, as they fear repercussions on campus and beyond in such a tense political time. At least one protester decided not to publish her opinion because she is afraid such a controversial issue might affect her application for U.S. citizenship.I\u2019m still confused about my actions during the protest, but one thing I don\u2019t regret is the conversations the protests have ignited. We students were fighting speech that perpetuates stereotypes and inequality, but in the process we discovered we were promoting another form of injustice \u2014 checks on free speech and a more closed environment of intellectual discourse. This has created tension on our campus, but I think it is tension of the best kind \u2014 the kind that will push us to engage more deeply both with issues of racial oppression and the parameters of our campus dialogue.What happened at Middlebury is no longer about Murray or his work. It\u2019s not just a story about college campuses. Middlebury is not unique. In the United States, we have reached a point where nobody is willing to engage with viewpoints that don\u2019t conform to their own. In order to move forward, as a community and as a country, we must engage in tough and challenging conversations. The only way to do that is to preserve free speech, which often means defending the rights of those you disagree with, or even hate.Murray\u2019s ideas have real, tangible outcomes, which is why those who want to engage with and challenge them must be allowed to do so. Theoretically, it would be nice to discount his ideas and have them go away; pragmatically, they are not going anywhere, and if we want to fight them, at least some of us have to face them. That doesn\u2019t mean that those who feel targeted by his work should have to sit there and listen. Not all of us need to push for progress in the same way.As Americans, we are lucky to be able to talk about our political beliefs without legal consequence. The government cannot throw us in jail or punish us for the words we write or the things we say. This is our Constitutional right. But that does not mean that individuals or institutions must offer all ideas a stage, a microphone, and a large space for an audience. It does not mean that academic institutions or students must guarantee every individual 45 minutes of unchallenged and broadcasted speech, no matter how harmful. Student protesters were not violating Mr. Murray\u2019s First Amendment rights when they spoke out against him. They were changing the terms of the discussion.This is not to say that students ought not to engage with Mr. Murray\u2019s ideas at all. Given the controversial nature of his work, colleges must take into account the implications of the format of guest lectures so students can meaningfully evaluate the topic at hand.This weekend, I read these headlines \u201cStudent protesters turn violent at Middlebury College\u201d and \u201cCollege administrator and staff assault students\u201d \u2014 two seemingly contradictory reports. Going forward, we have to be able to hold complex truths together, or we are only fueling the polarization of our society.We cannot allow anyone to threaten or call into question the humanity of people on our campus, but we cannot threaten people who do so either. We can only protect one another and try to understand one another. We need to complicate our truths \u2014 regardless of whether we use the language of intersectionality or the language of traditional American values. We have to be willing to listen to one another through our buzzwords and despite our ideological differences.Advertisement"}

If there is no fever, but you are sneezing a lot and feel itchy in the nose or eyes, then you probably are suffering with allergies.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:It\u2019s cold enough to make the slush crusty.Things should warm up a tad tomorrow.\u2022 Devils host Flyers, 7 p.m. (MSG+).

{"Headline": "Police Posted Missing Teenagers\u2019 Data on Social Media. A City Took Note.", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byA new approach by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to use social media to raise awareness about teenagers reported missing did indeed gain attention \u2014 some of it unintentional.Starting in January, the department changed the way it alerted the public about missing teenagers by posting their photographs, names and ages on Twitter. Previously, publicity about each case was discretionary.That change, though, prompted a burst of attention by activists, members of the public and politicians, who interpreted the postings as a spike in the number of missing teenagers, particularly blacks and Hispanics.\u201cTen children of color went missing in our nation\u2019s capital in a period of two weeks, and, at first, garnered very little media attention,\u201d the caucus wrote, calling it \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and indicative of an assumption that those children had all run away and had not been abducted.Ms. Mikhaylova said, \u201cThey leave voluntarily, they come back voluntarily or they are located.\u201d\u201cSome of the circumstances that would lead an individual to leave home, that is a very complex issue,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be talked about in the community with as much gravity as anything,\u201dShe added that human trafficking was a concern nationwide, but that \u201cwe don\u2019t have an indication that that is what is going on.\u201dThere are no reports that any of the missing teenagers were abducted, Ms. Mikhaylova said.Also on Friday, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a series of measures to improve the city\u2019s response to reports of missing children and address issues that lead young people to run away from home.The figures that the police department reported on missing juveniles in the first quarter of 2017 are on track to equal or be lower than the totals in previous years. At the end of 2016, for example, there were 2,242 missing juveniles (aged 17 and younger) reported.\u201cBut one missing child is too many,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all agree on that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He has had four ex-wives and six children. If anything, he was a tad wistful about how things might have turned out otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think if didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the financial pressure, I would have done a lot better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have made more movies.

His book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPersonal Exposures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sits on my shelf, and its pages are well-thumbed-through.While traveling the world many times doing commercial and editorial photography as a member of Magnum, Mr. Erwitt always made time to shoot for himself. No matter if the professional work was in color, his personal work was in black and white, and always on film. These days he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll shoot digitally for clients, but not for himself.The best images from his canon are so easily recalled, like \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalifornia (California Kiss),\u00e2\u0080\u009d from 1956, which is featured in the San Francisco exhibition. We see two lovers reflected in a car\u00e2\u0080\u0099s round, rear-view mirror, while the majestic Pacific Ocean beckons in the distance. More than perhaps any other image, this came to represent an idealized West Coast optimism in 1950s America, predating even Gidget and the Beach Boys.In addition to capturing this optimism so well, Mr. Erwitt is also known for his visual puns and use of humor. The jokes are often silly and obvious, but sometimes they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re high-minded and literate too, as in \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuseo del Prado, Madrid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d from 1995, in which a gaggle of men are shown ogling Goya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Nude Maja,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while a lone woman contemplates the clothed version of the same painting.He acknowledged that it was a good thing if his work was received this way, yet he denied being funny himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think my wives thought I was particularly funny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I certainly prefer comedy to tragedy. And if people think my pictures are amusing, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m delighted, because I like amusing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFinally, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be an article about Elliott Erwitt if we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention the dog photographs, since those might be the most beloved of all. It turns out that man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend is no randomly chosen subject guaranteed to get giggles. He really loves dogs deeply.In fact, he got a new dog not too long ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost recently, I brought a dog back from Cuba. Just a farm dog who kept on following me around, so I brought him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, before waiting a beat to deliver the punch line.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe barks in Spanish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "With Their Leaders at a Loss, Marine Veterans Fight Abusers", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byAs a Marine infantry sergeant, James LaPorta once led an intelligence team in Afghanistan. Now, as a private citizen, he is doggedly tracking the moves of an online group that has been secretly compiling and sharing nude photos of hundreds of women in the Marine Corps.With top generals admitting before Congress that they are unsure how to protect members of the Marine Corps from nameless, faceless social-media \u201cpredators,\u201d Mr. LaPorta is among an unlikely scattering of can-do young veterans who have decided to take that assignment upon themselves.He and his comrades in online vigilance have been gathering intelligence and making counterstrikes, tracking the members of illicit groups, including Marines United, as they try to hide, and stripping away the anonymity that has allowed the group to thrive. They are also feeding information back to Marine Corps investigators.\u201cThe Marines\u2019 response is to be careful and slow, but the people they are after move very fast,\u201d Mr. LaPorta said. \u201cIf you want to catch them, you have to move at their speed.\u201dIndeed, Marine Corps leaders have resorted to traditional moves, commissioning a task force and mounting a meticulous investigation. But the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Robert B. Neller, frankly admitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the nude-photo scandal was a cultural problem he was ill-prepared to address.\u201cThere is a risk I cannot protect people on social media,\u201d General Neller said.It is certainly not easy: Marines United, which consists of thousands of active-duty and veteran Marines, has hopped from Facebook page to Facebook page, changing its name each time it gets shut down, while still trading illicit photos and taunting federal investigators.\u201cThe Marine Corps thought because they shut a Facebook page down, the group was dead,\u201d said Mr. LaPorta, 30, who left the Marines in 2014. \u201cWe had to show them it was just metastasizing into other back rooms.\u201dMr. LaPorta and other veterans trying to fight groups like Marines United have been deluged with online harassment themselves. Other Marines have called them traitors and threatened them with violence, but they have pressed on in what they see as a battle for the future of the Corps.\u201cThe Marine Corps can\u2019t do this alone. The internet is too huge,\u201d Mr. LaPorta said. \u201cWe need to police ourselves.\u201dThey say the fight is up to them in part because trying to get Marine Corps leaders, who are often near retirement, to recognize and address the power of social media in the military is as slow and frustrating as teaching an aging parent to set up a new laptop.Mr. Brennan said he was frustrated by what he saw as a slow and outdated response, as commanders convene a task force made up largely of older, high-ranking Marines and put out new social media policies that will be ignored or ridiculed online.He added that the military\u2019s response so far had been ineffective, noting that he had given investigators dozens of names and files on Marines United nearly two months ago but was not aware of the authorities\u2019 having taken any action.\u201cI almost feel like they didn\u2019t want to admit this stuff existed,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cAnd when we forced them to, they were caught off guard.\u201dA Marine Corps spokesman said he could not comment on the ongoing investigation.Earlier this week, Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, announced that investigators had identified 700 active-duty Marines and 150 Marines in the Reserve who were involved in the Marines United group.For several years, the Marine Corps has known of web pages where Marines shared racist and sexist memes, as well as photos of female Marines posted without their consent. Despite a number of public reports, the Corps has failed to crack down on the sites.For several years, active-duty and veteran Marines in a group called Just the Tip of the Spear have been posting illegal and offensive material on Facebook, Instagram and other sites. Like Marines United, they have posted nude photos of servicewomen without their permission. In some cases, they have also posted the women\u2019s telephone numbers and other private information. When women complained, the site\u2019s followers often harassed them more.Shawn Wylde, a Marine captain who served in a mixed-gender support battalion in Iraq, reported the site to Marine law enforcement as soon as he saw what was happening in 2013.When news emerged this month that the Marines were still engaged in the same type of online harassment, Mr. Wylde decided to fight Just the Tip of the Spear on his own by tracking down the anonymous members and unmasking them one by one by posting their names on the Silkies Facebook page.With $10,000 of his own money, he bought targeted ads on Facebook on Monday to appear on the pages of young Marines, especially young female Marines. The ads featured a meme of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis denouncing the shadowy groups and asking everyone to send information on the anonymous ringleaders to Mr. Wylde, so he could out them.\u201cIt\u2019s clear the leadership doesn\u2019t understand how social media works,\u201d Mr. Wylde said. \u201cBut I do, so I figured I had to do something.\u201dBut he said he was newly motivated by the disrespect the groups continued to show toward women in the Marines.\u201cI served with a lot of great women in Iraq. One was actually killed by an I.E.D.,\u201d he said, referring to an improvised explosive device. \u201cThese guys harassed a woman who was a friend of mine. I wanted it to end, and it didn\u2019t look like anyone was going to do anything.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe main point here is to make a cultural change, not get them prosecuted. That would be great, though.\u201dWithin hours, Mr. Wylde said, his ads began bringing in tips. Several women wrote in with information on men who they said were running Just the Tip of the Spear. Two of the tipsters claimed to be the wives of key members of the group.Some of the men are still active Marines. One of the founders of Just the Tip of the Spear was named Marine of the Year by The Marine Corps Times, according to Mr. Wylde. He has given the men\u2019s names to the Marine Corps but said the Corps had not responded.The New York Times tried to contact several of the men named, but none replied.Some female veterans close to the men said that some were veterans who spent most of their time online and had been unable to transition from their military life.All week, as Mr. Wylde has continued his crusade against anonymous trolls, his Silkies site has been flooded with messages of support, many of them from women who were targets of the group.\u201cYou are single-handedly restoring my faith in my brothers,\u201d one female Marine veteran wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many of those troll pages, I was starting to believe maybe that\u2019s what our brothers really thought of us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Not Just Unfair: Inequality Is a Threat to Our Governance", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.President Obama labeled income inequality \u201cthe defining challenge of our time.\u201d But why exactly? And why \u201cour time\u201d especially? In part because we now know just how much goes to the very top of the income distribution, and beyond that, we know that recent economic growth, which has been anemic in any case, has accrued mostly to those who were already well-heeled, leaving stagnation or worse for many Americans. But why is this a problem?Why am I hurt if Mark Zuckerberg develops Facebook, and gets rich on the proceeds? Some care about the unfairness of income inequality itself, some care about the loss of upward mobility and declining opportunities for our kids and some care about how people get rich \u2014 hard work and innovation are O.K., but theft, legal or otherwise, is not. Yet there is one threat of inequality that is widely feared, and that has been debated for thousands of years, which is that inequality can undermine governance. In his fine book, both history and call to arms, Ganesh Sitaraman argues that the contemporary explosion of inequality will destroy the American Constitution, which is and was premised on the existence of a large and thriving middle class. He has done us all a great service, taking an issue of overwhelming public importance, delving into its history, helping understand how our forebears handled it and building a platform to think about it today.As recognized since ancient times, the coexistence of very rich and very poor leads to two possibilities, neither a happy one. The rich can rule alone, disenfranchising or even enslaving the poor, or the poor can rise up and confiscate the wealth of the rich. The rich tend to see themselves as better than the poor, a proclivity that is enhanced and even socially sanctioned in modern meritocracies. The poor, with little prospect of economic improvement and no access to political power, \u201cmight turn to a demagogue who would overthrow the government \u2014 only to become a tyrant. Oligarchy or tyranny, economic inequality meant the end of the republic.\u201dSome constitutions were written to contain inequalities. In Rome, the patricians ruled, but could be overruled by plebeian tribunes whose role was to protect the poor. There are constitutions with lords and commoners in separate chambers, each with well-defined powers. Sitaraman calls these \u201cclass warfare constitutions,\u201d and argues that the founding fathers of the United States found another way, a republic of equals. The middle classes, who according to David Hume were obsessed neither with pleasure-seeking, as were the rich, nor with meeting basic necessities, as were the poor, and were thus amenable to reason, could be a firm basis for a republic run in the public interest. There is some sketchy evidence that income and wealth inequality was indeed low in the 18th century, but the crucial point is that early America was an agrarian society of cultivators with an open frontier. No one needed to be poor when land was available in the West.The founders worried a good deal about people getting too rich. Jefferson was proud of his achievement in abolishing the entail and primogeniture in Virginia, writing the laws that \u201claid the ax to the root of Pseudoaristocracy.\u201d He called for progressive taxation and, like the other founders, feared that the inheritance of wealth would lead to the establishment of an aristocracy. (Contrast this with those today who simultaneously advocate both equality of opportunity and the abolition of estate taxes.) Madison tried to calculate how long the frontier would last, and understood the threat to the Constitution that industrialization would bring; many of the founders thought of wage labor as little better than slavery and hoped that America could remain an agrarian society.Of course, the fears about industrialization were realized, and by the late 19th century, in the Gilded Age, income inequality had reached levels comparable to those we see today. In perhaps the most original part of his book, Sitaraman, an associate professor of law at Vanderbilt Law School, highlights the achievements of the Progressive movement, one of whose aims was taming inequality, and which successfully modified the Constitution. There were four constitutional amendments in seven years \u2014 the direct election of senators, the franchise for women, the prohibition of alcohol and the income tax. To which I would add another reform, the establishment of the Federal Reserve, which provided a mechanism for handling financial crises without the need for the government to be bailed out by rich bankers, as well as the reduction in the tariff, which favored ordinary people by bringing down the cost of manufactures. Politics can respond to inequality, and the Constitution is not set in stone.What of today, when inequality is back in full force? I am not persuaded that we can be saved by the return of a rational and public-spirited middle class, even if I knew exactly how to identify middle-class people, or to measure how well they are doing. Nor is it clear, postelection, whether the threat is an incipient oligarchy or an incipient populist autocracy; our new president tweets from one to the other. And European countries, without America\u2019s middle-class Constitution, face some of the same threats, though more from autocracy than from plutocracy, which their constitutions may have helped them resist. Yet it is clear that we in the United States face the looming threat of a takeover of government by those who would use it to enrich themselves together with a continuing disenfranchisement of large segments of the population.Sitaraman reviews many possible correctives, including redistribution to reduce inequality; better enforcement of antitrust laws; campaign finance reform to break the dependence of legislators on deep pockets; compulsory voting; and restrictions on lobbying, including the possibility of \u201cpublic defender\u201d lobbyists to act on behalf of the people. I would add the creation of a single-payer health system, not because I am in favor of socialized medicine but because the artificially inflated costs of health care are powering up inequality by producing large fortunes for a few while holding down wages; the pharmaceutical industry alone had 1,400 lobbyists in Washington in 2014. American health care does a poor job of delivering health, but is exquisitely designed as an inequality machine, commanding an ever-larger share of G.D.P. and funneling resources to the top of the income distribution.Perhaps the least familiar and most intriguing policy proposal that Sitaraman discusses is the idea of reviving the Roman tribunate: 51 citizens would be selected by lot from the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution. They would be able to veto one statute, one executive order and one Supreme Court decision each year; they would be able to call a referendum, and impeach federal officials.Such a proposal seems fanciful today, but so is campaign finance reform, or greater redistribution. Yet we do well to remember Milton Friedman\u2019s dictum that it takes a crisis to bring real change, so that our job in the meantime is to develop alternatives to existing policies that are ready for when \u201cthe politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\u201d There will surely be no lack of crises in the days to come.Angus Deaton, a professor emeritus at Princeton, was awarded the Nobel in economic science in 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Russian Revolution: Then and Now", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byEditorial NotebookThe many people writing about the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution this year usually have to pause early in their work to explain why the February Revolution was in March and the October Revolution in November. The reason is simple \u2014 Russia was on a different calendar at the time \u2014 but that nagging inconsistency offers a foretaste of the extraordinary degree to which perspective shapes the facts, myths and political narratives of an upheaval that continues to shape history today.In the White Russian emigrant world into which I was born, the Russian Revolution was a horrible cataclysm that destroyed our Holy Russia and installed a demonic, murderous regime. Many families had a portrait of Czar Nicholas II on the wall, often the one by Valentin Serov, alongside the icons and a faded photo of the old manor house. The old men, many of them veterans of the blood bath that was World War I, often lapsed into \u201cwhat ifs\u201d \u2014 what if the czar had not abdicated, what if the Guards had arrived on time, what if. \u2026 Other \u00e9migr\u00e9s, like the old exiled socialists in New York, argued endlessly over what the Duma, the provisional government or the Mensheviks should have done differently.In the Soviet Union, where I arrived in 1980 as a reporter, these debates were officially closed and to raise them risked a visit to the K.G.B. The February Revolution, in which the monarchy gave way to the provisional government, was considered a \u201cdemocratic bourgeois\u201d sideshow to the Great October Socialist Revolution that opened the way for a \u201cnew era in the history of humanity.\u201d The October Revolution, Nov. 7 (Oct. 25 in the Julian calendar), the day on which the provisional government was overthrown, was the national holiday, marked with military displays on Red Square under massive portraits of Marx, Engels and Lenin.But then no nation that has experienced revolution can ever cease poring over its causes, myths and lessons. Not even America. I was drafted into the Army in the late 1960s, at the peak of the antiwar and social movements. Basic training included propaganda films, and one was about the American Revolution. Alongside the standard stories of minutemen, freedom and democracy, the film made a point of arguing that the Loyalists were also good people and that revolution \u2014 as in what was going on in America at the time \u2014 is not always good. Most of my fellow trainees slept through the film, but it did demonstrate the way national histories require massaging even in mature democracies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Those Indecipherable Medical Bills? They\u2019re One Reason Health Care Costs So Much", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "FeatureHospitals have learned to manipulate medical codes \u2014 often resulting in mind-boggling bills.Supported byDuring a subarachnoid hemorrhage, if the pressure in the head isn\u2019t relieved, blood accumulates in that narrow space and can push the brain down toward the neck. Vital nerves that control breathing and vision are compressed. Death is imminent. Wickizer was whisked by helicopter ambulance to the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, 160 miles away, for an emergency procedure to halt the bleeding.After spending days in a semi-comatose state, Wickizer slowly recovered and left the hospital three weeks after the hemorrhage, grateful to be alive. But soon after she returned home to her two teenage children, she found herself confronted with a different kind of catastrophe. Wickizer had had health insurance for most of her adult life: Her husband, who died in 2006, worked for the city of Norfolk, which insured their family while he was alive and for three years beyond. After his death, Wickizer worked in a series of low-wage jobs, but none provided health insurance. A minor pre-existing condition \u2014 she was taking Lexapro, a common medicine for depression \u2014 meant that her only insurance option was to be funneled into the \u201chigh-risk pool\u201d (a type of costly insurance option that was essentially rendered obsolete by the Affordable Care Act and now figures in some of the G.O.P. plans to replace it). She would need to pay more than $800 per month for a policy with a $5,000 deductible, and her medical procedures would then be reimbursed at 80 percent. She felt she couldn\u2019t afford that. In 2011, she decided to temporarily stop working to tend to her children, which qualified them for Medicaid; with trepidation, she left herself uninsured.And so in early 2014, without an insurer or employer or government agency to run interference between her and the hospital, she began receiving bills: $16,000 from Sentara Norfolk (not including the scan or the E.R. doctor), $50,000 for the air ambulance. By the end of January, there was also one for $24,000 from the University of Virginia Physicians\u2019 Group: charges for some of the doctors at the medical center. \u201cI thought, O.K., that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Wickizer recalls. A month later, a bill for $54,000 arrived from the same physicians\u2019 group, which included further charges and late fees. Then a separate bill came just for the hospital\u2019s charges, containing a demand for $356,884.42 but little in the way of comprehensible explanation.In other countries, when patients recover from a terrifying brain bleed \u2014 or, for that matter, when they battle cancer, or heal from a serious accident, or face down any other life-threatening health condition \u2014 they are allowed to spend their days focusing on getting better. Only in America do medical treatment and recovery coexist with a peculiar national dread: the struggle to figure out from the mounting pile of bills what portion of the fantastical charges you actually must pay. It is the sickness that eventually afflicts most every American.What\u2019s less understood is the extent to which our current medical-billing system itself is responsible for the high prices patients are charged. There are, of course, many factors that have led to the United States\u2019 record-breaking $3 trillion health care bill: runaway drug prices, excessive testing and sky-high charges for even the most basic medical interventions. But all of those individual price increases have been enabled \u2014 indeed, aided and abetted \u2014 by the complex system of billing and coding that underlies bills like those sent to Wickizer. That system, with its lines of alphanumeric codes and arcane medical abbreviations, has given birth to a gigantic new industry of consultants, armies of back-room experts whom medical providers and insurance companies deploy against each other in an endless war over which medical procedures were undertaken and how much to pay for them. Caught in the crossfire are Americans like Wanda Wickizer, left with huge bills and indecipherable explanations in languages they cannot possibly understand.In the 1940s, the World Health Organization took over stewardship of Bertillon\u2019s system and renamed it to reflect a new, broader focus: the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD). The codes became an invaluable tool, a common language for epidemiologists and statisticians to track the world\u2019s afflictions. But over the last several decades in the United States, codes gradually took on a bedrock financial function as the basis for medical billing. In 1979, the government decided to use what by then were called ICD-9 codes \u2014 which specify the patient\u2019s diagnosis \u2014 in adjudicating Medicare and Medicaid claims, with some modifications added specifically for that purpose; the United States version was called ICD-9-CM. (The country has recently moved to a new iteration, ICD-10-CM.) For its beneficiaries, Medicare pays a fixed fee for inpatient hospitalization based primarily on the ICD-CM code, which is translated into a DRG (diagnosis-related group) code \u2014 which is the immediate basis for reimbursement.Other insurers followed in making codes the basis for billing. Coding systems begot new coding systems, because few hospitals wanted to be paid according to Medicare\u2019s relatively low DRG standards. And because strategic coding meant increased payment, that begot coding specialists and coding courses and coding degrees. There are now different increasingly complex coding languages that define payment for different kinds of services: CPT codes, for office visits delivered by doctors, as well as HCPCS, ICD-PCS-CM and DRG, for charges that are incurred in the hospital. There are tens of thousands of codes in each lexicon that have become increasingly specific. For example, there are different codes for in-office earwax removal depending on the method used (irrigation or instruments), different codes for delivering different vaccinations and a code for each injection delivered in the hospital. Different insurers also use different coding systems. While Medicare would have most likely considered Wickizer\u2019s brain bleed as DRG 021, if billed to a commercial insurer, it could result in more than a dozen ICD codes and hundreds of HCPCS entries.Seemingly subtle choices about which code to use can have large financial consequences. If after reviewing a hospital chart of, say, a patient who has just had a problem with his heart, a hospital coder indicates the diagnosis code for \u201cheart failure\u201d (ICD-9-CM Code 428) instead of the one for \u201cacute systolic heart failure\u201d (Code 428.21), the difference could mean thousands of dollars. \u201cIn order to code for the more lucrative code, you have to know how it is defined and make sure the care described in the chart meets the criterion, the definition, for that higher number,\u201d says one experienced coder in Florida, who helped with Wickizer\u2019s case and declined to be identified because she works for another major hospital. In order to code for \u201cacute systolic heart failure,\u201d the patient\u2019s chart ought to include supporting documentation, for example, that the heart was pumping out less than 25 percent of its blood with each beat and that he was given an echocardiogram and a diuretic to lower blood pressure. Submitting a bill using the higher code without meeting criteria could constitute fraud.Each billing decision, then, can be seen as a battle of coder versus coder. The coders who work for hospitals and doctors strive to bring in as much revenue as possible from each service, while coders employed by insurers try to deny claims as overreaching. Coders who audit Medicare charts look for abuse to reclaim money or fraud that needs to be punished with fines. Hospital coders teach doctors \u2014 and doctors pay to take courses \u2014 to learn how they can \u201cupcode\u201d their charts to a more lucrative level with minimal effort. In a doctor\u2019s office, a Level 3 visit (paid, say, at $175) might be legally transformed into a Level 4 (say, $225) by performing one extra maneuver, like weighing the patient or listening to the lungs, whether the patient\u2019s illness required that or not.While most hospitals and insurers set their own rates for each level of care, adding a step when interacting with a patient can also bring windfalls. E.R. doctors, for example, learned that insurers might accept a higher-reimbursed code for the examination and treatment of a patient with a finger fracture (usually 99282) if \u2014 in addition to needed interventions \u2014 a narcotic painkiller was also prescribed (a plausible bump up to 99283), indicating a more serious condition.Toward the end of the 20th century and into the next, as strategic coding increased, a new industry thrived. For-profit colleges offered medical-coding degrees, and internships soon followed. Because alphanumeric coding languages are as distinct from one another as Chinese is from Russian, different degree tracks are necessary, along with distinct professional organizations that offer their own particular professional exams, certifications and licensing. Hospital systems and insurers \u2014 which have become huge, Hydra-like enterprises \u2014 now all employ roomfuls of coding-program graduates to perform these tasks. Membership in the American Academy of Professional Coders has risen to more than 170,000 today from roughly 70,000 in 2008.Individual doctors have complained bitterly about the increasing complexity of coding and the expensive necessity of hiring their own professional coders and billers \u2014 or paying a billing consultant. But they have received little support from the medical establishment, which has largely ignored the protests. And perhaps for good reason: The American Medical Association owns the copyright to CPT, the code used by doctors. It publishes coding books and dictionaries. It also creates new codes when doctors want to charge for a new procedure. It levies a licensing fee on billing companies for using CPT codes on bills. Royalties for CPT codes, along with revenues from other products, are the association\u2019s biggest single source of income.Patients with good health insurance are often blissfully unaware and mostly unaffected by the jockeying that goes on over how to code their bills. But uninsured patients like Wickizer, or (increasingly) those with high deductibles, are stuck with no insurer to argue on their behalf. Her experience with the University of Virginia Medical Center is not unique: Studies have shown that hospitals charge patients who are uninsured or self-pay 2.5 times more than they charge those covered by health insurance (who are billed negotiated rates) and three times more than the amount allowed by Medicare. That gap has grown considerably since the 1980s.First, she took stock of her finances. She paid the rent for the Norfolk apartment that she and her children lived in by renting out a townhouse that she and her deceased husband had bought in Virginia Beach; after paying property tax, insurance and maintenance on the townhouse, she just broke even. She also received about $2,000 a month in Social Security survivor benefits because of her husband\u2019s death. In addition, she had about $100,000 from her husband\u2019s life insurance in a retirement account, which she was also hoping would help pay for her children\u2019s college. With medical bills totaling nearly $500,000 and no health insurance, the numbers didn\u2019t add up. \u201cMy dad said: \u2018They\u2019ll never expect you to pay that,\u2019\u2009\u201d Wickizer told me. \u201cBut they did.\u201dAs a sign of good faith, she quickly paid $1,500 to the hospital and $1,000 to the doctors and sought to make sense of the bills. Patients today are told to be good medical consumers, but they are asked to write checks for thousands of dollars \u2014 in this case hundreds of thousands \u2014 with little explanation of what they\u2019re for. Wickizer did what she would have done with a credit-card statement: She contacted the hospital and requested an itemized bill. Her idea was that if she could understand how much she was being charged for each procedure, she could compare the fees with the reimbursements that Medicare or another insurer would pay for those services and begin some kind of negotiation.A month later, on March 19, the hospital finally sent a list of charges, using medical abbreviations and terminology but not revealing the all-important alphanumeric codes. Despite being 60 pages long, the tally seemed incomplete, leaving out doctor\u2019s charges and including other fees that seemed incidental, like charges for catheters, wires and oxygen. Room charges were vastly different on different days.Nearly simultaneously, she received a one-page bill for the hospital portion of her care, broken down only into the broadest categories, including $111,162 in room charges, $34,755.75 for pharmacy, $19,653 for labs, $8,640 for the operating room, $8,325 for anesthesia, $1,143 for the recovery room, $44,524 for medical supplies and $40,489 for radiology services, totaling $356,884.42. The bill informed her that the medical center was prepared to offer her its standard 20 percent discount for patients who are uninsured, leaving a \u201cwhat you owe now\u201d fee of $285,507.58. It noted that the hospital could offer some additional financial assistance, but only if her household of three had assets of less than $3,100 (\u201csuch as bank or retirement accounts\u201d), which disqualified Wickizer and very likely most Americans who have ever held a job.Next, she did her best to find out what Medicare or another insurer would have paid for her hospitalization, hoping to offer the hospital that amount from her retirement account. To understand the Medicare codes, she had to learn a bit of coding language. Would her hospitalization count as Medicare DRG 020 or 021? She estimated that in 2013, her subarachnoid hemorrhage (most likely coded, she determined, as \u201cintracranial hemorrhage or cerebral infarction disorders, DRG 021, with procedures and major comorbidities or complications\u201d), would have been reimbursed by Medicare for about $80,000. Had a member of the armed services experienced the same condition, Tricare, the military insurer, might have paid closer to $70,000. But to know how much a commercial insurer would have paid, she would have to figure out what HCPCS codes the hospital used to calculate her bill, and the hospital did not send those. Hospitals tend to treat their billing strategies \u2014 codes and their master price list, called a charge master \u2014 as trade secrets vital to their business. State laws and judges tend to respect that as proprietary information.When the billers called insisting on payment of the full $285,507.58, Wickizer explained, \u201cI don\u2019t have this kind of money.\u201d She offered the hospital and its doctors the $100,000 in her retirement account. They declined and suggested that she sign up for a payment plan of $5,000 a month to the hospital \u2014 and a second $5,000 plan for the physicians\u2019 group. It was an untenable amount.In October 2014, a sheriff affixed a summons to Wickizer\u2019s front door, saying that the university was suing her for nonpayment. Eric Swensen, a spokesman for the University of Virginia, declined to answer questions about the case, citing patient privacy, as governed by HIPAA rules. But he noted that the university provides $270 million worth of free care to patients who meet its criterion for assistance and sets up interest-free payment plans for those who don\u2019t.In vetting Wickizer\u2019s bill, the experts encountered roadblocks from the medical center at every turn in a contentious battle that lasted for over a year. Multiple legal requests to review Wickizer\u2019s chart and complete bill \u2014 with its coding elucidated \u2014 were refused. Nora Johnson, a retired hospital bill-compliance auditor from West Virginia who volunteered to help Wickizer, noted that not revealing the billing codes constituted a violation of federal law. No insurer would have paid the bills without seeing them, allowing at least a rational attempt at negotiation. As Wickizer\u2019s team wrote to the University of Virginia in one of their letters: \u201cNo Codes = No Pay.\u201d The University of Virginia Physicians\u2019 Group, which independently charged Wickizer $54,000, eventually turned over its billing codes. Wickizer\u2019s experts were able to use the bill fragments they had received in discovery, supplemented by those codes, to get a better idea of what medical procedures Wickizer received during her three-week hospitalization. From there, they tried to extrapolate how the hospital had, perhaps, coded her case. By examining the cost reports the University of Virginia hospital must file with Medicare, which indicate the amount it spends delivering certain types of care, Christine Kraft, another medical-billing expert, estimated that even by its own calculations, the medical center spent less than $60,000 treating Wickizer.That discrepancy comes, in part, from the prolonged negotiations over payment and the huge number of coders, billers and collectors who have to be compensated: Their salaries and loans from those years of training in obscure languages are folded into those high charges and rising premiums. In addition, as is often the case in warfare, the big conventional army can be at a disadvantage: The insurance companies and government seem to be always one step behind the latest guerrilla tactics of providers\u2019 coders.For years, creative coding has been winning over what the government calls \u201ccorrect coding,\u201d meaning coding that gives providers their due, but without exaggeration. Indeed, each attempt by the government to control questionable coding to enhance providers\u2019 revenue has seemed to only fuel more attempts. In 1996, for example, Medicare\u2019s National Correct Coding Initiative made it clear that certain codes couldn\u2019t appear on the same bill because they were inherently part of the same procedure. As a rule, an anesthesiologist could not, for example, separately bill for anesthesia and checking your oxygen level during your surgery. But the government created Modifier 59 \u2014 a code that could be appended to other codes to allow doctors to take exceptions to that rule in unusual cases. Modifier 59 could be used to allow for two payments in certain situations, such as when an oncology nurse needed to insert two separate IVs for two different purposes \u2014 one to administer chemotherapy, say, and another hours later because the patient seemed dehydrated. Such cases were expected to be exceedingly rare.But just as entrepreneurial corporate tax lawyers search each new tax code for economic advantage, entrepreneurial coders and billers find loopholes to exploit at the edge of the law. An investigation by the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General in 2005 found many instances of Modifier 59 abuse. Forty percent of code pairs billed with Modifier 59 in 2003 were not legitimate, resulting in $59 million in overpayment. Similarly, when Medicare announced that it would pay only a set fee for the first hour and a half of a chemotherapy infusion \u2014 and a bonus for time thereafter \u2014 a raft of infusions clocked in at 91 minutes.Like nearly every area of medicine, coding science has advanced \u2014 though not to the patient\u2019s benefit. Commercial computer \u201cencoder\u201d programs maximize income from coding and make helpful suggestions (\u201cThat could be billed for Level 3,\u201d or \u201cDid you forget Code 54150,\u201d indicating a circumcision on a bill for a male newborn). Today many medical centers have coders specializing in particular disciplines \u2014 joint replacement or ophthalmology or interventional radiology, for example. Advanced coding consultants advise lesser coders. The Business of Spine, a Texas-based consulting firm with a partner office in Long Island, advises spine surgeons\u2019 billers about what coding Medicare and commercial insurers will tolerate, what\u2019s legal and not, to maximize revenue. The evolution of this mammoth growth enterprise means bigger bills for everyone \u2014 whether through increasing premiums and deductibles on insurance policies or, as in Wickizer\u2019s situation, depleting the savings earmarked for children\u2019s college.In Wickizer\u2019s case, the hospital brought in a law firm that specialized in debt collection, then called Daniel & Hetzel and based in Winchester, Va. For a year and a half, Wickizer\u2019s team of experts dissected the bills and negotiated with the hospital and its representatives at the law firm over its charges and coding strategies \u2014 just as insurers do behind the scenes on patients\u2019 behalf. The experts laid out their logic for what might constitute reasonable payment in a detailed report based on what they could discover about Wickizer\u2019s care: how it could be coded and what other hospitals and insurers would have paid. They helped her local lawyer, Kelly Roberts, write motions for discovery and legal letters and made offers of payment between $65,000 and $80,000, which they calculated should provide the hospital a profit on the services rendered to Wickizer.But the hospital did not accept any of the offers. In a letter, Peter Hetzel, an attorney at the firm, said his client would accept only just over $225,000, saying the University of Virginia Medical Center was \u201cthe victim here.\u201d He noted, too, that the small rental property that Wickizer owned \u2014 appraised at $90,200 in 2014 \u2014 was considered fair game for the hospital to seize as payment. Swensen, the spokesman for the university, said that it decides on a case-by-case basis whether or not to report nonpayment to credit agencies or to pursue civil cases against patients in court. He added: \u201cIf we obtain a lien on real estate, we do not seek to sell the property if it is the patient\u2019s primary residence.\u201dIn February 2016, Wickizer received a letter from the state of Virginia saying that the medical center would be dunning money from any tax refund she might get. At one point, in exasperation, Wickizer wrote to her group of experts: \u201cMore than likely I am going to have to declare bankruptcy by the time this is all said and done, and I just would like to have everything settled. I want to pay them what I have and what is fair.\u201dBy then, Wickizer was recovering physically and had married her boyfriend. But she was still struggling with stress from the uncertainty of the mammoth bills hanging over her. With court dates scheduled and postponed, motions filed and denied, she and her pro bono lawyer from Chicago, Tom Osran, along with her local lawyer were finally scheduled to face off in court with the University of Virginia Medical Center on April 29, 2016. The day before trial, after Osran was preparing to book his plane ticket to Virginia, and after I called the hospital inquiring about attending the court session, the case was dismissed. The terms of the settlement are sealed.Nearly a year later, Wickizer remains exhausted by the ordeal. Her speech, which was hesitant when I first spoke with her more than two years ago, sounds fluid now, and she is funny and thoughtful, though she says she still occasionally needs to search to find the right word, a form of a condition known as aphasia. Now working part-time as a clerk in a small store, she would like to go back to her previous work as a bookkeeper, she told me when we spoke in March. But she has failed to secure a job; she worries that her barely noticeable speech problems make her job interviews less than optimal. Or perhaps, she frets, the problem is her credit rating, which (unknown to her at the time) dropped more than 200 points after the doctors who cared for her reported her unpaid bills to credit agencies. That black mark will remain until 2021, even though her legal case is resolved and she now has military health insurance through her husband. And, she notes with a sigh of resignation, \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who\u2019s always tried to do everything right.\u201dElisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief of Kaiser Health News and a former senior writer at The Times.Adapted from \u201cAn American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back,\u201d to be published this month by Penguin Press.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Man Collects $763,000 He Thought Was a Scam", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byImagine finding more than $700,000 under your couch cushions. That, essentially, is what happened to a man in South Carolina who received a phone call from the state treasurer, Curtis Loftis, informing him that he was entitled to more than $763,000 in unclaimed cash.This money had belonged to the man\u2019s father, who died more than 15 years ago. The man, who chose to remain anonymous, initially thought the caller was trying to engage him in a scam, Mr. Loftis said.Follow this thread: The man\u2019s mother remarried after his father died. Because of confusion about the son\u2019s surname, the money was never sent to him. Instead, it sat around in a lawyer\u2019s office, before eventually being sent to Mr. Loftis\u2019s office, which then set out to track down the recipient.\u201cNo one on the planet believes that they have money waiting for them,\u201d Mr. Loftis said in an interview in which he recounted the steps he took to track the man down.To find him, Mr. Loftis, who is also the president of the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators, found another relative that had passed away in South Carolina. The man\u2019s last name appeared on that relative\u2019s tombstone. Mr. Loftis then used Facebook to find the son of the man Mr. Loftis was looking for. The son told his father, who then skeptically called Mr. Loftis. It took multiple conversations to convince the man that this was real. Mr. Loftis even offered to drive to a Starbucks to meet him in public to prove it wasn\u2019t a scam.\u201cThe most typical example is when people move around, and they haven\u2019t let their bank know what their new address is,\u201d said Thomas DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller.Another common source is life insurance. In California, for example, Betty Yee, the state\u2019s controller, said there were hundreds of millions of dollars in life insurance benefits still waiting to be claimed because many families don\u2019t discuss the topic.\u201cIt\u2019s not an everyday conversation that you have,\u201d Ms. Yee said.We imagine you have some questions.\u201cYou have about a one in four chance of having unclaimed property,\u201d Mr. Loftis said.In fact, before his interview, Mr. Loftis looked up this New York Times reporter. It turns out that when he typed in \u201cSopan Deb\u201d of New York into a national database, 11 results came up. Yes, this reporter might have somewhere to look other than couch cushions.\u201cThere are organizations who do this for a fee,\u201d Mr. Loftis said. \u201cBut you can do it yourself. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201dThese organizations are typically referred to as finders, and they will inform people of their unclaimed funds and then try to take a cut of it in exchange for the convenience of retrieving the money on their behalf.\u201cWe always tell people if you get a call or a letter like that, ignore it because there\u2019s no charge,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said.No.Mr. Loftis said that the government takes in money from holders, which are entities that hold money not belonging to them. This could include banks, cable companies or a law firm. They might retain payroll checks or bank deposits that went awry.But once the money is sent to the government, it tries to find the owners to inform them that this money exists.And it\u2019s not like state governments keep all the money on hand. For example, New York\u2019s $14.5 billion isn\u2019t sitting in an account somewhere.\u201cTechnically, if everybody came out of the woodwork tomorrow and claimed this money, we\u2019d be responsible for the $14.5 billion,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said. \u201cThe reality is some of this money goes back decades and will never be claimed.\u201dMr. Loftis said that treasuries keep a \u201cresponsible\u201d amount of cash on hand to meet claims as they come in.No, although Mr. Loftis said he is chasing the owners of a closed textile mill in South Carolina who are owed $985,000.\u201cMost of the claims are a hundred bucks or something like that,\u201d Mr. Loftis said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, I bet you your church or synagogue would like it, so pick up that money and send it to them.\u201d\u201cOur motto on this is, it\u2019s your money and we\u2019re doing everything we can to make it easy to get it returned to you,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said.Advertisement"}
