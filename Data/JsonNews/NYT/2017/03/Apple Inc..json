{"Headline": "Lyft Is Said to Seek New Funding as Its Rival Uber Stumbles", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLyft, the second-largest ride hailing company in the United States, is trying to raise more money just as Uber, its bigger rival, grapples with questions about its culture and leadership.Lyft is talking with investors about new fund-raising that would put the company\u2019s value around $6 billion, according to three people briefed on the financing who asked to remain anonymous because the proceedings are confidential. One of the people said the valuation could be as high as $7 billion.The fund-raising may bolster Lyft competitively, given that Uber has been caught up in an escalating series of internal problems.Uber has also wrestled with concerns about its workplace culture over the past few weeks, after a former employee published an account of her year at the company, which included allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.This week, Mr. Kalanick apologized for his behavior toward an Uber driver after a video of him losing his temper with the driver surfaced.Yet Lyft\u2019s brand has recently looked comparatively attractive. As Uber struggled with its ties to President Trump\u2019s administration in January, Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lyft\u2019s app subsequently soared to the top of the Apple app store\u2019s download list.Neither Lyft nor Uber has emerged as a financially sound business. Their battle has led them to lower prices and offer deals to lure new customers and maintain their market share. It has been hard for either company to raise prices enough to cover costs. Both Lyft and Uber are still unprofitable and depend on private investment capital to fund their operations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Caterpillar Is Accused in Report to Federal Investigators of Tax Fraud", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, federal investigators have been scrutinizing Caterpillar\u2019s overseas tax affairs with no resolution to the examinations of the complex maneuvers involving billions of dollars and one of the company\u2019s Swiss subsidiaries.Now, a report commissioned by the government and reviewed by The New York Times accuses the heavy-equipment maker of carrying out tax and accounting fraud. It is extremely rare to accuse a big multinational company of tax fraud, which could result in high penalties.\u201cCaterpillar did not comply with either U.S. tax law or U.S. financial reporting rules,\u201d wrote Leslie A. Robinson, an accounting professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and the author of the report. \u201cI believe that the company\u2019s noncompliance with these rules was deliberate and primarily with the intention of maintaining a higher share price. These actions were fraudulent rather than negligent.\u201dNo charges have been filed, and it is not clear whether investigators agree with the findings or intend to act on them. The report, which has not been made public or made available to Caterpillar, outlines a company strategy for bringing home billions of dollars from offshore affiliates while avoiding federal income taxes on those earnings.Corrie Heck Scott, a Caterpillar spokeswoman, pointed out that the company had not been provided with a copy of the report and declined to comment further. The company, which makes heavy construction and mining equipment, has defended its tax strategies in previous years by calling the arrangements prudent and lawful among large United States companies.Caterpillar\u2019s strategies for reducing the taxes it must pay in the United States have saved the company billions of dollars. Last week, federal agents raided three Caterpillar buildings near its headquarters in Peoria, Ill., as part of the investigation. Caterpillar said it was cooperating with law enforcement.The company\u2019s tax practices have been a focus of government investigators since a 2014 Senate hearing found that the company cut its tax bill by $2.4 billion over 13 years, moving earnings out of the United States and into a Swiss subsidiary, despite internal company warnings that the strategy lacked a business purpose, other than tax avoidance.Less than a year later, Caterpillar disclosed it received a subpoena from federal investigators seeking documents and information relating to the movement of cash among domestic and overseas subsidiaries, as well as other matters involving its foreign units, including the Swiss entity.The company has since disclosed in securities filings that the Internal Revenue Service is seeking more than $2 billion in income taxes and penalties on profits earned by the Swiss unit. Caterpillar has said it is \u201cvigorously contesting\u201d the I.R.S.\u2019s proposed increases.Reached by telephone, Dr. Robinson declined to comment. Her report focused on one specific part of Caterpillar\u2019s offshore tax arrangement. It concluded that the company failed to pay taxes on billions of dollars brought home primarily from its Swiss unit and its affiliates, and thus failed to comply with United States tax law and financial reporting rules.It is not clear which federal agency hired Dr. Robinson. In her report she wrote that she was asked to provide a written opinion of Caterpillar\u2019s financial reporting related to various tax accounting standards, \u201cas pertaining to\u201d the investigation of Caterpillar by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General.\u201cI was provided with all documents available to the case agents assigned to the investigation,\u201d Dr. Robinson wrote. She also wrote that she spent approximately 200 hours reviewing the evidence and performing calculations.The investigation is being conducted by the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Central District of Illinois as well as the Inspector General of the F.D.I.C., which investigates criminal activities affecting financial institutions. Agents from that office, as well as from the I.R.S. and the Department of Commerce\u2019s office of export enforcement joined the raid on Caterpillar\u2019s offices last week.A spokeswoman and a spokesman for the agencies confirmed last week\u2019s law enforcement activity and the agencies involved, but declined to comment further.United States companies owe corporate income taxes at a rate of 35 percent on profits earned around the world. However, they are permitted to defer the taxes owed on the profits generated offshore until they bring those earnings back to the States, a process known as repatriation. Once they bring cash back, they generally owe federal income taxes, with a credit for any income taxes they have already paid overseas.In the report, Dr. Robinson estimated that Caterpillar has brought back $7.9 billion into the States, structured as loans, over and beyond the income that had already been taxed overseas. She concluded that the company failed to report those loans for tax or accounting purposes, and she wrote that those profits should be subject to federal taxes.In one example, she cited correspondence between the company and the Securities and Exchange Commission in which Caterpillar said it had $2.5 billion of income eligible to be brought to the United States tax-free. Dr. Robinson wrote that her research showed that the company did not have \u201canywhere near\u201d that sum still available to be brought in tax-free.Caterpillar failed to report those loans as taxable distributions of cash, thus avoiding the tax on earnings brought home from Switzerland, while \u201cenjoying the use of those earnings to meet U.S. cash needs,\u201d she wrote.Dr. Robinson\u2019s 85-page analysis is based on publicly available and internal financial data of the company, she wrote in the report, as well as bank data tracking wire transfers from Switzerland into the United States.The report does not explain whether Caterpillar used the type of creative, and often legal, transactions that United States multinationals use to avoid tax on earnings brought home from offshore.For instance, while companies typically owe tax on earnings brought home, there some exceptions. For instance, they do not owe tax on short-term loans made by their offshore subsidiaries to their domestic parent company. In her report, Dr. Robinson does not mention this legal exception, and it is unclear if Caterpillar used such transactions.In 2012, the same Senate committee that examined Caterpillar\u2019s taxes found that Hewlett-Packard stitched together a series of such loans to bring home billions of dollars tax-free.The 2014 Senate report on Caterpillar said the company worked with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, to set up its Swiss tax-cutting strategy. PwC was also the company\u2019s auditor, which raised \u201csignificant conflict of interest concerns,\u201d according to Senate investigators.The report by Dr. Robinson makes a passing reference to PwC but does not address what role, if any, it had in these transactions.Caroline Nolan, a spokeswoman for PwC, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on client matters or pending investigations.\u201dCompanies like Caterpillar, Google, Apple and Pfizer have accumulated at least $2.3 trillion offshore, much of it in subsidiaries located in tax havens like Bermuda, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. President Trump has said he supports a holiday of sorts that would permit companies to bring those profits back to the United States at a low rate.Advertisement"}

If you pick a good stand-in, I\u2019ll bring you back a cool souvenir.This seems like a good idea; lots of people don\u2019t want to pay hundreds of dollars for cable but probably can\u2019t get all their entertainment from Netflix and Amazon. But I do wonder if that\u2019s a TV company pipe dream. Maybe cord cutters will switch entirely and never miss TV. Personally, I pay for cable and almost never watch it. It\u2019s like burning money every month.In all, it has not been a great week for Uber. But I have been saying that a lot lately.This reminds me of the time Zenefits, the high-flying human resources start-up, was found to have installed software to let its workers cheat on a licensing course. You know what happened at Zenefits after that? The C.E.O. had to resign, there were hundreds of layoffs, regulators began long-term investigations and imposed millions in fines, the company\u2019s valuation plummeted, and its long-term prospects are still in question.Or, hey, I just thought of another comparison. It\u2019s like when Volkswagen created software to pretend its cars had low emissions in testing, but they didn\u2019t actually.In other words: This is bad.So I\u2019m kind of a Snap bear \u2014 and no, that\u2019s not some sort of terrifying euphemism. I believe their marquee product, Snapchat, has some significant challenges in regard to growth, and their thesis of being a camera company is far from borne out. (I will admit, however, that I am waiting for my pair of Snap Spectacles to arrive in the mail.)How does that add up to a successful company?But since you\u2019ve cast yourself as the Snap bear, let me pretend to be the Snap bull. I think it could be a mistake to compare it to Twitter for a simple reason: Snap is visual and Twitter is not. Snap, I think, is thus a more faithful replacement of the world\u2019s most popular pastime: watching TV. The big opportunity for all consumer internet companies is the money that will flow from TV ads to digital ads, and I think Snap has a pretty good shot at capturing a huge slice of that market.I also wouldn\u2019t compare it to GoPro. Yes, Snap says it\u2019s a camera company, but we\u2019re taking it too literally. It\u2019s a camera company whose main innovation is camera software, not hardware. In this way it is a bit like Apple: Apple\u2019s physical phone hardware is in many cases on par with that of competitors, but the reason that Apple makes essentially all the profit in the smartphone business is that its software keeps people glued to iPhones. Snap, too, is investing in software that hooks you in, and its hardware will be secondary to that. This is very different from GoPro, whose software is at best forgettable \u2014 leaving it open to competition from low-end manufacturers.Anyway, have you decided what car service you\u2019re using to get to the airport?Advertisement"}

Why is Musk Teflon while Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was pressured a few weeks ago by anti-Trump employees and customers to resign from the president\u2019s advisory council?Mr. Pai started by shelving new data security rules that were supposed to go into effect this month. He is also targeting broader broadband privacy rules approved last fall that would have forced AT&T and Comcast to ask for a consumer\u2019s permission to track browsing and app activity. If he doesn\u2019t scrap those rules first, Congress will. Mr. Pai\u2019s Republican allies, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, are in the process of rescinding the F.C.C. privacy rules through the Congressional Review Act, which is basically a tactic used by Congress to remove recently adopted agency rules.Anyway, thanks for being here.

{"Headline": "Dole Case Illustrates Problems in Shareholder System", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorThe share ownership system in the United States is fraying. And while its shortcomings have been largely behind the scenes, now they are going to cost some innocent shareholders money.Former Dole shareholders will receive $2.74 a share \u2014 a nice chunk of change in addition to the $13.50 a share originally paid in the deal. Still, because of the shareholder ownership system, some of those Dole shareholders may not get that money.The reason is that while shareholders think they own the shares they buy, they don\u2019t in a sense.That may come as a surprise to those who check their online brokerage accounts daily or see traders on a floor of an exchange reacting to price movements. A market that in many ways is open and transparent is underpinned by a system of share ownership that can be anything but.Share ownership in the United States is conducted through the Depository Trust Company, which was formed after the back-office scandal of the early 1970s. At that time, trading volume on Wall Street became too much to handle, and brokerage firms were swamped by paperwork, falling months behind.The idea was to freeze ownership of company shares in one place. Now, when Apple or Microsoft look at their share register they see only the Depository Trust Company. When trading occurred, brokers would now transfer shares among accounts at the trust company. The brokers hold the shares on behalf of customers who were the ultimate beneficial owners.The result was that the Wall Street firms could now more easily track shares by having to deal only with themselves and the Depository Trust Company. Companies were taken out of the process.Because shareholders are actually only beneficial owners, lots of odd things can happen.For example, instead of executing a trade in the market, a broker may just transfer shares among clients and mark the trade as a sale. (The broker is still required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to get the best price.)Alternatively, if a person wants to short a stock by borrowing it and selling it in the market \u2014 betting that the stock price will drop \u2014 the broker may \u201clend\u201d your shares without you knowing it.These issues have been brought to the forefront by the Dole case. In the settlement, 4,662 people and entities claimed 49,164,415 shares at $2.74 per share.There is just one problem: Dole had only 36,793,758 shares outstanding.These are probably not false claims. They go directly to the problems with the share ownership system.The first problem is that the Depository Trust Company sometimes doesn\u2019t keep track of shares. When this happens, it puts a \u201cchill\u201d on the shares, meaning that it stops tracking them because of established procedures for the final three trading days up to the closing of a merger.Instead, the money in a merger is simply paid to the brokers who are supposed to filter it down to the investors. Usually this works, but apparently in the Dole buyout, there may have been some problems with this process.The bigger problem, however, is the shorting issue. Normally, when someone shorts shares, they borrow them and then sell them. When the short position is closed, the investor buys back the shares and restores them to their lender.In a merger, the shorting party simply pays the merger consideration.There seemed to have been many shorts in Dole. Expectations that the company would obtain a higher sale price lifted Dole\u2019s shares above the terms of the buyout offer.Other investors were apparently skeptical that would happen, and more than 2.9 million shares were shorted on the last day that the trust company tracked the trading of Dole shares.For good measure, the judge, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery, noted that \u201cit bears noting for future merger cases that the problems raised by short sales and trades during the three days before closing appear endemic to the depository system and hence likely infect every claims process.\u2019\u2019In other words, this happens every time. It became a problem in the Dole settlement only because with so much money being paid out, more shareholders than usual took the trouble to submit a claim.But there is not enough money. When short sellers borrowed shares they sold them to other shareholders in the market. Under the ruling, those third parties who unknowingly bought shares that were shorted will now not be paid. Instead, the holders of the shares that were lent out will be paid. Those who bought shorted shares will be left to look to the shorters.The Dole settlement highlights that as our capital markets become ever more complex, share trading and ownership are getting harder track. But in an age when computing power is cheap, why can\u2019t we keep track of shares?But is that really necessary? The system might be fixed just by adding some computing power to better trace shares. Of course, this would require the people who control the plumbing of the markets to invest millions and millions of dollars in improvements.Alas, there is no profit to be made on an upgrade. This is an area where the nation\u2019s chief market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, needs to step in.But even this will not solve the shorting issue. When you sign up with your broker you are signing up to short shares, whether you like it or not. People are then buying shares without your knowledge.This is a problem that the brokerage firms have created, and hopefully they will fix. At a minimum, they need to stand behind the shareholders here. After all, they helped create this mess.The Deal Professor column on March 22, about a Delaware court case over shares of Dole Food, described incorrectly the capabilities of the Depository Trust Company, which provides clearing and settlement services to the stock market. The trust company does in fact have the ability to track the ownership of shares; it is not the case that the trust company does not track the shares because it is too hard or too expensive to do so. (In the case of cash buyouts like that of Dole, regulatory processes and practices dictate how payment is made on settled positions and unsettled trades.)Advertisement"}

Later, Mr. Bezos posted a photo on Twitter of himself in the suit with a more menacing air, the robot\u2019s arms raised as if about to deliver a bone-crushing bear hug.For years, retailers have been haunted by the thought of Amazon using its technological prowess to squeeze them into powder. That battle has mostly played out on Amazon\u2019s home turf, the world of online shopping.Now the fight is coming directly to retailers on actual streets around the globe, where Amazon is slowly building a fleet of physical stores. And while most of the attention has been focused on Amazon\u2019s grocery store dreams, the company has a more ambitious collection of experiments underway.If those experiments work \u2014 and there is no guarantee of that \u2014 they could have a profound influence on how other stores operate. Over time, they could also introduce new forms of automation, putting traditional retail jobs in jeopardy. At the same time, locating those stores close to customers\u2019 homes could also help Amazon further its ambitions of delivering internet orders within hours.The company is exploring the idea of creating stores to sell furniture and home appliances, like refrigerators \u2014 the kinds of products that shoppers are reluctant to buy over the internet sight unseen, said one of several people with knowledge of the discussions who, in conversations with The New York Times, spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential. The stores would serve as showcases where people could view the items in person, with orders being delivered to their homes.These would not be your average Home Depots: Amazon has considered using forms of augmented or virtual reality to allow people to see how couches, stoves and credenzas will look in their homes, the person briefed on the discussions said.Amazon is also kicking around an electronics-store concept similar to Apple\u2019s retail emporiums, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions. These shops would have a heavy emphasis on Amazon devices and services such as the company\u2019s Echo smart home speaker and Prime Video streaming service.Overseas, Amazon is quietly targeting India for new brick-and-mortar grocery stores. It is a vast market, and one still largely dominated by traditional street bazaars where shoppers must wander from stall to stall haggling over prices and deliberating over unrefrigerated meat sitting in the dusty open air. Amazon\u2019s internal code name for its India grocery ambitions: Project Everest.It is possible that some of the store ideas will never see the light of day. Groups within Amazon are often encouraged to come up with zany initiatives (this is the company that popularized the idea of drone deliveries). Many ideas are chucked after deeper scrutiny by executives. Amazon declined to talk about any stores it has not announced publicly.\u201cWe are always thinking about new ways to serve customers, but thinking is different than planning,\u201d said Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman.Since the late \u201990s, pundits have asked when Amazon \u2014 the company Mr. Bezos founded on the premise that people would rather shop from the comfort of their screens \u2014 would finally start building stores. But Amazon executives saw plenty of opportunities in online retail and new ways to reach people, from creating digital book-selling devices like Kindle to building up the Prime membership service for getting faster deliveries and other benefits.\u201cWe want to do something uniquely Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can find that idea, and we haven\u2019t found it yet, but if we can find that idea, we would love to open physical stores.\u201dDespite Amazon\u2019s internet retailing success, over time it has become clear that there is a lot of shopping that people prefer to do in person. The most glaring example is groceries \u2014 the mother of all shopping categories, with about $770 billion for the supermarkets represented by the Food Marketing Institute, a nonprofit group that includes the majority of such stores in the United States.After pouring resources into an online grocery service, AmazonFresh, for almost a decade, the company has made only modest progress. According to people familiar with the workings of the company\u2019s grocery business, it has struggled to operate it profitably, leading to a slow rollout of the service in new locations.One big desire many customers have is that they want to see fresh fruits, vegetables and meat in person before buying them. The relatively high cost of home delivery \u2014 Amazon charges $15 a month for its Fresh service, on top of a $99 annual Prime membership \u2014 is another barrier.Online grocery delivery accounts for only about 3 percent of the market in the United States, though it is closer to 10 percent in Britain, said Randy Burt, a partner in the food and beverage practice of A. T. Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm. Mr. Burt said Amazon\u2019s growing interest in stores mirrored the conclusion that other online merchants with physical stores \u2014 the apparel seller Bonobos and the eyewear seller Warby Parker \u2014 had come to.\u201cI think they are recognizing, for certain things you can\u2019t digitize and replicate online all the experience one has in a store,\u201d Mr. Burt said. \u201cThe ability to create experiences is going to be critical for them to continue to get share.\u201dJoe Thompson, a former general manager in Amazon\u2019s retail business, sees physical retail as key to Mr. Bezos\u2019s outsize ambitions for the company. \"I can\u2019t help but feel that, in Bezos\u2019s mind, he wants to be the first trillion-dollar valuation company,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, who is now an executive at BuildDirect, an online home improvement store. To do that, he said, Amazon would have to \u201ccrack\u201d a couple of \u201ccompletely underpenetrated markets online.\u201dAmazon\u2019s current market value is bobbing around $400 billion.A growing number of established grocery retailers are experimenting with this \u201cclick and collect\u201d approach to shopping, including Walmart, Kroger and others. According to one person briefed on Amazon\u2019s plans, the company has been developing technology for automatically detecting when a customer pulls into the parking lot so orders can be brought to them more quickly.The retail industry has been captivated by Amazon Go\u2019s technology since the company unveiled the store late last year. The store uses a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to automatically detect the food items shoppers remove from shelves, so they can leave the store without visiting a cashier \u2014 the way customers do when they bolt from an Uber.\u201cAmazon is wonderful at frictionless commerce,\u201d said Timothy Laseter, a professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business.There have been glitches with the technology that Amazon engineers continue to work on, according to a person familiar with the operations.

Stern School of Business.\u201cI\u2019ve probably been in 30 boardrooms of retailers in the past year,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cI would say the No. 1 topic of conversation is Amazon.\u201dThat was too much, apparently, for Mr. Bezos, who became uncharacteristically feisty on Twitter, attacking the article by saying The Post\u2019s sources had \u201cmixed up their meds.\u201dBut a group within Amazon has explored another larger grocery store format, according to both a person familiar with the concept and to internal Amazon documents reviewed by The New York Times. The store could stock fresh produce, meats and other items in a public area of the store, while keeping frozen foods, cereals and other items traditionally found in the center of a grocery store behind a wall, in what would be a kind of small Amazon warehouse. Workers behind the wall, not robots, could quickly package orders for customers.While Mr. Bezos was known for coining the motto \u201cGet Big Fast\u201d in the early days of Amazon, the company\u2019s plans in physical retail could be better described as \u201cGet Big Slow.\u201d Some reports have said Amazon has discussed building up to 2,000 grocery stores. But that figure was floated mainly as a hypothetical to consider the impact on Amazon\u2019s supply chain, not as a goal that was under serious consideration, a person familiar with the discussions said.In addition to the two soon to open in Seattle, as many as five more AmazonFresh Pickup locations could open by next year, and the company hopes to expand Amazon Go to Britain and several cities in the United States in the same time frame, this person said.According to a person familiar with Amazon\u2019s India grocery efforts, the company hopes to open its first Indian grocery store in Bangalore. In a statement, Amazon said the company was excited by the Indian government\u2019s efforts to encourage foreign investment in a \u201cstronger food supply chain.\u201d\u201cWe have sought an approval to invest and partner with the government in achieving this vision,\u201d Amazon said.For Mr. Galloway at N.Y.U., the slow pace of Amazon\u2019s rollout of stores is a sign that it has not figured out physical retail yet, and that has surprised him. Five years ago, he believed Amazon would have hundreds of stores by this time.\u201cWhat appears to be clear is they haven\u2019t yet zeroed in on a format they\u2019re willing to massively scale,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a company that the moment it figures out something that works, it puts nuclear energy behind it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Devices Lose Luster in American Classrooms", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life.Of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States in 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, up from 50 percent in 2015, according to the report. School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said.\u201cApple is struggling,\u201d said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource.Apple said education was a longstanding value for the company.\u201cMac and iPad are the best tools in education to help teachers teach and students learn,\u201d Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of product marketing, wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly passionate about education and new programs like Apple Teacher,\u201d a site for teachers who want to learn how to more creatively use Apple tools with their students, she said.The rise of Google\u2019s Chromebooks has disrupted the momentum of Apple, which has been marketing its computers to schools for some 40 years.The shift toward Google-powered devices is hurting Apple\u2019s revenue. Of the $7.35 billion that schools, colleges and universities spent on mobile and desktop computers in 2016, sales of Apple devices fell to $2.8 billion in 2016, from about $3.2 billion in 2015, according to IDC, a market research firm. Windows devices generated $2.5 billion in 2016, up from $2.1 billion in 2015, while Chrome devices reached $1.9 billion, up from $1.4 billion.The Chromebook has beaten out classroom competitors on pricing, usability and other factors. Chromebooks run apps through Google\u2019s cloud-based Chrome operating system, making them cheaper \u2014 and often faster to boot up \u2014 than traditional laptops that rely on hard drives.Because Chromebooks store documents in the cloud, they can be shared among students, who can grab any school device to access their class work. Google also provides school administrators with an online dashboard to remotely manage thousands of the laptops at once.Then there is the keyboard issue. While school administrators generally like the iPad\u2019s touch screens for younger elementary school students, some said older students often needed laptops with built-in physical keyboards for writing and taking state assessment tests.The public school system in Eudora, Kan., for instance, used to have rolling carts of iPads for elementary school classrooms and MacBook carts for older students to share. But last year, when administrators wanted to provide a laptop for each high school student, the district bought 500 Chromebooks at about $230 each.\u201cAt the end of the day, I can get three Chromebooks for each of the Mac devices I would have purchased,\u201d said Steve Splichal, the superintendent of Eudora Public Schools. He added that Eudora students continued to use MacBooks for certain creative courses and that first graders and younger students still used iPads.A picture caption on Friday with an article about Apple devices that are losing ground in American classrooms to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on the Chrome operating system from Google, misspelled part of the name of a place in Maryland where children were shown using Chromebooks. It is Glen Burnie, not Glenn Burnie.Advertisement"}

Most importantly, so do the victims and families.\u201dAfter several terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere, the region\u2019s lawmakers and regulators, as well as some of their counterparts in the United States, now want Silicon Valley companies to do more to tackle potential threats.For many policy makers, that includes opening up services like WhatsApp and Telegram, a rival messaging tool, to national intelligence agencies when they are investigating terrorist activities.\u201cWe do want them to recognize that they have a responsibility to engage with government, to engage with law enforcement agencies when there is a terrorist situation,\u201d Ms. Rudd told the BBC on Sunday, referring to tech companies. \u201cThey cannot get away with saying we are in a different situation. They are not.\u201dTech companies and digital rights advocates have said such efforts would infringe on human rights because providing the authorities with access to such messaging services would require weakening their overall levels of encryption. That, they argue, would leave people who use those services vulnerable to outsiders.Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in an email: \u201cWe are horrified by the attack carried out in London,\u201d adding that the company was \u201ccooperating with law enforcement.\u201dOfficials in Britain, however, are going a step further. And by demanding that intelligence agencies be allowed to read encrypted messages, Ms. Rudd is reiterating long-held plans to gain more control over digital services.Tech companies say they cannot hand over such information because internet messages are sent through so-called end-to-end encryption.This technology scrambles messages to make them indecipherable to anyone but their intended recipient. It also makes messages unreadable when they pass through an app\u2019s server, meaning companies do not have the ability to provide the information to law enforcement even if they wanted to.If such technology is weakened, campaigners say, governments and hackers could gain access to encrypted messages, reducing people\u2019s ability to communicate privately online.\u201cCompelling companies to put back doors into encrypted services would make millions of ordinary people less secure online,\u201d said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, a British nonprofit. \u201cWe all rely on encryption to protect our ability to communicate, shop and bank safely.\u201dSewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Michael D. Shear, a White House correspondent for The Times, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As a White House reporter, you must be bombarded with news about the Trump administration. What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat?Now, no matter where I am \u2014 at my desk, at a restaurant, or in a van waiting for POTUS to play a round of golf \u2014 I have access to cable news reports and live streams from the White House.What do you like about the setup, and what could be better about it?I like the fact that Sling TV works just about everywhere. There are apps for my iPhone 7 and my iPad Air, as well as my MacBook Pro and the Apple TVs and Rokus I have at home.The apps load quickly and even work behind the firewall at work.I do have a few gripes. For now, you can\u2019t pause most shows on Sling TV, and there\u2019s no recording of shows. (The company has a DVR beta in the works, but I haven't been able to get in.) And there are often hiccups. The audio and video are often, frustratingly, out of sync, especially for MSNBC and NBC. And there are times that the channels say \u201cunavailable\u201d for a few seconds, or a few minutes, with no explanation. Also, because of licensing issues, I can get NBC and Fox, but not ABC or CBS.As a political reporter, how do you keep messages, contacts and phone calls secure from surveillance?I\u2019ve always been pretty careful about electronic security. I have two-factor authentication turned on for all of my accounts \u2014 email, iCloud, etc. And I\u2019m as careful as I can be to avoid being trapped by a phishing scam. I rarely click on any link from an email, and I\u2019m pretty aggressive about sending emails that I don't recognize to spam.How do you keep on top of President Trump\u2019s Twitter?Having covered the White House since the beginning of 2009, I\u2019m definitely having to adjust to a new rhythm. I have about a dozen Twitter accounts set to alert me to every tweet, including the @POTUS and @RealDonaldTrump accounts, as well as the president\u2019s senior staff like @Presssec (Sean Spicer), @KellyannePolls and others. I had to adjust my Do Not Disturb settings on my iPhone so that notifications resume earlier \u2014 at 5:30 a.m. now. (There are overnight editors who can call me if he tweets between midnight and 5:30 a.m.)I also make extensive use of my Apple Watch to keep tabs on the president\u2019s Twitter habit throughout the day. I generally keep the speaker on mute, but the watch\u2019s haptic engine taps my wrist anytime he or his aides tweet.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?So far, I use it as a timer when I cook. I find it much easier to simply say \u201cHey, Google, set a timer for 30 minutes\u201d than to use the old-fashioned timer on my oven.We also have fun using Google Home for our grocery shopping list. Throughout the week, as we notice things we need at the store, any of us can say, \u201cHey Google, add orange juice to the shopping list.\u201d It\u2019s eerily accurate, even on stranger items. The list is automatically compiled in a Google Keep note that all of us have access to. (I will admit that my 14-year-old daughter is having fun putting weird items on the list to surprise me when I go to the grocery.)What could be better about it?The problem with Google Home \u2014 and the reason it often sits, neglected, on the counter \u2014 is that it just doesn\u2019t do that much. It can\u2019t send emails or text (yet). It can do some limited shopping, but isn\u2019t connected (for obvious competitive reasons) to our Amazon shopping account. It can\u2019t (yet) be used as a convenient speakerphone. The news sources that it accesses are limited (no New York Times headlines read aloud).And there is one, serious limitation that has to be fixed for Google Home to be really useful in a home with more than one person: It needs individual profiles. It has a nice feature that reads out the appointments for your day, but it links to only one calendar. That means only one of us can use the feature.The internet is flooded with fake news. What\u2019s your advice for readers for distinguishing good information from bad information?First, read The New York Times.But more broadly, I guess my advice would be to constantly crosscheck what you see and hear on the internet. If you read a fantastic-sounding allegation in a Facebook post or a tweet, or on a no-name internet site, try to see whether that allegation is also being reported by The Washington Post or Fox News. Go to the fact-checkers at various news organizations. Look around on Twitter to see whether the allegation has been debunked.If it sounds like something is \u201ctoo good to check,\u201d it probably means it\u2019s not real. But check it anyway!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "WikiLeaks Will Help Tech Companies Fix Security Flaws, Assange Says", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been derided as an anti-American anarchist, indiscriminate in publishing leaks and far too cozy with Russia. For more than four years, he has been hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid sexual assault investigators in Sweden.The 8,000 C.I.A. documents that WikiLeaks made public this week \u2014 the first installment in a far larger collection, Mr. Assange said \u2014 showed that the agency had found flaws in the most popular products of the internet age: iPhones, Android phones, software used in every office and even internet-connected televisions. But instead of alerting the companies so they could plug the security holes, the agency exploited the weaknesses to carry out cyberspying around the world.\u201cWe have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured,\u201d Mr. Assange said.The companies reacted cautiously to the WikiLeaks offer, saying there could be legal complications in accepting classified information stolen from the government. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, advised the companies to seek legal advice before accepting the leaked code.\u201cI do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about if a program or a piece of information is classified,\u201d he said at a press briefing. \u201cIt remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not.\u201dWikiLeaks\u2019 reputation was marred in some circles by its previous splash in the news, the release last year of emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign that were believed to have come from Russian government hackers. Now Mr. Assange, who once worked as a computer security specialist, insists that his goal was to safeguard the privacy of everyone\u2019s communications from the intrusive gaze of the C.I.A.\u201cWhy has the Central Intelligence Agency not acted with speed to come together with Apple, Microsoft and other manufacturers to defend us all from its own weapons systems?\u201d he asked.The C.I.A. issued an unusually lengthy response, emphasizing that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, with Americans off limits.\u201cAs we\u2019ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,\u201d the C.I.A. statement said. \u201cDespite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, C.I.A. continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.\u201dBy his offer, Assange was inserting WikiLeaks into a strained relationship between the government and Silicon Valley, where some executives believe their products\u2019 reputations are endangered by aggressive American espionage efforts.The Obama administration addressed this conflict by setting up a formal review process for technical vulnerabilities that the government discovered \u2014 or purchased from hackers.When an intelligence agency or the F.B.I. wanted to make use of a major chink in a company\u2019s technological armor, it first had to get approval through a committee organized by the White House. At a sort of court of vulnerabilities, intelligence agencies argued for using the flaw for surveillance, while other officials made the case for revealing it to Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other firm.\u201cThe default position was to disclose the vulnerability,\u201d said Michael Daniel, the cybersecurity coordinator at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, who ran the process. Last year, the administration said in congressional testimony that over 80 percent of vulnerabilities discovered by the government had been revealed to the industry.But there were moments, Mr. Daniel said on Thursday, when the committee he assembled judged that it was in the national interest to keep secret a \u201czero day\u201d flaw \u2014 so named because the target would have zero days of notice that there was a vulnerability. That would give the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. time to exploit it.Not all of the flaws revealed in the new WikiLeaks trove of C.I.A. documents would necessarily have gone through this process, and the committee would not have reviewed the \u201ctools,\u201d or software techniques, used to exploit a vulnerability. But Mr. Daniel said that \u201call the appropriate agencies, including the C.I.A., participated in this process.\u201d That suggests that using at least some of the vulnerabilities exposed by WikiLeaks would have required White House approval.Brian White, the chief operating officer of RedOwl Analytics, a cybersecurity firm, said the companies were caught between conflicting pressures, especially if some of their employees have security clearances to work on government contracts.\u201cIf you are holding a security clearance and you engage in the movement or sharing of this data, you could have your clearance revoked,\u201d he said.But he said that companies like Apple and Google also had a responsibility to their shareholders and customers to make their products as safe as possible. \u201cThe likelihood of prosecution is much less important than understanding any vulnerability in their products,\u201d he said.In addition to the legal quandary, dealing with Mr. Assange, a mercurial personality who is considered a criminal by some people and a hero by others, is fraught with political complications.While WikiLeaks has often been criticized for releasing sensitive data without regard for the consequences, Mr. Assange is acting responsibly this time, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. WikiLeaks redacted the actual computer code for C.I.A. exploits from its initial release to avoid spreading such cyberweapons.\u201cHe is trying to do the right thing,\u201d Ms. Granick said.She said that the legal risk to companies using the leaked information to fix their products is minimal, but that the government could make it easy by sharing more information about the vulnerabilities directly with the companies.Paul Kocher, a cryptographer who was previously an executive at the chip company Rambus, said that helping companies patch security holes was accepted practice in the industry.\u201cThere are lots of things at WikiLeaks that are ethically questionable,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cBut the normal thing to do if you come across vulnerabilities, regardless of who\u2019s using them, is to help them get fixed.\u201dScott Shane and David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "As Uber Woos More Drivers, Taxis Hit Back", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe center serving drivers of New York\u2019s yellow taxis is 3,000 square feet. The center serving the city\u2019s Uber drivers is 30,000 square feet.The taxi center invites cabdrivers to rest their feet in a cluttered office with utilitarian furnishings and fliers taped to the walls. They can use the bathroom, grab a cup of coffee and take advantage of free training classes and legal assistance. Opened in 2015, it is the first such center in the history of yellow cabs in New York City, industry leaders say.Just a mile away, the Uber center deploys a dozen concierges in black T-shirts to sign in drivers with iPads in a gleaming, airy sanctuary tastefully outfitted with flat-screen monitors, sleek couches and a wall-size print of abstract renderings of New York landmarks. There are bathrooms upstairs and downstairs, a self-serve coffee bar and plush carpeting so new it is spotless. There is also a raft of lucrative perks that are unmatched by the taxi center: signing bonuses, paying for two weeks of a driver\u2019s car lease and free medical checkups.The Uber center \u2014 officially called a Greenlight Hub \u2014 opened in December, part of the ride-hail app\u2019s all-out war to recruit drivers and win riders. It is the largest and fanciest of more than 200 across the country, including in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia and Miami.The upending of the traditional taxi business across the United States and around the world by Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services has given consumers new and sometimes cheaper options and forced cities to re-examine their transportation policies. Uber, in some places, has employed aggressive techniques to evade regulatory limits, and prompted demonstrations by taxi drivers and owners in places like Paris, London and Bras\u00edlia. And it has ignited an intense competition for drivers, nowhere more so than in New York.Despite the conflicts, Uber is a relentless competitor, and the taxi and Uber centers that have opened in different sections of the same neighborhood in Queens are a visible manifestation of how the rival industries continue to take on each other out of view of their customers. Both have introduced amenities for drivers once unheard-of in a no-frills industry, but Uber\u2019s showstopping center and incentives underscore how the deep-pocketed newcomer has become the behemoth in a crowded field.Shaon Chowdhury, 39, who manages a yellow taxi garage in Queens, said he was seeing more Uber drivers pick up shifts driving yellow cabs because Uber\u2019s \u201crates are low\u201d and they cannot make enough money.\u201cMy best friend drives for Uber and cries all the time,\u201d he said.That friend, Ben Chowdhury, 42, who is not related, said he made less money, and worked longer hours, than when he started driving for Uber two years ago. He typically earns $20 to $25 an hour, down from $30 to $35, because of the company\u2019s fare cuts.While the Uber centers are helpful for new drivers, Mr. Chowdhury said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make up for not paying us more. We are busy but we\u2019re just not making enough money.\u201dBut for some, the centers have made it easier to drive for Uber. Hager Krahn, 28, a mother of two young children earns up to $80 for four hours of driving at night to supplement her family\u2019s income.\u201cThey helped with everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey paid for everything. Who doesn\u2019t want something for free?\u201dYellow-cab drivers are also feeling more wanted as the taxi industry tries to stave off defections and lure new workers. Donald Friedman, 63, who has been driving since 1972, said he had made money ferrying around passengers including the likes of Bette Davis and Norman Mailer. But until now, he said, he never felt that anyone had his back.\u201cIn 45 years, there\u2019s never been anything like this,\u201d Mr. Friedman said, sitting with fellow cabbies at the taxi center. \u201cNobody advocated for the driver. If you dropped dead on the road, they would charge you to tow the car back to the garage. That\u2019s the kind of help drivers would get \u2014 nothing.\u201dBut leave it to Uber to open a sprawling center in the Falchi building, replacing a smaller center in the neighborhood. Uber says the new center has already drawn more than 10,000 drivers. It is one of four Uber centers in New York City alone, Uber\u2019s largest United States market; the others are in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.\u201cWe believe we owe it to the drivers that partner with us to provide support face to face,\u201d Josh Mohrer, a general manager for Uber, said.On a recent afternoon, over 100 drivers crowded into Uber\u2019s Queens center. Think Apple store, only nicer. A chime sounded and a concierge materialized to escort someone when it was his or her turn to meet with experts in blue T-shirts at long, communal tables in the back \u2014 the Uber version of the Genius bar.Assistance is offered in multiple languages, including Spanish, Chinese and Arabic. Medical checkups and training classes are available, as well as \u201cUber 101\u201d orientations for new drivers. (The center is open even to drivers who choose not to sign up with Uber.) Against one wall, Uber\u2019s corporate partners promote specials on cellphone plans, car leases and insurance.\u201cIt makes it simple and easy if you want to start driving for Uber,\u201d said Sumeet Singh, 22, a college student who was visiting the center for the first time a couple of weeks ago.The taxi center is also battling to retain and attract new drivers, albeit in a more modest setting.The Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents the owners of 5,500 yellow cabs, opened the driver resource center. Many taxi drivers have abandoned yellow cabs for ride-hailing apps in recent years, leaving cars idle in garages \u2014 a sharp turn from the days when those garages kept waiting lists because they had more potential drivers than cars.\u201cWe had to do something,\u201d said Jean Barrett, the taxi group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThis driver community is our business.\u201dMore than 4,000 drivers have used the center, Ms. Barrett said, and drivers are walked through each step of the licensing and renewal process, including filing their applications online. It offers free classes in defensive driving and how to assist passengers in wheelchairs. The classes, required by the licensing process, would typically cost $150 or more.Three lawyers and two legal assistants help drivers contest parking tickets, summonses from the taxi commission and other violations \u2014 more than 3,000 of them so far \u2014 and accompany them to hearings.Fritz Foreste, 66, was sent to the center by his garage after he received a parking ticket. With the center\u2019s help, the ticket was dismissed after he explained that he had left his yellow cab at a taxi relief stand for 15 minutes to take a bathroom break. \u201cThey take care of us here,\u201d he said.Ronald Gathers, 71, a taxi driver for four decades, went to the center for help last year after he was unable to renew his license because he was sick. After he recovered, the center contacted the taxi commission, and got his license renewed in one day.Even so, Mr. Gathers said he had heard so much about Uber that he could not resist checking out its new center recently. It was not for him, he said. He returned to his friends at the taxi center.\u201cI\u2019d be a traitor,\u201d he said. \u201cI came back to yellow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Her Dating App, Women Are in Control", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 As at most tech start-ups, the fridge was stocked with green juice and cold brew coffee. Unlike at most tech start-ups, there was not a single man present.\u201cI think everyone in this room has had terrible dating experiences or been in an emotionally unhealthy relationship,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said carefully.It is no secret her relationship with Mr. Mateen fell into that category, in part because dozens of their text messages were published on gossip blogs like Valleywag and TMZ. \u201cBut I\u2019ve thought long and hard about this,\u201d she added, \u201cand I think a lot of the dysfunction around dating has to do with men having the control. So how do we put more control in women\u2019s hands?\u201dAnd the tolerance for nastiness is low. After a female user sent screenshots to Bumble of a conversation with a guy named \u201cConnor,\u201d in which he ranted about \u201cgold-digging whores,\u201d the company barred him, detailing its thinking in an open letter that ended \u201c#LaterConnor.\u201d Another man was barred for fat-shaming. Users regularly receive notifications to \u201cbee nice,\u201d sometimes with saucy emojis.But its main innovation may be that it lets women be the hunters, not the hunted.\u201cI always felt that for me as a woman, I always had to wait around,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said. \u201cIn all other arenas, I was ambitious and a go-getter, but when it came to dating, I wasn\u2019t supposed to go after what I wanted. And so I essentially said, O.K., here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do: Women make the first move. And they\u2019re going to do so in 24 hours or the match disappears, so she feels encouraged to do it.\u201cMuch like Cinderella, if she waits, the carriage is going to turn into a pumpkin.\u201dBut have we really moved on from the old-school rules of attraction?Ms. Wolfe thinks technology turned the traditional mating dance into more of a rumble. \u201cI\u2019d read a lot about the psychology around rejection and insecurity, and I had noticed that when people feel insecure or rejected, they behave aggressively, erratically,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially when you can hide behind a screen name or a profile picture. So I thought, how can we reverse-engineer that?\u201dMs. Wolfe did not initially plan to change the dating game. She was 23, unemployed and living with her mother when she took a trip to Los Angeles to visit a fellow alumna of Southern Methodist University. The hot water went out, so they went to another friend\u2019s house to use the shower. That friend was Mr. Mateen. That night, they had dinner with his buddy Sean Rad, who was working at a tech incubator owned by IAC, which would eventually become the birthplace of Tinder. He needed someone to run marketing, and Ms. Wolfe was available.At Tinder, Ms. Wolfe said, she took the app to S.M.U., got sorority women to sign up, then immediately crossed the street to the fraternities and told them all the hot girls were on the app. When she started Bumble, she did much of the same, taking it to universities, signing up college women and assuming \u2014 as good marketers do \u2014 that where the women went, the men would follow. It was a crowded market, but Bumble now claims 800 million matches and 10 billion swipes per month. It ranks second in top grossing Apple downloads in the Lifestyle category, second only to Tinder.It was a condition of Ms. Wolfe\u2019s settlement with Tinder that she not discuss its terms. But she made it plain that leaving the company came at considerable cost, not all monetary. Almost overnight, she became what one reporter called the \u201cGone Girl\u201d of Silicon Valley. To some, she was a heroic survivor of toxic male start-up culture. Others felt that she had manipulated her way to power and that the text messages showed her to be as volatile as any angry ex.\u201cFor a good amount of time I didn\u2019t feel like me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think eventually my subconscious just said, \u2018Go to work. Just go to work.\u2019\u201dShe eventually began working on a social network for teenage girls called Merci, focused on compliments (the tagline: \u201ccompliments are contagious\u201d), and it became the basis for Bumble. The Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev, of the European dating behemoth Badoo, stepped up to invest.The company, which now has 35 employees globally (including two former Tinder colleagues), has added Bumble BFF, a matching service for platonic female friendships; is preparing to roll out Bumble Bizz, a networking app; and has acquired Chappy, an app for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.All of this expansion, however, has not been without hiccups.The company is also offering webinars for college users in which experts advise on subjects from \u201chow to do your taxes\u201d to \u201chow to recognize sexual assault,\u201d and getting ready to roll out a Siri-like character called Beatrice, which will call you during a date to make sure you\u2019re fine. Ms. Wolfe also said users would soon be able to chat with an on-call gynecologist (her own).\u201cLook, are we solving the world\u2019s problems by allowing women to make the first move on a dating app? No,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said. \u201cBut I do believe we are helping to change some very archaic norms.\u201dAs if on cue, the doorbell rang. It was a delivery man with a bouquet of flowers for Bumble\u2019s head of college marketing, from a guy she had met on the app.It had been going well \u2014 they had been on a half-dozen dates \u2014 until her friends found a video of him engaging in a lewd act online. She didn\u2019t want to ghost him. But for the moment, she wasn\u2019t responding to his texts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Releases Diversity Report and Repudiates Its \u2018Hard-Charging Attitude\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cEvery strength, in excess, is a weakness,\u201d Liane Hornsey, the recently appointed chief human resources officer, said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco. \u201cWhat has driven Uber to immense success \u2014 its aggression, the hard-charging attitude \u2014 has toppled over. And it needs to be shaved back.\u201dIn recent weeks, Uber has moved quickly to shed that past. The company hired Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and others to conduct an investigation of the workplace. Arianna Huffington, a board member, has repeatedly said that the company would no longer hire \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dMs. Hornsey, a former executive at Google, has also moved into the hot seat. She joined Uber late last year from SoftBank and has essentially been given a blank check \u2014 money, head count, resources \u2014 to revamp the workplace processes and managerial styles put into place when the company was still a fledgling start-up.Along with resources, Ms. Hornsey has embarked on a \u201clistening tour\u201d with employees who wish to share grievances. She is reworking the human resources structure and how Uber rates employee performance, long considered a problem area for insiders. And she spoke on behalf of the company about the diversity report, which covered full-time employees but not drivers, who work as freelancers.The report\u2019s numbers were stark. Only 36 percent of Uber\u2019s work force is made up of women, while the technology jobs at the company \u2014 some 85 percent \u2014 are overwhelmingly held by men. In terms of racial composition, 50 percent of Uber\u2019s employees in the United States are white and 31 percent are Asian, while 9 percent are black and 6 percent are Hispanic.\u201cWe have to build more trust with our employees, and transparency will build that trust,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said of the report.In the past, Mr. Kalanick has resisted publishing a diversity report, current and former employees have said. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Kalanick said, \u201cI know that we have been too slow in publishing our numbers \u2014 and that the best way to demonstrate our commitment to change is through transparency. And to make progress, it\u2019s important we measure what matters.\u201dCompared with statistics at other technology companies, Uber\u2019s diversity figures are not that different \u2014 and are modestly better than some.At Uber, issues of internal culture may have been compounded by its dizzying growth over the past few years. The service is available in hundreds of cities across more than 70 countries and completes hundreds of thousands of trip requests a day. In the last year alone, the company\u2019s employee base has doubled in size to more than 12,000.But that turbocharged expansion has come at a cost, employees have said. Growth, they said, was prioritized above anything else. That skewed the development of the organization into something that embraced the \u201ccult of the individual,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said.Top performers were rewarded and promoted into management positions. Some 63 percent of managers had never previously held a leadership position, and Uber did not provide much training for new managers, some said.\u201cFor the first several years, we had to just focus on executing our operational goals, and that was kind of the be-all, end-all,\u201d said Nicole Cuellar, an operations and logistics manager who has worked at Uber for nearly four years. \u201cThere was never the need to think about our culture like that. And I don\u2019t think it sunk in until we all had this really gut-wrenching experience.\u201dAmong the things that Uber now has on the table to change are its list of 14 corporate values, which include being \u201csuper pumped\u201d and \u201calways be hustlin\u2019.\u201d Mr. Kalanick is open to revising or adding new values, Ms. Hornsey said.She added that Uber was creating a task force to pinpoint major human resources failings, aided by Frances X. Frei, an adviser from Harvard Business School who has helped companies through organizational change. Uber also pledged to donate $3 million over the next three years to groups working on bringing women and underrepresented minorities into the tech industry.Some current and former employees have expressed concern over whether Uber will be able to change, given the deep-seated trait of aggressive individualism that Mr. Kalanick has fostered.But others like Tasneem Minadakis, who is active in Uber\u2019s LadyEng organization, an internal group at the company that supports and campaigns for women, said they have been galvanized by the efforts to fix the culture. In total, Ms. Minadakis said LadyEng has more than 500 employees eager to enact change.\u201cThey really do believe that this company can be a force for good,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said. \u201cIf it could only stop shooting itself in the foot.\u201dKatie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "C.I.A. Developed Tools to Spy on Mac Computers, WikiLeaks Disclosure Shows", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple said in a statement Thursday evening that its preliminary assessment of the leaked information indicated that the Mac vulnerabilities described in the disclosure were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013.However, the documents also indicated that the Central Intelligence Agency was developing a new version of one tool last year to work with current software.All of the surveillance tools that have been disclosed were designed to be installed on individual phones or computers. But the effects could be much wider. Cisco Systems, for example, warned customers this week that many of its popular routers, the backbone of computer networks, could be hacked using the C.I.A.\u2019s techniques.Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has offered to share the precise software code used by the C.I.A.\u2019s cyberweapons with the affected companies. But major tech companies have been reluctant to directly engage with him for fear of violating American laws governing the receipt of classified information.At a news conference Thursday, Mr. Assange criticized the government policies that restricted such communications but said that Apple had nonetheless been willing to work with representatives of his anti-secrecy organization.Google and Microsoft, he said, had simply pointed WikiLeaks to its existing channels for anyone to report a security flaw.In its statement, Apple denied negotiating with WikiLeaks. \u201cWe have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms,\u201d the company said. \u201cThus far, we have not received any information from them that isn\u2019t in the public domain. We are tireless defenders of our users\u2019 security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.\u201dThe spy software described in the latest documents was designed to be injected into a Mac\u2019s firmware, a type of software preloaded in the computer\u2019s chips. It would then act as a \u201clistening post,\u201d broadcasting the user\u2019s activities to the C.I.A. whenever the machine was connected to the internet.A similar tool called NightSkies was developed in 2009 to spy on iPhones, the documents said, with the agency figuring out how to install it undetected before a new phone was turned on for the first time. (Apple said that flaw affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed in all later models.)Although most of the tools targeted outdated versions of the Apple devices\u2019 software, the C.I.A.\u2019s general approach raises new security concerns for the industry, said Eric Ahlm, who studies cybersecurity at Gartner, a research firm. By rewriting the most basic software of a computer or a phone, tools that operate at the chip level can hide their existence and avoid being wiped out by routine software updates.Under an agreement struck during the Obama administration, intelligence agencies were supposed to share their knowledge of most security vulnerabilities with tech companies so they could be fixed. The C.I.A. documents suggest that some key vulnerabilities were kept secret for the government\u2019s use.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}
