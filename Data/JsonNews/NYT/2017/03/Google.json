{"Headline": "I\u2019m Not O.K. Neither Are You. Who Cares?", "Date": "2017-03-11", "News": "Supported byCirca NowMost self-help books make exhausting demands of their readers. The endless list-making and inventorying. The frequent deployment of the encomium \u201cYay, you!\u201d The tacit assertion that \u201cjourney\u201d has not been overexposed as a result of the \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d glut. It\u2019s easy to conclude, why can\u2019t someone just write a self-improvement book called \u201cCanceling Lunch\u201d and be done with it?Cynics, take heart. A new literary genre, which might be called anti-self-help or anti-improvement, is upon us.Granted, reading a book that coaches you on how to reject self-help is like downing a shot of Patr\u00f3n to get the nerve to stop drinking. But it appears to be working. Both \u201cA Counterintuitive Guide to Living a Good Life,\u201d by Mark Manson, and Sarah Knight\u2019s \u201cHow to Stop Spending Time You Don\u2019t Have With People You Don\u2019t Like Doing Things You Don\u2019t Want to Do\u201d were best sellers. (Those are the subtitles. The titles use a pointedly vulgar phrase synonymous with \u201cnot caring one bit.\u201d)Now comes one of the better-written entries in the genre, \u201cStand Firm: Resisting the Self-Improvement Craze,\u201d which made its author, Svend Brinkmann, a psychology professor in Denmark, a media star there.\u201cOur secular age is shot through with fundamental existential uncertainty and angst, and this makes it difficult to stand firm,\u201d writes the erudite Mr. Brinkmann, who, compared with his profane and jokey American colleagues, is the Max von Sydow character in this Woody Allen movie. Mr. Brinkmann\u2019s book, like Mr. Manson\u2019s, takes the stand that life is hard and you\u2019re not special, so instead of focusing on shallow quantities like happiness or success as defined by others in our culture of constant acceleration, you should acknowledge your limitations and learn to love your morning bowl of pebbles.Some of Mr. Brinkmann\u2019s prompts, such as contemplating your own mortality daily, are comically doomy. In \u201cSack Your Coach,\u201d a chapter about severing the ties with your therapist, he writes: \u201cConsider sacking your coach and making friends with him instead. Perhaps buy the coach a ticket to a museum, and ask what lessons life has to offer if you direct your gaze outward instead of inward.\u201dIn the chapter \u201cDwell on the Past,\u201d he writes: \u201cWhen someone presents plans for innovation and \u2018visions\u2019 for the future, tell them that everything was better in the old days. Explain to them that the idea of \u2018progress\u2019 is only a few hundred years old \u2014 and is, in fact, destructive.\u201dO, to have a camera to capture earnest Brinkmann adherents as they respond to their office manager\u2019s explanation of new petty-cash accounting procedures with, \u201cYou know, the idea of progress is only a few hundred years old.\u201d This reality-based Bravo series practically writes itself. Or what about a coffee-table book comprising photos of the moment when therapists are terminated by their patients and handed tickets to a Seurat show? It could be a glorious new direction for the \u201cHumans of New York\u201d author, Brandon Stanton.That said, Mr. Brinkmann distinguishes himself in the anti-improvement genre by taking an essayistic approach rather than a how-to one and by seamlessly weaving into his arguments the philosophies and writings of thinkers like the Stoics, the psychologist Barbara S. Held and the novelist Haruki Murakami. But more important, Mr. Brinkmann brings to the genre a refreshing dose of classical restraint, particularly as it relates to tone. To wit, his book, unlike Mr. Manson\u2019s, does not refer to its reader as \u201cdumbass.\u201dBut I prefer to look at the writing style of the self-help genre itself. Take a sample from the Manson book. He\u2019ll make an interesting point, such as: \u201cThe desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one\u2019s negative experience is itself a positive experience,\u201d but he indents it on the page as a pull-quote, and runs it in bold type. Then he adds, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a minute to unpretzel your brain and maybe read that again\u201d \u2014 and then he restates the premise, only this time in italics. In such an ecology, the only possible intensifier is a curse word. Or maybe 732 of them.I love well-deployed profanity. But while a dose of gritty humanity is a welcome contrast to the earnestness of Ms. Kondo or the mindfulness of the stress expert Jon Kabat-Zinn, a 732-unit-tall mountain of it suggests a lack of imagination. Or a cumulative juggernaut that is operating outside the purlieus of human agency.Come September, when Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishes Robert I. Sutton\u2019s \u201cThe [Expletive] Survival Guide,\u201d whose title uses coarse English to refer to \u201ca jerk,\u201d and which is a follow-up to his book \u201cThe No [Expletive] Rule,\u201d l expect further escalation in this particular arms race. I\u2019m imagining that the book will reach out and punch its reader in the kisser. Or maybe it will cut off its nose to spite its own face.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Unveils Subscription Television Service", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "Supported byBy popularizing video watching over the internet, YouTube, which Google bought in 2006, started the ball rolling on so-called cord-cutting, the practice of consumers\u2019 abandoning cable and satellite television subscriptions for web-based video services. YouTube\u2019s latest move, announced Tuesday, highlights how far it has come as well as the challenges in trying to replace cable and satellite TV.The company said it planned to introduce a new subscription service called YouTube TV in the next \u201cfew months,\u201d offering more than 40 channels including all four major networks, Disney Channel, FX and ESPN, for $35 a month. The subscription includes the ability to store an unlimited number of programs on a cloud-based digital video recorder for up to six accounts.\u201cYouTube TV represents an effort to evolve television,\u201d said Susan Wojcicki, YouTube\u2019s chief executive.But YouTube is now wading into the complex web of broadcast television, which has tripped up other technology companies seeking to break the grip of pay TV providers.It\u2019s an arduous and tedious process that demands securing deals with media conglomerates hoping to bundle its popular channels with less attractive offerings. It also requires ironing out agreements with the big four networks \u2014 NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox \u2014 and local affiliates that carry that network programming.It appears that YouTube is grappling with both of those issues. It did not announce a specific start date, and the company said it would roll out the service first in markets where it had secured rights from local affiliates. It also did not identify those markets. And YouTube TV is missing some popular channels, like Time Warner\u2019s HBO, CNN, TBS and TNT; Viacom\u2019s Comedy Central and MTV; and Scripps Networks Interactive\u2019s HGTV and Food Network.YouTube\u2019s incomplete lineup demonstrates how difficult it is to offer consumers what they want in a TV service while undercutting the prices offered by cable and satellite companies, said Jan Dawson, who runs the technology research firm Jackdaw.\u201cIt highlights how resistant to disruption the TV broadcast industry is,\u201d he said.One appeal of so-called over-the-top services is that they theoretically offer consumers choice in selecting the channels they watch at a more affordable price than the traditional bundles offered by pay TV services.However, the ability to cherry-pick channels is limited and the cost of an internet TV service adds up quickly. Most internet TV services offer a basic package of channels and then require consumers to pay extra for tiers of additional channels \u2014 similar in practice to pay TV offerings. In addition, there is the additional cost of paying for an internet connection \u2014 something that cable and satellite TV companies bundle with the cost of television.The huge audience flocking to YouTube, acquired by Google for $1.65 billion, makes the service one of the most valuable properties of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. While Alphabet does not disclose YouTube\u2019s revenue or earnings, the potential to turn that audience into dollars through advertising or subscriptions represents a major opportunity.The research firm eMarketer estimated that YouTube generated $5.6 billion in advertising revenue for Google last year and projected 20 percent growth in 2017.YouTube has also started offering an advertising-free subscription version, YouTube Red, that also includes access to the company\u2019s original programming \u2014 mainly programs and movies from the service\u2019s internet-famous stars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tracking the Yachts and Jets of the Mega-Rich", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byInside WealthThe hunt for connections between President Trump and a Russian billionaire has led to a little-known corner of the internet: websites that track the private yachts and jets of the rich.News reports in recent weeks have highlighted some unusual patterns in the movements of a private jet and a yacht owned by the Russian fertilizer magnate Dmitry Rybolovlev.The trips don\u2019t prove any connection or relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rybolovlev, of course. Mr. Rybolovlev \u2014 better known for his messy divorce and involvement in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit \u2014 may simply be a victim of the growing scrutiny of the Trump campaign\u2019s potential ties to Russia.Yet during the presidential campaign, Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s plane and boat were in the same locations as Mr. Trump or members of his family, according to tracking data.Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s yacht, named Anna, was also followed. The 220-foot ship was in Croatia last summer on the same days that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were vacationing there.Mr. Rybolovlev said through Brian Cattell, a spokesman, that \u201cMr. Rybolovlev travels frequently to many different destinations, including destinations across the U.S. If Mr. Rybolovlev was physically in the same place as Mr. Trump at any time, this was pure coincidence.\u201dWhat makes the stories surprising, however, is the amount of easily searchable data on the locations of Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s private jet and yacht. New technology, specialized websites and an army of amateur plane-spotters and yacht-watchers around the world have made it easier than ever for anyone to pinpoint a billionaire\u2019s yacht or jet anywhere in the world and track their movements.For the news media, wealth voyeurs and many of the rich themselves, the ability to track jets and yachts provides welcome transparency and safety benefits. But for the rich who look to their yachts and jets as cocoons of privacy, the mass of digital eyes following them represents an unwelcome intrusion and even a security threat.\u201cWhen owners step on their yacht, they want to feel totally safe,\u201d Mr. Beckett said. \u201cA lot of the wealthy prefer to stay under the radar.\u201dFor the most part, yacht- and plane-spotters are more like bird-watchers \u2014 hobbyists on the lookout for rare or unusual species in unlikely locales. They loiter on marine docks, boat channels and airport access roads in hopes of spotting and photographing a yacht like Larry Ellison\u2019s 288-foot Musashi or a jet like Paul Allen\u2019s $70 million custom Gulfstream G650.\u201cApparently there are a lot of people with nothing to do but hang out at airports and take pictures of planes and their tail numbers,\u201d said Jay Duckson, a private-jet broker and adviser with Central Business Jets.Yet the growing availability of location data has added a new level of detail to the hobby. Yachts and planes are both required by safety regulations to emit frequent location data. Increasingly, that data is aggregated by websites that let their users freely search for a particular plane or yacht by its name or registration number. The sites also upload up-to-the-minute photos of the vessels or planes that are sent in by amateurs. A quick search on Google can provide the name of a billionaire\u2019s yacht or pictures of a plane.Yacht owners are increasingly asking websites to remove information about their boats to protect their privacy. Some are turning off their transponders when they are onboard, according to industry experts, even though it is illegal.\u201cThey tell us it\u2019s a security risk,\u201d said Demitris Memos, the chief executive of MarineTraffic. \u201cBut we\u2019re not really giving more than what\u2019s available to someone with a pair of binoculars.\u201dIn March, Anna was moored in the British Virgin Islands, right next to a yacht owned by Robert Mercer, a major financial contributor to the president\u2019s campaign.Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s plane has gotten even more attention. His Airbus A319, which can seat more than 150 passengers when in use by the airlines, is a favorite of plane-spotters around the world for its size and swirling silver-and-black paint scheme. Its tail identification is also memorable \u2014 M-KATE \u2014 making it easy to search for on flight-locator sites.Using FlightAware, the flight data website, McClatchy, along with blogs and other sites, reported that Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s jet landed at Charlotte Douglas International Airport just five days before the November election. Less than 90 minutes later, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign jet landed on the same tarmac before a rally scheduled in nearby Concord, N.C. FlightAware confirms the flight data.Mr. Cattell said that when Mr. Rybolovlev was in North Carolina, he visited a company, Alevo, in which his family trust has a holding, and \u201cdid not have any contact with Mr. Trump or his advisers.\u201dUnlike yachts, owners of private jets can\u2019t turn off location data or flight paths. They can ask the Federal Aviation Administration to block their planes\u2019 data from public view for security reasons. Wealthy travelers can also charter jets or buy fractional ownerships in part to avoid public disclosure.\u201cMore and more private-jet owners don\u2019t want to publicly be on the internet,\u201d said Daniel Baker, the chief executive of FlightAware.Mr. Baker said he gets frequent calls from jet owners around the world asking to be removed from his site, which the site honors. FlightAware also sells a special service that lets jet owners and certain members of their families track their planes, while barring the broader public from seeing the plane\u2019s location or trip plans.\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is that more jet owners don\u2019t opt out,\u201d Mr. Duckson of Central Business Jets said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard to do. Maybe after the Rybolovlev news, they will.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Smartwatches at a Crossroads, and Some Analysts are Optimistic", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Some battery-powered watches at Fossil\u2019s flagship store here have traditional minute and second hands, but their displays sync with a user\u2019s smartphone and offer calendar notifications, activity-tracking functions and automatic time-zone updates.Smartwatches are at a crossroads: Even as some brands have exited the industry amid lackluster sales, others see new opportunities. Technology companies now are rolling out second-generation smartwatches with streamlined designs and enhanced battery life, for example, just as hybrid smartwatches (also called \u201csmart analog\u201d models) carve out a growing sales niche.\u201cI\u2019m not saying everybody\u2019s going to own or want a smartwatch,\u201d said Ramon T. Llamas, the research manager for wearables and mobile phones at IDC, a digital consultancy in Massachusetts. \u201cBut I think what\u2019s going to happen is the market\u2019s going to make it easier for people to own one.\u201dA central problem, he said, is that early smartwatch pioneers were technology firms that failed to grasp that their products, however technologically impressive, also had to be fashion items.But that has begun to change, Mr. Wood said, because \u201csmartwatches are starting to look like watches.\u201dMr. Llamas said that while many consumers still were unconvinced that a multifunctional smartwatch is a must-have, they may be intrigued by emerging technological developments in second-generation models, like cellular connectivity that frees the smartwatch from smartphone dependency.\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re over smartwatches,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, there\u2019s a big curiosity for what these things can do.\u201dSmart analog watches, for their part, are appealing to watch aficionados in a way that multifunctional smartwatches, which run apps on operating systems, never did, analysts say. A result is that the industry\u2019s consumer base is expanding beyond people who primarily bought the Apple Watch and other early smartwatches for their technological perks.A January study by the British consultancy Juniper Research predicted that although early interest in multifunctional smartwatches had waned, the \u201cbasic smartwatch\u201d category could rise to nearly 40 percent of the $21 billion smartwatch industry in five years, up from 30 percent today.The typical consumer price of a smart analog watch is $300 to $400, and the market is dominated by watch companies and fashion brands rather than technology companies, said James Moar, a senior analyst at Juniper Research.He said Fossil, Martian and Frederique Constant were especially strong in that market segment, and that he expected traditional watchmakers to continue taking the lead on smart analog.That the Baselworld watch fair, rather than any of the popular mobile-phone conferences, is increasingly the preferred debut location for smartwatches, he said, is itself a sign of how the industry\u2019s emphasis is shifting \u201cfrom the technology side of it to the watch side.\u201dHe said that this is a major concern because Swiss brands have operated on a business model that sells watches as long-term investments.Swiss watchmaking \u201cis about complexity and detailed manufacturing, and the love and care that goes into making intricate products, not some piece of consumer electronics that rolls down the line,\u201d Mr. Wood said. Smartwatches are still more of a commodity than an aspirational product, he said.\u201cBut Fossil is pushing the smartwatch mainstream,\u201d he said, \u201cand everything we have learned from the market is that they are way further ahead than they anticipated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Advertiser Exodus Highlights Perils of Online Ads", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byWhen Google acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion, it was considered a pricey gamble, one made with the belief that an online service known for pirated videos and vapid user-generated content could appeal to major advertisers.The bet paid off. YouTube is now one of the pillars of Google\u2019s advertising business and the most valuable video platform on the internet. In recent years, advertisers, unable to ignore its massive audience, flocked to YouTube to reach younger people who have started to shun traditional broadcast television.\u201cThis is beyond offensive,\u201d a Lyft spokesman, Scott Coriell, said. \u201cAs soon as we learned of it, we pulled our advertising on YouTube.\u201dThe pullback from advertisers strikes to the core of YouTube\u2019s appeal. Unlike television, with specific programming during which brands choose to run their advertising, YouTube mirrors the internet\u2019s sprawl, specializing in niche content that may not appeal to a mainstream audience but attracts engaged viewers. This provides YouTube with an enormous audience watching one billion hours of videos a day, perfect for new ad technology that minutely slices and dices an audience so that companies can target specific viewers.That technology, known as programmatic advertising, allows advertisers to lay out the general parameters of what kind of person they want to reach \u2014 say, a young man under 25 \u2014 and trust that their ad will find that person, no matter where he might be on the internet. This approach plays to the strengths of tech giants like Google and Facebook, allowing advertisers to use automation and data to cheaply and efficiently reach their own audiences, funneling money through a complicated system of agencies and third-party networks.But more than 400 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and while Google has noted that it prevents ads from running near inappropriate material \u201cin the vast majority of cases,\u201d it has proved unable to totally police that amount of content in real time. And that has advertisers increasingly concerned.Marketers have seen programmatic advertising as a groundbreaking development in media \u2014 a technologically efficient way to leverage the expanse of the internet so that, for example, Pampers can reach a new mom on a local blog or an instructional video about how to deal with a newborn\u2019s baby acne. This has opened up the whole of the internet to brands, which typically opt to remove their ads after they have appeared on unsavory sites, rather than restrict the ads to a list of preapproved locations.\u201cI distinctly remember doing presentations years and years ago, and there was some stat at the time that there were a million ad-supported websites and I thought that was mind-blowing,\u201d said Eric Franchi, co-founder of Undertone, an ad technology company. \u201cNow fast-forward to 2017, and Google\u2019s display network alone has two million sites. It\u2019s a lot harder to maintain brand safety today than what it was because of the sheer number of sites coming into these exchanges every day.\u201dThat sheer scale, coupled with its reliance on algorithms rather than humans to filter out the objectionable content after it appears, has been Google\u2019s main defense. More than two million websites are a part of its display advertising network \u2014 the equivalent of one for every resident of Delaware and Rhode Island combined.Google has pledged that YouTube will tighten safeguards against ads showing up alongside \u201chateful, offensive and derogatory content\u201d while reviewing guidelines for what type of content is allowable on the platform.\u201cWhile we recognize that no system will be 100 percent perfect, we believe these major steps will further safeguard our advertisers\u2019 brands, and we are committed to being vigilant and continuing to improve over time,\u201d Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said in a statement on Thursday.There\u2019s a lot at stake for YouTube and Alphabet. Search advertising is not growing as fast as it once did, and television ad budgets are still larger than total spending on digital advertising. YouTube and Facebook have made no secret of their desire for television advertising funds. Internet ad revenue in the United States, which is growing quickly, reached about $60 billion in 2015 while television accounted for about $66 billion, according to a study from IAB and PwC.James Dix, a senior media analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that YouTube accounted for revenue of about $13 billion, or roughly 20 percent of all advertising revenue on Google\u2019s internet properties in 2016. Alphabet does not disclose YouTube revenue.\u201cIf this company is going to look for new growth at scale, it has to pull money from television,\u201d Mr. Dix said. \u201cPeriod.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In addition, Brian McClendon, vice president of maps and business platform at Uber, also plans to leave at the end of the month.The two men are exiting Uber under very different circumstances. Mr. Jones, who was poached from Target to be Uber\u2019s No. 2 executive, resigned after the ride-sharing company\u2019s chief, Travis Kalanick, said he needed leadership help and began a search for a chief operating officer.Mr. McClendon is departing amicably from Uber and will be an adviser to the company. In a statement, he said he was moving back to Kansas, where he is from, to explore politics. His exit has been in the works for some time, and his last day at Uber is March 28.Mr. Jones did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to Recode, he said, \u201cThe beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber.\u201dMr. McClendon, in a statement, said he was returning to his hometown, Lawrence, Kan., after 30 years away. \u201cThis fall\u2019s election and the current fiscal crisis in Kansas is driving me to more fully participate in our democracy \u2014 and I want to do that in the place I call home,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in Uber\u2019s mission and the many talented people working there to make it a reality and that\u2019s why I have agreed to stay on as an adviser.\u201dMr. Jones\u2019s hiring last August was widely publicized by Uber. He was in charge of the company\u2019s branding, customer support and operations divisions.Mr. Jones\u2019s exit is problematic for Uber, as many current and former employees had seen him as a natural successor or counterpart to Mr. Kalanick. Investors and the company\u2019s board of directors were particularly keen on stabilizing the troubled company after months of internal turmoil.Uber hired Mr. McClendon, a highly respected engineer in Silicon Valley, from Google nearly two years ago to work on the company\u2019s mapping and autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Mr. McClendon was at Google for more than a decade, and was instrumental in forming Google Earth and leading the company\u2019s geolocation technology research.His departure from Uber is concerning considering how strategically important mapping and geolocation services are to the ride-hailing company.

Developed Tools to Spy on Mac Computers, WikiLeaks Disclosure Shows", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byApple said in a statement Thursday evening that its preliminary assessment of the leaked information indicated that the Mac vulnerabilities described in the disclosure were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013.However, the documents also indicated that the Central Intelligence Agency was developing a new version of one tool last year to work with current software.All of the surveillance tools that have been disclosed were designed to be installed on individual phones or computers. But the effects could be much wider. Cisco Systems, for example, warned customers this week that many of its popular routers, the backbone of computer networks, could be hacked using the C.I.A.\u2019s techniques.Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has offered to share the precise software code used by the C.I.A.\u2019s cyberweapons with the affected companies. But major tech companies have been reluctant to directly engage with him for fear of violating American laws governing the receipt of classified information.At a news conference Thursday, Mr. Assange criticized the government policies that restricted such communications but said that Apple had nonetheless been willing to work with representatives of his anti-secrecy organization.Google and Microsoft, he said, had simply pointed WikiLeaks to its existing channels for anyone to report a security flaw.In its statement, Apple denied negotiating with WikiLeaks. \u201cWe have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms,\u201d the company said. \u201cThus far, we have not received any information from them that isn\u2019t in the public domain. We are tireless defenders of our users\u2019 security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.\u201dThe spy software described in the latest documents was designed to be injected into a Mac\u2019s firmware, a type of software preloaded in the computer\u2019s chips. It would then act as a \u201clistening post,\u201d broadcasting the user\u2019s activities to the C.I.A. whenever the machine was connected to the internet.A similar tool called NightSkies was developed in 2009 to spy on iPhones, the documents said, with the agency figuring out how to install it undetected before a new phone was turned on for the first time. (Apple said that flaw affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed in all later models.)Although most of the tools targeted outdated versions of the Apple devices\u2019 software, the C.I.A.\u2019s general approach raises new security concerns for the industry, said Eric Ahlm, who studies cybersecurity at Gartner, a research firm. By rewriting the most basic software of a computer or a phone, tools that operate at the chip level can hide their existence and avoid being wiped out by routine software updates.Under an agreement struck during the Obama administration, intelligence agencies were supposed to share their knowledge of most security vulnerabilities with tech companies so they could be fixed. The C.I.A. documents suggest that some key vulnerabilities were kept secret for the government\u2019s use.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brands Try to Blacklist Breitbart, but Ads Slip Through Anyway", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported bySince the presidential election, hundreds of companies have decided to block their advertisements from running on Breitbart News, the alt-right website closely tied to President Trump\u2019s administration. But several of those brands, from the Nordstrom department store chain to small start-ups, have appeared on the site anyway, another example of how little control companies often have over where their ads are seen online.Nordstrom, which said it moved to prevent its ads from running on Breitbart several months ago, was on the site as recently as two weeks ago, puzzling employees and others online, who were quick to take screenshots and question the company on Twitter. Other advertisers, including BMW of North America and Scribie, a transcription service, also appeared on Breitbart after blocking their ads from the site, a practice known as blacklisting.\u201cIf a brand doesn\u2019t want to be associated with a particular publisher for whatever reason, it\u2019s kind of crazy that they request for it to be blacklisted and still spend money on it,\u201d said Andrew Casale, the chief executive of Index Exchange, an online advertising exchange. \u201cThis is all evidence of gaps in our supply chain, which are becoming visible to the mainstream.\u201dBreitbart and fake news have become the focal points for advertiser awareness around \u201cbrand safety\u201d domestically, said Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research. A spokesman for Breitbart did not respond to requests to comment.Fewer advertisers seem to be appearing on Breitbart, which may be a result of some ad networks and brand safety companies blocking it in recent months, citing hate speech violations or deeming the content too inflammatory.Breitbart had about 1,300 advertisers on its website last month, showing about 2,600 display ads, according to data from Moat Pro, a digital ad intelligence product. That was down from 3,300 advertisers and 11,500 display ads in November. It is not clear if the boycott has had a financial impact, although the top thousand domestic advertisers accounted for 73 percent of display advertising spending last year, Kantar Media said.Brands are finding that the mechanics of online ads, typically placed through a complex system of agencies and third-party networks that resemble a stock exchange, can be difficult to explain to consumers.\u201cAt this time, Nordstrom doesn\u2019t block those types of advertising opportunities because many prominent, well-respected and legitimate websites choose to use these tactics,\u201d Emily Sterken, a spokeswoman, said by email. \u201cOur teams are looking into how we might address this situation.\u201dBen Winkler, the chief investment officer at the agency OMD, said other brands that showed up on Breitbart in spite of blacklists probably had several parties handling their digital ad spending, including local marketing affiliates, publishers and public relations agencies. For a major company, \u201cthere are probably, at any given time, 100 different campaigns being run by a dozen different departments across a thousand websites and a dozen agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think that every single one of those players is religiously and slavishly using the approved site list or is blacklisting Breitbart is unlikely.\u201dBMW of North America has encountered that issue because its marketing plan does not extend to dealerships. While the company does not buy ads on Breitbart, Phil DiIanni, a spokesman, noted that \u201cdealerships are independent businesses and decide for themselves on their local advertising.\u201dJustin Oliver, who oversees digital marketing for Scribie, a start-up in San Francisco, blocked Breitbart from the sites it may advertise on through Google after Sleeping Giants contacted the company in late February. He assumed the issue was resolved but then learned through several messages on Twitter that Scribie was still appearing on Breitbart by way of Facebook\u2019s audience network, which places ads on sites outside Facebook.\u201cThe next thing I know, I\u2019m getting more of these screenshots, and more people saying, \u2018You\u2019re on a white-pride site,\u2019 and it\u2019s the worst thing you can see when you\u2019re a marketing manager,\u201d Mr. Oliver said. He added that he had not chosen to turn on the extended option for the Facebook ads, which allowed for the ads to be placed on Breitbart, and that he shut it off after fielding complaints.The New York Times has also inadvertently run ads on Breitbart. The Times started limiting its ads in the United States to a list of preapproved websites on Jan. 1, said Jason Sylva, vice president for media at the company. But since then, the company has been spotted on Breitbart by people accessing the site from countries like Finland and Canada. The Times is in the process of developing an international preapproved list, Mr. Sylva said.Perversely, because so much online advertising follows people wherever they go on the web, the attention on Breitbart and, separately, more extreme sites has increased their traffic, making the problem even bigger, said Joe Barone, managing partner of digital ad operations for GroupM, the media buying arm of the ad giant WPP.\u201cAs we become more aware of these extreme news environments, they\u2019re actually gaining more traction in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cThey generate more inventory going on exchanges, and the likelihood of showing up on these sites even if blacklisted goes up.\u201dFollow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter @Sapna.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Superstar Firms\u2019 May Have Shrunk Workers\u2019 Share of Income", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byBut in recent decades, that steady share \u2014 which includes everything from the chief executive\u2019s bonuses and stock options to the parking-lot attendant\u2019s minimum wage and tips \u2014 started to flutter. In the 2000s, it slipped significantly. Although the numbers have inched up in the last couple of years, labor\u2019s portion has not risen above 59 percent since before the recession.Some economists argue that technological advancements are to blame as employers have replaced workers with machines. Others point to trade powered by cheap foreign labor, a view championed by President Trump that particularly resonated among voters.Over the last 15 years, for example, labor productivity has grown faster than wages, a sign that workers are not being adequately compensated for their contributions. And some industries have fared worse than others. Slices of the pie going to mining and manufacturing narrowed the most, while service workers (including professional and business services) had the biggest gains.From manufacturing to retailing, giant companies have managed to gobble up a larger and larger share of the market.Think about the retail sector, where mom-and-pop stores once crowded the landscape. Now it is dominated by a handful of giants like Walmart, Target and Costco.\u201cThey\u2019re very sophisticated and efficient and they don\u2019t use as much labor,\u201d said Mr. Autor, who worked on the research with a team of economists that included David Dorn, Lawrence F. Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen.With efficiencies come advantages.Software platforms and online services, for example, may be expensive to install, but not so costly to expand. Technology can make it easier to exploit smaller competitive advantages. And there is no need for duplicate payroll, shipping or human resources departments.The idea of superstars vacuuming up a majority of goodies is perhaps more obvious on the individual level. Because of technology like cable and satellite television and the internet, music luminaries like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift or sports phenoms like LeBron James or Cristiano Ronaldo can reach a much larger audience and gain a greater proportion of the revenue generated.What was once true of pop stars can now be seen in more mundane industries. \u201cOver the past several decades, only the highest earners have seen steady wage gains,\u201d a report from the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers concluded late last year. \u201cFor most workers, wage growth has been sluggish and has failed to keep pace with gains in productivity.\u201dLarger companies tend to pay better than smaller ones, Mr. Autor and the other researchers say, and in the technology sector especially, salaries can be impressive. Workers there are sharing in the larger pie \u2014 there are just fewer of them to do so.The researchers examined six industries that account for 80 percent of private employment in the United States. In each one, they discovered \u201ca remarkably consistent upward trend in concentration.\u201d In manufacturing, for instance, the top four companies controlled 43 percent of sales in 2012, up from 38 percent in 1982. In finance, the figure grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, and in retail trade it went to 30 percent, from 15 percent.The faster concentration grew, the bigger the drop in labor\u2019s share.\u201cWhat\u2019s different about new superstar firms is they don\u2019t have the cadre of middle-class jobs for nonelite workers,\u201d said Mr. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard.\u201cThat\u2019s very worrisome,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe trend is going on in country after country.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the effect large companies may have had on a decline in workers\u2019 share of income misspelled the surname of an author of the study on such \u201csuperfirms.\u201d He is John Van Reenen, not Van Reenan.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C., in Potential Sign of the Future, Halts New Data Security Rules", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byAfter a 2-to-1, party-line vote by the Republican-led commission, Ajit Pai, the chairman, announced that a portion of privacy rules passed in October would be temporarily stayed.The rules, which were to take effect on Thursday, required high-speed internet providers like AT&T and Comcast to secure their customers\u2019 data against hacking and other unauthorized uses.Mr. Pai, in a sign that additional swipes at privacy rules may be in store, also said the commission should not be engaged in any policing of broadband providers over online privacy. He said the Federal Trade Commission should instead oversee the broadband and web industries.\u201cAll actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, enforced by the same agency,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a joint statement with Maureen K. Ohlhausen, the trade commission\u2019s acting chairwoman.During Mr. Wheeler\u2019s tenure, the F.C.C. created numerous regulations meant to protect users of broadband internet, including the privacy rules passed in October that required strong data-security measures and allowed internet service providers to collect data on web browsing and app usage only with the permission of customers.The commission has moved swiftly to dismantle those regulations since Mr. Pai\u2019s appointment as chairman in January.The agency has closed an investigation into claims that internet service providers may have been violating net neutrality provisions ensuring equal access to all websites, and has pledged to revoke the regulatory classification of broadband service under which it is treated like a telephone-style utility.Under Mr. Pai\u2019s leadership, the commission has also halted nine broadband providers from giving subsidized service to low-income users, putting in limbo reforms to a subsidy program known as Lifeline.The vote to stay the new data security rules came in response to petitions filed by broadband providers and advertising trade groups that said the rules would give web companies like Google and Facebook an unfair advantage in the online advertising market. Mr. Pai said the F.C.C. might create a weaker version of the privacy rules.Mignon Clyburn, the F.C.C.\u2019s lone Democratic commissioner, voted against Mr. Pai\u2019s order on Wednesday. She has objected to many of his actions, including a decision to abandon the commission\u2019s legal fight to lower how much prisoners pay to make phone calls, which Ms. Clyburn has called a civil rights issue.The F.C.C. is halting the security rules even as data breaches have become routine, Ms. Clyburn said in a statement, adding that the decision opened the door to further reductions in consumer protections.The F.C.C. decision, Ms. Clyburn said in the statement, \u201cfells a tree to ostensibly prune a branch.\u201dConsumer advocates had hailed the privacy rules as a watershed development. There are currently no privacy laws for web firms, and the United States trails many nations in Europe in protecting consumer\u2019s online data.\u201cInternet service providers have a unique, all-access view into consumers\u2019 daily online lives,\u201d said Laura MacCleery, a vice president at Consumers Union. \u201cWe urge the F.C.C. to focus on acting in the public\u2019s interest \u2014 rather than the industry\u2019s \u2014 and to maintain these critical rules.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Snap\u2019s I.P.O., Evidence of Bankers\u2019 Strategy", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorSnap\u2019s bankers deserve more than the commissions they will receive for a successful, perhaps flawless, initial public offering.Not bad for a pair of twentysomethings. (Yes, be jealous \u2014 what did you do in the first half of your 20s besides drink beer?)The key to a successful I.P.O., after all, is to get that first-day pop, as Facebook learned to its chagrin in 2012. And Snap\u2019s shares will most likely rise on Thursday even after exceeding the previous range.The bankers played another tried-and-true trick: limit the supply. Only about 19 percent of Snap\u2019s total share float was offered, and a quarter of that amount was sold subject to a one-year lockup. Snap\u2019s remaining capital needs were filled by a $1.2 billion loan from the same bankers underwriting the offering.Finally, Snap played off the simple laws of supply and demand and the strange world of internet valuations. There are only a few big internet companies around, and when one goes public, investors pounce.Here, internet valuation does not depend upon silly things like revenue or, heaven forbid, earnings, but prospects. One way (and there are many ways) to think about this, is the chance that Snap has to hit a certain valuation reflected as follows:Basically, Column 1 is the chance of meeting the valuation in Row 2. You can then value this chance by multiplying column 1 by row 2. So if Snap has a 1 percent chance of reaching a valuation of $100 billion, the value of that chance is $1 billion.That is the price a rational investor with a taste for risk would pay for that chance. Someone without a taste for risk would prefer paying for a 99 percent chance of getting $1 billion which would be valued at $1.01 billion.In this chart, the valuation of Snap is $22.8 billion if you add up the value of all the chances. But the chance of Snap being worth below its pricing valuation of $24 billion is 64 percent.Yet if you are basing this on the prospect of Snap, the valuation set on Wednesday for Snap is a rational bet for a risk taker. You can play with the numbers, but you get the idea that the bigger company you think this might be, the more it adds to the current, risky valuation.And Snap is all about prospects and risk. It will depend on doing something no other social network has done \u2014 which is to invent another product equally successful.So far, Snap has done only ephemeral pictures well. There is yet to be a verdict on its Spectacles, though they will probably go the way of Google Glass, a brief novelty.The bet in Snap as it exists today is in preserving and growing the core business, which already may be plateauing, and finding a new business. Can that happen? The chance of it achieving that is how the valuation works.In this regard, Snap is not Facebook or Twitter, the two most used comparisons. Facebook\u2019s core business was growing at the time of its I.P.O. and has continued to grow since, while Twitter was valued by investors based on what they thought about growth in its main business.For Snap, investors have ignored some big warning signs. In addition to the possibility of declining user growth, there is also the inability of Snap to gain traction outside the United States or outside its core young demographic. And that Instagram and WhatsApp (under the Facebook umbrella) are emerging as real competitors.Then there is the governance issue. The company has chosen to keep all control with its co-founders and gives no vote to the shares held by the public. So in some ways, Snap is more like Shake Shack or Fairway with a touch of Theranos, than it is like Facebook or Twitter.I could, of course, be all wrong about this. There is a chance that Snap will be the next Facebook, churning out products the teenage set loves for the next nine decades of Mr. Spiegel\u2019s life. In a year or two, we should have a good sense of Snap\u2019s direction, and when we do it will be a test not just of the internet I.P.O. model but corporate governance as well.In the meantime, Snap will likely spur more internet market debuts \u2014 after all, there is a drought of them \u2014 as bankers sell this good result to push clients out.And that is really what the Snap offering is about: good deal-making and salesmanship by its bankers at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.Congratulations, of a sorts, are due.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": " How does flying a drone add to your visual storytelling ability? One of the first things that attracted me to drone photography and videography was the ability to easily photograph scenes that in the past would have cost us thousands of dollars. It democratized the skies. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say that every assignment demands aerial photography, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice to be able to have it as a tool.  Not only is it less expensive, it also gives a different view.  Movement becomes really key with drone video, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult to do with a helicopter at some altitudes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a unique experience to be able to navigate like a bird. I try not to use automated flight patterns because I feel that the rigidity of the curves that automation gives you isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very pleasing to the viewer. More organic movement that shows there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a human behind this helps to bring people into these somewhat complex stories we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to tell. New research could yield groundbreaking information on the rate at which the Greenland ice sheet, the fastest-melting chunk of ice on the planet, is seeping into the ocean. As a child did you want to fly planes?  When I was in fifth grade, we did a project on how to spend a million dollars. I figured out how much it would cost to buy a plane so that I could fly to Scottsdale, Ariz., to see  spring training games with the San Francisco Giants. I found out how to get my pilot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license so that I could commute from San Francisco to spring training games in Arizona.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny. The New York Times never said to you, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you figure out how to spend a million dollars?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  No, but in 2012, when inexpensive drones first came out, I expensed a little $60 hobby quadcopter to figure out how to use it. I spent a few months in my tiny apartment trying not to hit the walls and ceiling while I flew it around, trying to get a sense of how to control movement. If you can control one of these tiny hobby quadcopters that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have GPS and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have obstacle avoidance, you can pick up the finesse that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed to manually control the bigger, more steady ones.  What have you learned about composition, both in stills and in video, using a drone? One of my initial projects with a drone was in the Marshall Islands. Before I went, I loaded up Google Earth to look at the islets that I could possibly travel to. I actually picked Ejit Islet to go to based on the Google satellite imagery. It allowed me to pre-envision where I was going to fly, so that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste time on a location that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. Since then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become a lot more confident in knowing what the situation can yield when I see it for the first time in person. Most of the time I am looking at the screen and making my compositional choices, which takes some of my attention away from actually being able to fly the craft. Most of the Marshall Islands rise less than six feet above sea level. For the Marshallese, the destructive power of the rising seas is already an inescapable part of daily life.I try to have a reporter, fixer or translator act as my visual observer so that I can spend some more time on the actual composition and not have to worry if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m coming too close to a power line.  I assumed that you were watching the drone the whole time.  At all times I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking back and forth between the drone and my screen. A lot of the times I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m flying to a place and then stopping the craft and looking down at my screen to judge the composition and make microscopic changes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very easy with still photographs to focus on both at once, but once you transition to motion, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to have a second person with you.  How do you decide whether stills or videos are the best approach, or do you do both? I try to start recording video as soon as I take off so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a mistake and fly a perfect pattern only to realize that I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit the record button. With about half of our stories in this series, we actually ran screen grabs from the 4K drone video. You can barely discern a difference on the web and in print as long as you keep your motion slow. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m shooting 30 frames a second at 4K. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting stills out of my video captures that are plenty large enough to use for anything we want. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another reason why I can prioritize video footage instead of stills.  Can we talk a little bit more about the Carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Casualties series, which recently took first place for Documentary Project of the Year in the Pictures of the Year International awards. How did you envision it from the start? At the end of 2015, I got the opportunity to travel to Greenland to accompany the U.S. ambassador to Denmark, taking a tour of some of the climate research happening. I decided that was a good place to bring the drone that I had been practicing with. While there, the reporter, Coral Davenport, and I found another story \u2014 a research group trying to measure the size of \u00e2\u0080\u0098meltwater\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rivers on top of the second-largest reserve of frozen freshwater in the world. They were flying helicopters out over the ice sheet, setting up camp and staying for several nights in freezing cold temperatures. I joined them. While I was there, we discovered that the researchers themselves were doing drone mapping. They were flying a very high-elevation drone to get middle-range drone imagery that was between the satellites and what I was getting with my drone. Later, we were able to seamlessly transition scenes from ground-level drone footage to middle-range drone footage mapping the watershed that they were in, all the way up to NASA satellite imagery.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be done before.  After Greenland I went to the Marshall Islands. By the time I got there and started talking to people on the islet I had identified from Google Earth, it became clear that residents were starting to prepare to have to move off this islet. When we got back to New York, there was a meeting of foreign editors and reporters tasked with trying to look for other places around the world where people were having to deal \u2014 right now \u2014 with the effects of climate change.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finished that particular series, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now brainstorming how we want to approach our visual coverage to climate change in the future. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very conscious of the fact that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done an entire series that follows the same visual rhetoric.We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily just want to continue repeating these visual cues. We want to keep pushing the envelope, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in the process of identifying new technologies we might be able to use for the next set of stories about climate change and its impact on people. How do you compose for stills with a drone? For still photos I try to use the drone to create very formal, or very graphic composition. I think that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to not shoot at a 45-degree angle with the horizon line in every photo. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been focused on shooting straight down as much as I can, or at semi-oblique angles so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite show your horizon line. When I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m filming from a helicopter, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very stressful, dangerous angle to take, because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really hanging outside of the helicopter. With a drone, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot easier to shoot straight down. The disappearance of Lake Poop\u00c3\u00b3 has not only destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of fishing families, but also added to a new category of climate refugees. What is the role of changing technologies like the drone in visual journalism? One of the things that I think working photojournalists need to do is constantly adapt. It would have been very easy to do these Carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Casualties stories from a purely still photographic perspective. And I think the still photographs I took on the ground would have been greatly improved had I been able to spend three times as much time on just the stills. But I think that it is a service to our readers to constantly experiment and figure out how to integrate new technologies into our storytelling in successful ways. It was important for me to be one of the first to use this technology. Luckily, The Times prioritized it and sent three of us to a drone training workshop under the F.A.A. at Virginia Tech to practice with this technology before we could even use it. And what was unique about the time period we chose to do this series is that many countries still hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t formalized their drone laws. In some ways it was the golden era for drone exploration. Even six months later when I tried to do an assignment in Canada, I had to fill out an 80-page application and wait weeks to be able to find out if I was certified to fly in their airspace.  You had to take an exam in the United States to get a pilot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license?  In the past, you had to be a licensed pilot in order to fly a drone. But the F.A.A. announced a new rule so people who understand the drone laws can be certified to fly in certain airspaces under a very strict list of rules. So I took the test the first day that it was offered.  In five years, will there be drones everywhere and an oversaturation of drone imagery? Definitely. I was lucky to be able to use this technology so early on because millions of drones were sold for last Christmas. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique about our drone laws in the United States is that hobbyists can fly in many more situations under more relaxed restrictions than commercial operators, and the law considers media organizations commercial operators. Just like the influx of digital cameras and camera phones created a saturation of imagery, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to adapt and figure out how we can bring our creativity to these new technologies. With this series, I tried to be thoughtful about how we employed the drone and not just fly it everywhere \u2014 to make sure that this is the right technology for the right story. Just because you have a drone, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you have to use it. People on the edges of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vast seas of sand are being displaced by climate change. What new technology is next?So in similar ways that the United States is conducting drone warfare from an office building in Las Vegas, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a matter of time until that technology gets small enough to put in a journalist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pocket. We need to plan for a world where that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible and decide how we want to treat storytelling should that happen.  But perhaps the photographer is also the reporter.  Hopefully as we think through the newsrooms of the future, photojournalists will be able to maintain the journalist part of our job title. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be recognized for the breadth of both the visual journalism and the text journalism that we can bring to each story. One story we did that was purely visually driven was called \u00e2\u0080\u009cLiving in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Expanding Desert.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was a new type of storytelling that we championed for this one particular piece in the Carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Casualties series. It was a story that the reporter Ed Wong and I conceptualized from a purely visual standpoint along with Hannah Fairfield, Jeremy White and Derek Watkins. The way our industry categorizes things hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t caught up to the type of visual journalism that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to do with all of these new technologies. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still honoring separations between still photographs, multimedia, documentary and video reporting. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settled on an overall visual journalism category. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunate that we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figured out a way for all these tools to integrate and work with one another. "}

{"Headline": "In the Buff", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byWordplayTUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Is anyone battening down the hatches and/or going through a March blizzard right now? As I wrote this it was in the forecast for the East Coast. In New York we\u2019ve had a very mild winter and the cold snap that we\u2019ve gotten swept up in the last few days is very discombobulating, but spring will come. No matter what changes the weather throws at us, the sun is the sun, and the light is slowly getting stronger, enticing our tenacious urban vegetation out of dormancy.My household is on a diet, and the kitchen is full of healthy, unprocessed ingredients, and the chill in the air makes me want to eat a toasted macaroni and cheese sandwich with a side of fries. As the theme of this puzzle revealed itself to me pretty slowly I found myself woefully amused.This seemed to me to be a constructor\u2019s puzzle \u2014 the challenge being in the rule of formation of the clues as well as the entries for the solver, which included a punny theme explanation \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.There are four actors clued in the acrosses, all of whom have last names with something in common, which is explained by 58A. The answer here refers to a Shakespeare quote that\u2019s catchy as heck, as I\u2019m finding, for \u201cclean food\u201d cookbooks, the headlines of diet articles, even in garden seed catalogs (which I\u2019ve been getting by the linear foot and daydreaming over, under my blankets and dogs, on the sofa).My salad daysWhen I was green in judgment, cold in blood,To say as I said then.It might not be as highbrow as the theater, but I vividly remember seeing Elizabeth Taylor in \u201cCleopatra\u201d back in high school at the revival movie theater at 80 St. Marks Place. It was fabulous, and set an unattainable standard for modern romance, although I admit I prefer growing old and fat to death by snake.I didn\u2019t need Google for the theme answers but I admit that I knew none of these actors from the clues. I had seen a couple of the films, but I am firmly in the camp of vegophiles that Mr. Gulczynski refers to in his notes. I also thought the whole grid was pretty chewy and fresh for a Tuesday.\u25a0 1A (and 1D): For 1A, \u201cPop fan?\u201d I thought of Champagne corks popping and went with SOT to start the whole procedure. I like this clue for MOM. For the cross at 1D, \u201cOne admired for his masculinity,\u201d I thought we might have a rebus at first, and thought of STRONGMAN, rather than MANS MAN. I trip myself up sometimes racing through puzzles early in the week.I wanted to make a pop culture-themed puzzle that spanned many generations. Without an exact theme idea in mind, I started browsing lists of old actresses and actors hoping something would come to me. Because SID CAESAR and LEE J. COBB both have surnames that start with C, they were listed near each other, and I made the obvious salad connection. Next I came up with the revealer SALAD DAYS, and the idea that my puzzle would contain movie stars with salad names who reminded people of their salad days. It seemed clever enough.It didn\u2019t work out quite like I wanted. (Does it ever?) There aren\u2019t a ton of well-known salad-named movie stars (nary a Waldorf nor a House nor a Tuna), and so I had to take what I could get: three actors who were at their peaks over 50 years ago and a guy who was better known for, um, \u201cbeing intimate\u201d with a dead moose on the side of the road on a silly TV show than he was for being in movies. (Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t think of Eva Green until well after the puzzle had been accepted.)So if you were born in the \u201840s or the \u201880s, this puzzle might hark you back to your SALAD DAYS. Otherwise it\u2019s a puzzle with a simple theme for all the people out there who really like vegetable-based word play.What did you think?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "High Above, Drones Keep Watchful Eyes on Wildlife in Africa", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byLIWONDE, Malawi \u2014 Night has fallen at Liwonde National Park, but the trespassers are clearly visible. Three hundred feet in the air, a thermal camera attached to a BatHawk drone tracks their boat, a black sliver gliding up the luminous gray Shire River.\u201cThey\u2019re breaking the law by coming into the park,\u201d said Antoinette Dudley, one of the drone\u2019s operators, pointing to her computer screen.More than two miles from the boat, she and her partner, Stephan De Necker, are seated in a Land Cruiser that serves as their command center. A monitor attached to the driver\u2019s seat displays the drone\u2019s vitals, and another behind the passenger\u2019s seat streams live video from the camera, operated with an old PlayStation console.\u201cLet\u2019s give them a scare,\u201d said Mr. De Necker. With the tap of a few keys, he switches on the drone\u2019s navigation lights and sends it beelining toward the boat.The reaction is instantaneous: The boat makes a U-turn, high-tailing it out of the park.Liwonde has lost about 50 elephants and two rhinos since 2014 to poachers. In August 2015, the Malawi Department of National Parks enlisted the help of African Parks, a nonprofit that specializes in rehabilitating struggling protected areas.Since taking over operations here, the group has confiscated upwards of 18,000 illegal snares, made over 100 arrests, installed more than 60 miles of electric fencing and removed 261 elephants to another reserve.But African Parks also has embarked on an unusual high-tech experiment, calling in a drone team from South Africa. With funding from the World Wildlife Fund, including a $5 million grant from Google, drones are being tested here in the first systematic evaluation of their potential to combat poachers.UAV & Drone Solutions, the company that employs Ms. Dudley and Mr. De Necker, is the first licensed drone operator in Africa, a certification that permits the company to fly drones up to 15 miles away and to operate at night \u2014 crucial advantages, given that the vast majority of poachers are active after dark and few parks are able to carry out effective nocturnal patrols.The group now operates in South Africa, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and soon will expand to Botswana. Their fixed-wing, bespoke BatHawk drones are outfitted with cameras, video transmitters and telemetry, and with battery changes they can fly for more than eight hours.\u201cU.D.S. does this better by far than anyone else,\u201d said John Petersen, the board chairman of the Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation, a nonprofit. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else in the world we know of that are flying regular missions almost exclusively at night.\u201dThe idea of using drones to combat poachers is not new. Conservationists enthusiastically embraced the devices as a silver bullet a few years ago \u2014 but disappointment was swift.Industry-grade equipment and software are needed, but they tend to be well beyond the budgets of strapped conservation organizations. Park managers opted for inappropriate models, too fragile for wild landscapes and lacking the necessary flight capabilities and cameras.\u201cI don\u2019t think the world of conservation has the money to spend that would be needed to make an anti-poaching drone effective,\u201d said Richard Vigne, the chief executive of Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.\u201cSo many groups want technology to solve all their problems, but usually they don\u2019t understand the tech,\u201d he said.Government officials haven\u2019t helped. In Namibia, trial flights and training undertaken by the W.W.F., supported by the Google grant, were cut short when the government suspended the use of drones. Other nations have banned unmanned aerial vehicles entirely or have strictly limited their use.Only recently has that begun to change. In 2015, South Africa established some of the first formal drone legislation, and other countries have started making limited exceptions for their use.The Lindbergh Foundation\u2019s Air Shepherd program, along with the South Africa-based Peace Parks Foundation and the W.W.F.\u2019s Google grant, have covered about half U.D.S.\u2019s $100,000 monthly operational costs.Despite these resources, Otto Werdmuller Von Elgg, the company\u2019s co-founder, has discovered that drones are far from the blanket solution everyone had hoped for.\u201cI am very convinced that we are onto something, but we\u2019re only beginning to understand how this tool can be used effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge now is determining how we integrate drones into existing anti-poaching operations.\u201dSo far, no arrests of poachers have been made solely based on drone surveillance, and pilots have only spotted poachers a handful of times. Drone teams often don\u2019t get ground support in the form of rangers able to follow up on leads, and must frequently fly without guidance on where poachers might be, according to Mr. Werdmuller Von Elgg.During trials in South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park, a protected area roughly the size of Israel, \u201cwe were told to go find people in this vast area based on no intelligence \u2014 it was an absolute waste of time,\u201d Mr. Werdmuller Von Elgg said. \u201cWe were just turning batteries into noise.\u201dWhen the drone team at Kruger finally did detect a group of rhino poachers, they called park officials. But officials said that there were no rangers available for deployment.\u201cIt was very frustrating,\u201d said Ms. Dudley, who had spotted the intruders. \u201cYou get upset with people because they say they want you there and you deliver the service, but then they don\u2019t back you up.\u201dBut Otch Otto, formerly the mission area operations manager of ranger services at Kruger, believes that limited resources were better spent on proven techniques and technologies, not experimental flying drones.\u201cThe technology is in the research phase, and to dedicate a reaction capability to something unproven does not serve the rhino,\u201d he said.Data analysis has also been a challenge. Currently, drone operators must watch live video feed to detect intruders and it is all too easy to miss the poachers.\u201cIt could be numerous reasons \u2014 the operator looks away for 20 seconds, or goes to grab a cup of coffeeand misses it,\u201d said Cedric Coetzee, the general manager for rhino security at Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife in South Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go beep-beep-beep, and off you go. You have to spot it.\u201dIndeed, pilots at a reserve managed by Mr. Coetzee missed a group of trespassers briefly picked up by their drone. The poachers were discovered only later in a review of the video feed.Serge Wich, an ecologist at Liverpool John Moores University in Britain and co-founder of the nonprofit Conservation Drones, is collaborating with colleagues from the astrophysics department to develop drone software that differentiates between humans and animals.\u201cOnce this is finalized, instead of having hours and hours of video to look at that doesn\u2019t have meaningful information, rangers will get a ping when there\u2019s a high chance that a poacher has been detected,\u201d Professor Wich said.Perhaps the biggest challenge is that conservationists do not know how to most effectively put anti-poaching drones to use, because there have been no rigorous long-term evaluations.Most evidence supporting drones is anecdotal: Mr. Coetzee said he has seen a significant reduction in park incursions when and where drones fly, but added that other factors could have been at play. Drones may deter trespassers, he said, but they may simply go elsewhere in the reserve.W.W.F. plans to tease out the answers to these questions by evaluating the drones\u2019 effectiveness against poachers here in Liwonde. Trials with two Bathawks and three DJI Phantom drones began in August. The foundation also has begun a test in Zimbabwe.Whether drones also can help reduce animals\u2019 contact with humans is also on the agenda. One unexpected discovery: DJI Phantom drones can steer elephants away from park boundaries \u2014 likely because they sound like a bit like bees, and elephants hate bees.\u201cAt the end of the experiment, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to say here\u2019s some good things you can do with drones and here are the things you shouldn\u2019t try because they probably won\u2019t work,\u201d said George Powell, W.W.F.\u2019s director of wildlife technology.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do this as scientists, and hopefully we\u2019ll save some elephants in the meantime.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Reports BBC to Police Over Investigation Into Child Sex Images", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 When Angus Crawford, a journalist at the British Broadcasting Corporation, started reporting on sexualized images of children on Facebook, he knew he had to proceed with caution.His original work in 2016 prompted the police to investigate, leading to a man being jailed over the issue. Months later, when Mr. Crawford found that other inappropriate images of children were still being posted on Facebook, he raised the issue with the company directly.But to his surprise, the Silicon Valley giant reported him and the BBC to the police.Facebook argued that it was just following established industry-standard procedures \u2014 and British law \u2014 by alerting the authorities to images of child exploitation, something it said it does with all such pictures.Google and Twitter, notably, are grappling with similar issues. Experts say these tech giants are blurring the lines between mere neutral online platforms for digital content and active media companies that must monitor what is posted online.\u201cThere is an expectation, particularly following the fake news controversy, that platforms have a responsibility as media companies rather than neutral tech companies to ensure that what goes on their platform is appropriate, tasteful, just like a broadcaster or a newspaper,\u201d said Adam Rendle, a London lawyer specializing in copyright and media at the law firm Taylor Wessing.Mr. Crawford, the BBC reporter, began investigating the presence of obscene images of children on Facebook last year. He had sought to highlight the difficulty of monitoring content on the social network, and his original investigation found that pedophiles were using secret pages to share images of children. A subsequent police investigation led to one man being imprisoned for downloading indecent images.He then contacted the social network directly to query the discrepancy, and was asked to provide examples of images that he had reported. But when he provided examples last week, the company reported Mr. Crawford and the BBC to the police.Facebook, however, said it had followed established procedures, and insisted it had removed all content that was illegal or breached its standards.\u201cWhen the BBC sent us such images we followed our industry\u2019s standard practice and reported them,\u201d Simon Milner, Facebook\u2019s policy director in Britain, said in a statement.\u201cIt is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation,\u201d Mr. Milner said. \u201cWe also reported the child exploitation images that had been shared on our own platform. This matter is now in the hands of the authorities.\u201dFacebook has said it is improving its system for reporting offensive content, but the incident has raised questions about exactly how it polices its site.Mr. Crawford, for example, noted an apparent contradiction between the view of Facebook\u2019s moderation system, which determined that the photos were not in breach of the social network\u2019s guidelines, and the company\u2019s decision to report the BBC to the police.\u201cIs it that it\u2019s illegal and their moderation isn\u2019t working?\u201d he asked, \u201cor is it that actually it\u2019s perfectly legal content?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Photos on the technology news site The Verge didn\u2019t display. Quora, a popular question-and-answer site, couldn\u2019t be reached.It was a rare fumble for Amazon in cloud computing, in which companies pay to run their online applications in data centers operated by big providers.Amazon\u2019s service interruption, though not nearly bad enough to spark a panic among customers, was viewed by some as a moment for reflection.\u201cIt really is a wake-up call to enterprises,\u201d said Craig McLuckie, a former Google technologist who is now chief executive of Heptio, a start-up that makes software tools for more easily moving applications between clouds. \u201cThey certainly need to understand to what level of dependency they have on a single provider.\u201dAmazon\u2019s error was still fresh in people\u2019s minds last week at the Google Cloud Next conference, a jamboree for the search giant to show off its seriousness in cloud computing. At the beginning of her keynote speech, Diane Greene, Google Cloud\u2019s chief executive, boasted about how reliable Google\u2019s cloud service was last year. Taking a jab at Amazon, she quipped that \u201cso far, 2017 looks promising, too.\u201dIt was part of a barrage unleashed by Google to persuade potential customers that they should piggyback on the $30 billion of infrastructure investment it had made over the years.\u201cWe\u2019re here for real; this is an incredibly serious mission,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cWe have the money, means and commitment to pull off a new platform of computation globally for everyone who needs it.\u201dBut even big customers Google showcased at its conference emphasized the importance of not relying exclusively on one company. Darryl West, global chief information officer of HSBC, said at the event that the bank used Google, Amazon and Microsoft for cloud services, noting that each company has its strengths.Paul Gaffney, Home Depot senior vice president of information technology, who also spoke at the Google event, said, \u201cAll of us have a role as consumers to drive competition so multi-cloud is a very important part of doing that.\u201dOne fear among businesses is that Amazon\u2019s dominance could lead to a new form of \u201clock-in,\u201d giving it huge leverage over customers because of the costs of switching providers. In the 1980s and 1990s, those costs helped Microsoft gain a seemingly unshakable grip on personal computing. Microsoft is betting that won\u2019t happen this time.\u201cThis won\u2019t be a winner-take-all scenario,\u201d said Judson Althoff, executive vice president of Microsoft\u2019s worldwide commercial business.Although they have become credible competitors to Amazon in the past few years \u2014 especially Microsoft \u2014 the newcomers to cloud computing have a long way to go. In the fourth quarter, Amazon accounted for 40 percent of the worldwide market for public cloud services, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft and 6 percent for Google, which was tied for third place with IBM, according to Synergy Research Group.Disruptions like the one in late February in what Amazon calls its simple storage service remain rare, especially in relation to comparable computing services operated privately by companies within their own walls. Even with the problem, which lasted for about four hours, the Amazon storage service was up and running more than 99.98 percent of the time in the United States and Europe over the last 90 days, according to CloudHarmony, a cloud measurement service owned by the technology research firm Gartner.Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, did not expect what transpired to cause a rush of companies to shift their cloud computing away from Amazon. She said it was highly unusual for companies to run the same application in more than one cloud because it introduced new complexities and costs.To avoid being knocked offline, companies can set up their applications to run in multiple regions, across the company\u2019s network of data centers. All of the big cloud providers offer volume discounts, the full benefits of which customers don\u2019t get to enjoy if they divide their use of cloud services among multiple providers.Still, there are some compelling reasons to use multiple providers, Ms. Leong said. Often companies rely mostly on Amazon for cloud service, while a specific development team inside the company familiar with Microsoft technologies will use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service.A few years ago, Hearst, the media company, was exclusively using Amazon for cloud computing, but later added services from Microsoft and Google, said Philip R. Wiser, Hearst\u2019s chief technology officer. He said some of the company\u2019s internal online services had been affected by Amazon\u2019s interruption, but nothing the public would have noticed.Because it\u2019s relatively early in the emergence of cloud computing, Mr. Wiser said he believed it was important to spread one\u2019s bets around.\u201cBeing multi-cloud as a company and having the skill and understanding of how to move between investments \u2014 that is an asset,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have that as a stated mission for all of our infrastructure team.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed to this story from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

And last weekend, 102 years later, police officers stood around it in Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn, looking beyond the name and dates for other kinds of clues.The stone and dozens like it, no longer standing, were lying flat on the grass. The police were investigating whether someone had climbed the fence and knocked them over.\u201cThis is a moment in time, a moment in history, where forces of hate have been unleashed,\u201d he said.The question of whether Washington Cemetery was part of this moment in history began on March 4, when a passer-by noticed the fallen stones and called the Shomrim, the Orthodox Jewish patrol society. The next morning, Jewish leaders, including Assemblyman Dov Hikind and Councilman David G. Greenfield, who both represent the area, stood outside the fence in the cold and peered inside.What they saw seemed a clear case of vandalism. Clusters of headstones were toppled from their bases. Some appeared very old and had broken into pieces upon impact. Others looked newer, made of smooth, polished stone.And the fence itself seemed to have been breached. Concertina wire was spooled along its top, but it appeared someone had snipped away a small portion, creating a gap large enough to climb through.Inside the fence, police officers wearing jackets marked Evidence Collection Team, who are more accustomed to searching for shell casings at shooting scenes, looked around the fallen stones. The gravity of the investigation was reflected in who arrived. Capt. Mark Molinari, the new commanding officer of the Police Department\u2019s hate crimes unit \u2014 so new he was not due to begin until the next day \u2014 was there. Police Commissioner James. P. O\u2019Neill came, too.Then, as quickly as it began, the investigation ended.The swift conclusion left some, including the elected officials present at the cemetery, skeptical.\u201cIt was very, very, very, very suspicious,\u201d Mr. Hikind said of the fallen stones later that week. He said he hoped there would be further investigation.\u201cIf it was nothing? Great, wonderful, super,\u201d Mr. Hikind said.Mr. Greenfield noted the large number of stones \u2014 the police put it at 42 \u2014 that had fallen in an isolated area.\u201cForty-two tombstones, a hole in the fence, and this is the only section,\u201d he said last week. \u201cIt seems unlikely that would have happened simply by the weather.\u201dOn Wednesday, I spoke to Captain Molinari on the telephone while I was in the cemetery, and he described his team\u2019s findings.Take that 1915 headstone for Fannie. It had been mounted, like many others, on a stone base in the ground, and the area where the two stones met had been sealed with caulk. The sort of clue the officers noticed was right there on top of the base: a long, green vine.\u201cThose vines had to have grown last year,\u201d Captain Molinari said. It appeared impossible that the stone could have fallen in recent weeks or even months.Upon closer inspection, dozens of fallen headstones bore environmental hints that they had been down for some time, with thin layers of dried grass and dirt in their exposed crevices. Many had vines snaking up their sides or across the bare bases. A 48-year-old woman\u2019s 1911 headstone, marked \u201cGone but Not Forgotten,\u201d had a tangle of vines between its new resting place and the base from which it fell.Likewise, the police found vines twisted around the area where the concertina wire was missing. \u201cThose vines had to grow last year sometime, and live and die,\u201d Captain Molinari said.Captain Molinari said a few of the stones looked as though they could have fallen recently, with no undergrowth to suggest otherwise. And it was possible the stones had in fact been pushed over, just not recently.\u201cI can\u2019t confirm that some of them were not pushed over, but we have nothing to indicate that has happened,\u201d he said. Captain Molinari said that large delivery trucks use the alley alongside the fence to make deliveries to Franklin D. Roosevelt High School opposite the cemetery, which might partly explain why so many stones had fallen in that area.\u201cA truck going by three feet away from these stones could cause enough vibration to topple a 110-year-old stone,\u201d he said. He planned to return to the cemetery with Google satellite images that show which stones were already down on past dates.Mr. Hikind commended the investigation when he was told of the findings on Friday. But he held onto some skepticism.\u201cThe absolute truth in all of this?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know for sure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The move could bolster the profits of the telecommunications industry by billions of dollars.Republican lawmakers, like Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and the chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, say that the commission\u2019s privacy rule is unfair because it applies only to broadband companies and not to internet businesses like Google and Facebook. This is highly disingenuous. Congress has only given the commission authority over telecommunications companies, so the F.C.C. couldn\u2019t have come up with rules that applied to other businesses even if it wanted to.Telecom companies know a lot about what people do online because they are the gatekeepers through which people connect to the internet. And as people link household devices like thermostats, light bulbs and security cameras to the internet, these companies will have even more intimate knowledge about their customers. By comparison, people can more easily evade tracking by businesses like Google and Facebook by not using those services or by deleting the cookies those websites leave on their computers and phones.In the absence of strong privacy rules, people will have to rely on encryption to prevent service providers from tracking them. But broadband companies would still know what websites people visit. And the companies would be able to see all of the communications between users and websites that do not use encryption. Sophisticated users might increasingly rely on virtual private networks, which are used by corporations to let their employees log into secure systems remotely, and other tools to mask their activities, but most Americans are unlikely to be conversant with such tricks of the trade.Mr. Trump promised voters during the campaign that he would protect the working class.

If you pick a good stand-in, I\u2019ll bring you back a cool souvenir.This seems like a good idea; lots of people don\u2019t want to pay hundreds of dollars for cable but probably can\u2019t get all their entertainment from Netflix and Amazon. But I do wonder if that\u2019s a TV company pipe dream. Maybe cord cutters will switch entirely and never miss TV. Personally, I pay for cable and almost never watch it. It\u2019s like burning money every month.In all, it has not been a great week for Uber. But I have been saying that a lot lately.This reminds me of the time Zenefits, the high-flying human resources start-up, was found to have installed software to let its workers cheat on a licensing course. You know what happened at Zenefits after that? The C.E.O. had to resign, there were hundreds of layoffs, regulators began long-term investigations and imposed millions in fines, the company\u2019s valuation plummeted, and its long-term prospects are still in question.Or, hey, I just thought of another comparison. It\u2019s like when Volkswagen created software to pretend its cars had low emissions in testing, but they didn\u2019t actually.In other words: This is bad.So I\u2019m kind of a Snap bear \u2014 and no, that\u2019s not some sort of terrifying euphemism. I believe their marquee product, Snapchat, has some significant challenges in regard to growth, and their thesis of being a camera company is far from borne out. (I will admit, however, that I am waiting for my pair of Snap Spectacles to arrive in the mail.)How does that add up to a successful company?But since you\u2019ve cast yourself as the Snap bear, let me pretend to be the Snap bull. I think it could be a mistake to compare it to Twitter for a simple reason: Snap is visual and Twitter is not. Snap, I think, is thus a more faithful replacement of the world\u2019s most popular pastime: watching TV. The big opportunity for all consumer internet companies is the money that will flow from TV ads to digital ads, and I think Snap has a pretty good shot at capturing a huge slice of that market.I also wouldn\u2019t compare it to GoPro. Yes, Snap says it\u2019s a camera company, but we\u2019re taking it too literally. It\u2019s a camera company whose main innovation is camera software, not hardware. In this way it is a bit like Apple: Apple\u2019s physical phone hardware is in many cases on par with that of competitors, but the reason that Apple makes essentially all the profit in the smartphone business is that its software keeps people glued to iPhones. Snap, too, is investing in software that hooks you in, and its hardware will be secondary to that. This is very different from GoPro, whose software is at best forgettable \u2014 leaving it open to competition from low-end manufacturers.Anyway, have you decided what car service you\u2019re using to get to the airport?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Executive Invokes Fifth Amendment, Seeking to Avoid Potential Charges", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 An Uber executive accused of stealing driverless car technology from his former employers at Google is exercising his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, according to his lawyers.The lawyers for Anthony Levandowski, the former head of Google\u2019s self-driving car project who is now leading a similar effort at Uber, said he was broadly asserting his Fifth Amendment rights because there was \u201cpotential for criminal action\u201d in the case, according to court transcripts obtained on Thursday.The legal maneuver adds even more intrigue to the high-profile fight between two of the technology industry\u2019s largest companies, which are squaring off in the race to put driverless cars on the road.As part of the motion seeking the injunction, Waymo said that Mr. Levandowski, while still working at Google, installed software that allowed him to download over 14,000 files, or about 9.7 gigabytes of data, pertaining to the driverless car program. Uber was ordered to hand over those files.In the transcript of a private hearing before Judge William Alsup in United States District Court in San Francisco, Mr. Levandowski\u2019s lawyers said he was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination in not turning over documents that may pertain to the case. Arturo Gonzalez, one of Uber\u2019s lawyers, said they have made clear to Mr. Levandowski that he needs to release any documents relevant to the case as part of discovery. \u201cWe obviously have a conflict,\u201d he said.Miles Ehrlich, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Levandowski, said the Uber executive was asserting his Fifth Amendment rights to protect against \u201ccompelled disclosure that would identify the existence, location or possession of any responsive documents.\u201d He also said that Mr. Levandowski\u2019s decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment may change as they examine the case.The situation raises questions about the future of Mr. Levandowski at the company. When Uber\u2019s lawyer told the court that the company could not force him to testify, Judge Alsup said Uber had the right to order him to cooperate or be fired.Without arguing about whether or not Mr. Levandowski stole documents, Uber\u2019s lawyer said the company intended to prove that its driverless car technology was not stolen from Waymo.\u201cThe more we get into this, it might look like a public relations disaster for Uber,\u201d said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University. \u201cThe mere fact that you\u2019re pleading the Fifth doesn\u2019t look good.\u201dThe acquisition of Otto and the hiring of Mr. Levandowski was critical for Uber. It is betting that autonomous cars are essential to its future, allowing it to run a fleet of cars around the clock without having to pay drivers.Angela Padilla, Uber\u2019s associate general counsel, said in a statement that the company plans to publicly lay out its case on April 7. \u201cWe are very confident that Waymo\u2019s claims against Uber are baseless and that Anthony Levandowski has not used any files from Google in his work with Otto or Uber,\u201d she said. A Waymo spokesman declined to comment.Uber\u2019s lawyers tried to keep the hearing confidential, arguing that it could harm Mr. Levandowski\u2019s reputation. Judge Alsup dismissed that argument.The New York Times obtained a copy of the transcript after Uber sent an email to employees warning of possible negative coverage in the news media over the expected release of a document from the trial.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Caterpillar Is Accused in Report to Federal Investigators of Tax Fraud", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byFor years, federal investigators have been scrutinizing Caterpillar\u2019s overseas tax affairs with no resolution to the examinations of the complex maneuvers involving billions of dollars and one of the company\u2019s Swiss subsidiaries.Now, a report commissioned by the government and reviewed by The New York Times accuses the heavy-equipment maker of carrying out tax and accounting fraud. It is extremely rare to accuse a big multinational company of tax fraud, which could result in high penalties.\u201cCaterpillar did not comply with either U.S. tax law or U.S. financial reporting rules,\u201d wrote Leslie A. Robinson, an accounting professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and the author of the report. \u201cI believe that the company\u2019s noncompliance with these rules was deliberate and primarily with the intention of maintaining a higher share price. These actions were fraudulent rather than negligent.\u201dNo charges have been filed, and it is not clear whether investigators agree with the findings or intend to act on them. The report, which has not been made public or made available to Caterpillar, outlines a company strategy for bringing home billions of dollars from offshore affiliates while avoiding federal income taxes on those earnings.Corrie Heck Scott, a Caterpillar spokeswoman, pointed out that the company had not been provided with a copy of the report and declined to comment further. The company, which makes heavy construction and mining equipment, has defended its tax strategies in previous years by calling the arrangements prudent and lawful among large United States companies.Caterpillar\u2019s strategies for reducing the taxes it must pay in the United States have saved the company billions of dollars. Last week, federal agents raided three Caterpillar buildings near its headquarters in Peoria, Ill., as part of the investigation. Caterpillar said it was cooperating with law enforcement.The company\u2019s tax practices have been a focus of government investigators since a 2014 Senate hearing found that the company cut its tax bill by $2.4 billion over 13 years, moving earnings out of the United States and into a Swiss subsidiary, despite internal company warnings that the strategy lacked a business purpose, other than tax avoidance.Less than a year later, Caterpillar disclosed it received a subpoena from federal investigators seeking documents and information relating to the movement of cash among domestic and overseas subsidiaries, as well as other matters involving its foreign units, including the Swiss entity.The company has since disclosed in securities filings that the Internal Revenue Service is seeking more than $2 billion in income taxes and penalties on profits earned by the Swiss unit. Caterpillar has said it is \u201cvigorously contesting\u201d the I.R.S.\u2019s proposed increases.Reached by telephone, Dr. Robinson declined to comment. Her report focused on one specific part of Caterpillar\u2019s offshore tax arrangement. It concluded that the company failed to pay taxes on billions of dollars brought home primarily from its Swiss unit and its affiliates, and thus failed to comply with United States tax law and financial reporting rules.It is not clear which federal agency hired Dr. Robinson. In her report she wrote that she was asked to provide a written opinion of Caterpillar\u2019s financial reporting related to various tax accounting standards, \u201cas pertaining to\u201d the investigation of Caterpillar by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General.\u201cI was provided with all documents available to the case agents assigned to the investigation,\u201d Dr. Robinson wrote. She also wrote that she spent approximately 200 hours reviewing the evidence and performing calculations.The investigation is being conducted by the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Central District of Illinois as well as the Inspector General of the F.D.I.C., which investigates criminal activities affecting financial institutions. Agents from that office, as well as from the I.R.S. and the Department of Commerce\u2019s office of export enforcement joined the raid on Caterpillar\u2019s offices last week.A spokeswoman and a spokesman for the agencies confirmed last week\u2019s law enforcement activity and the agencies involved, but declined to comment further.United States companies owe corporate income taxes at a rate of 35 percent on profits earned around the world. However, they are permitted to defer the taxes owed on the profits generated offshore until they bring those earnings back to the States, a process known as repatriation. Once they bring cash back, they generally owe federal income taxes, with a credit for any income taxes they have already paid overseas.In the report, Dr. Robinson estimated that Caterpillar has brought back $7.9 billion into the States, structured as loans, over and beyond the income that had already been taxed overseas. She concluded that the company failed to report those loans for tax or accounting purposes, and she wrote that those profits should be subject to federal taxes.In one example, she cited correspondence between the company and the Securities and Exchange Commission in which Caterpillar said it had $2.5 billion of income eligible to be brought to the United States tax-free. Dr. Robinson wrote that her research showed that the company did not have \u201canywhere near\u201d that sum still available to be brought in tax-free.Caterpillar failed to report those loans as taxable distributions of cash, thus avoiding the tax on earnings brought home from Switzerland, while \u201cenjoying the use of those earnings to meet U.S. cash needs,\u201d she wrote.Dr. Robinson\u2019s 85-page analysis is based on publicly available and internal financial data of the company, she wrote in the report, as well as bank data tracking wire transfers from Switzerland into the United States.The report does not explain whether Caterpillar used the type of creative, and often legal, transactions that United States multinationals use to avoid tax on earnings brought home from offshore.For instance, while companies typically owe tax on earnings brought home, there some exceptions. For instance, they do not owe tax on short-term loans made by their offshore subsidiaries to their domestic parent company. In her report, Dr. Robinson does not mention this legal exception, and it is unclear if Caterpillar used such transactions.In 2012, the same Senate committee that examined Caterpillar\u2019s taxes found that Hewlett-Packard stitched together a series of such loans to bring home billions of dollars tax-free.The 2014 Senate report on Caterpillar said the company worked with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, to set up its Swiss tax-cutting strategy. PwC was also the company\u2019s auditor, which raised \u201csignificant conflict of interest concerns,\u201d according to Senate investigators.The report by Dr. Robinson makes a passing reference to PwC but does not address what role, if any, it had in these transactions.Caroline Nolan, a spokeswoman for PwC, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on client matters or pending investigations.\u201dCompanies like Caterpillar, Google, Apple and Pfizer have accumulated at least $2.3 trillion offshore, much of it in subsidiaries located in tax havens like Bermuda, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. President Trump has said he supports a holiday of sorts that would permit companies to bring those profits back to the United States at a low rate.Advertisement"}

And it needs to be shaved back.\u201dIn recent weeks, Uber has moved quickly to shed that past. The company hired Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and others to conduct an investigation of the workplace. Arianna Huffington, a board member, has repeatedly said that the company would no longer hire \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201dMs. Hornsey, a former executive at Google, has also moved into the hot seat. She joined Uber late last year from SoftBank and has essentially been given a blank check \u2014 money, head count, resources \u2014 to revamp the workplace processes and managerial styles put into place when the company was still a fledgling start-up.Along with resources, Ms. Hornsey has embarked on a \u201clistening tour\u201d with employees who wish to share grievances. She is reworking the human resources structure and how Uber rates employee performance, long considered a problem area for insiders. And she spoke on behalf of the company about the diversity report, which covered full-time employees but not drivers, who work as freelancers.The report\u2019s numbers were stark. Only 36 percent of Uber\u2019s work force is made up of women, while the technology jobs at the company \u2014 some 85 percent \u2014 are overwhelmingly held by men. In terms of racial composition, 50 percent of Uber\u2019s employees in the United States are white and 31 percent are Asian, while 9 percent are black and 6 percent are Hispanic.\u201cWe have to build more trust with our employees, and transparency will build that trust,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said of the report.In the past, Mr. Kalanick has resisted publishing a diversity report, current and former employees have said. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Kalanick said, \u201cI know that we have been too slow in publishing our numbers \u2014 and that the best way to demonstrate our commitment to change is through transparency. And to make progress, it\u2019s important we measure what matters.\u201dCompared with statistics at other technology companies, Uber\u2019s diversity figures are not that different \u2014 and are modestly better than some.At Uber, issues of internal culture may have been compounded by its dizzying growth over the past few years. The service is available in hundreds of cities across more than 70 countries and completes hundreds of thousands of trip requests a day. In the last year alone, the company\u2019s employee base has doubled in size to more than 12,000.But that turbocharged expansion has come at a cost, employees have said. Growth, they said, was prioritized above anything else. That skewed the development of the organization into something that embraced the \u201ccult of the individual,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said.Top performers were rewarded and promoted into management positions. Some 63 percent of managers had never previously held a leadership position, and Uber did not provide much training for new managers, some said.\u201cFor the first several years, we had to just focus on executing our operational goals, and that was kind of the be-all, end-all,\u201d said Nicole Cuellar, an operations and logistics manager who has worked at Uber for nearly four years. \u201cThere was never the need to think about our culture like that. And I don\u2019t think it sunk in until we all had this really gut-wrenching experience.\u201dAmong the things that Uber now has on the table to change are its list of 14 corporate values, which include being \u201csuper pumped\u201d and \u201calways be hustlin\u2019.\u201d Mr. Kalanick is open to revising or adding new values, Ms. Hornsey said.She added that Uber was creating a task force to pinpoint major human resources failings, aided by Frances X. Frei, an adviser from Harvard Business School who has helped companies through organizational change. Uber also pledged to donate $3 million over the next three years to groups working on bringing women and underrepresented minorities into the tech industry.Some current and former employees have expressed concern over whether Uber will be able to change, given the deep-seated trait of aggressive individualism that Mr. Kalanick has fostered.But others like Tasneem Minadakis, who is active in Uber\u2019s LadyEng organization, an internal group at the company that supports and campaigns for women, said they have been galvanized by the efforts to fix the culture. In total, Ms. Minadakis said LadyEng has more than 500 employees eager to enact change.\u201cThey really do believe that this company can be a force for good,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said. \u201cIf it could only stop shooting itself in the foot.\u201dKatie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russian Espionage Piggybacks on a Cybercriminal\u2019s Hacking", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byTo the F.B.I., Evgeniy M. Bogachev is the most wanted cybercriminal in the world. The bureau has announced a $3 million bounty for his capture, the most ever for computer crimes, and has been trying to track his movements in hopes of grabbing him if he strays outside his home turf in Russia.He has been indicted in the United States, accused of creating a sprawling network of virus-infected computers to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from bank accounts around the world, targeting anyone with enough money worth stealing \u2014 from a pest control company in North Carolina to a police department in Massachusetts to a Native American tribe in Washington.But it is clear that for Russia, he is more than just a criminal. At one point, Mr. Bogachev had control over as many as a million computers in multiple countries, with possible access to everything from family vacation photographs and term papers to business proposals and highly confidential personal information. It is almost certain that computers belonging to government officials and contractors in a number of countries were among the infected devices. For Russia\u2019s surveillance-obsessed intelligence community, Mr. Bogachev\u2019s exploits may have created an irresistible opportunity for espionage.While Mr. Bogachev was draining bank accounts, it appears that the Russian authorities were looking over his shoulder, searching the same computers for files and emails. In effect, they were grafting an intelligence operation onto a far-reaching cybercriminal scheme, sparing themselves the hard work of hacking into the computers themselves, officials said.The Russians were particularly interested, it seems, in information from military and intelligence services regarding fighting in eastern Ukraine and the war in Syria, according to law enforcement officials and the cybersecurity firm Fox-IT. But there also appear to have been attempts to gain access to sensitive military and intelligence information on infected computers in the United States, often consisting of searches for documents containing the words \u201ctop secret\u201d or \u201cDepartment of Defense.\u201dThe Russian government has plenty of its own cyberspace tools for gathering intelligence. But the piggybacking on Mr. Bogachev\u2019s activities offers some clues to the breadth and creativity of Russia\u2019s espionage efforts at a time when the United States and Europe are scrambling to counter increasingly sophisticated attacks capable of destroying critical infrastructure, disrupting bank operations, stealing government secrets and undermining democratic elections.This relationship is illustrated by the improbable mix of characters targeted with the sanctions announced by the Obama administration. Four were senior officers with Russia\u2019s powerful military intelligence agency, the G.R.U. Two were suspected cyberthieves on the F.B.I.\u2019s most wanted list: an ethnic Russian from Latvia named Alexsey Belan with a red-tinted Justin Bieber haircut, and Mr. Bogachev, whose F.B.I. file includes a photograph of him holding his spotted Bengal cat while wearing a matching set of leopard-print pajamas.His involvement with Russian intelligence may help explain why Mr. Bogachev, 33, is hardly a man on the run. F.B.I. officials say he lives openly in Anapa, a run-down resort town on the Black Sea in southern Russia. He has a large apartment near the shore and possibly another in Moscow, officials say, as well as a collection of luxury cars, though he seems to favor driving his Jeep Grand Cherokee. American investigators say he enjoys sailing and owns a yacht.Running the criminal scheme was hard work. Mr. Bogachev often complained of being exhausted and \u201cof having too little time for his family,\u201d said Aleksandr Panin, a Russian hacker, now in a federal prison in Kentucky for bank fraud, who used to communicate with Mr. Bogachev online. \u201cHe mentioned a wife and two kids as far as I remember,\u201d Mr. Panin wrote in an email.Beyond that, little is known about Mr. Bogachev, who preferred to operate anonymously behind various screen names: slavik, lucky12345, pollingsoon. Even close business associates never met him in person or knew his real name.\u201cHe was very, very paranoid,\u201d said J. Keith Mularski, an F.B.I. supervisor in Pittsburgh whose investigation of Mr. Bogachev led to an indictment in 2014. \u201cHe didn\u2019t trust anybody.\u201dRussia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, and Russian officials say that so long as Mr. Bogachev has not committed a crime on Russian territory, there are no grounds to arrest him.Attempts to reach Mr. Bogachev for this article were unsuccessful. In response to questions, his lawyer in Anapa, Aleksei Stotskii, said, \u201cThe fact that he is wanted by the F.B.I. prevents me morally from saying anything.\u201dA line in Mr. Bogachev\u2019s file with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, which has helped the F.B.I. track his movements, describes him as \u201cworking under the supervision of a special unit of the F.S.B.,\u201d referring to the Federal Security Service, Russia\u2019s main intelligence agency. The F.S.B. did not respond to a request for comment.That Mr. Bogachev remains at large \u201cis the most powerful argument\u201d that he is an asset of the Russian government, said Austin Berglas, who was an assistant special agent in charge of cyberinvestigations out of the F.B.I.\u2019s New York field office until 2015. Hackers like Mr. Bogachev are \u201cmoonlighters,\u201d Mr. Berglas said, \u201cdoing the bidding of Russian intelligence services, whether economic espionage or straight-up espionage.\u201dIt also hints at a struggle to recruit top talent. A job with the Russian intelligence agencies does not command the prestige it did in the Soviet era. The Russian state has to compete against the dream of six-figure salaries and stock options in Silicon Valley. A recruiting pitch from a few years ago for the Defense Ministry\u2019s cyberwarfare brigade offered college graduates the rank of lieutenant and a bed in a room with four other people.And so the Kremlin at times turns to the \u201cdark web\u201d or Russian-language forums devoted to cyberfraud and spam. Mr. Bogachev, according to court papers from his criminal case, used to sell malicious software on a site called Carding World, where thieves buy and sell stolen credit card numbers and hacking kits, according to the F.B.I. One recent posting offered to sell American credit card information with CVV security numbers for $5. A user named MrRaiX was selling a malware supposedly designed to pilfer passwords from programs like Google Chrome and Outlook Express.Rather than shut down such sites, as the F.B.I. typically tries to do, Russian intelligence agents appear to have infiltrated them, security experts say.Some of the forums state specifically that almost any type of criminality is allowed \u2014 bank fraud, counterfeiting documents, weapons sales. One of the few rules: no work in Russia or the former Soviet Union. In Carding World, and in many other forums, a violation results in a lifetime ban.The F.B.I. has long been stymied in its efforts to get Russian cybercriminals. For a time, the bureau had high hopes that its agents and Russian investigators with the F.S.B. would work together to target Russian thieves who had made a specialty of stealing Americans\u2019 credit card information and breaking into their bank accounts. \u201cHere\u2019s to great investigations,\u201d F.B.I. and F.S.B. agents would toast each other at Manhattan steakhouses during periodic trust-building visits, Mr. Berglas said.But help rarely seemed to materialize. After a while, agents began to worry that the Russian authorities were recruiting the very suspects that the F.B.I. was pursuing. The joke among Justice Department officials was the Russians were more likely to pin a medal on a suspected criminal hacker than help the F.B.I. nab him.\u201cAlmost all the hackers who have been announced by the U.S. government through indictments are immediately tracked by the Russian government,\u201d said Arkady Bukh, a New York-based lawyer who often represents Russian hackers arrested in the United States. \u201cAll the time they\u2019re asked to provide logistical and technical support.\u201dWhile it was a widely held suspicion, it is tough to prove the connection between cyberthieves and Russian intelligence. But in one case, Mr. Berglas said, F.B.I. agents monitoring an infected computer were surprised to see a hacker who was the target of their investigation share a copy of his passport with a person the F.B.I. believed to be a Russian intelligence agent \u2014 a likely signal that the suspect was being recruited or protected. \u201cThat was the closest we ever came,\u201d he said.Mr. Bogachev\u2019s hacking career began well over a decade ago, leading to the creation of a malicious software program called GameOver ZeuS, which he managed with the help of about a half-dozen close associates who called themselves the Business Club, according to the F.B.I. and security researchers. Working around the clock, his criminal gang infected an ever-growing network of computers. It was able to bypass the most advanced banking security measures to quickly empty accounts and transfer the money abroad through a web of intermediaries called money mules. F.B.I. officials said it was the most sophisticated online larceny scheme they had encountered \u2014 and for years, it was impenetrable.Mr. Bogachev became extremely wealthy. At one point, he owned two villas in France and kept a fleet of cars parked around Europe so he would never have to rent a vehicle while on vacation, according to a Ukrainian law enforcement official with knowledge of the Bogachev case, who requested anonymity to discuss the continuing investigation. Officials say he had three Russian passports with different aliases allowing him to travel undercover.At the height of his operations, Mr. Bogachev had between 500,000 and a million computers under his control, American officials said. And there is evidence that the Russian government took an interest in knowing what was on them.Beginning around 2011, according to an analysis by Fox-IT, computers under Mr. Bogachev\u2019s control started receiving requests for information \u2014 not about banking transactions, but for files relating to various geopolitical developments pulled from the headlines.Ahead of Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, infected computers were searched for information about top-secret files from the country\u2019s main intelligence directorate, the S.B.U. Some of the queries involved searches for personal information about government security officials, including emails from Georgia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, the Turkish Foreign Ministry and others, said Michael Sandee, one of the researchers from Fox-IT.And at some point between March 2013 and February 2014, there were searches for English-language documents, which seemed to be fishing for American military and intelligence documents. The queries were for terms including \u201ctop secret\u201d and \u201cDepartment of Defense,\u201d said Brett Stone-Gross, a cybersecurity analyst involved in analyzing GameOver ZeuS. \u201cThese were in English,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was different.\u201dCybersecurity experts who studied the case say there is no way to know who ordered the queries. But they were so disconnected from the larceny and fraud that drove Mr. Bogachev\u2019s operation that analysts say there can be no other motive but espionage.Whether the searches turned up any classified document or sensitive government material is unknown, although the odds are good that there were a number of federal government employees or military contractors with infected personal computers.\u201cThey had such a large number of infections, I would say it\u2019s highly likely they had computers belonging to U.S. government and foreign government employees,\u201d Mr. Stone-Gross said.In the summer of 2014, the F.B.I., together with law enforcement agencies in over half a dozen countries, carried out Operation Tovar, a coordinated attack on Mr. Bogachev\u2019s criminal infrastructure that shut down his network and liberated computers infected with GameOver ZeuS.Prosecutors said they were in talks with the Russian government, trying to secure cooperation for the capture of Mr. Bogachev. But the only apparent legal trouble Mr. Bogachev has faced in Russia was a lawsuit filed against him by a real estate company in 2011 over payment of about $75,000 on his apartment in Anapa, according to court papers there. And even that he managed to beat.These days, officials believe Mr. Bogachev is living under his own name in Anapa and occasionally takes boat trips to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied in 2014. Mr. Mularski, the F.B.I. supervisor, said his agents were \u201cstill pursuing leads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Young People Need to Know About Colon Cancer", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported bySarah DeBord was 24 when she first noticed blood in her stool. She saw a gastroenterologist who did a procedure called a flexible sigmoidoscopy to examine her lower colon and rectum, then gave her a diagnosis of hemorrhoids.\u201cI don\u2019t see any hemorrhoids, but that\u2019s probably what it is,\u201d Ms. DeBord recalled the doctor saying.For the next 10 years, whenever Ms. DeBord saw blood in her stool, she told herself it was probably hemorrhoids. At 34, she began losing a lot of weight, which she at first chalked up to her training for a half marathon. But she was also so constipated she was making endless trips to the bathroom. She had a colonoscopy and learned she had advanced colorectal cancer that was inoperable and had spread to her lung.\u201cIt was staring me in the face the whole time,\u201d said Ms. DeBord, who lives in Minneapolis and has such advanced disease that she can never stop chemotherapy treatment. \u201cI\u2019d Google \u2018blood in stool,\u2019 and 10 different things would come up,\u201d including colon cancer, \u201cbut I thought colon cancer was only in older people.\u201dThe cause, or causes, of the increase have eluded scientists. While rates of cancers tied to human papillomavirus, or HPV, have been rising in recent years, that virus causes cancers mainly of the cervix, back of the throat and anus (anal and rectal cancers are distinct), and scientists do not believe sexual behaviors or HPV are driving the increase in colon or rectal cancer.Ms. DeBord, who has two young children and works for the Colon Cancer Coalition, is encouraging young adults to be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, and urges them to get a second opinion, or a third, if they think their doctor might be missing something. Younger people are much more likely to be diagnosed after the disease has spread, when it is much harder to treat, as in Ms. DeBord\u2019s case.Warning signs include blood in the stool, rectal bleeding or stools that are dark or black in color. The blood, released from the tumor, may be bright red or \u201ctarry\u201d in appearance, which can result when blood has broken down in the intestine. Unexplained or unintentional weight loss or fatigue can also be symptoms. General digestive complaints can also occur, including persistent abdominal cramps, gas pain or low back pain, feeling bloated, or experiencing a change in bathroom habits that lasts more than a few days, such as diarrhea, constipation, narrower than usual stools or a feeling that your bowel is not emptying completely.\u201cI kept making excuses for my symptoms,\u201d said Ms. DeBord, until \u201cit got so bad I knew something was wrong.\u201dMany symptoms that could indicate colorectal cancer may be benign, or related to other medical conditions, which is why the diagnosis is often missed in young adults, experts say.Iron-deficiency anemia, for example, is common in women with heavy periods, but it can also be a sign of colorectal cancer. In women who are not menstruating and in men, \u201canemia is colon cancer until proven otherwise,\u201d said one expert, Dr. Thomas Weber, who serves on the steering committee of the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. In general, he said, worrisome symptoms that persist should be investigated, and doctors should consider ordering a colonoscopy.Dr. Renee Williams, an assistant professor of medicine at New York University School of Medicine and a gastroenterologist at Bellevue Hospital Center, said she would take steps to rule out colorectal cancer even in menstruating women with iron deficiency if they are in their 40s, as well as in younger women with a first case of iron deficiency if they do not have heavy periods.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create a panic, and the frequency in younger adults is still relatively low, but we are seeing an increase,\u201d said Dr. Mark Pochapin, director of gastroenterology at NYU Langone Medical Center, and treasurer of the American College of Gastroenterology.The new data \u201craise the flag to be vigilant,\u201d Dr. Pochapin said. \u201cWe need doctors to realize colorectal cancer is possible in younger patients, and if they are having something like rectal bleeding, this could be something more serious. Young people\u2019s symptoms should not be dismissed.\u201dPhysicians are trained to think of the most common conditions first, that \u201cWhen you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t as much a zebra as people think.\u201dRoutine screening tests for colorectal cancer are not currently recommended in people under 50 who are considered to be at average risk because the number of cases is so low that universal screening tests would most likely do more harm than good, experts say. Colonoscopies, for example, are often done with sedation and can result in serious complications, such as perforation of the intestine, in a small percentage of cases.So what\u2019s the average millennial or Gen-Xer to do?\u25a0 Find a primary care physician whom you like and trust, and establish a relationship with him or her, even if you don\u2019t have any medical issues, said Dr. Pochapin. \u201cGo to a doctor when you\u2019re well,\u201d he said. That way, if you ever develop worrisome symptoms, \u201cyou have easy access, and can get care from someone who knows you already. A lot of young people are embarrassed to talk about these things.\u201d\u25a0 Know your family history and share it with your physician. Has anyone in your family had colorectal cancer, or had precancerous polyps removed? \u201cIf you have a first-degree relative \u2014 a parent or sibling \u2014 who had colon cancer at 50,\u201d for example, \u201cyou should be screened at 40,\u201d or 10 years earlier, said Dr. Williams. Illness in a more distant relative may also increase the risk. Certain medical conditions, like inflammatory bowel disease and certain other cancers, may also increase the risk for colorectal cancer. If you are African-American, some medical organizations encourage screening starting earlier, at age 45, Dr. Williams said.\u25a0 Know what\u2019s normal for you, said Anne Carlson, executive director of the Colon Cancer Coalition. \u201cKnow your body,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at your stool \u2014 it\u2019s really the picture of your health. Take pictures to show your doctor if you\u2019re concerned. Keep a journal of what\u2019s going on in your toilet and your eating habits and diet, and be aware of changes in your body.\u201d\u25a0 If your doctor isn\u2019t taking a concern seriously, be persistent, Ms. Carlson said. \u201cWe are taught physicians know best. But you know when something isn\u2019t right for you,\u201d she said. If a doctor is dismissive, \u201cgo to another one, and another one.\u201d Even though routine screening is not recommended until age 50, doctors can order diagnostic tests if you are having persistent symptoms. In addition to flexible sigmoidoscopy, which examines the rectum and lower colon, and colonoscopy, there are noninvasive laboratory tests that can be done to examine stool samples for microscopic amounts of hemoglobin, a marker for blood, and for DNA markers indicative of colorectal cancer. \u201cColon cancer is one of the most treatable cancers if it\u2019s found early,\u201d Ms. Carlson said.\u25a0 Last but not least, a healthy lifestyle that lessens your risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes may also protect you from colorectal cancer. Eat a diet that\u2019s high in fruits, vegetables and fiber, and provides enough folate and calcium. Avoid eating lots of red or grilled meats and processed meats, which are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Obesity, smoking, heavy use of alcohol and sedentary lifestyles are also associated with an increased risk. Try to keep your weight under control. Get plenty of exercise, which is believed to protect against colon cancer. If you smoke, quit.An earlier version of this article misstated the sedation requirements for colonoscopy. The procedure is often done with sedation, but sedation is not required.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Nix\u2019s little-known firm, Cambridge Analytica, claimed to have developed something unique: \u201cpsychographic\u201d profiles that could predict the personality and hidden political leanings of every American adult.\u201cOf the two candidates left in the election, one of them is using these technologies,\u201d Mr. Nix said, referring to Donald J. Trump.Capitalizing on its work for the man who is now president, Cambridge has pitched potential clients in the United States ranging from MasterCard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Ahead of this year\u2019s elections in Europe, Mr. Nix is promoting the four-year-old United States-based company abroad, too.But a dozen Republican consultants and former Trump campaign aides, along with current and former Cambridge employees, say the company\u2019s ability to exploit personality profiles \u2014 \u201cour secret sauce,\u201d Mr. Nix once called it \u2014 is exaggerated.\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of really smart people,\u201d said Brent Seaborn, managing partner of TargetPoint, a rival business that also provided voter data to the Trump campaign. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as easy as it looks to transition from being excellent at one thing and bringing it into politics. I think there\u2019s a big question about whether we think psychographic profiling even works.\u201dAt stake are not merely bragging rights, but also an emerging science that many believe could reshape American politics and commerce. Big data companies already know your age, income, favorite cereal and when you last voted. But the company that can perfect psychological targeting could offer far more potent tools: the ability to manipulate behavior by understanding how someone thinks and what he or she fears.A voter deemed neurotic might be shown a gun-rights commercial featuring burglars breaking into a home, rather than a defense of the Second Amendment; political ads warning of the dangers posed by the Islamic State could be targeted directly at voters prone to anxiety, rather than wasted on those identified as optimistic.\u201cYou can do things that you would not have dreamt of before,\u201d said Alexander Polonsky, chief data scientist at Bloom, a consulting firm that offers \u201cemotion analysis\u201d of social networks and has worked with the center-right Republican Party in France.\u201cIt goes beyond sharing information,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s sharing the thinking and the feeling behind this information, and that\u2019s extremely powerful.\u201dBoth conservatives and liberals are eager to harness that power. In Washington, some Democratic operatives are scrambling to develop personality-profiling capabilities of their own. But even as Cambridge seeks to expand its business among conservative groups, questions about its performance have soured many Republicans in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit.Cambridge is no longer in contention to work for Mr. Trump at the Republican National Committee, a company spokesman confirmed, nor is it working for America First Policies, a new nonprofit formed to help advance the president\u2019s agenda.But when asked to name a single race where the firm\u2019s flagship product had been critical to victory, Mr. Nix declined.\u201cWe bake a cake, it\u2019s got 10 ingredients in it. Psychographics is one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to isolate exactly what the impact of that ingredient is.\u201dCambridge\u2019s parent company, the London-based Strategic Communication Laboratories Group, has a long record of trying to understand and influence behavior. Founded in 1993 by a former British adman, the firm has worked for companies and candidates around the world, as well as for government and military clients. SCL has studied Pakistani jihadists for the British government and provided intelligence assessments for American defense contractors in Iran, Libya and Syria, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times.\u201cTheir approach was seen as serious and focused,\u201d said Mark Laity, chief of strategic communications at NATO\u2019s military headquarters in Europe, who has taken part in NATO-affiliated conferences where SCL has made presentations.In recent years, the company has moved to exploit the revolution in big data to predict human behavior more precisely, working with scientists from the Cambridge University Psychometrics Center. The United States represented a critical new market. Europe has strict privacy protections that limit the use of personal information, but America is more lightly regulated, allowing the sale of huge troves of consumer data to any company or candidate who can afford them.In 2013, Cambridge Analytica was created as SCL\u2019s American operation, and the two companies today share many of their roughly 200 employees, several top executives, and offices in New York and Washington.To develop its profiling system, Cambridge conducts detailed psychological surveys \u2014 by phone and online \u2014 of tens of thousands of people, differentiating them by five traits, a model widely used by behavioral researchers.Uniquely, the company claims to be able to extrapolate those findings to millions of other people it has not surveyed, assigning them one of 32 distinct personality types. Cambridge then blends those profiles with commercial data and voting histories, revealing \u201chidden voter trends and behavioral triggers,\u201d according to a 2016 company brochure.Those profiles, in turn, would allow campaigns to customize advertising, direct-mail slogans and door-knocking scripts, each calibrated to prod the targeted voter toward \u2014 or away from \u2014 a candidate.The promise of psychometrics appealed to Mr. Mercer, a computer scientist who made a fortune helping to lead Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island-based hedge fund. Mr. Mercer and his daughter Rebekah presided over a growing political empire that included millions of dollars in contributions to conservative groups and a stake in Breitbart, whose nationalist and racially antagonistic content prefigured Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Mr. Mercer became Cambridge\u2019s principal investor, according to two former employees. (Like several others interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements and the threat of lawsuits.) Mr. Bannon, the family\u2019s political guru, also advised the company and served as vice president of its board, according to Delaware public records.Mr. Mercer has never spoken publicly about his policy views in depth, but his giving is eclectic: He has financed anti-Clinton documentaries, right-wing media watchdogs, libertarian think tanks and both Senator Ted Cruz, a religious conservative, and Mr. Trump, a thrice-married nationalist.\u201cThe genius here is Bob, and the billionaire in this is Bob, and the person with the extreme views of how the world should be is Bob,\u201d said David Magerman, a Renaissance research scientist who was recently suspended after criticizing his boss\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.As the 2016 presidential campaign began, however, Cambridge landed a marquee political client: Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator. Mr. Mercer seeded a super PAC with $11 million to support him.Cambridge had a talented salesman in Mr. Nix, an Eton-educated SCL director chosen to lead the American effort. Among colleagues, his skills at cajoling clients are legendary. At an office party at a London dog track in the summer of 2015, one young employee offered an affectionate toast.\u201cHe is so smooth he\u2019ll rub shoulders with politicians and their campaigns,\u201d the employee joked, according to a video of the event posted on YouTube, \u201cand, in their face, tell them he\u2019s going to rip them off.\u201dBut Cambridge\u2019s psychographic models proved unreliable in the Cruz presidential campaign, according to Rick Tyler, a former Cruz aide, and another consultant involved in the campaign. In one early test, more than half the Oklahoma voters whom Cambridge had identified as Cruz supporters actually favored other candidates. The campaign stopped using Cambridge\u2019s data entirely after the South Carolina primary.\u201cWhen they were hired, from the outset it didn\u2019t strike me that they had a wide breadth of experience in the American political landscape,\u201d Mr. Tyler said.Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon were aggressive advocates for Cambridge. When the campaign disputed a $2.5 million invoice, they lit into Mr. Cruz\u2019s senior campaign team during a conference call, according to the consultant. Cambridge Analytica, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon claimed, was the only thing keeping Mr. Cruz afloat. (The company declined to comment on the exchange, as did a personal spokeswoman for Mr. Bannon and the Mercers.)After the Cruz campaign flamed out, Mr. Nix persuaded Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director, Brad Parscale, to try out the firm. Its data products were considered for Mr. Trump\u2019s critical get-out-the-vote operation. But tests showed Cambridge\u2019s data and models were slightly less effective than the existing Republican National Committee system, according to three former Trump campaign aides.Mr. Bannon at one point agreed to expand the company\u2019s role, according to the aides, authorizing Cambridge to oversee a $5 million purchase of television ads. But after some of them appeared on cable channels in Washington, D.C. \u2014 hardly an election battleground \u2014 Cambridge\u2019s involvement in television targeting ended.In postelection conversations with potential clients, Cambridge has promoted itself as the brains behind Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory. One brochure circulated to clients this year, which details Cambridge\u2019s expertise in behavioral targeting, also calls the company\u2019s \u201cpivotal role\u201d in electing Mr. Trump its \u201cbiggest success politically in the United States.\u201dTrump aides, though, said Cambridge had played a relatively modest role, providing personnel who worked alongside other analytics vendors on some early digital advertising and using conventional microtargeting techniques. Later in the campaign, Cambridge also helped set up Mr. Trump\u2019s polling operation and build turnout models used to guide the candidate\u2019s spending and travel schedule. None of those efforts involved psychographics.At a conference in Munich last month, Alexander Tayler, Cambridge\u2019s chief data officer, dodged a question about whether Cambridge would work with far-right parties in European elections this year. He also played down the role of psychological profiling in the company\u2019s work, much of which, Mr. Tayler suggested, is still based on traditional data analytics and marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s not about being sinister,\u201d Mr. Tayler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about tricking people into voting for a candidate who they wouldn\u2019t otherwise support. It\u2019s just about making marketing more efficient.\u201dEven before the election, according to one former employee, Cambridge employees attended sessions about soliciting government business in the United States \u2014 where Mr. Trump now oversees the federal bureaucracy and Mr. Bannon is arguably the White House\u2019s most powerful staff member. According to documents obtained by The Times, SCL is pursuing work for at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Commerce Department and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Mr. Bannon\u2019s spokeswoman said he stepped down from the Cambridge board in August, when he joined the Trump campaign, and \u201chas no financial involvement\u201d with the firm currently. She declined to say whether Mr. Bannon previously held equity in the firm.Late last month, SCL executives met with Pentagon officials who advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff on information warfare. A reference document submitted in advance of that meeting indicates that the company has worked as a subcontractor on roughly a dozen Pentagon projects, many of them \u201ccounter-radicalization\u201d assessments in Pakistan and Yemen.Such intelligence work is the bread and butter of SCL\u2019s government contracting in other countries. And the firm\u2019s experience in trying to influence Muslim sentiment abroad dovetails with Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon\u2019s focus on combating the Islamic State.At the moment, according to former employees, Cambridge has relatively few well-known corporate clients in the United States. Among them are ECI New York, a clothing company, and Goldline, which sells gold coins and markets heavily to listeners of conservative talk radio.A spokesman for MasterCard declined to say if it would do business with Cambridge. The Yankees did not sign on.But Mr. Nix appears to have bigger ambitions. \u201cI think were are on the cusp of something enormous,\u201d he said.Data science is about to reshape marketing, Mr. Nix maintained, and the big advertising conglomerates would survive only by developing their own targeting technology \u2014 or acquiring companies like Cambridge.\u201cThose agencies that don\u2019t adapt will die,\u201d Mr. Nix said.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

Since the top and bottom thirds of this grid had clues that spanned from left to right, there were plenty of supportive crosses that made the solve pretty quick for me.\u25a0 30A: For a Monday, there were musical references from a big generational range. I counted five musicians, active from the 1930s to the present. This guy, \u201cFrank of the Mothers of Invention,\u201d was ZAPPA, a star and musical influence for the middle three decades of this time.\u25a0 66A: For 75 years, this puzzle has used political figures for cluing, and the vast majority of them are used as filler, with short life spans in the pantheon. This one might have had a shot once, \u201cFlorida senator Marco,\u201d but odds are Senator RUBIO will meet the same fate.When I first caught myself idly musing about theme and good fill ideas, I realized I had taken the step from crossword enthusiast to wannabe crossword constructor. Sometime later I determined that the next step was to actually write down some of these ideas.Among those things I wrote down were both BERMUDA TRIANGLE (because who doesn\u2019t love geometry?) and POINT OF NO RETURN, which can pair nicely, and are both 15s, and hey, there exist other types of POINTs that could be mined for more material! The two remaining themers were not too stubborn in coming, and these are the same as those in my original submission, but the original grid was returned to me for a bit of a polish.

{"Headline": "Push for Internet Privacy Rules Moves to Statehouses", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported byNow that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers\u2019 online data. States have other ideas.Illinois legislators are considering a \u201cright to know\u201d bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates.Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers\u2019 locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in internet-connected devices like mobile phones, smart TVs and personal assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo.Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois \u2014 because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of state- and country-specific features to localize their effects.Congressional Republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also assert, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation.Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction.California and Connecticut, for instance, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like email, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees\u2019 social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants.\u201cMore and more, states have taken the position that, if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,\u201d said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said.States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle.In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking to roll back regulations, not create them.But federal blockage can create local opportunities.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts \u2014 not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,\u201d said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it\u2019s going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy.\u201d\u201cI think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,\u201d said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure.Mr. Hastings said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation.In an interview, Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating email lists or giving online support to customers.\u201cHiring attorneys to write privacy policies, coming up with terms of service \u2014 that will be a real burden for small businesses,\u201d he said.\u201cWe were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive,\u201d said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC. \u201cIt\u2019s important because the Trump administration is doing so much to roll back privacy rights, so there is going to be a huge shift to state lawmakers and state attorneys general.\u201dCecilia Kang contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars Can\u2019t Cure Traffic, but Economics Can", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byThe CommuteIt\u2019s easy to get giddy about self-driving cars. Older people and preteens will become more independent and mobile. The scourge of drunken driving will disappear. People will be able to safely play video games while on the freeway to work.But there is one problem autonomous driving is unlikely to solve: the columns of rush-hour gridlock that clog city streets and freeways. If decades of urban planning and economic research are any guide, the solution is unlikely to come from technology but from something similar to Uber\u2019s surge pricing: charging people more to use driverless cars at rush hour.These various technologies share a common theme. One way or another, they promise to expand the nation\u2019s roads \u2014 literally, in the case of Mr. Musk\u2019s tunnels, figuratively, in the case of flying cars, and efficiently, in the case of self-driving ones. While it is possible that one or all of these technologies will increase road capacity to the point at which no amount of traffic will fill them, history gives us reasons to be skeptical.Decades\u2019 worth of studies show that whenever cities add roads, new drivers simply fill them up. This isn\u2019t because of new development or population growth \u2014 although that\u2019s part of the story \u2014 but because of a vicious cycle in which new roads bring new demand that no amount of further roads can satisfy.Economists call this latent demand, which is a fancy way of saying there are always more people who want to drive somewhere than there is space for them to do it. So far anyway, nothing cities have done to increase capacity has ever sped things up.That\u2019s where charging people during busy times comes in. \u201cMaybe autonomous cars will be different from other capacity expansions,\u201d Mr. Turner said. \u201cBut of the things we have observed so far, the only thing that really drives down travel times is pricing.\u201d\u201cThere will be so many cars on the streets, and freight deliveries and buses and everyone else will be so slowed down, that people will get fed up and demand a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have a solution in pricing.\u201dMayor Michael R. Bloomberg met abject failure with his attempt at congestion pricing in New York. Yet London, Singapore and Stockholm have all put in such systems effectively.In the United States, the most common objection is that road pricing is regressive: Rich people get to drive alone while the masses huddle on a bus. Also, people just don\u2019t like paying for things that they are used to having free.\u201cThis idea of congestion pricing is not completely dismissed the way it once was,\u201d said Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Winston said the eventual introduction of self-driving cars would probably lessen consumer opposition to paying more to use roads during peak periods. Ride-hailing apps have taught consumers to accept surge pricing, and people are generally less resistant to paying for something new. The result would be something like variably priced lanes dedicated to fleets of robot vehicles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Since Trump, Quiet Upstate Road Becomes a Busy Exit From U.S.", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Residents of Champlain, N.Y., watch as migrants, both adults and children, use a country road to reach Canada, where they can seek asylum.Supported byCHAMPLAIN, N.Y. \u2014 Roxham Road is a quiet country road jutting off another quiet country road, where a couple of horses munch on soggy hay and a ditch running along the muddy pavement flows with melted snow. It cuts through a thicket of dormant trees, passing a half-dozen trailer homes and after almost a mile runs into a line of boulders and a rusted railing with a sign: Road Closed.Chris Crowningshiele has been driving a cab, on and off, for 30 years in this rural corner of upstate New York known as the North Country. He lives south of here in Plattsburgh, and his fares usually come from ferrying students from a state university there or picking shoppers up at a Walmart in his gray minivan. But in recent weeks, riders have been asking him \u2014 two, three, sometimes as many as seven times a day \u2014 to bring them to the end of Roxham Road.Mr. Crowningshiele picks up passengers in Plattsburgh, mostly at the airport or the bus station, and over the 25-mile drive north, they have told him that they had traveled from across the country. Some were migrants from Yemen and Turkey. They confided that they were fearful, of what was happening in the countries they wanted to leave behind \u2014 not just their homeland but now also the United States \u2014 and of what they faced once they stepped out of Mr. Crowningshiele\u2019s cab.\u201cYou wonder what\u2019s going through their heads, you know?\u201d he said. Many of his passengers have been families, with parents carrying young children and whatever possessions they could take with them.\u201cPeople just want to live their life,\u201d Mr. Crowningshiele, 48, said, \u201cand not be scared.\u201dGiven their proximity to Canada, people around here have always had some awareness of the world beyond the border. A pop music station in Montreal comes through clearly on the radio, and it is not all that unusual to make a run to the other side to shop. But the steady stream of cabs that have started driving up Roxham Road has forced them to reckon with life on the border and decisions made in Washington in ways they never have before.This is not exactly Trump Country. In Clinton County, which includes Champlain, Hillary Clinton eclipsed Mr. Trump by 610 votes. Many residents on Roxham Road said they did not bother to vote and had followed politics just enough to feel disenchanted, if not disgusted.\u201cI used to just blow everything off,\u201d said Melissa Beshaw, whose house is the second to last before the border. \u201cI was never into politics until this road became famous.\u201dShe, like some others, was quick to assign blame to Mr. Trump. Immigration advocates in Canada said the reasons for fleeing were more complicated: The president\u2019s executive order in January on immigration that affected countries that are mostly Muslim was certainly a factor, but so were frustration with the immigration process in general and concern over anti-Muslim rhetoric.Migrants have been coming to places like Roxham Road not because they want to sneak over the border; the expectation is to walk right into the arms of the Canadian authorities. An agreement between the United States and Canada makes it virtually impossible for them to ask for asylum at a legal border crossing; Canadian border officials would have to turn them back. But a technicality allows them to bypass the agreement by illegally setting foot in Canada.\u201cOnce they get arrested, they\u2019re already on Canadian soil,\u201d said Jean-S\u00e9bastien Boudreault, the president of the Quebec Immigration Lawyers Association, \u201cso we have to let them do a refugee claim.\u201dJust after a gentle rain let up on a recent afternoon, a blue Prius with a yellow taxi sign perched on its roof approached the border.A husband and wife got out. He loaded on a backpack, a duffel bag and several shopping bags. She carried a young boy. The couple declined to speak with a reporter, though the man said they were Turkish. The family was the second spotted arriving that day on Roxham Road, with at least two other cabs coming later. By the count of the people living on the road, it was a slow day. Almost 20 people had come the day before.As the family approached the border, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told them it was not legal for them to enter here. If they continued, he said, they would be arrested.\u201cI apologize about this,\u201d the man replied, his voice unsure, \u201cbut I have to break your rules.\u201dHe paused.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe couple hopped across a narrow, mucky creek that divides the two countries. A Canadian officer gently grabbed the woman\u2019s left arm as she held her son in the crook of her right arm, helping her up.Lawyers said families like this one were usually taken to immigration offices at the nearest legal border crossing, where they can officially ask for asylum. If they have identification and do not appear to pose a security threat, the lawyers said, they are typically released and given a bus ticket to Montreal, where they wait for a hearing on their refugee status. Many of them are staying at a Y.M.C.A. there.The border crossings, despite being freighted with emotion, happen quickly and can seem almost procedural, occurring over and over every day in recent weeks.Tony George Hogle Sr. has lived on Roxham Road for almost 25 years, moving in when it was still a strip of dirt. He said that years ago the road had been an official crossing. He certainly has noticed the pickup in traffic recently. He has seen people left at the intersection, forced to drag their suitcases a mile through the snow. His sleep apnea keeps him awake, he said, and he has seen taxis creeping up the road in the dead of night.Mr. Hogle did not vote in November and said he was \u201cleery\u201d of Mr. Trump. On some counts, he said, the president is \u201cdoing all right.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises about the economy and bringing back jobs had some appeal. There are some jobs around here, mostly in warehouses, Mr. Hogle said, but he wished there was better-paying work. He used to be a forklift driver in a warehouse before a medical condition left him on disability. His wife works at a gas station and at a discount store.\u201cI think what he set out to do, he\u2019s doing,\u201d Mr. Hogle, 54, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of his word.\u201dHe understood the president\u2019s motivation in pursuing his immigration policies, but the situation at his own doorstep made him question the \u201cway he went about it.\u201d\u201cI can see his point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to protect the United States. It\u2019s hard. Some are good. Not everybody\u2019s bad. Just like the white man \u2014 you have good ones and you have bad ones. There should be something better than this.\u201dAcross the street from Mr. Hogle, Matthew Turner said the influx had been unsettling. \u201cI\u2019m not O.K. with it,\u201d he said of the border crossings, \u201cbut I definitely can\u2019t blame them.\u201d He recently discovered the lock on his shed had been tampered with and worried that border security was not tight enough.\u201cI used to hunt along the border,\u201d said Parker Cashman, who was staying with Mr. Turner, \u201cand there\u2019s too many places where it\u2019s too easy to cross.\u201d\u201cMaybe we need to build a wall!\u201d Mr. Turner replied, jokingly. \u201cHave Canada pay for it!\u201dHe pointed out that Roxham Road can be hard to find. Until recently, if you typed it into Google Maps, the pinpoint landed on a roadway on the other side of the border. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like this road doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Mr. Turner, a 21-year-old warehouse worker.It is unclear how the border hoppers, as some call them, first found Roxham Road. There are moments when residents are frustrated by it, like the day when local television stations discovered what was happening and came out with their satellite trucks. But, mostly, they sympathize with the people passing through.Ms. Beshaw, who stays at home to raise two grandsons in her custody, said she had never had a conversation or even shared a word with the migrants. But she has watched as the taxis arrive again and again, and she sees the passengers, especially the children, getting out and trudging through rain, snow and bitter cold.\u201cI don\u2019t feel sorry for the adults as much as the kids,\u201d she said. Still, she understands their motivation. \u201cAll they want is a life like what we have,\u201d she said.Ms. Beshaw also wishes that life for her would return to how it was just a few weeks ago. \u201cIt was a quiet road,\u201d she said wistfully.As dusk settled in, dogs could be heard yapping through the woods, and Ms. Beshaw\u2019s grandsons pedaled around on their bicycles, chasing each other.Before long, darkness blanketed the trees and stars freckled the vast country sky. All was quiet on Roxham Road, except for the babbling water in the ditch. Still, just over the border, Mounties were posted on a muddy hill, waiting for the next car to arrive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Classic Watch, TAG Heuer Turns Back Time at Baselworld Fair", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byOn TimeThis week, the pedigreed Swiss watchmaker again turned heads at Baselworld, but this time, it did so by looking back a half-century.Instead of scouring auctions and spending five figures for an actual piece from the Kennedy era, TAG fans can secure a faithful rendition of a watch made famous by auto racing legends like Mario Andretti and Jochen Rindt for $5,150 (on a leather strap) or $5,300 (on a stainless steel bracelet).Fans of the brand will most likely be pleased to see the meticulous period detailing on this new 55th anniversary model \u2014 most notably the so-called reverse panda dial featuring three white subdials on a black dial, a coveted retro design feature often found on vintage Rolex Daytonas that fetch $40,000 or more.Then again, fans already are sold on this retro Autavia, it seems. This model was born of a marketing stunt last year called the Autavia Cup, in which the company, led by the chief executive Jean-Claude Biver, one of the industry\u2019s most colorful showmen, polled more than 50,000 TAG fans to see which of 16 vintage Autavia models they would like to see brought back.The Autavia \u201cRindt,\u201d which harks back to the first sports chronograph created by Jack Heuer, the fourth generation head of the company, won going away.Sure, vintage snobs will have to put up with a few conspicuous nods toward modernization. The new Autavia is plainly brawnier than the original, with a 42 millimeter case, rather than 39 millimeters. Some purists might be aghast to see the addition of a date window, although this one is artfully hidden down around 6 o\u2019clock.But in the trade-off, buyers of the modern version also get the new, self-winding Heuer-02 caliber proprietary chronograph movement, an 80-hour power reserve and water resistance to 100 meters.So, no, the new Autavia is not the latest smartwatch. It is merely a very smart watch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Selfie With Merkel by Refugee Became a Legal Case, but Facebook Won in German Court", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byW\u00dcRZBURG, Germany \u2014 A Syrian refugee whose image showed up in fake news reports linking him to terrorism lost a closely watched case in Germany on Tuesday that sought to prevent Facebook from allowing users to repost the picture.The case, one of several against Facebook in Germany, was viewed as an important indicator of how the country\u2019s stringent laws on personal privacy will be applied to social media companies. It also raised questions about whether those companies should be treated as data providers, and whether they should follow stricter media laws or even new legislation.The rise of fake news and populist propaganda has prompted broader concerns ahead of German elections in September. A government-led task force, which includes representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter, is looking into how such companies deal with posts deemed hateful.In the case on Tuesday, Judge Volkmar Seipel ruled that there were no grounds for an injunction because Facebook had not in any way manipulated the content, which would have made it legally responsible for the distribution. The judge added that a host provider, according to the European Union\u2019s electronic commerce laws, could be held responsible for eliminating content from its site only when it was considered technically possible.Facebook had argued that it was not possible to search the entire contents of its site. Mr. Modamani\u2019s lawyer disagreed. \u201cThis question was disputed by the parties and could not be clarified in the hearing,\u201d the judge said, suggesting it could be answered in a separate trial if pursued.Mr. Modamani, who lives in Berlin, was not present at Tuesday\u2019s announcement and declined to comment on the ruling. His lawyer, Chan-jo Jun, said that although some of the altered images remained available on Facebook, the attention the trial generated had resulted in a drop in threats against Mr. Modamani since late December.Mr. Jun, however, arrived at the court flanked by two police officers. He said the security detail had been ordered after an anonymous call several weeks earlier in which the person threatened to murder him and cited information that Mr. Jun said only an insider could have known.\u201cWe learned a lot from this case,\u201d Mr. Jun said after the ruling. \u201cPeople have learned that Mr. Modamani is not a terrorist. We lawyers have learned that we cannot help victims of libel and slander with the laws we have. But we have learned which laws have to be changed.\u201dThe post remains in circulation on Facebook, although Mr. Jun said that he had reported it as recently as Monday through the channels the company provides. In response to a request to take down the photograph, Facebook replied that it did not violate user guidelines, the lawyer said.\u201cWe appreciate that this is a very difficult situation for Mr. Modamani,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cRegarding the ruling, we are pleased that the court shares our view that the legal action initiated was not merited or the most effective way to resolve the situation.\u201d\u201cWe quickly disabled access to content that has been accurately reported to us by Mr. Modamani\u2019s legal representatives,\u201d the statement added, \u201cand will continue to respond quickly to valid reports of the content at issue from Mr. Modamani\u2019s legal representatives.\u201dMr. Jun had previously tried to file a separate suit against Facebook for violating a German law that prohibits publication of seditious comments by extremists. A court in Hamburg rejected that suit last year, but a court in Munich is examining it.Mr. Jun said that one goal of the trial was \u201cto find out and demonstrate whether it is possible, under existing laws and Facebook\u2019s approach to compliance, to effectively protect personal privacy.\u201dThe German Constitution guarantees a right to the \u201cfree development of the individual,\u201d which is understood to include the right to personal privacy and to determine the extent to which a person appears in public. Mr. Jun has argued that Facebook is failing to uphold German law, instead adhering only to its own guidelines.The case also demonstrated the complications involved in applying rules in a digital era.Judge Seipel was not clear, at first, of some of the basic social media terminology. He asked for clarification about the difference between \u201cviewing,\u201d or seeing something posted to the platform, and \u201csharing,\u201d when people distribute another person\u2019s content to their own networks, increasing the number of viewers.In Mr. Modamani\u2019s case, such information was crucial, as simply erasing the original version of the disputed image would not ensure that it could no longer be found elsewhere on the platform.Lawyers for Facebook said in February that they did not possess a \u201cwonder machine\u201d capable of recognizing and immediately blocking every reproduction of Mr. Modamani\u2019s image. Mr. Jun rejected that defense as \u201cridiculous.\u201dGermany has been struggling with how to apply laws on personal privacy to social media giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter.On Monday, an administrative court in Bremen handed down a suspended sentence of six months and two weeks to a man who had insulted refugees on his Facebook page. That case concerned the posting of hateful comments on the platform, but it did not involve Facebook itself.The Justice Ministry is expected to announce in the coming weeks its guidelines for dealing with hate speech on social media and for preventing its proliferation. The report comes after more than a year of round-table talks involving the ministry and representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter.Advertisement"}

More than 230,000 Legacy plates have been issued as of late December, according to the agency.For the second-most popular, the \u201cKids\u201d plate featuring a handprint, the figure is roughly 91,000. At third is the whale tail with about 67,000.Mike Gatto, a former state assemblyman who spearheaded the introduction of the Legacy plate, said that in part he wanted do a nice thing for classic car enthusiasts who cringe at the sight of out-of-period license plates.But the appeal seems to be far broader.David Lacey, a license plate collector based in Novato, said he rarely saw the Legacy plates on cars from the time period of the original release, 1963 to 1969. (Classic car owners much prefer the actual originals). \u201cInstead I see that plate on 2017, 2016, 2015 vehicles,\u201d he said.He suggested nostalgia could play a role, or perhaps it\u2019s just the pared-down design.\u201cMost of the plates that come out nowadays are graphic intensive and you actually lose the alphanumeric characters in the background,\u201d said Mr. Lacey, 67. \u201cThis plate is kind of just in your face with, \u2018I\u2019m just a license plate.\u2019\u201dGetting new designs approved is not easy. They must wind through the Legislature, then collect at least 7,500 pre-orders within a year. (Designs can also be requested with the sponsorship of a state agency).Today, there are three in the pre-order phase.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)There is more than $8 billion just sitting in the unclaimed property fund run by California.Some of it could be yours.The state controller requires that banks, insurers and other companies turn over customers\u2019 property after three years of account inactivity.It comes in the form of stock dividends, tax refunds, wages \u2014 even the contents of safe deposit boxes.The controller\u2019s office says more than 32 million individuals and businesses in its database have unclaimed property. (I plugged in my name and found an old $20 bank balance.)California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C. Berkeley.An earlier version of this article omitted a method for requesting new specialty license plates. They can be requested through the sponsorship of state agencies, not only through acts of the Legislature. The article also misstated the number of specialty plates currently in the pre-order phase.

{"Headline": "Who Needs Another Cancer?", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byLiving With Cancer\u201cNo thanks, I already have cancer,\u201d I said to the radiologist. Since the magnified images of calcifications in my right breast looked neither obviously benign nor obviously malignant, he had just recommended a biopsy. Even after I explained that I have been dealing with advanced ovarian cancer since 2008, he must have judged me daft. But I was thinking: Who needs another?Of course, my oncologist insisted that I go ahead. Afterward, I fulminated: If men had breasts, breast biopsies would be less ghastly. I realize I was floating the proposition as an \u201calternative fact\u201d \u2014 in my case, a conviction fueled by infantile rage. My friend Alexandra, who accompanied me, waited until our return home to confide that she had fainted during her biopsy. \u201cVery common,\u201d a nurse informed her.Breast biopsies come in several varieties. Mine was a stereotactic core needle biopsy. Beforehand, the doctors described what it would entail, but they failed to convey how grueling it would be.I was positioned in a chair \u2014 the technician called it a \u201cprincess throne\u201d \u2014 placed before a device that appeared exactly like ye olde mammogram machine. There I was prodded and repositioned \u2014 can you press in your chest, turn your head to the left, lower it, move your torso to the right? \u2014 while my admittedly small breast was laid out like a filet on a tray and then squeezed tight between two flat panels, first horizontally and then vertically. I was instructed to embrace the machine with my right arm and rest my chin on one of its ledges.The contraption and I were more entangled than I had ever been with my nursing babies, while my sandwiched breast was penciled and I was told repeatedly to stop breathing for pictures. All this, before the biopsy began.Extreme physical discomfort was punctuated by extreme gratitude for the technician, Kim. She explained that I would be numbed, that I should tell her if there was any sharp sensation so the doctors could increase the medication, that I would hear a \u201cwhish\u201d like the jet into the eye during a glaucoma exam. It was essential to stay as still as possible. Placing a cloth beneath my chin, she was careful about the port implanted in my chest, just above my right breast. Beyond my line of vision, the two doctors started digging to extract bits from inside my body, as Kim placed her hand on my arm.Neither my position nor the extractions would rate high on the pain scale, but the contorted immobilization over 45 minutes made me wary of my fortitude. When Kim left the room to check if samples of the calcifications had been retrieved, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go on much longer.\u201dDuring my friend Alexandra\u2019s biopsy, the technician returned at this point to ask for more tissue extractions \u2014 and that was when she fainted.But in my case, the initial samples were O.K. and the biopsy done, except for a few \u201clight mammograms\u201d and the insertion of a titanium clip to mark the site for future scans. It was a relief when my breast was freed, the throne rolled away from the machinery and lowered to a reclining position.As one of the doctors swabbed the wounded area to apply a bandage, I asked if I could help hold some gauze in place. But he rejected my offer, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sterile.\u201d \u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d I murmured as we all laughed in relief.I spent the next day reading a depressing novel about depression. At least that is not my problem, I thought, ticking through a list of reasons to be optimistic. First, I take daily pills in a clinical trial that has kept my ovarian cancer at bay for three and a half years \u2014 surely they would help fend off other cancers, too. Second, lightning does not strike twice. Third, my mother died with her breasts. Fourth, I have avoided the color pink, except on days I need to show solidarity.When the phone rang, it was a woman explaining that she had overseen the procedure, the results were in, and was this a good time to talk?Receiving the \u201cbest possible\u201d of bad outcomes, I considered Rose Kushner, who was a pioneering breast cancer educator back in the \u201970s. She protested the radical Halsted operation as well as the \u201cone-step\u201d approach to breast cancer then standard practice: a tumor biopsy and mastectomy performed in a single operation while the patient was under anesthesia. In 1975, Ms. Kushner was booed off the stage at the meeting of the Society of Surgical Oncology, which was then predominantly male. However, in 1990 the society, which by then had more female members, posthumously honored her with one of its most distinguished awards.The pressure Ms. Kushner and many activists following in her footsteps exerted has produced regimens that empower patients to make the sort of informed decisions I will have to ponder in the days ahead. Their interventions have also shaped the training of compassionate technicians like Kim.Procedures for early detection of breast cancer certainly need to be improved. However, they work better than those for other types of cancer. We have seen some progress, I thought as my heart clenched at what the past has wrought and what the future might bring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inquiry Opens Into How a Network of Marines Shared Illicit Images of Female Peers", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported bySome photographs show female Marines posing topless in their dress uniform slacks, or with their camouflage blouses open, in pictures they thought would forever be secret. Others show private moments swiped from their personal social media sites.In one photograph, surreptitiously taken in February, a female corporal from Camp Lejeune, in North Carolina, is shown bent over from behind. The image, once posted online, was flooded with derogatory comments, including suggestions that she should be raped.Now the Defense Department has opened a criminal investigation and the Marine Corps is facing its latest unwanted controversy after it was revealed over the weekend that a secret online Facebook group of active-duty and veteran Marines shared thousands of naked and private photos of Marine Corps women.The invitation-only group, called Marines United and made up of more than 30,000 active duty Marines and veterans, built online dossiers on Marine women without their knowledge or consent, listing dozens of women\u2019s names, ranks, social media handles and where they are stationed.The Marine Corps quickly condemned the all-male group, saying in a statement on Sunday that Marines United\u2019s conduct \u201cdestroys morale, erodes trust and degrades the individual.\u201d The Naval Criminal Investigation service has opened an investigation, and the Marine Corps said that any Marine who \u201cdirectly participates in, encourages or condones\u201d illicit activity could face court-martial. The Marine Corps declined to say how many Marines were being investigated.One of the victims of the group was Marisa Woytek, a Marine lance corporal serving at Camp Pendleton, who had photos taken from her Instagram account and posted to the group. She was alerted by friends and sent a screen shot.\u201cThey were nothing scandalous, just me saying good morning,\u201d Corporal Woytek said in an interview. \u201cBut the comments went just as far toward sexual assault and rape and degrading as your imagination can go.\u201d\u201cI love the Marine Corps,\u201d she added. \u201cBut after seeing that, I wouldn\u2019t re-enlist.\u201dSeveral Marines said the Marines United postings are an evolution of a retaliatory practice called \u201cmake her famous.\u201d Marines would share nude photographs of girlfriends or spouses they believed were cheating through text messages to a broad swath of people, encouraging them to forward the photos.Jason Elsdon, a Marine in his early 40s, who said he was a member of Marines United and said he played no role in posting, organizing or disseminating the photographs, argued that people were overreacting. \u201cIt was just nudes,\u201d he said. \u201cI scrolled past it.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s right, but I don\u2019t feel that people should be utterly surprised that it is happening. There are other groups, and many are civilians, that are the same way.\u201dHe defended the larger mission of the group and the web page, which is a grab bag of military news and humor, saying it provided needed support. He cited instances in which servicemen were contemplating suicide and the page would \u201clight up\u201d with people who wanted to help.But many Marines have pushed back against the idea that crude behavior is intrinsic to their identity.\u201cThat is absolute nonsense,\u201d said Maj. Clark Carpenter, a Marine Corps spokesman. \u201cA true warrior carries himself with a sense of decency and compassion, but is always ready for the fight,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who hide in the dark corners of the internet with a shield of anonymity and purport to be warriors are nothing of the sort \u2014 they are nothing more than cowards.\u201dStill, the Marine Corps leadership has never fully rid the Corps of its rough ethos, and in recent years it has been hit with a number of scandals when this mentality broke into the open, including allegations that commanders retaliated against women who reported sexual assaults and recent reports that drill instructors hazed recruits, especially Muslims.The Marine Corps is also the military branch that has put up the stiffest resistance to opening combat jobs to women, with several high-ranking Marines saying the move could hurt combat effectiveness. A small group of women joined combat units in January.Women in the Marine Corps say the culture has been hostile to them for years.\u201cWhen I was in Iraq, I always carried a can of black spray paint to cover up what was written about me in the port-a-johns,\u201d said Kate Hendricks Thomas, a Marine veteran who is now a professor of behavioral health at Charleston Southern University. \u201cI tried to laugh it off, but the harassment is so pervasive that it can have a real effect.\u201dMarines United collected thousands of photos that appeared to be a mix of private photos shared by former partners and images taken from personal accounts.

These types of actions dishonor their names and the entire Marine Corps,\u201d Mr. Albert said in an interview.Facebook took down the page temporarily for violating a ban on nudity after the complaint, Mr. Albert said, but the group apparently got around restrictions on nudity by shifting photos to a shared Google file.Marine Corps officials, alerted to the site by Mr. Brennan, contacted Google and had the files removed.Since publishing the story, Mr. Brennan said he and his family had received death threats from members of the group. He charged that one member was offering \u201c500 bucks for nudes\u201d of Mr. Brennan\u2019s wife and said he was \u201ccooperating with multiple law enforcement agencies\u201d regarding threats to him and his family.\u201cI\u2019m no angel. I have deployed just like these Marines. I\u2019ve sat around a fire in Afghanistan and shared that dark, dark Marine humor. In ways, that humor has healing properties. But this is different.

{"Headline": "When a Basic Laptop Will Do: Our Top Budget Picks", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byAsk The WirecutterEver since the advent of the iPhone and iPad, some people have been using their laptops a lot less. It made me wonder if I need one at all. So I asked Kimber Streams, who tests laptops at The Wirecutter, a product reviews website owned by The New York Times, for some advice.For people who basically use their laptop to browse the web and send email, is there a cheap option?With a Chromebook, can I use all the Google apps and store documents and spreadsheets on Google Drive?Yes. Google\u2019s apps (which I use all the time for work) can open spreadsheets and documents, including those created in Microsoft Office. And most Chromebooks come with 100 gigabytes of free Google Drive storage for two years. Chromebooks encourage people to store documents in the cloud, because the machines have very little local storage (usually about 32 gigabytes).Microsoft also offers Office 365, a way to access Word, Excel and such on the web, if you need to use those particular programs.What\u2019s the cheapest Chromebook to buy and what do you recommend?There are $200 Chromebooks, but we don\u2019t recommend them because they usually have two gigabytes of memory and poor processors, which means you can\u2019t have more than a couple of tabs open and everything loads very slowly. They\u2019re truly painful to use, even for light browsing.I always wondered why these things can\u2019t run the apps that can run on phones, so I can do more things with them.Well, Google\u2019s working on that! But it\u2019s pretty rough around the edges right now. Google perpetually updates Chrome OS, so it\u2019s possible apps will improve over the next couple of years.When I buy a laptop, do I still need to be concerned about specs?Yes, but only a little bit.Right now, a Chromebook shouldn\u2019t have fewer than four gigabytes of memory, and a Celeron processor. A Windows laptop for everyday work needs at least eight gigs, and we recommend a Core i3 or Core i5 processor and a solid-state drive. For gaming or video editing, you\u2019ll need 16 gigabytes of memory, at least a Core i5 or i7 processor, a dedicated graphics card and a solid-state drive.Processors aren\u2019t improving as quickly as before, so any of the past few generations are fine, as long as they\u2019re Core i processors.If I still need a real laptop, what should I be thinking about? Do you even recommend the best cheap Windows machine?If you have only $500 to spend, then the cheap Windows laptop is your only option. It\u2019ll do everything you need it to, but it\u2019s large, bulky and has poor quality.In fact, my mom is shopping for a laptop right now, and that\u2019s the one I told her to buy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intel Buys Mobileye in $15.3 Billion Bid to Lead Self-Driving Car Market", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byIn the world of driverless cars, household names like Google and Uber have raced ahead of rivals, building test vehicles and starting trials on city streets.But when it comes to what is under the hood, an array of lesser-known companies will most likely supply the technology required to bring driverless cars to the masses. And in a $15.3 billion deal announced on Monday, Intel moved to corner the market on how much of that technology is developed.The chip maker\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles, is one of the largest in the fast-growing sector and sets the stage for increasing competition between Silicon Valley giants as well as traditional automakers over who will dominate the world of autonomous cars.The likes of Google and Uber have already invested billions of dollars in their own technology, signing partnerships with automakers like Chrysler and Volvo and sending test vehicles onto the road in a bid to cement their place in the industry. The sector is estimated to be worth $25 billion annually by 2025, according to Bain & Company, a consulting firm.Faced with an existential threat to its legacy computer business, Intel \u2014 alongside competitors like Qualcomm \u2014 has focused on autonomous cars as a new and potentially lucrative market. Many of these driverless vehicles, experts say, will require immense computing power, including the latest microchips able to crunch reams of data in seconds to keep the cars safe, and on the road.And by acquiring Mobileye, whose digital vision technology helps autonomous vehicles safely navigate city streets, Intel aims to broaden its offerings beyond just chips to a wider suite of products that driverless vehicles will require. It hopes, as a result, to appeal to automakers that want to offer autonomous driving but lack the in-house expertise and do not want to rely on the likes of Google.\u201cScale is going to win in this market,\u201d Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s chief executive, told investors on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that every carmaker can invest to do independent development into autonomous cars.\u201dIntel has a history with such strategic moves. It cornered the personal computer market over more than three decades, supplying hundreds of millions of desktop computers with much of their internal architecture, after dominating which microchips were used in the industry. But in recent years, Intel has struggled to find its feet as people\u2019s habits have increasingly turned to the mobile world, where the company\u2019s chips have lost out to rivals.Mobileye, founded in Jerusalem in 1999, has signed deals with several automakers, including Audi, for the use of its vision and camera technology, which uses machine learning and complex neuroscience to help drivers \u2014 and increasingly cars themselves \u2014 avoid obstacles on the road.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.As that collaboration grew, Intel and Mobileye executives began talking about a potential takeover at the end of December, holding meetings, mostly in New York, to complete a deal in which Mobileye\u2019s executives would take the lead in new expanded efforts.\u201cThis deal makes Intel a Tier 1 partner for the automotive industry,\u201d said Martin Birkner, an automotive analyst at Gartner, a technology research company in Munich. \u201cAs the industry moves toward autonomous driving, new types of digital suppliers like Intel are developing quickly.\u201dIntel\u2019s efforts to stamp a claim on driverless cars represents a recognition that chip-making rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm had moved slightly ahead in the race to provide the computing power needed for autonomous vehicles.As part of the deal, Intel said it would buy Mobileye\u2019s outstanding shares at $63.54 a share, a 34 percent premium to Mobileye\u2019s closing price on Friday. The acquisition requires shareholder and regulatory approval, and is expected to close by the end of this year.Much of Intel\u2019s success will depend on Amnon Shashua, Mobileye\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer, who has a doctorate in brain and cognitive sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Part of Mr. Shashua\u2019s plan is to have cars with Mobileye\u2019s advanced driver assist systems collect imaging and location data that can be used to create what the company calls RoadBook \u2014 a vast digital map of roadways in the United States and Europe.The goal, Mr. Shashua said, is to provide carmakers with a complete product line of digital services that go beyond what they can do for themselves.Still, experts say autonomous cars are unlikely to hit the roads by the end of the decade, at the earliest, because regulators are beginning to question which rules such cars should follow and because of struggles to make the technology work seamlessly.Still, with technology companies and global automakers making hefty \u2014 and costly \u2014 bets on autonomous cars, experts that say more deals like Intel\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye are likely to follow as firms jostle for position.More acquisitions, said Mr. Birkner of Gartner, \u201care an absolute necessity.\u201d\u201cCarmakers and Silicon Valley companies,\u201d he said, \u201care realizing that they both bring different skills to the table.\u201dNeal E.

{"Headline": "Tech Roundup: Why Regulation Benefits (Yes, Benefits) Electric Cars", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byBitsA common piece of wisdom in business circles is that regulation is bad and stifles innovation.\u201cThere are lots of reasons for this, but one above all: The whole industry is being pushed by regulation, both at the federal level and in the nine states that have adopted a zero-emission plan created by regulators in California,\u201d Mr. Manjoo writes.Not surprisingly, many auto companies disagree with that sentiment, arguing that gradual acceptance of the technology and more affordable prices have contributed to the cars\u2019 popularity.So what prompted the initial investments? There is a theory: Regulations prodded companies to invest in technologies they might otherwise have ignored. This led to the commercialization of the technology.Would shifts in technology occur if companies did not get a shove? Sure. But regulation can force change to happen more quickly than if it were left to the market.More tech news:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel\u2019s $15 Billion Gamble on Self-Driving", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsIntel has put the self-driving pedal to the financial metal.Mobileye specializes in helping cars see what is around them. Intel makes high-performance chips and runs data centers. Combining the two should mean better design systems that are aware of their surroundings, crunch huge amounts of data and react on the fly.Intel estimates that the market for vehicle systems, data and services will be $70 billion in 2030. While that is an absurdly long time frame for a financial prediction, the eventual amount could easily be far higher. The fast-expanding ability of computers to make sense of the world by sight will probably create undreamed-of markets.Intel\u2019s chief executive, Brian Krzanich is, at least, leaving Mobileye\u2019s Ziv Aviram in charge, parking the $167 billion chip-maker\u2019s self-driving unit in its new acquisition\u2019s garage.The financial justification for the deal, though, is a stretch. The $175 million of expected cost cuts carry a present value of around $1 billion once taxed, discounted and capitalized. That is a country mile from the roughly $4 billion premium that Intel is paying.That leaves Mr. Krzanich and his shareholders relying on Mobileye\u2019s stunning growth continuing. Revenue is running at a 45 percent annual clip, while its operating margin of around 35 percent in recent quarters could hit 60 percent in the coming years, according to the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts.Intel will need to sustain these for five years before the deal starts earning close to Intel\u2019s cost of capital. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet and a slew of other firms are gunning for the market. That leaves plenty of chances for a wrench to end up in the works.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Small Table Maker Takes On Alibaba\u2019s Flood of Fakes", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 From his desk in a downtown workshop, Greg Hankerson is at war with a Chinese company half a world away.One recent day, Mr. Hankerson fired up his web browser to scan for counterfeits. Several Taobao shops sell copies of various Vintage Industrial tables, including one with A-shaped legs and another with a glass top and propeller-like base, as well as cabinets and a metal locker.\u201cIt just keeps going and going and going,\u201d Mr. Hankerson, 45, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to pick weeds on a 70-acre farm.\u201dBut Mr. Hankerson wants to know why Alibaba doesn\u2019t do more to defeat counterfeiting, which damages the very same small businesses Mr. Ma says he intends to aid.Mr. Ma \u201cis making himself look like someone you can trust,\u201d Mr. Hankerson said. But, he added, his company is selling counterfeit products.That leaves many businesses, big and small, wondering why it has such a hard time finding fakes on its sites. Its online system for reporting counterfeits, many say, is cumbersome and prone to hiccups. Against one of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms, Mr. Hankerson employs his iMac, $74-a-month image-searching software, his phone and a lot of time \u2014 sometimes, he says, 12 hours a day.Yet if he doesn\u2019t invest the effort, he worries that a flood of cut-rate replicas could undermine the future of his business. Shops on Alibaba \u2014 shops that sometimes sell outside China \u2014 offer their copies at a fraction of Mr. Hankerson\u2019s prices. One Taobao store sold a version of his A-frame table, with a starting price of $5,295, for $24.\u201cIf this gets out of hand, people are going to be able to buy our stuff for next to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be devastating for us.\u201dAlibaba has long faced accusations that its sales platforms are a haven for fakes, and big organizations have been effective at bringing the problem to the fore.In a report submitted to the U.S.T.R. in October, Alibaba boasted about the technology and resources it uses to clean counterfeits from its platforms. The company says its systems are powerful enough to scan 10 million product listings each day. As a result, Alibaba said, it proactively removed 380 million suspect product listings in one 12-month period.\u201cThere are few companies (indeed, none, to our knowledge) that have taken the combination of steps Alibaba has taken, and has concrete plans to take, and certainly none that have put in place measures on the scale of Alibaba\u2019s,\u201d the company told the U.S.T.R.Alibaba also argues that many of the complaints against it are unfair. Counterfeiting and piracy are widespread in the Chinese economy. As private businesspeople, Mr. Ma and his team cannot shut down the culprits producing fake goods.Additionally, Alibaba suggests that it has been made into a scapegoat. In a statement in December, the company protested that the U.S.T.R. decision \u201cleads us to question whether the U.S.T.R. acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate\u201d \u2014 presumably referring to heightened anti-China sentiment amid last year\u2019s United States presidential election.The U.S.T.R. and industry experts contend that there is a lot more Alibaba could and should be doing to tackle fakes.\u201cThey are a leading technology company,\u201d said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, which represents many brands hurt by counterfeiting. \u201cIt is our hope that they use this technology to develop solutions and make sure those solutions are available for everybody.\u201dFor small enterprises, fighting fakes on Alibaba\u2019s sites \u201ccan become expensive, it can become frustrating, it can take time away from your sales, marketing and other creative endeavors,\u201d Mr. Lamar said.An Alibaba spokesman said that suggestions that small businesses do not get its attention are \u201cfalse\u201d and that they can qualify for the streamlined process if their submissions prove reliable. He added that its process for removing suspect listings is in place to address the large number of fraudulent claims the firm receives.\u201cThere are places that our systems can be improved to make them more effective, efficient and user-friendly,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are working hard every day to make these improvements a reality.\u201dMichelle Stennett, 38, a jewelry maker in Suwanee, Ga., found out counterfeiters had stolen her designs during a trip to Yiwu in eastern China in 2012 to buy supplies. Upon returning home, Ms. Stennett scoured Alibaba.com \u2014 an Alibaba platform that sells around the world \u2014 and discovered shop after shop selling copies of her wares.She first tried contacting the stores directly, ordering them to take down the offending goods. Some complied, but others didn\u2019t. Next she filed a couple of complaints to Alibaba, asking the firm to remove the copies. Although those were successful, she quickly realized that the scale of the problem and the paperwork Alibaba required were too much for her to handle as a one-person business.\u201cThere was no way I could go through the process,\u201d she said. There were \u201ctoo many.\u201dDespondent, Ms. Stennett said she stopped making jewelry for nearly a year. \u201cIf someone is going to take my design and mass-produce it, it is hard for me to compete with them,\u201d she said. When she resumed, in 2013, she decided to source her components only from American suppliers, hoping to make it harder for counterfeiters to replicate her products.Now Ms. Stennett rarely checks Alibaba, afraid of what she\u2019ll find. After a quick search of Alibaba.com one day in March, she spotted an image of one of her pendants, which she reported to Alibaba. It is no longer on the platform, but she said she still does not have time to hunt for fakes.\u201cYou\u2019re losing out on money,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause time is money.\u201dAlibaba did not respond to a request for comment on Ms. Stennett\u2019s predicament.Last year, a friend told her that she had found her designs being sold by a store in Australia. Confused, Ms. Long contacted the proprietor, who informed her she had purchased the clothing on Alibaba.com and had no idea the designs were originally from Reignland. Ms. Long looked at the Alibaba shop and was shocked to find a picture of her own son, one of the models in her promotional material, being used to peddle fakes of her clothing.Ms. Long did not know she could ask Alibaba for assistance in removing these counterfeits. Instead, she contacted several shops, which, in some cases, have cooperated and removed the offending products. But Ms. Long blames the spread of copies from Alibaba for the sudden decline in sales of one of her best-selling products, a pair of children\u2019s pants.A few months ago, she had been selling about 30 a week, she said. Now, she moves only five a month.Mr. Hankerson had worked at his father\u2019s financial firm and in I.T. services, building websites, before he began tinkering with furniture.He unexpectedly started Vintage in 2009, when his wife said she wanted a new patio table. Mr. Hankerson hammered one together and posted a picture on a website. He began making more tables and advertising them on the internet, too. \u201cI loved the experience so much that I just wanted to make a better table,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a mad artist.\u201dToday, the Vintage factory is abuzz with the sounds of welding, sawing and hammering. There is one nod to modern automation \u2014 a recently acquired computerized steel-cutting machine \u2014 but much of the manufacturing is done by specially trained employees with woodworking or metalworking skills.While his business was quickly growing, Mr. Hankerson had no idea counterfeiters were profiting off his work as well.He first learned he had a problem in 2014, when he spotted an advertisement on Facebook that included a photo of one of his A-frame tables. He contacted the seller, who said she had bought the merchandise from elsewhere. Intrigued and worried, Mr. Hankerson began searching for images of his designs using Google, and he discovered many of them around the web.\u201cYou would find one image, and you go and look at their catalog on Alibaba, and there\u2019s another and another and another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going down the rabbit hole.\u201dMany shops promote these fakes with pictures lifted from Mr. Hankerson\u2019s own website. One photo bouncing around Taobao features a Vintage console with framed snapshots of Mr. Hankerson and his family still hanging on the wall above it.Some Taobao sellers admit they get their designs from Mr. Hankerson. Liao Xiaoting, a customer service provider at Shang Jie Crafts Company, said her firm\u2019s designers use them as \u201creference\u201d to make their own furniture, with changes, mainly to the materials.Huang Geqing, proprietor of a Taobao shop called Creative Iron Factory, said that he copies Vintage\u2019s designs, manufactures replicas in Fujian province in eastern China, and uses Mr. Hankerson\u2019s photos to promote his own products. He first found Vintage\u2019s designs marketed on other Taobao stores, then traced them back to the original source.Mr. Huang estimates 100 shops may be selling fakes of Mr. Hankerson\u2019s furniture. The style \u201cis quite popular in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can make something exactly like it.\u201dMr. Hankerson said he had no idea how many of these fakes can be found outside of China. Though some of these likely counterfeits have been on Taobao, which has primarily Chinese users, he has also spotted them on the globally focused Alibaba.com.One furniture maker in India, Raja Rani Art Handicrafts, said two pieces of furniture it sells on Alibaba.com are based on Mr. Hankerson\u2019s designs. \u201cThis design is from Vintage Industrial, but we also manufacture the same design in our company,\u201d said Bobby Shukhla, who answered queries from The New York Times.Mr. Hankerson tried contacting sellers directly, asking them to take down his images. Most of them complied. He was also encouraged when Alibaba staff members removed all of the photos he targeted on Alibaba.com through its infringement-fighting process.But then he ran into difficulties. Last year, the website through which he could send Alibaba requests to remove suspect listings stopped working. He tried submitting and resubmitting the required paperwork on the site, even on different computers, only to have it return error messages.An Alibaba spokesman, in written responses, said that in October the company started an improved online system through which companies and people can report possible infringement on any of its platforms. He said that Mr. Hankerson has not tried to use this new system. Mr. Hankerson said he had but could not get it to work.Mr. Hankerson decided to step up his efforts. In August, he sent emails to Alibaba\u2019s investor and public relations departments threatening to raise a public ruckus about fakes on its sites.A manager at Alibaba\u2019s intellectual property protection department reached out. Mr. Hankerson handed over lists of more than 400 suspect images, only some of which were removed. Many of them, Mr. Hankerson was informed, were on a different Alibaba system and had to be removed through a separate process, which has not yet been undertaken.He argued that he shouldn\u2019t have to go to such lengths to get Alibaba to act. Once Alibaba has been made aware of his company\u2019s intellectual property, he said, the firm should proactively prevent additional postings of his photos or clean any suspect products from its platforms. Yet despite Alibaba\u2019s boast to the U.S.T.R., combing the millions of listings could be difficult or expensive.\u201cIt should be click and forget,\u201d he said. \u201cOur products should never be on their site.\u201dAn Alibaba spokesman said the company had tried to work with Mr. Hankerson to remove his images and resolve his technical problems. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the primary responsibility of protecting a brand rests with the brand itself,\u201d the spokesman wrote in an email.Additionally, Alibaba disputes the idea that it tolerates fakes. Intellectual property infringement \u201churts Alibaba\u2019s business and reputation,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether the infringement is against big brands or small companies.\u201dMr. Hankerson remains unmollified. He is talking to lawyers about his options and is trying to rally other small-business owners to the cause.\u201cThey want to have all those counterfeits,\u201d he said, \u201cand they want to make money off of it.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about American small businesses\u2019 fighting counterfeits on Alibaba\u2019s sales platforms misstated the Chinese company\u2019s relationship with a popular online payment system in China. The system, Alipay, is owned by a company controlled by Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman, not by Alibaba itself.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

It is part of a system that promotes both the economy and the country\u2019s multicultural society, which has arguably become as much a part of Canadian identity as hockey. And it is largely seen as a way to increase immigration, not reduce it.\u201cCanadians are more likely than citizens of any other industrial country to think immigration is essential to the economy and the future of the country,\u201d said Jeffrey Reitz, a professor of ethnic and immigration studies at the University of Toronto.Part of that enthusiasm is the country\u2019s recognition that, with an aging population, immigration is essential to economic growth. Add to that Canada\u2019s geography \u2014 a long border with the prosperous United States to the south and the Arctic to the north \u2014 and illegal immigration is less of an issue.And finally, Canadians have a wholehearted belief in the merit-based immigration system, which creates a positive feedback loop.\u201cThe advantage of our system is the people who come in \u2014 everyone agrees they\u2019ve passed some sort of merit system,\u201d said Ravi Pendakur, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa. \u201cThe Canadian population in particular is more willing to buy into immigration. They can see it\u2019s managed, and that\u2019s an advantage.\u201dThe program does have its drawbacks. It has become enormously complex, ever-morphing and a source of huge backlogs.Created in 1967, the merit-based system was seen as a way to select immigrants based on their \u201chuman capital\u201d and not simply their country of origin, as had been the tradition. The idea was to bring in immigrants, regardless of where they were born, with vetted qualities that would make them the most successful at integrating into the Canadian economy.Candidates received points for their level of education, ability to speak one or both of the country\u2019s official languages, work experience, age, a job offer and what immigration officials called adaptability, which meant they came with family or had family here.Two years ago, the country revamped the entire system, increasing the possible points to 1,200 and valuing a job offer at 600.Other applications were put in a job bank for employers to select. Successful applicants were promised a six-month approval, but unsuccessful ones had to reapply.Add separate point systems drafted by the country\u2019s provinces and territories based on their job markets, and the system grows even more head-scratching. Saskatchewan, for instance, is recruiting long-haul truck drivers and hospitality workers, while Alberta wants food and beverage processors.\u201cI teach this stuff and I find it confusing,\u201d said Prof. Audrey Macklin, director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Center for Criminology and Sociolegal Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently confusing, plus it keeps changing.\u201dStill, the principle remains: The immigrants coming in under this system are well educated, literate in the local language and have great credentials.\u201cIf America changes toward our system, the Apples and Microsofts and Googles will be very happy,\u201d said Robert Vineberg, a retired regional director general of immigration. \u201cBut the vegetable growers in California will not be so happy.\u201dMr. Vineberg offered government immigration statistics from 2015 as an example. That year, Canada identified 66,360 newcomers as economic immigrants for their occupational skills.Around 36,300 were categorized in the top two classes, meaning they were fluent in one national language and had a college degree. Most would have been recruited for a specific job, Mr. Vineberg said: for instance, vice president of a company or administrator of a hospital. Another 22,700 were picked for a job in skilled trades, like an industrial electrician. They needed the language skills to read a blueprint and follow complicated directions, and at least some postsecondary training and certification in their trade.Only 2,177 were brought in as laborers, and even they would have been chosen for specific positions, most likely in a hard-to-fill job or a remote location \u2014 for instance, a Japanese-speaking hotel receptionist in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Mr. Vineberg said.His example, however, illuminates the contradiction at the center of the immigration system.In 2015, almost 272,000 people were granted entry, and only a quarter were picked for their merit. Most of those counted in the economic class were family members, chosen not for their human capital \u2014 although many might also be educated and intend to work \u2014 but their blood ties.\u201cThe statistics convey the impression that Canada chooses most people based on economic criteria, and perhaps policy makers think this reassures Canadians that immigration serves Canada\u2019s economic interests,\u201d Professor Macklin said. \u201cIn reality, most people still enter on the basis of kinship. The idea that this can be easily or significantly altered is a bit of a fantasy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to be relaxed about immigration when your only land border is a huge wall with the United States,\u201d Professor Reitz said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Does Mount Rushmore Exist?", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "The Voyages IssueThis gargantuan shrine to democracy has never felt so surreal.Supported byThey wanted to stay forever, to be swallowed by the crowds, but we were on a different pilgrimage, in search of a different America, so we continued on.Late that night, finally, we reached South Dakota.It was unfathomably empty. In downtown Rapid City, we idled at empty intersections, block after snowy block, waiting for traffic lights that governed no traffic. Emptiness is, to some degree, South Dakota\u2019s natural condition: It is the 17th-largest state in the country but has only the 46th-largest population \u2014 the square mileage of Senegal, the people of Fort Worth. The emptiness reaches a new extreme in winter, when all the tourists scatter and the open spaces take over. The map-boards on the sidewalks, set up to guide pedestrians from shop to shop, were covered in a crust of snow. Our hotel, a grand old lodge built concurrently with Mount Rushmore itself, bragged of hosting six presidents over the decades. But its rooms, in February, were cheap and vacant, and we met no one in the grand lobby except imitation wooden Indians and mounted bison heads.Why were we there? Why had I dragged my family \u2014 my wife and our Snapchatting 12-year-old daughter and our longhaired, talkative 9-year-old son \u2014 away from work and school to see, of all places, Mount Rushmore?I couldn\u2019t say, exactly. All I knew was that I seemed to be suffering a crisis of scale. America was taking up a larger part of my mind than it ever had before. It was dominating my internal landscape, crowding out other thoughts, blocking my view of regular life. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was reaching its proper size, growing the way a problem tends to grow just before a solution is found, or if it was swelling the way an organ does before it fails and bursts.I felt drawn to Mount Rushmore, instinctively, like a spawning fish to the head of a river. I wanted to look American bigness squarely in the face.Somewhere on the way to Mount Rushmore, we realized that none of us knew, for sure, which presidents were carved into the mountain. The image was so familiar that we had never really bothered to look closely. After some discussion, we managed to agree on George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. But who was the fourth? John Adams? Benjamin Franklin? Alexander Hamilton? We were just guessing figures from money. We had to look it up. It was Thomas Jefferson. I asked my son to draw me a picture, from memory, of Rushmore, and after several minutes of earnest work, he revealed something that looked like a police sketch of a middle-aged Beatles cover band that has been caught shoplifting after a gig at a strip mall. None of the presidents had a nose, Roosevelt\u2019s glasses had fallen off and Jefferson (who sported a jet-black mop-top) was on the wrong side of Washington. Otherwise, we all agreed, the picture was excellent.\u201cI think I really nailed Abraham Lincoln,\u201d my son said. \u201cHe has that long face and skinny chin.\u201dMy wife read in the local paper about a man who was in trouble for setting off an elk stampede with a drone. We drove off into the South Dakota vastness.This changed suddenly in the 1870s, when the notorious George Armstrong Custer arrived to make a map of the Black Hills. (In a bizarre coincidence \u2014 history ripped from today\u2019s headlines \u2014 Custer\u2019s most trusted Indian guide joined the expedition from Standing Rock and was named Maga.) In the course of their exploring, Custer\u2019s men discovered gold. Word flew across the nation (\u201cFrom the grass roots down, it was \u2018pay dirt\u2019\u2009\u201d), and before long a fire hose of white Americans went spraying into the isolated land, violating an Indian treaty with impunity, setting up mining towns and trading posts, blasting roads through mountains, changing the nature of the place forever.Before long, of course, the boom went bust. Many miners left; the region\u2019s economy sagged. In the 1920s, local boosters proposed an eccentric solution. What if some of the Black Hills\u2019 ancient rock could be carved into a monument to American history \u2014 a patriotic tribute that would also serve, in this new era of automobiles, as a roadside attraction? Spindly granite towers, it was suggested, could be carved into free-standing statues honoring heroes of the American West: Red Cloud, Sacagawea, Lewis and Clark. Instead of gold, South Dakota could harvest tourists.Only one American sculptor seemed up to the task. He was, like the sculpture he would create, a larger-than-life weirdo: John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum, son of a Danish immigrant, friend of Auguste Rodin, publicity hound, populist, salesman, self-styled tough guy with a white Stetson and a flowing scarf and a dark, bushy mustache. At the time, Borglum was working on another huge sculpture chiseled into the front of a mountain: a tribute, in Georgia, to great heroes of the Confederacy \u2014 Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson. (The project was initially sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and entangled with the Ku Klux Klan.)When Borglum was enticed to visit the Black Hills, he saw presidents: Washington, Lincoln. Anything else, he argued, would be too limited, too provincial, not sufficiently star-spangled \u201cU.S.A.!!!\u201d Borglum believed that America was a special artistic challenge, a place so heroically grand that the effete styles of Europe could never hope to do it justice. \u201cArt in America should be American,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdrawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement.\u201d He accepted the challenge to transform the Black Hills.From the beginning, the project struck many locals as absurd. Controversy raged in the newspapers. To carve statues in the mountains, one wrote, \u201cwould be as incongruous and ridiculous as keeping a cow in the rotunda of the Capitol building.\u201d \u201cWhy not just paint a mustache on everything?\u201d another asked.Funding for Mount Rushmore was touch-and-go, as was political and public support. But Borglum would not give up. The project took far longer, and cost far more money, than anyone could have imagined. Logistics were murderously complex. Men were lowered over the rock face on sling chairs; carving was done mainly with dynamite and jackhammers. At one point, a crack running through the stone threatened to break Thomas Jefferson\u2019s nose, so his face was blown off the mountain and started again in a different spot.The sculpting of Mount Rushmore began in 1927, with a ceremony overseen by President Calvin Coolidge, who wore a comically large hat. Work spanned 14 years, encompassing some of the defining spasms of American history: the Great Depression, the beginning of World War II. Separate dedication ceremonies were held for each of the four faces; Franklin Roosevelt himself came to dedicate Jefferson. The sculpture was finished one month and one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Work would have continued \u2014 the plan was to depict each of the presidents down to the waist \u2014 but funding began to dry up again, and Borglum died, and after a few finishing touches, the figures were abandoned as good enough. This was precisely the moment when American influence was about to explode, the dawn of 50 years of prosperity and cultural dominance. Mount Rushmore was completed, conveniently, just in time to serve as a kind of superheated mascot for the mythology of the Greatest Generation and baby boomers: that America\u2019s hugeness is bound up with its nobility, that it deservedly dominates the globe.The granite of Mount Rushmore is so hard that the sculptures will erode at a rate of one inch every 10,000 years.Huge thrusts of rock burst out of the landscape at random intervals in the forest. My wife said they looked as though they had fallen from outer space.\u201cThey\u2019re just rocks, Mom,\u201d said our daughter, who was listening to Chance the Rapper on one earbud. \u201cCalm down.\u201dWe passed over quaint wooden bridges that curled like pigtails and through old stone tunnels that looked, every time, as if they were going to rip off our side mirrors. More than once, I had the feeling that we were driving in a theme park. Each tunnel had been carefully blasted to frame a perfect view of Mount Rushmore. The presidents were watching us come to them. Our daughter screamed when she saw them and made me pull over so she could get a good angle for Snapchat.\u201cI hate pictures,\u201d our son said. \u201cYour mind is your own picture-taker-thing.\u201dAt one point, we passed a roadside cliff that looked vaguely like a face, and we all spent several minutes debating whether it had been carved like that deliberately or if we were maybe going slightly crazy in the snowy, empty woods. Soon everything we saw started to look like a face: rocks, trees, snowdrifts. \u201cThey\u2019re haunting me!\u201d our daughter shouted. \u201cEvery rock I look at! I don\u2019t understand life!\u201dBy the time we pulled into the Mount Rushmore parking garage, after an eternity of winding, everyone was exhausted and starving. The park\u2019s restaurant was closed for renovation, so we settled into a sort of triage-unit cafe next door. We ate in tense silence. The food was bad. I drank a beer called Honest Abe Red Ale, the can of which featured a picture of Mount Rushmore below the slogan GET SICK-N-TWISTED. Our son complained, bitterly, that his plastic cup of applesauce was \u201chot.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d he said \u2014 and that \u201chere\u201d seemed to encompass everything: the cafe, Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, America, the 21st century.After lunch we walked outside, to the viewing deck, and there \u2014 well, there was Mount Rushmore. That was really the biggest thing you could say about it: There it was. Rushmore is a ubiquitous American image, tattooed on the inside of every citizen\u2019s eyelids, so it felt disorienting to see it in three-dimensional space, pinned to this particular spot on the earth. We had the viewing deck almost to ourselves, which meant that the presidents and our family faced off. Four of us, four of them.There was Washington, out front, the leader of the band \u2014 noble, aristocratic and smooth, his mouth a grim stone line. A dollop of snow stuck to the bridge of his nose. Peering over his shoulder, like a shy sidekick, was Jefferson, his big nose held high, showing his nostrils to the world. (This was not an artistic choice; the grain of the rock forced Borglum to tilt the head back.) Lincoln stood apart from them, heavy eyebrows frosted with snow, and in the middle, almost swallowed by the mountain, was Teddy Roosevelt, with his wire-rimmed spectacles and Freddie Mercury mustache. They were all looking in slightly different directions, not at us but far over our heads, into the great American distance.I must admit that, in person, I was not especially moved by the beauty of the sculptures. They were, essentially, traditional busts, distinguished mainly by their insane scale and placement. The novelty of it was stronger than the beauty.What stood out most was everything around the presidents\u2019 faces: the Black Hills landscape that spreads and spreads, incorporating eons of old rock and new growth, last century\u2019s roads and yesterday\u2019s snow. This was something that was hard to appreciate in photographs, which tend to be tightly cropped \u2014 just the presidents, stony and smooth. But the mountain itself is magnificent: rough and rutted and craggy, like an ancient crocodile\u2019s back. The stone is warped and twisted, a frozen surge flowing toward and around the artificial faces; it is like a diagram of the geological energy that thrust it into being nearly two billion years ago. This speaks to forces much larger than America or nationalism of any kind. It made the giant heads look small.I felt a rush of emotion that was not patriotism but awe: awe at human weirdness, at our capacity to create, in the actual world, such an improbable and unnecessary artifact as this. Why had humans done this? Why did Mount Rushmore exist?\u201cOh, it\u2019s a nice little mountain thing,\u201d my son said appreciatively, and then he asked if we could leave.Outside Custer was the Crazy Horse Memorial \u2014 another granite mountain being carved, Rushmore-style, into the enormous likeness of a historic figure. This one depicted Crazy Horse, the enigmatic leader of the Oglala Sioux, one of the fiercest defenders of the Black Hills from the indignity of white invasion. It was a sort of corrective to Rushmore, a reclaiming of the landscape by the people from whom it was stolen. My family was tired and refused to get out of the car, so I walked through the museum myself. I looked at a tiny model of the monument. The carving has been in progress, without federal funding, for nearly 70 years. The finished figure would be 563 feet tall, sitting on his horse, pointing toward the Black Hills.I understood the impulse, of course, but it also struck me as strange: to honor a Native American leader in terms of Rushmore-style gigantism.And it began to seem foreign to me, our American obsession with size. We are born a fantasy of bigness. We are tall and strapping, with big hats and big hair and loud clothes and booming voices. We drive our big cars through the epic landscapes of our giant continent. We work in tall buildings, where we give 110 percent in order to build larger-than-life careers that distinguish us from the huge teeming masses of our fellows. Our great ideas define infinite eras. Our big weapons win big wars. We are economically, geographically, culturally and spiritually huge: the Gigantic States of America.There is something childish about this fantasy \u2014 the way it tends to conflate virtue and size. Why does goodness have to be huge? It is a dangerous belief, and one that inevitably causes stress and confusion when \u2014 as it must \u2014 it runs up against reality. Inevitably, there will be a shift in scale; the dominant thing (nation, culture, religion, demographic) will begin to shrink. Does it lose its virtue with its dominance? If we truly believe that, then what virtue will we not be willing to sacrifice to make ourselves feel big again?At the gift shop, I bought a length of braided sweet grass, which was said to dispel negative energy; we set it on our dashboard as we pulled away.Later, as the sun was beginning to set, we drove through the spreading wilderness of Custer State Park. We passed through huge, shaggy herds of buffalo, which raised their heads and stared. The landscape seemed to change every 500 feet: lakes, buttes, forests, gashes of red dirt. A small herd of pronghorns glided over a bluff, ghostly white on the snow. It was as beautiful as any land I\u2019ve ever seen; driving through it inspired the kind of awe that the sculptures of Rushmore had not. But then again, we never would have seen this landscape if we hadn\u2019t come to look at Rushmore.At one point, our car was besieged by a herd of burros. They surrounded us completely, forcing us to stop. We rolled our windows down. They stuck their heads in and worked their giant lips; we could see, deep inside their mouths, tiny sets of teeth clacking away in anticipation of food. It was like a horror movie, but hilarious. The burros were not native to the Black Hills: Their ancestors had been brought to the region as pack animals, then set loose, so these creatures were a result of many generations of acquired wildness. We had nothing to feed them, so they started licking our car, presumably for the salt from the roads. When we got out later, the entire vehicle was covered in thin white swirls.She pointed me to the Rushmore view, and sure enough, there it was, unobstructed. But it was so far away that you could barely see it. Binoculars hung by the window. Even magnified, the heads were tiny. Borglum made the sculptures on Mount Rushmore 80 times as large as an average human head \u2014 each one roughly the size of a sperm whale. This window shrank those heads down to the size of a pin.As the evening wore on, the view got stranger. Outside, somewhere in the wilds of the Black Hills, a fire was burning. As the sky darkened, the fire grew and grew, and from our perspective through the window, it was directly in front of Rushmore. It sent its smoke into the presidents\u2019 miniature faces, and the smoke glowed an eerie red. George Washington looked at us through the screen of a red cloud. It seemed like one of those weird meteorological events, an eclipse or a comet, that ancient cultures invested with meaning. Tiny giant America seemed to be burning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brand New Colossus: A Statue of Liberty Revival Amid Immigration Woes", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byKing Bradley was working his shift at the gift shop near the Statue of Liberty when something unusual happened.Mr. Bradley had transferred in the last six months from Federal Hall, another national landmark in New York, where tears are not a normal part of the visitor experience. But a woman browsing through the gift shop had begun to cry, he said, and tears were rolling down her face.\u201cShe said that it\u2019s sad that the statue is supposed to mean freedom and liberty and all these things and we don\u2019t actually have that here,\u201d Mr. Bradley said, adding that the woman explained that she worked with Syrian refugees.In another telling sign of how the last presidential election may have shifted the civic landscape, the Statue of Liberty has re-emerged as a potent and resonant symbol amid a polarizing debate about immigration.And the attention is reverberating at the statue\u2019s home, a small island in New York Harbor, where visitors in January and February have surged this year. In January, an estimated 170,000 visitors boarded the ferry that travels to Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island, up about 18 percent over the same month last year, and 171,000 did so in February, up about 15 percent over 2016. Both months smashed records that Statue Cruises, the company that tracks visitors through ferry ticket sales, has kept since 1991.Mr. Bradley, the gift shop worker, said the change became noticeable in the weeks after the election.\u201cPeople are definitely paying more attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re asking more questions.\u201dThe numbers can perhaps be explained, in part, by the relatively mild winter New York has had this year, though 2016 was also on the warmer side. Still, on an unusually cold morning recently, hundreds of people milled about the monument, braving a chill that the early spring sun did little to dispel.In interviews with more than three dozen visitors, many said they had been motivated to visit the statue by the divisive national debate on immigration. Most had brought their children, hoping to teach them about the family\u2019s immigration history. Others were quick to cite lines from the famous Emma Lazarus poem \u201cThe New Colossus\u201d: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free \u2026 \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like, remember who we are, remember what we did. Remember how this country was built,\u201d said Christian Pollas, 48, a Bronx resident who lived in Haiti before moving to the United States as a child for \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d during the reign of the dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, known as Baby Doc. \u201cWe\u2019re not just American citizens.\u201dOthers drawn to the statue included a family of four of Puerto Rican descent visiting from Orlando, Fla.; a mother from Los Angeles teaching her 5-year-old son about how his family had come from Ireland decades ago; a French traveler curious about the \u201csituation in the U.S.A., with Donald Trump\u201d; a couple in town from the Netherlands interested, they said, in the statue\u2019s message of liberty; and some 170 eighth graders from a yeshiva in Brooklyn.\u201cLady Liberty shows that everyone and anyone can come in,\u201d said Jacob Kassin, 13, an eighth grader at the Magen David Yeshivah, who, unprompted, spoke harshly about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban before being hushed by a teacher. \u201cThe rich, the poor, the immigrants. We\u2019ll treat them equally.\u201dAs a sign, perhaps, of how politically fraught the statue has become, the National Park Service, seemingly reluctant to promote the heritage of a landmark under its stewardship, turned down requests for interviews with rangers as well as a librarian who is an expert on the statue.Jerry Willis, a Park Service spokesman, said there was indeed a sense that the statue was enjoying a renewed relevance. As examples, he cited a random phone call seeking conversation about the statue\u2019s meaning, a television crew that arrived for a shoot and a group of protesters who rode over after a demonstration against the travel ban in Battery Park City. Mr. Willis\u2019s Google alert for the Statue of Liberty has been getting significantly more hits than it used to, he said.The statue, \u201cLiberty Enlightening the World,\u201d was dedicated in 1886, but was not originally intended to be a symbol of immigration.With a broken chain at Liberty\u2019s feet, the monument was conceived in France as a celebration of the abolition of slavery and the Union\u2019s victory in the Civil War. But the meaning shifted over time because of the statue\u2019s prominence in New York Harbor at a time when immigrants were arriving at nearby Ellis Island and the addition of the Lazarus poem in 1903.But it has found its broadest use today as a totem of the left, emerging as a sort of patron saint of the protest movements that have surged in opposition to Mr. Trump and his policies.Still, one recent visitor, Barry Hutton, an engineer from Dorchester, England, scoffed at the idea that the statue was anything more than a great feat of engineering and architecture.\u201cThat is politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of taking a bit of history, \u2018What a nice statue,\u2019 they will read things into it. People make up stories to get attention.\u201dAs the day began to warm, Ana and Christopher Felpeto, visiting from Miami with their daughters, Luciana, 10, and Valentina, 8, headed back to the ferry.Ms. Felpeto said she had come to New York many times but had never visited the statue. Her parents fled Cuba in 1959, she said, and her father gave up his law career to drive a taxi and sell kitchen goods in the United States. Her husband arrived from Cuba in 1967, as a baby.Her family\u2019s story and today\u2019s political climate had prompted her to bring her children to the statue, she said. She asked them about the words of \u201cThe New Colossus.\u201d\u201cIt means freedom!\u201d one of the girls shouted.\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that we came here,\u201d Ms. Felpeto said. \u201cIt\u2019s for a very specific reason. These kids have grown up American, so it\u2019s very important for them to pass those messages and values on. Especially in this time we\u2019re in, this is the time to do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T and Johnson & Johnson Pull Ads From YouTube", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byAT&T and Johnson & Johnson, among the biggest advertisers in the United States, were among several companies to say Wednesday that they would stop their ads from running on YouTube and other Google properties amid concern that Google is not doing enough to prevent brands from appearing next to offensive material, like hate speech.\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re trying harder \u2014 that\u2019s insufficient,\u201d Mr. Wieser said of Google. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to understand the scale of the perceived problem.\u201dThe company has defended itself by noting that it prevents ads, which are placed on websites automatically, from running near inappropriate material \u201cin the vast majority of cases.\u201d It also said it added thousands of sites to its ad network every day, as well as 400 hours of video to YouTube every minute.Still, several advertisers, seeking more accountability, have pulled some of their ad spending. They include the British government, The Guardian, the pharmaceutical company GSK and the French advertising multinational Havas.Now, the issue is taking hold with American advertisers, with the car rental company Enterprise announcing a temporary halt of spending on YouTube on Wednesday. Verizon, while it did not mention Google or YouTube by name, said Wednesday that it would suspend \u201call digital nonsearch advertising inventory\u201d after learning its ads \u201cwere appearing on nonsanctioned websites,\u201d which presumably included ads on YouTube and websites in Google\u2019s ad network.AT&T said in its statement: \u201cWe are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won\u2019t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google\u2019s nonsearch platforms.\u201dJohnson & Johnson said it \u201chas decided to pause all YouTube digital advertising globally to ensure our product advertising does not appear on channels that promote offensive content.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe take this matter very seriously and will continue to take every measure to ensure our brand advertising is consistent with our brand values.\u201dGoogle, in response to the actions, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual customers, but as announced, we\u2019ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear.\u201dGoogle has become the largest seller of advertising on the internet by pairing its vast network of content \u2014 its own and other publishers\u2019 \u2014 with businesses large and small looking to grab eyeballs moving from traditional media to the web. The company\u2019s ad business generated $22.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, about 85 percent of the total revenue in the period by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. The biggest part of that still comes from search advertising.While the pullback from major brands is a public relations blow, it is unclear if it will have much of an effect on that vast ad business. The underlying dynamic of advertising\u2019s shift from TV toward the internet remains unchanged, and YouTube is still the largest player in the web video game.Still, AT&T was one of the top five advertisers in the United States last year, spending nearly $1 billion through November, according to data from Kantar Media. Mr. Wieser said its size would certainly cause other marketers, and investors, to take note.\u201cEventually, they\u2019ll respond appropriately,\u201d Mr. Wieser, who cut his recommendation on Google shares to hold, from buy, early this week, said of the company, citing \u201cglobal repercussions\u201d from the moves in Britain. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to just see a significant business go away.\u201dWhereas advertisers usually get strict assurances about how and where their ads will be placed on television and in print publications, Google and other internet players like Facebook do not provide the same oversight. That is because of the volume of websites they deal with, because of the fact that they have less direct control over the content uploaded to those sites and because algorithms, rather than humans, place the majority of ads.Google\u2019s policies prohibit ads on video content deemed to be pornographic, inciting violence or promoting illegal behavior. The company uses software to comb YouTube titles and images to flag potentially inappropriate content, but by its own admission, these methods are not perfect. Marketers also have the option of prohibiting their ads from appearing next to certain types of content, such as videos featuring profanity.\u201cAlthough it is effective in dealing with the highly fragmented nature of the digital ad world, programmatic buying is still evolving as a business practice \u2014 and it appears that technology has gotten ahead of the advertising industry\u2019s checks and balances,\u201d Laura Bryant, a spokeswoman for Enterprise, said in a statement. \u201cThere is no doubt there are serious flaws that need to be addressed.\u201dProgrammatic advertising and YouTube represent two major initiatives for Alphabet. The shift to searches on smartphones has pushed down the prices for Google\u2019s main search ads, heightening the importance of new areas of growth.Google does not break out revenue from either business but has trumpeted both during earnings calls. Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts in January that Google had only \u201cscratched the surface\u201d for what it could do with YouTube and programmatic advertising.\u201cWe remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped,\u201d she said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the place in California where Google\u2019s complex is.

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: YouTube\u2019s Problematic Advertising", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byBitsAt one point, for instance, President Trump got into a big rig and honked its horn a couple of times, really putting all of his effort into it. It looked quite satisfying, to tell the truth. Next time I have a hard day at the office, I\u2019m going to go look for a big truck.Under rules created last October by the Federal Communications Commission, Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and other broadband providers had to ask your permission to track your online behavior to sell for advertising purposes. On a party-line vote, Republicans in the Senate decided that was too onerous. If the measure passes the House and gets President Trump\u2019s signature, broadband companies will be free to track you without your permission.This whole thing is clearly in no way justifiable in the name of consumer protection. The reason there isn\u2019t more outrage about this, in my opinion, is that it\u2019s far too technical of an issue for normal people to get up in arms about unless translated into plain English and publicized.More and more ads are being sold \u201cprogrammatically\u201d \u2014 that is, through financial algorithms run by computers rather than by human marketers determining the exact placement of any given spot. But it\u2019s not clear that the big programmatic companies, of which Google is the largest and most powerful, have perfected ways to keep prominent brands off some of the seedier corners of the internet.But how do you deal with ads that appear on videos that have racist or xenophobic content in them? Doesn\u2019t that get into the realm of sentiment analysis? Isn\u2019t that difficult to handle in the long term? I feel like that requires the aid of artificial intelligence, a field that C.E.O.s have admitted still needs help understanding very human issues.The other side of this lies with the folks who have to write up the community guidelines around what constitutes racism and hate speech, an area into which companies like Google and Facebook have increasingly been drawn as reluctant arbiters of speech. That\u2019s the last place they want to be headed, but I think they won\u2019t have much of a choice.My guess on how this plays out: A bunch of brands will yank ads. YouTube will come out with some rewritten policy on community guidelines that\u2019s somewhat more hardline against certain kinds of speech, but still relatively squishy. Brand advertisers will reinsert their ads on YouTube. The heat will go away. Life will steadily march on.Speaking of that, I\u2019m going to go enjoy life and find a truck horn to honk. See you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under the Spell of Sunny Puerto Rico", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byFamily TravelYou know things are going pretty well when the big family argument is over whether to splash in the rain forest waterfall or loll around on the white-sand beach.You know things are even better when you realize you can do both in a single day and not tax the patience or interest of three children.From our weeklong base at a rental condo in Rio Grande \u2014 there are plenty of them on sites like Airbnb \u2014 we had such debates, the kind of decision-making that vacations should be about.It was winter break for our three, ages 11 to 15, and having not traveled far since a move from Mexico nearly two years ago, they pushed for someplace warm off the mainland.We settled on Puerto Rico, where we had always wanted to go and which, while a commonwealth, is far enough off the mainland (just under four hours from Kennedy Airport), and culturally apart, too, to count in their reckoning.Having lived in warm climates for several years, we found that even this relatively mild winter in New York was grinding on us, so almost any natural sunlamp would do.Rio Grande, a coastal and jungle resort town about 20 miles east of the capital, San Juan, could not have been more perfect, given that almost every attraction could be reached in 30 minutes or less.Our debates evolved into which day trip was more satisfying.Although Puerto Rico tends to conjure images of palms and beaches, the rain forest just down the road beckoned, as something a little different.You could do worse than start with the rain forest.La Coca Trail, for instance, rises and falls on its meandering path to the big payoff: a roaring waterfall and pool that beckon you for a dip and, if you can tolerate the pelting, a shower. A hike a little downstream offers more private relaxing.Angelito Trail nearby provides an easier walk and more mellow bathing in a large stream, though locals told us it can get brisk after heavy rains. One natural pool there was deep enough for our two boys to jump from a rope swing.Tropical rain forest. You may be thinking about bugs, particularly mosquitoes, given the Zika outbreak that occurred in Puerto Rico and elsewhere last year.But, visiting in February, we discovered there were not legions of them, and hearty, cool sea breezes helped keep them at bay and the climate quite pleasant.Really, our biggest anxiety had to do with giving the kids enough of the beach time they demanded.Pick your pleasure.A nameless beach a few minutes down the road from our apartment complex, and accessible via a path of wooden planks, offered fierce waves, which delighted the children as they twisted in the curling break, but kept me on guard. The sand and grass beach was narrow and scattered with seaweed, the kind of relatively isolated place you might crave for an only-the-locals experience, but it might disappoint if you expect comfort and, maybe, an umbrella.Puerto Rico guarantees public access to beaches, even at resorts. Those beaches, of course, tend to be well-maintained and near amenities like a bar. It can be tricky getting to them, though. Our apartment complex was around the bend from the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa, with its manicured grounds, restaurants, casinos, golf course and well-appointed rooms.Ask at the security gate where the beach is, and you are directed down the road to a place that is not the resort. But if you say you would like to pay for a day pass to the hotel or to visit the casino or restaurants, you are waved in and can park in the garage, which charges by the hour and is a short walk down a path to the beach.It looks like the ones that you see when you Google \u201cPuerto Rico beach.\u201d Clean sand, invitingly clear water ... and populated by a good number of tourists.We had more fun, however, at a public beach called Playa Luquillo 10 minutes down the road. For $5.50, we parked, set up our chairs (you can rent them, and umbrellas, too) and joined local families and fellow bargain hunters. There are concession stands, and the beach abuts a line of food and souvenir kiosks.Vendors come by hawking fresh seafood from coolers. We tried the shrimp and grilled octopus in homemade mojo sauce and ran after the vendor for more.But the best beach by far, and one of the most spectacular we have seen in our years of travel in Mexico and the Caribbean, was Culebra Island.It requires about a 15-mile drive east from Rio Grande to a ferry at the seaside village of Fajardo; it\u2019s a good idea to get there an hour or more before the scheduled time to ensure a seat.After a ferry trip of an hour to 90 minutes, depending on how long it takes to board everyone, you arrive at a funky beach town with taxi buses ready to whisk you to beaches, snorkeling, Jet Skis and other activities minutes away. With our children growing anxious, we opted for the closest beach, Playa Flamenco, and were enthralled.A wide, powdery white-sand beach awaited. Swimming-pool-clear water extended yards out, waist-deep, and even deeper water was the blue of a dusky sky.Gentle but persistent waves playfully banged around the young (and older) daredevils. The presence of a coral reef just offshore seemed an impossibly over-the-top perk, but it had enough fish \u2014 lots of blue tang for \u201cFinding Dory\u201d fans \u2014 poking around to lure us, some of them zooming off to the shoreline.Culebra now ranks in our household among our top three beaches.Almost everything we did after that teetered on letdown.A popular attraction is nighttime kayaking in a bioluminescent bay in Fajardo. With a guide leading the way, you paddle for a half-hour through a dark mangrove, knocking trees and other boats along the way as novices get used to navigating, into a large bay where luminescent bubbles from micro-organisms trail your hand as you pass it through the water (swimming is no longer permitted).It was a workout for me as my companion, my 11-year-old son, comfy in his backrest-equipped spot, grew tired of paddling and drifted off to sleep at one point. And overall I guess I was expecting science-fiction level luminescence, but the eerie course through the mangrove, with fish darting and splashing to the surface, passed for adventure.Long days usually meant quick meals at the apartment, with a couple of supermarkets 10 minutes away good for stocking up on snacks and whatever cooking we were motivated to do.But plenty of restaurants and shops are worth checking out.Three stood out for us.The Wyndham and some of the restaurants offer live music on many nights, but traveling with children left us mostly exhausted by the time such things got going.The visit reminded us of the charm of this corner of Puerto Rico, a casual place with rich rewards in easy reach.Randal C.

{"Headline": "How a Money-Losing Snap Could Be Worth So Much", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Common SenseTesting the upper limits of valuation, Snap\u2019s investors are betting on the kind of rapid growth that few, if any, companies have ever achieved.Supported byBy now, even most of us over 35 \u2014 old age, by Snapchat standards \u2014 are aware of the photo sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial America.Even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that self-destruct, or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow, turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts, you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $34 billion.At that price, Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook \u2014 not to mention such internet stalwarts as Google, Amazon and even Netflix \u2014 look like bargain-basement \u201cvalue\u201d stocks.Snap \u201clooks tremendously overvalued to me,\u201d said Brian Hamilton, a co-founder of Sageworks, a financial analysis and valuation firm.Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Snap as a \u201cfield of dreams.\u201d Even with rosy growth forecasts, \u201cat $22 billion, we\u2019re looking at a stock trading at five to eight times estimated revenues in 2020,\u201d he said before the valuation rose even higher. \u201cThe only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba, and they have massive scale. And both of them are profitable.\u201dMajor I.P.O.s of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992.So let\u2019s be generous and ignore profit. How about revenue? Snap said it generated $404 million in sales in 2016. A valuation of $34 billion is about 84 times revenue.That\u2019s six times as high as Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio, which is 14. It\u2019s 14 times as high as Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which trades at just over six times revenue. Amazon trades at a mere three times. Even high-flying Netflix trades at seven times.Compared with Snap, however, those are mature companies, whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as they\u2019ve aged. As Mr. Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry Gold put it in a recent note to clients: \u201cThere is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all. The sky\u2019s the limit and history is not a guide.\u201dTo justify a valuation of even $25 billion, \u201cyou have to make some very lofty assumptions,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cThey would need to grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent, which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly.\u201d He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the history of American business.But let\u2019s ignore revenue, too. This is social media, after all, where \u201cdaily active users\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d are the coins of the realm.And $1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for Snap. At $34 billion, each of Snap\u2019s daily active users is worth $215, six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for Instagram.As of January, Instagram reported 300 million daily active users. At $215 each, the Instagram app alone would be valued today at $64.5 billion.These are static numbers, and what Snap is selling investors is growth. According to Snap\u2019s prospectus, Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016, about the same as the year before. If it can pull that off again next year, it would reach an impressive 234 million users, though still short of Instagram.The Snapchat story \u201cis all about growth,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about economics.\u201dBut Snapchat\u2019s growth slowed sharply in last year\u2019s fourth quarter \u2014 just about the time Instagram started its own version of Stories, a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos. It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters.By comparison, 150 million Instagram users are now using its Stories feature. That\u2019s already nearly as many as Snapchat\u2019s entire user base.Maybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user, even if its user base doesn\u2019t grow all that much. It\u2019s currently generating an average of $5.83 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebook\u2019s North American average of $12.81, the MoffettNathanson analysis notes, suggesting plenty of room to grow.But even doubling revenue doesn\u2019t get Snap close to a Facebook valuation.There are, of course, superhigh revenue and user-growth assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuation.Still, very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels (and I looked for some). The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as $30 billion. But that\u2019s based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of $3.8 billion in 2018.Mr. Gold said some investors were buying into the I.P.O., but not to hold Snap for the long term. \u201cPeople are saying they\u2019ll wait for a valuation that\u2019s truly astronomical, and then take the other side of the bet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run into trouble over the next few quarters.\u201dDespite many of its somewhat juvenile features, at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate, substituting images for language. \u201cSnapchat has built a better mousetrap,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s engaging, and it\u2019s fun, especially for young people.\u201dThat\u2019s a story that obviously appealed to investors starving for the next hot social media company. Whether they\u2019ll want to cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains to be seen.\u201cThis looks and smells like Twitter to me,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time, if ever, before they see any meaningful appreciation.\u201dAbout the best Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Gold could come up with: Snap\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t \u201cpatently crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(San Francisco, Paris and Tokyo are home to additional labs.)Since the incubator opened, Mr. Balooch has overseen the development of five products \u2014 a mix of wearables, objects and apps \u2014 that further his vision of a future in which cosmetics are connected, customized and designed to meet each consumer\u2019s needs.Take his team\u2019s latest invention: the K\u00e9rastase Hair Coach Powered by Withings. Introduced in early January at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the sleek silver hairbrush \u2014 the product of a three-way partnership of the incubator, the smart technology maker Withings and K\u00e9rastase, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s luxury hair-care brand \u2014 is described as the world\u2019s first smart brush.\u201cMore than 50 percent of Google searches today in beauty are about hair,\u201d Mr. Balooch explained.The device aims to banish bad hair days by offering technical insights into the state of the user\u2019s locks, plus personalized advice on how best to care for them.Scheduled to go on sale this year for less than $200, the brush contains a conductivity sensor that knows whether hair is wet or dry; an accelerometer and gyroscope to measure the speed and force of brush strokes; a microphone that captures auditory data; and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity to upload all that information to an app, which uses an algorithm to analyze the statistics and detect breakage. And, oh yeah \u2014 the bristles feel pretty good, too.\u201cIt was very important for us to make a high-end device that, taking all the technology and sophisticated aspects away, is the best brush you\u2019ll ever see,\u201d said C\u00e9dric Hutchings, chief executive of Withings and vice president for digital health at Nokia, which developed the hardware.Mr. Balooch said the brush uses a combination of synthetic fibers \u201cthat mimic $200 to $300 brushes on the market.\u201dIt\u2019s a category he knows well. In 2007, after earning a doctorate in biomaterials from the University of California, San Francisco, and following postdoctoral studies in cell biomechanics at Stanford, he took a job with L\u2019Or\u00e9al in Chicago, where he was challenged to \u201cunderstand the physics of hair,\u201d he said.\u201cI would take hairs of ethnic descent and I would test relaxers on them, shampoos, conditioners, then I would break the hairs on a machine,\u201d he said.Mr. Balooch\u2019s work impressed the L\u2019Or\u00e9al brass, who in 2008 asked him to join the company\u2019s research and innovation team, and build relationships with start-ups and universities. When the incubator was formed five years ago, he was \u201cthe right man for the job,\u201d said Mr. Balooch\u2019s manager, Stephan Habif, senior vice president for L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s research and innovation arm in the Americas. \u201cThis is L\u2019Or\u00e9al \u2014 we believe in entrepreneurship.\u201dThat may explain why the incubator is staffed by men and women who share Mr. Balooch\u2019s academia-meets-Silicon Valley background.\u201cI hand-chose everybody more for their souls than their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s,\u201d Mr. Balooch explained. \u201cIf you put a UX designer, a physicist, a biologist and a micro-engineer all together in a room, the tension between their ideas creates really cool things.\u201dMakeup Genius, the incubator\u2019s first project, proved him right. Introduced in May 2014, the virtual makeup app relies on augmented reality technology, in which graphics are superimposed onto real-world imagery, to let users try on various shades of L\u2019Or\u00e9al cosmetics before buying.Mr. Balooch said he tried to make the app, which boasts more than 17 million downloads, in-house until perfecting the feature that distinguished Makeup Genius from other such apps (its ability to track facial movements in real time) proved a formidable challenge.\u201cSo I said, \u2018Would you be interested in making an app with us around makeup?\u2019\u201d Mr. Balooch recalled. \u201cSix months later, we had Makeup Genius.\u201dThe incubator\u2019s second project, the Lanc\u00f4me Le Teint Particulier, is a customized foundation blended at the point of sale using a color-matching algorithm that sorts through 22,000 skin tones.Le Teint Particulier, introduced in 2015 in two Nordstrom locations and scheduled to be rolled out globally this year, isn\u2019t the first custom foundation on the market, but Mr. Balooch contends that it is the most accurate.\u201cYou could have a beautiful display, but if you don\u2019t go home with a product that really is to your skin tone, you\u2019re never going to reorder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people cry when they try it. Because it\u2019s meeting a consumer need.\u201dIn the case of one project \u2014 My UV Patch, introduced in January 2016 by L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s La Roche-Posay skin care brand \u2014 that need might even be lifesaving.The heart-shaped patch is a wearable adhesive containing photosensitive dyes that change color when exposed to UV rays.To demonstrate how easy it is to use, Mr. Balooch peeled off the back of one sticker \u2014 it measures about one inch and is half the thickness of a strand of hair \u2014 and affixed it to his left hand. \u201cIt\u2019s like a second skin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt lasts up to five days. You can wrinkle the skin with it, you can shower. We had people swimming with it.\u201dWhen paired with an app, Mr. Balooch said the monitoring device had been proven to change behavior.\u201cThe data today shows 60 percent of people who use the app have less sunburn and 30 percent are using more sunscreen,\u201d he said.\u201cI love the idea of that project because it\u2019s truly about changing the lives of consumers. Because we\u2019re in R. & D., our goal is not to market products. Our goal is to make great consumer technologies and then work with marketing to put a beautiful story behind them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from a company developing the K\u00e9rastase Hair Coach Powered by Withings, misstated the hairbrush\u2019s price. When it goes on sale later this year, the brush will be sold for less than $200, but it will not be $179.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Cool Robot May Be a Security Risk", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the coming age of robotics, many of those autonomous machines will be internet-connected and mobile.What could possibly go wrong?The researchers, who described the categories of vulnerabilities they had discovered in the report but not the specific flaws, said their research was simply an early reconnaissance of the field.\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that our testing was not even a deep, extensive security audit, as that would have taken a much larger investment of time and resources,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe goal for this work was to gain a high-level sense of how insecure today\u2019s robots are, which we accomplished.\u201dDespite the general nature of the report, industry specialists warn that if robot makers fail to take a security-first approach, it may haunt them.\u201cThe desire for online commerce brought strong cryptographic algorithms into our daily lives,\u201c said Joe Britt, the chief executive of Afero, a Los Altos, Calif.-based maker of secure communications systems for the world of so-called embedded computing. \u201cAs embedded systems for sensors and robotics flourish in the next wave of computing, failure to apply these proven safeguards is like leaving the locks off of our doors.\u201dThe research underscores the potential security challenges that await the world of mobile robots. Given the popularity of stationary home robotic systems like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home personal assistants as well as dozens of other internet-connected devices like doorbells, video cameras and even light bulbs, it appears that consumers are willing to trust that manufacturers are building adequate security into the products.It is common for manufacturers that do not have good security practices to not know how to deal with vulnerability reports. Most of them probably do not have a procedure in place to handle reports and neither to provide security fixes to customers.Robots are widely used in manufacturing. But they are largely systems like robot arms that do not have autonomous functions and cannot move around in the environment.There is a growing consensus that during the next decade, advances in artificial intelligence will make it possible for robots to move freely in unstructured environments. This will bring self-driving cars closer to reality and will also lead to a generation of machines that will operate autonomously in homes, offices and factories.The authors of the new report challenged the robotics industry, saying that not enough attention was being given to well-known security issues that have proved devastating for existing commercial computer networks.\u201cWe call it an internet-of-things with arms and legs and wheels,\u201d said Cesar Cerrudo, chief technology officer of IOActive. \u201cThe surface of attack is huge. Each robot has multiple ways it can be compromised.\u201dThe researchers said that robot makers were rushing their products to market without giving adequate consideration to security.\u201cVendors like to add features that please the public,\u201d said Lucas Apa, a senior security consultant at IOActive and one of the authors of the report. \u201cThey forget about important issues. Robots can have microphones and cameras; they can walk and they can grab objects. People don\u2019t realize the consequences of something that can grab an object or can hear or see you.\u201dThe report identifies security flaws in a number of robots, including NAO and Pepper home robots made by SoftBank Robotics; and manufacturing robots from Universal Robots and Rethink Robotics, two makers of robot arms that are intended to collaborate with human workers in assembly line applications. It also identifies flaws in small humanoid robots made by UBTECH Robotics and Robotis, and in robotics software developed by Asratec Corp.The report identifies seven different kinds of security issues, ranging from weak cryptographic systems and vulnerable default configurations to what security experts call authentication issues.In some cases, they noted that it was possible to control some robot functions without authentication.\u201cWe found key robot services that didn\u2019t require a username and password, allowing anyone to remotely access those services,\u201d the report said.One of the robot manufacturers identified by the report disputed the findings. Two of the criticisms leveled by the researchers actually involved \u201cfeatures\u201d added for research and education markets, according to Gil Haylon, a Rethink Robotics spokesman. He added that other vulnerabilities had been \u201cphased out\u201d in the latest software release for the company\u2019s Baxter and Sawyer robots, which are intended for light assembly operations.Universal Robots said it was looking into the issue raised by the researchers. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb\u2019s Rivals in China Hold Hands in a Nervous New Market", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Sun Huifeng liked the idea of tapping Airbnb or one of its rising local competitors to rent out his spare Beijing bedroom.The problem: He didn\u2019t like the idea of a stranger in his house.\u201cI mainly worry about the quality of guests,\u201d said Mr. Sun, 31, a marketer for an information technology company. \u201cOr, to speak more plainly, I was even worried that some criminals might come.\u201dXiaozhu, a Chinese version of Airbnb, swung into action. It ran him through the company\u2019s guest-vetting system, helped him install a password-based lock on the door to his Beijing apartment and provided bright pink cushions for his sofa. Twice a week, Mr. Sun carefully waters the plants Xiaozhu gave him.Airbnb sees big promise in China, where travel spending reached nearly $500 billion in 2015 thanks to a new generation of domestic tourists. On Wednesday in Shanghai, Airbnb unveiled a new Chinese name \u2014 Aibiying, which means \u201cwelcome each other with love\u201d \u2014 as well as efforts to increase local hiring and deals to draw visitors to Shanghai with offers such as behind-the-scenes visits to the Chinese opera.\u201cOur mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere,\u201d Brian Chesky, Airbnb\u2019s chief executive, said in Shanghai on Wednesday. \u201cIf we are going to achieve our mission of belonging anywhere, anywhere must include China, and anyone must include Chinese travelers.\u201dBut like other global tech firms with an eye on China, Airbnb faces challenges. Chief among them are domestic versions of the site, including Xiaozhu and another rival, Tujia, that offer more local listings. To counter Airbnb\u2019s advantage with cosmopolitan Chinese who may have used its service in New York, Paris or Tokyo, the competitors are taking big steps to educate other skeptical Chinese about renting out \u2014 and crashing in \u2014 a spare bedroom.The cultural barriers are significant. In a country where a home is for family or for investment and tourism is still relatively new for many, the idea of posting homes online for random guests to rent takes some getting used to.\u201cThere is a manager behind every property,\u201d said Kelvin Chen, the chief executive of Xiaozhu. \u201cWe still need time to educate our users.\u201dCrucially, like LinkedIn, another international hopeful in China, Airbnb complies with Chinese laws requiring it to keep Chinese data only on domestically based Chinese servers. That could expose it to requests from the Chinese surveillance authorities to track any of its users. Last year, Airbnb sent a message to its users in China informing them that data would be stored in the country.For Airbnb, which has only about 80,000 listings in China, its more than three million listings around the world put it in a strong position to cater to the millions of Chinese who travel overseas each year. It also has outreach efforts, like informational events for hosts and occasional promotions offering free photography for hosts with apartments they want to rent out.Natasia Guo, a longtime Airbnb host and entrepreneur in China, said most visitors tended to be younger, while the odd middle-aged guest did not seem to understand how the service was supposed to work. Of one 40-year-old guest, she said: \u201cHe treated my place like a hotel. And the reason I say that is he started smoking in the room.\u201d\u201cI think he was using one of our bowls as an ashtray,\u201d she said.Xiaozhu, which has about 140,000 listings, seeks to reassure hosts against such problems. It also works with the internet censorship department and the public security bureau, which helps weed out users with a criminal record. For the benefit of guests, it offers its own cleaning services as well as training events to teach hosts how to get along with customers and decorate their homes.Tujia, a competitor with more than 420,000 listings, more directly manages many of the apartments it showcases, either itself or through management firms. In some cases, it works with property developers sitting on unsold units. For those it does not manage, it conducts inspections and also maintains a blacklist of problematic guests. Many of Tujia\u2019s users stay for a longer period of time or use the properties for vacation.David Wang, 52, a Beijing resident, said his nephew first suggested renting out the spare room in his mother\u2019s courtyard house in the capital. But Mr. Wang\u2019s 89-year-old mother took some persuading. To assuage her concerns, the family segregated the room from the rest of the house, blocking the door to the courtyard, and created a new entryway from the road. Then they installed a closed circuit television. They listed the room on Xiaozhu, which provided linens, a picture frame, lamps, curtains and a small Ikea table.\u201cNow she is happy because every cent from the rent goes into her account,\u201d Mr. Wang said.The companies are counting on younger Chinese to catch on as both hosts and guests. \u201cChinese millennials are keen to have an authentic experience,\u201d said Jens Thraenhart, president of Digital Innovation Asia, which connects Asian tourism business with digital know-how.Zhu Jiamin, a 28-year-old from Shanghai, said he just started hosting on Airbnb, in part because of the positive experiences he had traveling overseas using the site and other services like Couchsurfing. He said he had no problem having long conversations with guests or sometimes showing them around. Other friends rent out apartments and pull out the stops to attract guests.\u201cThey have photos that are way too fancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe places are decorated with flowers, and some of them even hire models, some beautiful girls, for the photos.\u201dMr. Zhu said that he chose to focus more on having meaningful exchanges with people who stay at his place. \u201cYou just feel that their photos don\u2019t represent the people who live there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a home. It\u2019s a fancy place to take photos.\u201dMr. Sun, who received the pink cushions from Xiaozhu, said he had also come to enjoy the company of his guests and the income he received from them, which totals about $300 to $600 a month. One was a Sichuan cook brimming with gossip about the entertainment business. Another played mah-jongg.\u201cMah-jongg is my hobby,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the guests want to play mah-jongg, I get pretty excited.\u201dCao Li and Zhang Tiantian contributed research from Beijing, and Ailin Tang from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Immelt, General Electric\u2019s chief executive, says climate change is real, a position at odds with the Trump administration.As a member of a White House manufacturing advisory council, he also has President Trump\u2019s ear. And environmentalists are counting on Mr. Immelt, and other executives close to the president, to use that access to argue for policies to combat global warming when the White House is rolling them back.\u201cMr. Trump says the business perspective is especially important, so hearing the business voice is critical,\u201d said Kevin Moss, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington.\u201cThe companies are demonstrating that it\u2019s in their business interest to take action on climate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more they\u2019re willing to say that and take action, the stronger the message comes across.\u201dThose hopes have become increasingly urgent as Mr. Trump \u2014 against the warnings of scientists, environmentalists and even the government\u2019s own research \u2014 has moved to nullify the Obama administration\u2019s efforts on climate change.In a joint statement after the order, a group of technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, urged Mr. Trump to stay the course.\u201cStrong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change,\u201d they said.That action also spurred Mr. Immelt to write a blog post to G.E.\u2019s 300,000 employees in which he criticized the rollback.Jennifer Friedman, a General Electric spokeswoman, declined to say whether Mr. Immelt intended to relay his thoughts to Mr. Trump personally. Many other companies also declined to commit their executives to intervening with the president on climate-related policies.But Ms. Friedman emphasized that Mr. Immelt was outspoken, and she cited G.E.\u2019s focus on clean energy, including Current, a subsidiary that focuses on products and services in energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage to large customers.\u201cHe\u2019s pretty out there and clear,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s his position in every conversation he has.\u201dA PepsiCo spokesman, Jay Cooney, said the company believes that \u201ccombating climate change is critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers and our world.\u201d Kevin Gardner of Walmart, said its environmental commitments were \u201cembedded in our business.\u201dThomas Hushen, spokesman for Campbell Soup, said the company supported \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in the Paris agreement and the continuation of low-carbon policies and investment in a low-carbon economy.\u201d Campbell\u2019s chief executive, Denise Morrison, participates in Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory council because \u201cwe believe it is important to have a voice on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees.\u201d Mr. Hushen said.Corporations, especially those with strong consumer brands, have been increasingly responsive to customer and shareholder concerns about climate change. And the global nature of their businesses means many of their customers are in countries where there is a greater acceptance of the science behind climate change, and the need to tackle it.Walmart, Intel, General Motors and Lockheed Martin \u2014 all of which have senior executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business councils \u2014 have signed on to the principles of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofit groups working to make corporate purchases of renewable energy easier. Last year, General Motors said it would generate or procure 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050.Dell, another company with the president\u2019s ear, says it expects to reduce the energy intensity of its products by 80 percent by 2020.\u201cIn many cases, I think businesses disagree with the administration,\u201d said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder resolutions to advocate for greater corporate environmental and social responsibility.\u201cPeople still care about climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cThe administration may not, but they do have consumers and employees and reputations to uphold.\u201dAn Intel spokeswoman, Katie Lewallen, said, \u201cRegardless of regulatory changes, we intend to continue our commitment to environmental stewardship, including working to fulfill the climate change pledge we made in 2015.\u201dEnvironmentalists also worry about the influence of companies that have opposed climate regulations. General Motors and Ford, for example, successfully advocated a review of stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution.Businesses are pushing for policies to fight climate change \u201cbecause of a well-balanced economic judgment of whether or not they should,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group.He added that sentiment among corporate executives had, after the 2009 global climate conference in Copenhagen, shifted away from the belief that fighting climate change would be too expensive.\u201cIn Paris, there was a very significant number of business leaders that had changed their minds and considered that it was going to hurt the economy if we don\u2019t do something,\u201d he said.Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Traditional media, in a hypercompetitive 24-7 news environment, can rush to report fresh details. All of this has made for a media morass in which fake news, hate speech and unverified information may overrun basic facts.Before British officials identified Mr. Masood on Thursday, they urged media outlets to avoid publishing the names of any suspects in the attack. But the pleas did little to stop the misinformation online, particularly in the hours immediately after the event.In the digital era, people increasingly seek real-time coverage, readily supplied by all manner of sources, credible and otherwise.

And \u2014,\u201d sort of the way a reader feels when finishing a good mystery.I plugged away for a while on this puzzle before gaining any traction, and I\u2019d say more of the clues were tricky than not. I especially struggled with many of the shorter fill words that I usually rely on for entry, such as KIP, COIT and COO, but I feel that hints on some longer words would be of more value to those of us trying to solve, so here are a few of those:\u25a0 30A: \u201cBackstage Broadway worker\u201d seems pretty straightforward, but I came up with a ton of jobs before hitting on COSTUMER, which apparently is itself a crossword debut.\u25a0 45A: \u201cVery light\u201d sent me hunting for descriptions of pale colors, humorous writing, even close to weightlessness; I eventually got enough crosses for ETHEREAL to emerge. The definition is correct but I always imagine fairies, art nouveau maidens and gossamer damselflies as clues for this, so it didn\u2019t come to mind.\u25a0 67A: The question mark alerted me, but it didn\u2019t occur to me in the slightest that \u201cWent door to door?\u201d could pertain to a car accident in which one was SIDESWIPED. I still thought of salespeople and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, but I thought this one was a clever gotcha.\u25a0 36D: This was another straightforward definition that worked with loads of answers and concerned a worrying array of technical tools, the names of which escaped me. \u201cCertain chemistry lab apparatus\u201d could have referred to extractors, condensers, cylinders, flasketers, burettes (I\u2019m making stuff up now that sounds scientific)... TITRATOR certainly does, and was one of the last words I was able to fill in. Also a new word for the puzzle.47D: So, I have created these by mistake, when you don\u2019t end a command correctly and have to reach into your frantically cycling program and grab its gyrating necktie and hang on for dear life. I know there are many reasons programmers create these DO LOOPs, but when I looked to Google for examples, for some reason I got this motivational speech by someone who also coincidentally appears in this grid, and I really couldn\u2019t look away.

{"Headline": "\u2018Photo Archives Are Sleeping Beauties.\u2019 Pharos Is Their Prince.", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported bySome 20,000 green boxes \u2014 each about the size of a large coffee table book \u2014 are neatly lined up, row after row, stacked high on shelving and packed with folders that are, in turn, filled with pictures of artworks. Immaculately typed pages of information about each work are tucked alongside the photographs. The room smells exactly as it\u2019s supposed to: musty but clean, and reassuringly proper.More than one million works \u2014 far beyond what\u2019s in the Frick\u2019s own collection \u2014 are documented in the archive, and although the public isn\u2019t allowed in the stacks, any of the contents can be requested and viewed in the wood-paneled Frick Art Reference Library.Pharos will link and make accessible the photographic holdings that all the institutions in the consortium possess.In the words of Thomas Gaehtgens, the director of the Getty Research Institute, one of the Pharos participants: \u201cAll these photo archives are Sleeping Beauties, and they are waiting to be discovered and kissed.\u201dPharos may transform the work of art historians, its intended audience, but anyone will be able to use it, and it could have broad implications for genealogical research and art restitution, and perhaps other unforeseen applications.Ms. Reist, the Frick\u2019s Pharos point person and the consortium\u2019s president, used a famous artwork as an example of how Pharos will work: Hans Holbein the Younger\u2019s 1527 portrait of Sir Thomas More. The original painting is in the Frick\u2019s collection, and a quick Google search tells you a lot about it.Beyond the Frick, there is a miniature version in London that some attribute to Holbein, as well as numerous copies by different artists in various public and private collections, and works that were painted either as a reference to the original or as a homage. Pharos will provide access to images of all these works, including some that have not been reproduced in publications.Pharos users will be able to search the restoration history of the works, including different states of the same piece over time (sometimes dealers and owners modified paintings, for instance); past ownership; and even background on related works that have been lost or destroyed.It\u2019s the ultimate art historical deep dive, and an idealistic vision for sharing knowledge \u2014 perhaps one that More, the author of \u201cUtopia,\u201d would have appreciated.The Pharos consortium, with its commitment to scholarly depth, is also working on image-recognition technology so that language barriers will be eradicated from the scholars\u2019 searches.\u201cIf images can find each other, with no language mediation, that\u2019s the holy grail for an art historian,\u201d Ms. Reist said. \u201cWe want that for Pharos.\u201dShe noted that the project is a major commitment for all the institutions. \u201cThere\u2019s no single funder,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has to pay for their own work on it. And it\u2019s costly.\u201d She estimated that the Frick would spend more than $5 million on Pharos initially.The project officially began in New York in 2013, at a meeting of the 14 institutions that was sponsored by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation. The first marker of critical mass, having around one-third of the images digitized, is expected sometime in 2020 \u2014 scanning millions of photographs is time-consuming in the extreme.\u201cPeople expect everything to be online, but it takes forever,\u201d said Johannes Roell, the head of the photography collection of the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome, which is in the consortium and part of the Max Planck Society.Mr. Roell said that 150,000 of the 850,000 photographs at the Hertziana had been digitized in a \u201cPharos-ready\u201d state so far.The motivation for all the institutions was clear: Analog materials like photographs don\u2019t last forever. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned these unique works will disappear,\u201d Ms. Reist said, adding: \u201cWe know how urgent this is. We\u2019re living in a Wiki world. All younger art historians start their research online.\u201d\u201cIt was a wake-up call to all our institutions to work together and form a consortium,\u201d Mr. Roell said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do this, we are digging our own graves.\u201dThat the Frick is taking the lead may surprise some of its regular visitors.Helen Clay Frick, the daughter of the museum\u2019s founder, the steel magnate Henry Clay Frick, established the institution\u2019s art reference library in 1920.\u201cWith photo archives in the 1910s and \u201920s, it was really hard to find a good photo of a work of art, and that hobbled art historians,\u201d Mr. Wardropper said. \u201cSo Helen Clay Frick started commissioning photographs of artworks, and it has grown over the decades to 1.2 million photographs.\u201dMr. Wardropper noted that in 2015, 2,500 visitors had come to the Frick to use its photo archives, compared with 75,000 who did online searches. \u201cAnd that will only go up with this tool,\u201d he added.Like any ambitious project that tries to catalog knowledge, Pharos will be continuing. Its organizers plan to add more partners. \u201cThe 14 institutions are the critical mass to start, but we want it to be scalable,\u201d Ms. Reist said. \u201cIt will never be finished.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Times\u2019s technology columnist discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As a technology columnist, what devices and apps do you use to do your job?My primary work computer is an amazing 5k iMac desktop, but I spend more than half of my computing time on my phone, an iPhone 7.Which is your favorite product and why?I really like my iPhone; they\u2019ve caused lots of problems, but on the whole, I think we\u2019re better off with smartphones than without.And yet I wouldn\u2019t say any of these are really my favorites. Technology occupies a weird space in my life. I love it more than anything for its potential, but I\u2019m always disappointed in its failure to live up to what\u2019s possible. My phone has changed everything about my life, much of it for the better, and yet I find myself hating it often \u2014 it can be buggy, the battery life is dismal, I miss the headphone jack, etc. The comedian Louis C. K. has a funny routine about how we\u2019re all ungrateful about tech. I\u2019m that guy, unashamedly.Email is just terrible. I use Google\u2019s Inbox app, which has some nice features to automatically sort email, but I still find email a huge chore. More and more of my communications are moving to other channels \u2014 Slack, mobile messaging, Twitter DMs, encrypted apps like Signal, and after last year\u2019s Clinton-campaign email hacks, I\u2019ve even started to make more phone calls. The sooner we can all get off email the better.What new tech product are you currently obsessed with using at home? What do you and your family do with it? This is going to sound weird, but I\u2019m a strange person. I have two kids, ages 6 and 4, and for the last few years I\u2019ve been mourning their loss of childhood. Every day they get a little bit older, and even though my wife and I take lots of photos and videos of them, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that we\u2019re losing most of the moments of their lives.So last summer, after some intense lobbying of my wife, I did something radical: I installed several cameras in my living room and dining room to record everything we did at home for posterity. In other words, I created a reality show in my house.In practice, it works like this: The cameras are motion-activated and connected to servers in the cloud. Like security cameras in a convenience store, they are set to record on a constant loop \u2014 every video clip is saved for a few days, after which it\u2019s automatically deleted, unless I flag it for long-term keeping.And yet I\u2019ve found these cameras to be just wonderful at capturing the odd, beautiful, surprising, charming moments of life that we would never have been able to capture otherwise. Every time the kids say something hilarious or sweet, or do something for the first time, I make a note of the time and date. Later on, I can go and download that exact clip, to keep forever. I\u2019ve already got amazing videos of weeknight dinners, of my wife and I watching the news on election night, of my son learning to play Super Mario Brothers, and my kids having a dance party to their favorite music.When I\u2019m 80 and the robots have taken over, I\u2019ll look back on these and remember that life was good, once.O.K. How old do you think a child must be to get that first smartphone? In general, our policy for devices isn\u2019t based on time but quality. If my kids are going to use their iPads, I want them to use them for experiences that aren\u2019t totally bad for them. So, for instance, we\u2019ve put curbs on how much they can use YouTube, which they use to watch the most garbage videos (usually of other kids playing with toys). But for other stuff \u2014 games, for instance \u2014 they\u2019re allowed to play for an hour or two on the weekends.I really haven\u2019t thought much about when I\u2019ll get them their own phones. It\u2019s a looming crisis \u2014 I know it\u2019s unavoidable, and I\u2019ll probably give in when they\u2019re around 11 or 12, but I\u2019m sure going to hate the feeling of losing them to their gadgets. Of course that\u2019s probably how they feel about me and my phone.Advertisement"}

Edison Jackson, the president of Bethune-Cookman, said of Arizona Summit, \u201cTogether, we aim to be a leading force in disrupting a legacy of exclusion that has persisted into the 21st century.\u201d Officials from both schools claim that their goal is to increase \u201cdiversity\u201d in legal education.But encouraging African-American students to attend Arizona Summit will not help them achieve their goals. It will hobble them. Going to a law school that doesn\u2019t prepare most of its students to pass the bar is not an \u201copportunity,\u201d unless \u201copportunity\u201d means being saddled with debt that you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life trying to pay back.For-profit schools like Arizona Summit prey on students with high aspirations but little knowledge about how the postgraduate system really works. Many black students aren\u2019t just the first people in their families to go to graduate school \u2014 they are the only people they know in the game. Information passed down from family, friends or mentors is hard to get when you don\u2019t have people in your life who have been there. Too many aspiring black students are trying to piece together education plans based on career fairs and Google searches.I was the first person in my family to go to law school, but I went to Harvard for undergrad. Harvard teaches you how to play the game.In other words, long before I sat down for my first LSAT prep session, I knew precisely the LSAT score I needed to get in order to go to the schools I wanted. Do you realize how powerful this information was?Getting into professional schools like law and medicine is not art \u2014 it\u2019s math. Here\u2019s a formula: G.P.A. x Test Score / Demographics = Admission Decision. That formula is not bulletproof; it\u2019s possible to quirk one\u2019s way into a particular school. But in broad strokes, the grids reveal exactly what numbers each student needs to get into the law schools he or she desires.When I applied, I didn\u2019t randomly send out applications and hope for the best. I was studying for a specific score, to get into specific schools, following the specific plan of action I mapped out with my pre-law advisers.Is Bethune-Cookman compiling the grids and disseminating that information to pre-law students?I\u2019m forced to conclude that this deal isn\u2019t about diversity in legal education, for either institution. Arizona Summit wants legitimacy, and Bethune-Cookman needs to expand its geographic footprint.Arizona Summit is owned by the InfiLaw company, which owns three law schools, including one in Florida. Bethune-Cookman didn\u2019t go with the local for-profit diploma mill because it\u2019s trying to market itself to students who live west of the Mississippi. It shouldn\u2019t be aligning itself with an out-of-state law school purely for marketing purposes.The best thing any historically black college could do to \u201cdisrupt\u201d exclusionary legacies in legal education would be to arm its students with the very information from which they have been excluded, information that would help them get into good schools \u2014 or at least keep them out of predatory ones.

{"Headline": "Lyft Is Said to Seek New Funding as Its Rival Uber Stumbles", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byLyft, the second-largest ride hailing company in the United States, is trying to raise more money just as Uber, its bigger rival, grapples with questions about its culture and leadership.Lyft is talking with investors about new fund-raising that would put the company\u2019s value around $6 billion, according to three people briefed on the financing who asked to remain anonymous because the proceedings are confidential. One of the people said the valuation could be as high as $7 billion.The fund-raising may bolster Lyft competitively, given that Uber has been caught up in an escalating series of internal problems.Uber has also wrestled with concerns about its workplace culture over the past few weeks, after a former employee published an account of her year at the company, which included allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.This week, Mr. Kalanick apologized for his behavior toward an Uber driver after a video of him losing his temper with the driver surfaced.Yet Lyft\u2019s brand has recently looked comparatively attractive. As Uber struggled with its ties to President Trump\u2019s administration in January, Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union.

Most importantly, so do the victims and families.\u201dAfter several terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere, the region\u2019s lawmakers and regulators, as well as some of their counterparts in the United States, now want Silicon Valley companies to do more to tackle potential threats.For many policy makers, that includes opening up services like WhatsApp and Telegram, a rival messaging tool, to national intelligence agencies when they are investigating terrorist activities.\u201cWe do want them to recognize that they have a responsibility to engage with government, to engage with law enforcement agencies when there is a terrorist situation,\u201d Ms. Rudd told the BBC on Sunday, referring to tech companies. \u201cThey cannot get away with saying we are in a different situation. They are not.\u201dTech companies and digital rights advocates have said such efforts would infringe on human rights because providing the authorities with access to such messaging services would require weakening their overall levels of encryption. That, they argue, would leave people who use those services vulnerable to outsiders.Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in an email: \u201cWe are horrified by the attack carried out in London,\u201d adding that the company was \u201ccooperating with law enforcement.\u201dOfficials in Britain, however, are going a step further. And by demanding that intelligence agencies be allowed to read encrypted messages, Ms. Rudd is reiterating long-held plans to gain more control over digital services.Tech companies say they cannot hand over such information because internet messages are sent through so-called end-to-end encryption.This technology scrambles messages to make them indecipherable to anyone but their intended recipient. It also makes messages unreadable when they pass through an app\u2019s server, meaning companies do not have the ability to provide the information to law enforcement even if they wanted to.If such technology is weakened, campaigners say, governments and hackers could gain access to encrypted messages, reducing people\u2019s ability to communicate privately online.\u201cCompelling companies to put back doors into encrypted services would make millions of ordinary people less secure online,\u201d said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, a British nonprofit. \u201cWe all rely on encryption to protect our ability to communicate, shop and bank safely.\u201dSewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Waymo has said that Mr. Levandowski, who joined Uber six months after leaving Google, when the ride-hailing service bought his start-up Otto for $680 million in August, colluded with Uber to steal information about Waymo\u2019s self-driving vehicle technology.Waymo filed a motion seeking a temporary injunction this month to stop Uber\u2019s driverless car development.Uber wants to settle the lawsuit in arbitration, arguing that Waymo\u2019s claims stem from Mr. Levandowski\u2019s time at Google and are covered by an arbitration clause in his employment contract. Arbitration is usually less expensive and proceeds faster than a federal lawsuit. It is not argued in front of a jury, and arbitration hearings are not part of the public record.In Wednesday\u2019s motion, Uber said that Waymo filed two arbitration demands against Mr. Levandowski in October saying that he breached the confidentiality agreement in his employment contract with Google when he used confidential salary information to make \u201ctargeted offers to Waymo\u2019s employees\u201d to aid Uber and Otto.

The House is expected to mirror the Senate\u2019s action next week, followed by a signature from President Trump.The move means Verizon, Comcast or AT&T can continue tracking and sharing people\u2019s browsing and app activity without permission, and it alarmed consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers. They warned that broadband providers have the widest look into Americans\u2019 online habits, and that without the rules, the companies would have more power to collect data on people and sell sensitive information.\u201cThese were the strongest online privacy rules to date, and this vote is a huge step backwards in consumer protection writ large,\u201d said Dallas Harris, a policy fellow for the consumer group Public Knowledge. \u201cThe rules asked that when things were sensitive, an internet service provider asked permission first before collecting. That\u2019s not a lot to ask.\u201d\u201cIt is unnecessary, confusing and adds another innovation-stifling regulation,\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said this month when he introduced the resolution to overturn the rules using the Congressional Review Act procedure that lets Congress overrule new agency regulations.The Senate\u2019s vote was a victory for giant telecommunications and cable companies. The F.C.C. chairman under the Obama administration, Tom Wheeler, had declared that broadband would be regulated more heavily, by categorizing the service in the same regulatory bucket as telephone services, which are viewed as utilities.That move acknowledged the importance of the internet for communications, education, work and commerce and the need to protect online users, Mr. Wheeler had said.\u201cWe appreciate today\u2019s Senate action to repeal unwarranted F.C.C. rules that deny consumers consistent privacy protection online and violate competitive neutrality,\u201d the cable industry lobby group, NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, said in a statement on Thursday.The F.C.C. chairman, Mr. Pai, has also talked with Republican allies in Congress about privacy and broadband classification. Mr. Pai has already chipped away at more than a dozen regulations, including aspects of net neutrality and the program, known as Lifeline, that provides subsidies for broadband users in low-income households.Consumer groups warned that internet users would suffer from the changes. The Federal Trade Commission, the consumer protection agency, is barred from overseeing broadband providers, so without the F.C.C. privacy rules, the federal government will be a weaker watchdog over internet privacy, supporters of the regulations said.\u201cSenate Republicans just made it easier for Americans\u2019 sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared and sold to the highest bidder without their permission,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.Democrats had taken to the Senate floor on Wednesday and Thursday to warn that without the rules, broadband providers will now have free range to peer into their customers\u2019 lives. A company like AT&T or Sprint can tell the time people wake up by when they check the clock on their phone, or see where users go to lunch or whom they visit. By tracking a user\u2019s browsing of medical websites, a carrier can also determine if that person might have an illness.The Senate\u2019s action also signaled a philosophical shift on tech regulation. Lawmakers and Mr. Pai have said regulations should be created only when there is proof of harmful activity. They also argue that the telecom industry competes with internet firms such as Facebook and Google for access to online content, so any rules should also include those companies. Republicans have said the F.T.C. should be the watchdog for all online privacy.But Democratic regulators have said the key difference is that consumers do not have many choices for broadband access, which makes them vulnerable to data collection by internet service providers.\u201cSubscribers have little or no competitive choice as to which provider to use,\u201d said Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic commissioner of the F.T.C.

{"Headline": "New York Has a Great Subway, if You\u2019re Not in a Wheelchair", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byDisabilityNearly eight years ago, on a bright summer morning in Manhattan, I was walking through Central Park when an enormous rotted tree branch snapped and fell on my head.What came next was a remarkable turn of events that saved my life. First, a doctor out for a morning jog saw me lying unconscious, and used a pair of jeans he dug out of my backpack to slow the bleeding until an ambulance came. I was treated at the intensive care unit at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and underwent rehabilitation at Helen Hayes Hospital in Rockland County, where a skilled medical team worked tirelessly for more than a month treating injuries to my head, lungs and spine. And over the next six months, nonstop support from loved ones and expert rehabilitative care helped me recover much of what I had lost.But there was one feat they could not accomplish. The accident had caused spinal cord damage, which partly paralyzed my lower body. It was clear I was going to have to use a wheelchair to get around.Among the first challenges I faced was navigating my neighborhood in New York on wheels. With practice, I slowly increased my range, and began getting around the city independently. I took buses, taxis and eventually the subway. I returned to work as a software engineer at Google 18 months after my accident.I felt grateful to have come back so far, but each time a broken curb tipped over my wheelchair, a taxi refused to stop for me or a stalled subway elevator left me stranded, my frustration mounted. I became increasingly aware of how large, inflexible bureaucracies with a \u201cgood enough\u201d approach to infrastructure and services can disenfranchise citizens with disabilities, many of whom cannot bridge these gaps on their own.Before my injury, I had felt that dealing with grittiness and unreliability were the price of entry for living in New York, and even took a smug pride in dealing with obstacles. Since my accident, I have been humbled to realize the often dire effect of civic dysfunction on the vulnerable, and have had to recognize that some of what I once took for resourcefulness was in truth enabled by privilege.I was once like many other able-bodied New Yorkers, only vaguely aware of subway elevators, merely noting that they seemed dingy and often out of service. But now that I needed them, the reality was more stark. New York\u2019s subway is by far the least wheelchair-friendly public transit system of any major American city, with only 92 of the system\u2019s 425 stations accessible. That means fewer than one in four stations can be used by people in wheelchairs when elevators are working \u2014 and they frequently are not.On average, 25 elevators a day stop working, and these breakdowns are not quickly resolved; their median duration is nearly four hours. Moreover, with a single elevator serving both directions at most stops, a breakdown means that a disabled rider exiting the train will be trapped on the platform, and one hoping to board will have to find some other way to travel to where they need to go.I often wheel off a train only to discover that the sole elevator to ground level is out of service. No information on alternate routes is posted as it is for other service changes and delays \u2014 indeed, subway personnel are often unaware of the situation. So the options are to wait for the next train and continue to an accessible stop \u2014 possibly many stations away \u2014 or call the fire department to be carried up the stairs.I\u2019ve done both, although on occasion fellow passengers have agreed to carry me \u2014 a 170-pound stranger in a wheelchair \u2014 up to the street. And it has been heartening to find that in moments of need, people step forward to help.But these acts by individuals cannot be accepted as a substitute for a functional system. Rather, a system that routinely leaves vulnerable riders stranded has abdicated its responsibility. The need for extraordinary goodness, like that shown by the doctor in Central Park, should be the exception, not the rule.All of this can make an accessible subway seem impossible. But it isn\u2019t.When I traveled to Boston several years ago, I was amazed to discover that its subway system \u2014 as old as New York\u2019s, though far smaller, with only 53 stations \u2014 is more than 90 percent wheelchair-accessible.Was Boston just a nicer town? Not necessarily. The admirable accessibility was legally mandated. In 2002, wheelchair users sued Boston\u2019s transit authority and the eventual settlement included guarantees for elevator construction, maintenance and monitoring.So are legal challenges the only way to get equal access for the disabled? They are undoubtedly a useful tool, and sometimes a necessary one. But however change comes, accessibility advocates will have to counter the belief that devoting resources to help one group necessarily shortchanges others.At first, the activists were threatened with arrest, but before long the first official curb cut was made and many cities followed, as they realized what now seems obvious: The curb cuts weren\u2019t useful only for wheelchair users. Parents with strollers, workers with handcarts and travelers with luggage all benefited. This action helped people with disabilities integrate further into economic and cultural life. When I go to work, or pick up my children from school, those curb cuts help me get there.I owe a debt to those activists, and to others whose actions helped move us toward the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. Now it is my turn to speak up, thank my fellow New Yorkers for their underrated kindness, and ask the transit authority to commit to follow their lead and work for all of us.Sasha Blair-Goldensohn is a software engineer at Google, disability advocate and lifelong New Yorker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building a Road Map for the Self-Driving Car", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byWheelsHow do you create a map showing every road in the United States, with the precise location of every stop sign, all the lane markings, every exit ramp and every traffic light \u2014 and update it in real time as traffic is rerouted around construction and accidents?That\u2019s a challenge that automakers and technology companies are confronting in their race to develop self-driving cars, the kind that someday will let you sit back and read or watch TV on the way to work each morning.The need for highly detailed, three-dimensional, computerized maps \u2014 which pinpoint a car\u2019s location and understand its surroundings \u2014 is often overlooked amid all the hype about autonomous vehicles. The chatter tends to focus more on the various sensors that enable cars to \u201csee\u201d the road and any obstacles in front of them. Those sensors include radar, cameras and a laser-based kind of radar known as lidar.But digital maps are an equally critical piece of the puzzle.Waymo creates the maps by driving around cars equipped with spinning lidar units mounted on their roofs that shoot out laser beams, creating images of the road and the surroundings. Human engineers, in a time-consuming process, then go over the images and tag the objects that are found, like stop signs, buildings, stoplights and do-not-enter signs. The laser equipment needed to do this scanning is expensive \u2014 it can cost $100,000 or more to outfit just one car to do this job.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.The effort may soon shift into higher gear, thanks to an idea borrowed from the internet that has helped in other fields: crowdsourcing.Mobileye supplies front-facing camera systems that enable cars to detect obstacles and brake to prevent or mitigate collisions. Starting with 2018 models, both Volkswagen and BMW will outfit their vehicles with Mobileye systems that can also transmit their precise locations and images of the roads they are traveling, which can be synthesized into one giant digital map.Mr. Shashua said his company expected to sign on many other automakers to do the same. \u201cYou can leverage the fact that you will have millions of cars with cameras \u2014 almost all the new cars that hit the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a force multiplier.\u201d\u201cFor full autonomy, we believe we need to have a high-definition map of the area we\u2019ve been operating in, a map annotated with what are the permanent fixed objects in that area,\u201d said Raj Nair, the global product development chief at Ford, which has vowed to begin producing a fully autonomous car \u2014 with no steering wheel and no pedals \u2014 by 2021.Mobileye envisions assembling its data into a giant map called Road Book, and plans to share it with Here. The idea is that Here at some point will license the mapping information for use by self-driving cars and Mobileye will get a share of that, Mr. Shashua said. Some of the money will go back to automakers like VW and BMW that add the mapping capability to their cars.\u201cThere is a revenue-sharing model between us and the carmakers,\u201d he said, noting that map services are a future business. \u201cConsumers would be paying for map services for their autonomous cars.\u201dThe reason digital maps are so important is that even the most advanced sensors, like radar and cameras, are not enough to enable a car to navigate a chaotic and changing world safely enough to allow occupants to lean back and take a snooze.Digital maps ease the burden by helping give foresight to a car\u2019s computers, and adding redundancy to the car\u2019s understanding of the situation it faces, said Civil Maps\u2019 chief executive, Sravan Puttagunta. Radar and cameras cannot always recognize a stop sign if pedestrians are standing in the way or the sign has been knocked down, he explained.\u201cBut if the map knows there is a stop sign ahead, then the sensors just need to confirm it,\u201d Mr. Puttagunta said. \u201cThen the load on the sensors and processor is much lower.\u201dThe need for data that can complement radar and camera readings was made clear last year when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died in a crash in Florida when his 2015 Tesla Model S was operating under control of the electric car\u2019s Autopilot system.As the car was traveling on a state highway at 74 miles per hour, a white tractor-trailer was crossing the road, but Autopilot\u2019s sensors had trouble recognizing it against a bright sky. Tesla has said Autopilot may have thought the truck was an overpass.A digital map could have shown that there was no overpass in that location and that an obstacle was blocking the road. As it was, neither the car nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes.Last fall, Tesla updated Autopilot, and one upgrade is a basic use of digital mapping. Cars that have the new software, known as Version 8, note the positions of road signs, bridges and other objects, and send the data to a Tesla database that other Tesla vehicles can draw on to make safe driving decisions. Tesla calls this \u201cfleet learning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They have joined an ever-growing number of high-end companies now convinced that selling online is crucial to capturing the next generation of buyers.Jules Boudrand, a Geneva-based director at the consulting firm Deloitte, said, \u201cWe did a consumer survey in six different countries, and for people between 18 and 30 years old, social media is clearly becoming the most important marketing channel, and they have a high intention of buying watches online.\u201dHe said that half of the watch executives surveyed as part of the 2016 study said they would emphasize online resellers more than any other sales channel this year, compared with only 19 percent in 2015.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a move the brands need to make to reach this younger audience,\u201d Mr. Boudrand said.Luxury houses overall were slow to adopt online selling, sure that the experience of a beautifully appointed boutique and white-glove service were fundamental parts of their allure.

(IWC\u2019s owner, Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont, is an investor in the Yoox Net-a-Porter Group.)\u201cAt the end of the day, we want to help our clients buy where and when they want,\u201d said Christoph Grainger-Herr, who will become IWC\u2019s chief executive on April 1.Another reason brands have downplayed their online operations is that it\u2019s taken a long time for them to shake the idea of the web as a discount emporium ruled by illegitimate dealers and counterfeits.So instead, luxury timepiece brands highlighted the importance of the brick-and-mortar experience and the deluxe service and education that buyers would find there.There\u2019s just one problem with that rationale: Today\u2019s buyers aren\u2019t buying it.\u201cLuxury isn\u2019t about champagne and caviar and the experience in the boutique,\u201d Mr. Clymer said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time. I\u2019d love to be able to buy a Rolex, a Vacheron or a Patek online and have it delivered to my door the next day instead of going to a boutique. I do think every brand should be online, and in two years probably will be.\u201d\u201cWe were blown away,\u201d said Vincent Brun, president of Vacheron Constantin in North America. \u201cWe wanted to increase our exposure, to speak to a clientele we didn\u2019t necessarily speak to until now.\u201dBeyond connecting with a new demographic, e-commerce can also be an important way for watch manufacturers to compete with online resellers of pre-owned timepieces.\u201cThere\u2019s so much secondhand product on the market. We wanted to be there as a direct connection to the consumer,\u201d said Karl-Friedrich Scheufele, co-president of Chopard, whose United States e-boutique opened three years ago. (Chopard\u2019s online operation has since expanded to Britain.)Indeed, the proliferation of pre-owned watches online \u2014 on sites like Crown & Caliber and Bob\u2019s Watches \u2014 can be traced to the 1980s, when men began accumulating timepieces, said Danny Govberg, owner of Govberg Jewelers in Philadelphia, a company established in 1916.Two years ago, the watch retailing company introduced an app, Govberg OnTime, for iOS and Android devices, designed for people who want to buy, trade and sell new and pre-owned watches.\u201cIn 2009 \u2014 one generation later \u2014 when gold hit $1,800, women stood in line to sell their gold jewelry, but men did not liquidate their timepieces because the knowledge of what to pay for them wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he said.\u201cSo the men just kept the watches in their drawers. It\u2019s been a 25-year accumulation.\u201dBy offering clients click-to-buy capability, transparent pricing, on-demand education, videos, phone support and, last but not least, a brick-and-mortar showroom complete with a touch-screen TV to explore the store\u2019s online inventory, Mr. Govberg represents a handful of online upstarts showing the primary watch market how omnichannel retailing is done.It\u2019s only a matter of time before the rest of the Swiss follow suit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "WikiLeaks Reignites Tensions Between Silicon Valley and Spy Agencies", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Four years ago, Edward J. Snowden\u2019s disclosures that the federal government was hacking America\u2019s leading technology companies threw the industry into turmoil.Major technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, were trying to assess how badly their core products had been compromised. But one thing clearly had been ruptured yet again: trust between intelligence agencies and Silicon Valley.\u201cAfter the Snowden disclosures, the Obama administration worked hard to re-establish relationships and government-industry partnerships,\u201d said David Gutelius, chief executive of the marketing technology company Motiva, who has worked with the federal government on national security projects. \u201cThis leak will challenge those ties to some extent. But I don\u2019t see companies simply walking away from the table as a result of this. Government and industry still need one another.\u201dThe tense relationship between the technology industry and government agencies has been well documented. After the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the government appeared to give some ground to the industry, which was angered by previously unknown snooping on their products and embarrassed by disclosures of their cooperation with intelligence agencies.The government allowed companies to describe in broad terms the number of secret court orders for access to customer information that they receive. President Barack Obama also promised that the government would share knowledge of security flaws so that they could be fixed.In that case, the government eventually found a way into the phone without Apple\u2019s assistance.Apple said Tuesday night that many of those security issues had already been patched in the latest version of its software and it was working to address remaining vulnerabilities.The leaked documents also identified at least two dozen flaws in Android, the most popular operating system for smartphones, which was developed by Alphabet\u2019s Google division.Google said it was studying the flaws identified by WikiLeaks. Android is more difficult to secure than Apple\u2019s software because many phone makers and carriers use older or customized versions of the software.The documents released by WikiLeaks reveal numerous efforts by the C.I.A. to take control of Microsoft Windows, the dominant operating system for personal computers, using malware. They include techniques for infecting DVDs and USB storage devices with malware that can be spread to computers when they are plugged in.\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the report and are looking into it,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement.Security experts said it was not surprising that the government had stockpiled flaws in major technology products to use for spying. \u201cThe real scandal and damaging thing is not knowing these things exist, but that the C.I.A. could be so careless with them that they leaked out,\u201d said Matthew D. Green, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University.Inside technology companies, the revelations set off a scramble to assess the potential damage to the security of their products.The vulnerabilities, some of which were already known in the security community, could leave individual users of computers, mobile phones and other devices open to being snooped on. Technology companies are likely to plug the holes, however, even as new ones are discovered by spy agencies and others.The more serious near-term effect could be on the reputation of the C.I.A. and the relationship between the technology industry and the intelligence community.Denelle Dixon, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox web browser and was mentioned in the WikiLeaks trove, said that if the reports were accurate, the C.I.A. and WikiLeaks were undermining the security of the internet.\u201cThe C.I.A. seems to be stockpiling vulnerabilities, and WikiLeaks seems to be using that trove for shock value rather than coordinating disclosure to the affected companies to give them a chance to fix it and protect users,\u201d Ms. Dixon said in a statement. \u201cAlthough today\u2019s disclosures are jarring, we hope this raises awareness of the severity of these issues and the urgency of collaborating on reforms.\u201dOren Falkowitz, a former N.S.A. official and the chief executive of the cyberdefense firm Area 1 Security, said that WikiLeaks, run by Julian Assange, had again succeeded in disrupting the status quo, as it did during last year\u2019s presidential election with the release of emails from the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIf you understand the Assange playbook,\u201d Mr. Falkowitz said, \u201ca lot of it is just to create chaos.\u201dBut Mr. Falkowitz added that perhaps the most important message behind Tuesday\u2019s leaks was that neither government agencies nor companies can trust their employees to keep their most precious information secret.\u201cWe expect governments to be involved in espionage,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t expect is that the people within these organizations would create vulnerabilities by disclosing them.\u201dIn a statement accompanying the documents, WikiLeaks said that the security flaws could easily fall into the wrong hands.\u201cOnce a single cyber \u2018weapon\u2019 is \u2018loose\u2019 it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike,\u201d the organization said. It said it was still reviewing whether to release any of the underlying software code.The security flaws described by WikiLeaks are intended to target individual phones. They do not appear to give the intelligence agencies the ability to intercept electronic communications en masse.\u201cWhat can you do as a user to defend?\u201d he asked. \u201cBoring stuff. Keep your software up to date. Don\u2019t run unneeded apps. Don\u2019t become a C.I.A. target.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Koh, the company\u2019s head of mobile devices, adding that Samsung was ready to start anew.The Galaxy S8 features a large 5.8-inch screen without adding bulk to the device. The company said it made room for the screen by reducing the size of the bezel \u2014 or the forehead and the chin \u2014 on the face of the device.

{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, Caltrain Upgrade Is Imperiled as Trump Withholds Funds", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The engineers of Silicon Valley are fine-tuning driverless cars, building robots designed to replicate the human brain and shaving milliseconds off internet response times.Their trip to work, however, can be a throwback to the predigital age. The region\u2019s commuter rail line is saddled with aging, smoke-spewing, diesel-powered locomotives.For more than a decade, the managers of the Silicon Valley railway, known as Caltrain, have been planning to upgrade to faster and less polluting electric trains.But those plans are now imperiled by the Trump administration\u2019s decision in February to withhold a $647 million federal grant.In this impasse, some transportation experts see a foretaste of the political infighting and financial hurdles that could plague the nationwide infrastructure projects that President Trump is promising. Reviving America\u2019s rusted and sagging infrastructure is one of the few areas where it seemed Democrats and Republicans could agree. But making these projects a reality \u2014 the \u201cnew roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land\u201d that Mr. Trump enumerated to Congress last week \u2014 will require political cooperation and accommodations that are increasingly rare in ultrapartisan times.In the case of Caltrain, the decision to withhold the grant came after California\u2019s Republican congressional delegation asked the transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, to withdraw funding because the electrified system also would be used for the state\u2019s bigger high-speed rail project, a plan they vehemently oppose.The high-speed rail line connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles is the most ambitious rail plan in the country and has been in the works for more than two decades with a projected cost of $64 billion. The project calls for completion in 2029.Despite initial support, Republicans now regard the high-speed project as too costly.\u201cWe have said no more federal dollars will go to California high-speed rail,\u201d said Representative Jeff Denham, a Republican who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Railroads. \u201cWe\u2019re very strong on that position.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Denham said the project should immediately stop.There has long been tension in California between advocates of more freeways and those favoring public transport. But the high-speed rail project had bipartisan support in its early stages. It was formally started in 1996 by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and was supported by another Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.That consensus is long gone. The letter penned by the state\u2019s 14 Republican members of Congress, including Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, called the project a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and described the Caltrain grant as an \u201cirresponsible use of taxpayer dollars.\u201dCaltrain and the high-speed rail project are administratively separate, but a 2013 agreement to share tracks as a cost-saving measure raised Republican ire.Defunding the electrification of the Silicon Valley corridor has immediate consequences for the system\u2019s 65,000 daily commuters. Caltrain had hoped to switch to its electric system by 2021. The current trains are overcrowded and breakdowns are frequent; there are more than 19 mechanical failures per month, according to Caltrain engineers. Two-thirds of the fleet has \u201creached the end of its useful life,\u201d Caltrain says.At the rail line\u2019s maintenance depot, engineers say they have trouble finding parts for the locomotives, which were built in the 1980s. And new maintenance workers need lectures from veteran technicians because they have no experience working on such old equipment.\u201cYou change out parts here and there,\u201d said Joe Navarro, director of operations and maintenance at Caltrain. \u201cWe are putting Band-Aids on. It\u2019s very challenging.\u201d\u201cWe are lucky to live in a place where innovation is in the DNA, but we don\u2019t see that for public transport,\u201d said Sridhar Iyer, a software engineer for Twitter who rides the double-decker Caltrain that runs near the headquarters of Apple, Facebook and Google. \u201cThe whole thing is stuck in the past.\u201dIn recent weeks, more than a dozen leaders of Silicon Valley firms called lawmakers to urge that the federal money be released for the Caltrain electrification project, according to Carl Guardino, the president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents most of the region\u2019s large tech companies.Mr. Guardino called the Republican campaign to block funding \u201ca misinformed effort.\u201d\u201cThe most important asset of the innovation economy are our employees,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they are stuck and stalled in traffic they are not productively creating the future.\u201dThe specific objection by Republicans is that $600 million of state funds allocated to Caltrain\u2019s electrification were initially authorized by a 2008 referendum on high-speed rail, known as Proposition 1A.\u201cThey are stealing Prop 1A money and using it for something else,\u201d Mr. Denham said.Caltrain says that although the two trains will use the same tracks, the electrification project is \u201cindependent\u201d and high-speed rail\u2019s use of the corridor will require a separate environmental review.The bigger picture, proponents of the electrification project say, is that the commuter rail project deserves the support of the Trump administration because it meets the broad criteria of its infrastructure push \u2014 it will be made in America by American workers. Almost all of the materials for the new train system will be sourced from factories across 14 states. Caltrain estimates the project will create nearly 10,000 jobs.\u201cThis is the perfect project if you care about infrastructure, if you care about jobs and if you care about focusing on areas that are going to deliver long-term economic benefit,\u201d said Stuart Cohen, the executive director of TransForm, a nonprofit group that advocates public transportation.The state High-Speed Rail Authority is making a similar pitch. \u201cEvery ounce of the steel, every ounce of the concrete is domestic,\u201d Dan Richard, the authority\u2019s chairman, said. \u201cWe are reaching out to the Trump administration to make the case that this is entirely consistent with the president\u2019s vision.\u201dOutside Fresno, a city in California\u2019s Central Valley surrounded by almond and fruit orchards and racked by poverty, about 1,000 workers have been employed on the project to build viaducts and tunnels at 10 construction sites.The Finance Department of Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, decided on Friday that the project was ready to lay some track and approved $2.6 billion in spending. But there are lingering questions about how the later stages of the project will be financed, especially if Congress blocks more federal support.Although the authority was established more than two decades, ago it was only in 2013 that construction began on the first, 119-mile segment of the project.Mayor Lee Brand of Fresno, a Republican, supports the project, which would make Silicon Valley a 45-minute train ride away by 2025.\u201cI don\u2019t look at this ideologically,\u201d Mr. Brand said. \u201cI look at it practically. The city of Fresno can enjoy a major benefit from what\u2019s going on with high-speed rail. This is a poor city that needs all the help it can get.\u201dTom Richards, a real estate developer in Fresno who is on the authority\u2019s board, said the rail connection could encourage tech companies to set up in the city and workers to commute to well-paying jobs in Silicon Valley.\u201cThis is a whole story about connecting California together,\u201d he said.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "White House Echoes Tech: \u2018Move Fast and Break Things\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byAdventures in CapitalismLast summer, not long after Donald J. Trump secured the Republican nomination for president, his recently installed campaign manager, Stephen K. Bannon, met with top officials from the Republican National Committee to discuss management of the general election.Mr. Trump\u2019s staff had remained unusually small throughout the grueling primaries \u2014 a compactness, his advisers believed, that had given them a nimble edge. Now most Republican officials expected the Trump team to expand as it began to oversee the thousands of Republican staff members, state officials and consultants who would be ground troops in the coming political war.But when Mr. Bannon met with R.N.C. officials, he informed them that a major expansion was not going to happen.The Trump campaign, he said, intended to remain sparse and decentralized. Borrowing a Silicon Valley mantra from Facebook, he told his shocked listeners that \u201cyour job is to move fast and break things,\u201d according to a person who was present. \u201cFigure out what needs doing, and then just do it. Don\u2019t wait for permission.\u201dHis audience was surprised. Conventional political wisdom advocated a robust and elaborate campaign hierarchy.But Mr. Bannon demanded the opposite. Winning, he said, required tactics and ideas \u2014 like distributed decision making; quick experimentation and execution rather than thoughtful deliberation; learning from left-leaning advocacy groups and video game companies \u2014 that were drawn from the management playbooks of Silicon Valley start-ups.After that meeting, many thought Mr. Bannon\u2019s strategy was crazy, the person who was present said. Then Mr. Trump won the election. And now we can argue that Mr. Trump is, in many ways, the first genuine Silicon Valley start-up candidate and president.President Barack Obama may have embraced technology, weaponized social media and sought advice from the co-founders of Facebook and LinkedIn. But he was ultimately a traditional campaigner and manager. It is Mr. Trump\u2019s team who, surprisingly, have embraced the philosophy of disruption and the management styles of Silicon Valley, and who have sought to imitate the tactics that have powered companies like Uber and Amazon.\u201cTrump is the Silicon Valley candidate in every way except that the ideology is flipped,\u201d said Sam Altman, a prominent technology leader, chief executive of Y Combinator and a major Hillary Clinton donor. \u201cHe\u2019s an outsider. He took on a system he thought was broken and then disregarded the rules, he got to know his users well and tested his product early and iterated rapidly. That\u2019s the start-up playbook. That\u2019s exactly what we tell our start-ups to do.\u201dIt remains to be seen, however, whether Mr. Trump will successfully transition from a start-up to a mature commander in chief. Just as Uber and other young tech firms have stumbled while growing, so Mr. Trump seems, right now, in over his head at the White House.But understanding these early missteps \u2014 and how start-up thinking vaulted Mr. Trump into power \u2014 is important, because it gives us a lens into the strengths and weaknesses of management techniques that are increasingly being imitated by other industries around the world.Put differently, the president\u2019s success has demonstrated the strength of the start-up philosophy. But is it a good or a bad thing if Mr. Trump becomes the first political unicorn?But the fact remains that he is a prime example of the disruptive forces that the tech industry celebrates. At the most basic level, Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of technology \u2014 the millions of dollars he has raised through online donations, and his capacity to mobilize huge crowds through email and drive news through Twitter blasts \u2014 is crucial to his unexpected political success.And his team\u2019s embrace of Silicon Valley philosophy goes much deeper. As Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign gained steam, for instance, top officials began a dedicated effort to study the tactics of successful digital advocacy groups, particularly the left-leaning Moveon.org, as well as #BlackLivesMatter, to reverse engineer methods for rapidly mobilizing voters.His campaign also reached out to video game companies to learn how to make addictive content. During the race, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with Gabriel Leydon, founder of a company in Palo Alto, Calif., named MZ, previously known as Machine Zone, which created the highly popular games Mobile Strike and Game of War: Fire Age. Mr. Leydon, one of the biggest online advertisers, agreed to share insights about digital marketing tactics with the Trump campaign. (In a statement, MZ said it never formally worked for Mr. Trump.)The influence of start-up philosophy on Mr. Trump\u2019s team extends to day-to-day management. The campaign and the White House have looked to tech industry management techniques to empower staff members to start policy initiatives, to conduct rapid digital tests, and to push fund-raising and advertising campaigns without seeking authorization from senior officials.In contrast to the methodical Obama White House and the Clinton campaign, where tweets often needed approval from at least three officials before they were posted, members of the Trump team could dream up ads or email blasts almost without oversight. At its peak, his campaign was running 60,000 different online advertisements per day to see which phrases and images outperformed others.However, the most significant connection between Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley thinking is how thoroughly he embodies the \u201cdisruption thesis\u201d that has propelled so many emerging technology firms. Mr. Trump\u2019s team has deliberately worked to remove the traditional gatekeepers \u2014 the big donors, the political parties, the advocacy groups and the news media \u2014 that have, in the past, often determined political viability.A senior campaign official said the strategy \u201csidestepped the power brokers the same way Uber sidestepped taxi dispatchers,\u201d and asserted that politics as practiced by Mr. Trump was part of a revolution that started in technology and was now spreading to other industries and governments around the world.Yet, even by that measure, Mr. Trump, who attracted many first-time voters, and who was elected with a big boost from Americans without college degrees, seems to fit the bill.Which all presents a question: If the playbook was so successful in electing Mr. Trump, why is he stumbling now? Why has the Silicon Valley mentality failed to thrive in Washington?It might be that Mr. Trump simply needs to evolve to the next level of tech industry thinking. And, in fact, there is a ready playbook for how start-ups transition into mature firms. Google, for instance, began floundering when it reached about 200 employees. So the company\u2019s founders brought in a more established leader, Eric Schmidt, to \u201cbe a bit of chaperone, providing adult supervision,\u201d as Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, explained in 2001. When Facebook\u2019s work force hit 1,800 in 2008, its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, hired Sheryl Sandberg, a seasoned manager, as chief operating officer to rein in the firm\u2019s freewheeling, decentralized culture.We\u2019re seeing a similar shift in the White House. After Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban caused widespread confusion at airports and within federal agencies last month, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, put in effect a formal process for rolling out executive orders. When the president was preparing for his address to Congress last week, his team used a formal process to review the script. Republican leaders are pushing the White House to bring on more aides with prior governing experience. As at Facebook and Google, a hierarchy is being built.But for many within the technology industry, this new, more mature White House is cause for concern. \u201cI think most people don\u2019t want him to succeed at all,\u201d said Laszlo Bock, who until last year was a senior vice president at Google. \u201cNo matter how Trump manages the White House, what he believes in is the opposite of Silicon Valley values. We don\u2019t want him to learn from us.\u201dUltimately, say Silicon Valley luminaries, the world is changing thanks to forces beyond the control of any one industry.

{"Headline": "Door-Busting Drug Raids Leave a Trail of Blood", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "\n    In 2013, Fort Worth officers served a no-knock warrant in search of cocaine. Jermaine Darden, 34, who was obese and had asthma, was handled roughly and stunned with a Taser. When medics arrived, he was unresponsive. The medical examiner ruled he died of cardiac-related natural causes.\n  CORNELIA, Ga. \u2014 This town on the edge of the Appalachians has fewer than 5,000 residents, but the SWAT team was outfitted for war.At 2:15 a.m. on a moonless night in May 2014, 10 officers rolled up a driveway in an armored Humvee, three of them poised to leap off the running boards. They carried Colt submachine guns, light-mounted AR-15 rifles and Glock .40-caliber sidearms. Many wore green body armor and Kevlar helmets. They had a door-breaching shotgun, a battering ram, sledgehammers, Halligan bars for smashing windows, a ballistic shield and a potent flash-bang grenade.The target was a single-story ranch-style house about 50 yards off Lakeview Heights Circle. Not even four hours earlier, three informants had bought $50 worth of methamphetamine in the front yard. That was enough to persuade the county\u2019s chief magistrate to approve a no-knock search warrant authorizing the SWAT operators to storm the house without warning.The point man on the entry team found the side door locked, and nodded to Deputy Jason Stribling, who took two swings with the metal battering ram. As the door splintered near the deadbolt, he yelled, \u201cSheriff\u2019s department, search warrant!\u201d Another deputy, Charles Long, had already pulled the pin on the flash-bang. He placed his left hand on Deputy Stribling\u2019s back for stability, peered quickly into the dark and tossed the armed explosive about three feet inside the door.It landed in a portable playpen.As policing has militarized to fight a faltering war on drugs, few tactics have proved as dangerous as the use of forcible-entry raids to serve narcotics search warrants, which regularly introduce staggering levels of violence into missions that might be accomplished through patient stakeouts or simple knocks at the door.Thousands of times a year, these \u201cdynamic entry\u201d raids exploit the element of surprise to effect seizures and arrests of neighborhood drug dealers. But they have also led time and again to avoidable deaths, gruesome injuries, demolished property, enduring trauma, blackened reputations and multimillion-dollar legal settlements at taxpayer expense, an investigation by The New York Times found.The casualties have occurred in the execution of no-knock warrants, which give the police prior judicial authority to force entry without notice, as well as warrants that require the police to knock and announce themselves before breaking down doors. Often, there is little difference.Innocents have died in attacks on wrong addresses, including a 7-year-old girl in Detroit, and collaterally as the police pursued other residents, among them a 68-year-old grandfather in Framingham, Mass. Stray bullets have whizzed through neighboring homes, and in dozens of instances the victims of police gunfire have included the family dog.After being awakened by the shattering of doors and the detonation of stun grenades, bleary suspects reach for nearby weapons \u2014 at times realizing it is the police, at others mistaking them for intruders \u2014 and the shooting begins. In some cases, victims like Todd Blair, a Utah man who grabbed a golf club on the way out of his bedroom, have been slain by officers who perceived a greater threat than existed.To be sure, police officers and judges must find probable cause of criminal activity to justify a search warrant. Absent resources for endless stakeouts, police tacticians argue that dynamic entry provides the safest means to clear out heavily fortified drug houses and to catch suspects with the contraband needed for felony prosecutions.But critics of the forcible-entry raids question whether the benefits outweigh the risks. The drug crimes used to justify so many raids, they point out, are not capital offenses. And even if they were, that would not rationalize the killing or wounding of suspects without due process. Nor would it forgive the propensity of the police to err in the planning or execution of raids that are inherently chaotic and place bystanders in harm\u2019s way.Forcible-entry methods have become common practice over the last quarter century through a confluence of the war on drugs, the rise of special weapons and tactics squads, and Supreme Court rulings that have eroded Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Support for their continued use has been bolstered by an epidemic of opioid abuse and the threat of domestic terrorism.The no-knock process often begins with unreliable informants and cursory investigations that produce affidavits signed by unquestioning low-level judges. It is not uncommon for the searches to yield only misdemeanor-level stashes, or to come up empty.In some instances when officers have been killed, suspects with no history of violence, found with small quantities of drugs, have wound up facing capital murder charges, and possible death sentences.In December, a jury in Corpus Christi, Tex., acquitted a 48-year-old man who spent 664 days in jail after being charged with attempted capital murder for wounding three SWAT officers during a no-knock raid that targeted his nephew. The jury concluded that the man, Ray Rosas, did not know whom he was firing at through a blinded window.While the officers are typically seeking narcotics, there also have been deaths and serious injuries when warrants were served on people suspected of running illegal poker games, brewing moonshine and neglecting pets. In 2011, officers in Marine City, Mich., conducted a dynamic-entry raid to serve a search warrant for \u201cany and all evidence pertaining to graffiti including but not limited to, spray paint containers, markers, notebooks, and photographs.\u201d After forcing residents to the floor at gunpoint, they found nothing, according to depositions by the residents.The Times found that from 2010 to 2015, an average of least 30 federal civil rights lawsuits were filed a year to protest residential search warrants executed with dynamic entries. Many of the complaints depict terrifying scenes in which children, elderly residents and people with disabilities are manhandled at gunpoint, unclothed adults are rousted from bed and houses are ransacked without recompense or apology. Louise Milan, 68, of Evansville, Ind., alleged in her filing that she and her 18-year-old daughter were handcuffed in front of neighbors during a door-busting 2012 raid prompted by threats against the police made by someone who had pirated her wireless connection.\u201cThere\u2019s a real misimpression by the public that aggressive police actions are only used against hardened criminals,\u201d said Cary J. Hansel, a Baltimore lawyer who has represented plaintiffs in such lawsuits. \u201cBut there are dozens and dozens of cases where a no-knock warrant is used against somebody who\u2019s totally innocent.\u201dAt least seven of the federal lawsuits have been settled for more than $1 million in the last five years. They include a $3.75 million payment in 2016 to the family of Eurie Stamps, the unarmed Framingham grandfather who was accidentally shot while compliant and on his stomach; and $3.4 million in 2013 to the family of Jose Guere\u00f1a, a 26-year-old former Marine shot more than 20 times as agents broke into his house in Tucson. No drugs were found.In each of those cases, as in almost all botched raids, prosecutors declined to press charges against the officers involved.Perhaps no fiasco illustrates the perils of no-knock searches as graphically as the 2014 raid here in Georgia\u2019s northeast corner. On May 22, an eager young Habersham County sheriff\u2019s deputy named Nikki Autry, who was attached to a narcotics task force, turned a small-time methamphetamine user into a confidential informant. Intent on avoiding jail, the informant, James Alton Fry Jr., set about the task of baiting bigger fish.According to trial testimony and investigative documents, the agents sent Mr. Fry out on the night of May 27 to make drug buys. He scored two Lortab pain pills on his first approach, struck out with a second source and then was connected to a meth dealer named Wanis Thonetheva. At around 10:30 p.m., Mr. Fry, his wife, Devon, and their housemate, Larry Wood \u2014 all persistent meth users \u2014 drove to the address provided by the dealer.\u201cIt didn\u2019t look like a drug house,\u201d Ms. Fry later testified. \u201cThis was a nice house. It\u2019s usually a shack or trailer.\u201d The police did not follow them to provide protection or surveil the property.Mr. Wood conducted his business out front with Mr. Thonetheva, a 30-year-old American-born son of Laotian immigrants, as the Frys waited in their red pickup. All three appeared shaken when they met up with their handlers in a church parking lot. They had spotted two men at the house whom they took to be guards for the drug operation, and a third who might have been a supplier.The agents sent the informants home, but about half an hour later Deputy Autry texted Ms. Fry with an afterthought. \u201cDid y\u2019all see any signs of kids at wanis\u2019 house,\u201d she asked.\u201cNothing except a mini van,\u201d came the response.Thinking she was on to a big score, Deputy Autry, who was 28, did not wait for daylight or further investigation. She returned to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, where she pulled Mr. Thonetheva\u2019s criminal history and mug shot. With the approval of the sheriff, Joey Terrell, she alerted the county\u2019s Special Response Team to prepare for a raid. She and her drug unit commander, Murray J. Kogod, began drafting the application for the no-knock warrant.The affidavit included inaccuracies and hyperbole. It asserted incorrectly that Mr. Fry \u2014 the only informant formally certified by the police \u2014 had bought the drugs, rather than Mr. Wood. Deputy Autry described Mr. Fry as \u201ca true and reliable informant,\u201d even though he had not made a buy before that night. Despite the lack of surveillance, she wrote that she had \u201cconfirmed that there is heavy traffic in and out of the residence.\u201dShortly after midnight, Deputy Autry and another agent awakened the county magistrate, James N. Butterworth, with a house call. He read the affidavit and placed her under oath.She told him that Mr. Thonetheva had been arrested several times for drug possession, that there might be armed lookouts at the house and that an assault involving an AK-47 had been reported there the previous year. The judge, who had never denied Deputy Autry a warrant, found no reason to dispute probable cause and signed at 12:15 a.m.\u201cIf you had drugs and you had weapons, that was constitutional purpose to go on in there, not to knock on the door,\u201d he later testified.There had been few chances to quell riots and subdue active shooters in the hamlets of Habersham County, population 43,000. Instead, the unit had been used primarily to serve narcotics search warrants, 32 times in all.During their pre-raid briefing, team members circulated a photograph of Mr. Thonetheva, a Google Earth image of the brick house with dark shutters and a sketch of the three-bedroom interior. Deputy Autry mistakenly told the team\u2019s commander that the drug deal had gone down near a side door to an enclosed garage, so he plotted his entry from there. She told him there were no signs of children or animals, failing to mention the minivan.When the flash-bang detonated with a concussive boom, a blinding white light filled the room. The entry team rumbled in, screaming for the occupants to get to the ground. Deputy Stribling peered into the playpen with a flashlight and found 19-month-old Bounkham Phonesavanh.Deputy Stribling waved off Deputy Long, who had lobbed the grenade. \u201cCharlie, go away, you don\u2019t need to see this,\u201d he said.The child, known affectionately as Bou Bou, had a long laceration and burns across his chest, exposing his ribs, and another gash between his upper lip and nose. His round, cherubic face was bloodied and blistered, spackled with shrapnel and soot. The heat had singed away much of his pillow and dissolved the mesh side of the playpen.At first the child was silent. But as Deputy Stribling picked him up, rubbed his feet and shook his arms, he began to wail. Even the drug agents stationed outside the other end of the house could hear the screams.\u201cYou don\u2019t think that baby got hurt, do you?\u201d one asked another.There is no way to know the true number of forcible entries because there is no federal mandate that police agencies report on SWAT operations. Only two states have required it, and efforts by news and watchdog groups to compile national figures have been frustrated by police stonewalling.\u201cThis is kind of a secret world within a secret world,\u201d said Dr. Tom Nolan, a criminologist at Merrimack College and a SWAT veteran of the Boston Police Department. \u201cThey don\u2019t open up.\u201dUtah is currently the only exception. In 2014, after a marijuana raid resulted in the death of one officer and the wounding of five (as well as of the suspect, who hanged himself in jail), the state enacted a law requiring annual disclosures about tactical raids.C. Anthony Muse, a state senator who sponsored the measure, said he found the numbers \u201calarming.\u201d He also found it disturbing that the General Assembly allowed the reporting requirement to sunset, amid heavy lobbying from law-enforcement groups. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be held accountable,\u201d he said.Among the cities examined in the recent ACLU study was Little Rock, Ark., where the SWAT team broke down doors and detonated flash-bangs in more than 90 percent of 147 narcotics search warrant raids between January 2011 and March 2013, according to data shared with The Times.Deadly outcomes did not slow them down. In 2010, two team members were shot, neither fatally, and a suspect was killed, in a no-knock raid that uncovered half an ounce each of marijuana and crack. Less than two years later, a SWAT officer killed an armed 31-year-old man during an early morning raid that turned up three marijuana plants. The unit then conducted five more raids in the ensuing two weeks.The shootings prompted a new policy that the team must withdraw if it encounters an armed suspect, but they did not prompt broader reconsideration.\u201cIt\u2019s not foolproof, not always going to happen just right,\u201d said the SWAT commander, Lt. Tim Calhoun. \u201cBut it winds up being the most safe for us. These are dangerous people we\u2019re dealing with.\u201dSummoning armed criminals outside, he said, is no less risky than startling them inside. Long stakeouts exhaust manpower and can lead to dangerous vehicle pursuits, street confrontations and traffic stops that do not yield as much contraband.It matters little, Lieutenant Calhoun said, that drug crimes may not always pose an immediate mortal threat. \u201cIf you have a dope house next door,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s probably nothing the police can do that would be overreacting.\u201dThe mission creep for the heavily militarized teams has coincided with a stark shift toward law enforcement in the Supreme Court\u2019s search for the proper balance between public safety and individual rights.How the law concerning search and seizure and no-knock warrants has evolved.The quest for that sweet spot dates from the early 17th century and the \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d of English common law, which protected residents from unannounced government intrusions. That ethos was enshrined in the United States Constitution in 1791 with the ratification of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d and requires that warrants be backed by probable cause.\u201cIf it\u2019s a small quantity, you\u2019re probably not going to find too many police investigators that are going to knock,\u201d Chief William P. McManus of the San Antonio Police Department said in a 2010 deposition.That has helped blur the distinction between no-knock and knock-and-announce entries. \u201cEither the door comes in and people are yelling \u2018Sheriff\u2019s office\u2019 or people yell \u2018Sheriff\u2019s office\u2019 and the door comes in,\u201d said Judge Brian M. Rickman of the Georgia Court of Appeals, who was district attorney in Habersham County during the Cornelia raid.In The Times\u2019s inventory, 47 civilians and five officers died as a result of the execution of knock-and-announce searches, while 31 civilians and eight officers died in the execution of no-knock warrants. The type of warrant could not be determined in three civilian fatalities.With so little restraint exerted by the federal courts, few states have offered greater protections. A survey by The Times found that 13 states have enacted laws authorizing no-knock warrants. Another 13 have blessed them through rulings by appellate courts. In seven states, no-knock warrants are routinely granted in the absence of explicit authority by statute or the courts. In 16 states and the District of Columbia, no-knock warrants are not customary but the police can nonetheless make unannounced entries with standard warrants.The legal status of no-knock search warrants differs from state to state. In some, they are authorized by law or judicial precedent. In others, they are granted by judges in the absence of statute or case law when exigent circumstances exist, like a risk of danger or destruction of evidence. Oregon is the only state with a law requiring the police to always announce themselves before serving a search warrant.Elsewhere, even when prompted by sensational headlines, legislative efforts to curb the raids have encountered resistance. Several proposals withered in Georgia\u2019s General Assembly the year after the Baby Bou Bou episode, including prohibiting no-knock raids between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.Those failures only deepened mistrust in minority neighborhoods, said State Senator Vincent Fort, a Democrat who sponsored the bills in the Republican-controlled legislature. \u201cIt makes some community members see the police as occupying forces as opposed to community partners against crime,\u201d he said.And so the raids continue. When successful, they can temporarily disrupt the supply chain. But too often, the show of force is disproportionate, the errors disastrous. There are a variety of contributing factors.In August 2015, an assistant clerk-magistrate in Worcester, Mass., reviewed an application for a no-knock warrant aimed at finding two illegal guns in a drug dealer\u2019s apartment. The affidavit by a state trooper relied solely on a single confidential informant. There had been no surveillance, and the affidavit itself acknowledged that motor vehicle and utility records indicated that the suspect did not live there anymore.Nonetheless, the magistrate, Brenda D. Seaver, signed the warrant and at about 5 a.m. on Aug. 19 the city\u2019s SWAT team broke through the door. The new tenants \u2014 a man and woman who were engaged, their male roommate and two children \u2014 were detained at gunpoint as their belongings were ransacked. Both men were handcuffed; the woman, who had been sleeping nude, reported being berated profanely in front of her children.No contraband was found, and the police eventually became convinced that the residents did not know the suspect, who had moved out more than three months earlier.The tenants have filed a federal lawsuit against the city, the police and the informant. But their lawyer, H\u00e9ctor E. Pi\u00f1eiro, also blames the judiciary.\u201cIf you\u2019re a magistrate,\u201d he said, \u201cyou should be asking are there children there, what steps have been taken to find out, what kind of surveillance has been done, how reliable is this confidential informant, are there other ways you can arrest this person. It never gets done.\u201dMs. Seaver did not respond to a request for comment.The mistakes might be laughable were they not so consequential.In May 2010, the police in Hempstead, N.Y., shot and wounded 22-year-old Iyanna Davis during a no-knock raid at a two-family residence where she lived in an upstairs unit with a separate entrance. The warrant was for downstairs.Ms. Davis was awakened at about 7 a.m. by the sound of a door\u2019s being smashed and hid in a closet, she recounted in a deposition. A Nassau County police officer, armed with an assault rifle, opened the door, found her crouching and screamed at her to raise her hands.\u201cThat\u2019s when I heard the shot,\u201d she recounted. \u201cThe force actually knocked me back on my backside.\u201d The bullet had entered her right breast and exited her abdomen.In his own deposition, the officer, Michael Capobianco, said that he \u201ctripped and didn\u2019t mean to fire.\u201d He was cleared of any policy violations; Ms. Davis, who spent a week in the hospital and another three months recuperating, won $650,000 in a legal settlement from the county.The warrant to search Julian Betton\u2019s apartment did not authorize the police in Myrtle Beach, S.C., to break in without warning, and the officers insist that they knocked and announced.Suspected of small-scale marijuana dealing, Mr. Betton said in a deposition late last year that he emerged from a bathroom, saw moving shadows, assumed he was being robbed and reached for the handgun in his waistband. Three officers responded by spraying the room with dozens of rounds, hitting Mr. Betton nine times.\u201cI just seen stuff coming at me and I went to reach for it and went down,\u201d Mr. Betton, who was 30 at the time, said in a deposition for the lawsuit he later filed.Mr. Betton awoke from a coma six weeks later, partially paralyzed, having lost portions of his gallbladder, colon, bowel and rectum. On Thursday, he pleaded guilty to drug charges, including possession of nearly eight ounces of marijuana found in the raid. Counts of pointing and presenting a weapon were dismissed and he was sentenced to the time he served in the hospital.Members of the police team initially claimed that Mr. Betton fired first, but the state crime lab found no evidence that his gun had been discharged. A prosecutor cleared the officers, concluding that the shooting was justified.Members of the Beauregard Parish sheriff\u2019s special operations team told investigators that when they broke into Mr. Senegal\u2019s house trailer in rural Ragley, La., on Jan. 4, 2016, they found the slightly-built, 27-year-old man just inside the entrance, pointing a handgun their way. It was not cocked, but two deputies fired, hitting Mr. Senegal three times, according to investigative reports. Another killed his charging pit bull.Several team members told investigators there were shouts of \u201cSheriff\u2019s Office\u201d as they detonated two flash-bangs and breached the door. A grand jury declined to indict them, said District Attorney James R. Lestage.But since the deputies were not equipped with cameras, there is no way to really know what happened, and the uncertainty has bred suspicion and litigation. Crime scene photographs show Mr. Senegal splayed out on the floor, blood pooling near his head, the gun about three feet from his sneakers. Derrick Kee, a lawyer who has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Senegal\u2019s widow, suggests that it could have been planted.The drug seizure was not insubstantial: 22 ounces of marijuana, about 20 grams of methamphetamine, a gram of cocaine, 34 prescription pills and $38.42 found in a Nesquik jar, according to a crime lab report.Mr. Kee does not acknowledge that Mr. Senegal was dealing, but said it still would not justify his death. \u201cThese warrants introduce volatile circumstances into nonvolatile situations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be issued only under the most unique circumstances.\u201dSome SWAT veterans find it confounding that many police agencies remain so devoted to dynamic entry. The tactic is far from universally embraced, and a number of departments have retired or restricted its use over the years, often after a bad experience.The National Tactical Officers Association, which might be expected to mount the most ardent defense, has long called for using dynamic entry sparingly. Robert Chabali, the group\u2019s chairman from 2012 to 2015, goes so far as to recommend that it never be used to serve narcotics warrants.\u201cIt just makes no sense,\u201d said Mr. Chabali, a SWAT veteran who retired as assistant chief of the Dayton, Ohio, Police Department in 2015. \u201cWhy would you run into a gunfight? If we are going to risk our lives, we risk them for a hostage, for a citizen, for a fellow officer. You definitely don\u2019t go in and risk your life for drugs.\u201dAnother former chairman of the association, Phil Hansen, said SWAT teams tended to use dynamic entry as \u201ca one-size-fits-all solution to tactical problems.\u201d As commander of the Police Department in Santa Maria, Calif., and before that a longtime SWAT leader for the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, he said it seemed foolhardy to move so aggressively in a state that voted in November to legalize recreational marijuana.\u201cWhy am I risking people\u2019s lives to save an ounce of something that they\u2019re bringing in by the freighter every year?\u201d he asked.But officials with other law enforcement groups reject such absolutist approaches.\u201cIf you want to take the position that narcotics laws in this country should not be enforced, then O.K., yeah,\u201d said Sheriff Greg Champagne of St. Charles Parish in Louisiana, the president of the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association. \u201cThat\u2019s not the position of the law enforcement people around the country that I know. If you\u2019re going to make narcotics cases you need to have evidence, and search warrants are how you get it.\u201dSheriff Champagne said his deputies looked for opportunities to detain suspects on the street or in cars. Even so, he said, \u201cthere are times we just have to go in.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an argument that no-knock warrants can actually be safer for residents and officers because a well-trained SWAT team can neutralize a situation in seconds and minimize the chance for hostage-takings and standoffs,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can always point to the one bad case, but look at the thousands of cases where a no-knock warrant was executed without injury and heroin is seized. How many lives are saved because we got it off the street?\u201dNo-knock warrants, said Bob Bushman, president of the National Narcotic Officers\u2019 Associations\u2019 Coalition, are \u201ca tool that should stay in the toolbox.\u201d\u201cThere are some times,\u201d he said, \u201cthat if you\u2019re going to bring an investigation to a head the way to do it is with a no-knock.\u201dClearly there are other factors that contribute to the tactic\u2019s staying power. Some of it, according to long-term observers, derives from the adrenalized, hypermasculine, militaristic ethos of SWAT.This is how the news should sound. Twenty minutes a day, five days a week, hosted by Michael Barbaro and powered by New York Times journalism.\u201cIt\u2019s culturally intoxicating, a rush,\u201d said Dr. Kraska, the criminologist. \u201cIt involves dressing up in body armor and provocative face coverings and enhanced-hearing sets, a cyborg 21st-century kind of appeal. And instead of sitting around and waiting for something to happen twice or three times a year, you can go out and generate it.\u201dThat culture is reinforced by a cottage industry of tactical training contractors, many of them veterans of the Iraq or Afghanistan wars, who are hired by police departments to keep SWAT teams up to date.\u201cFor them, collateral damage is something you try to avoid but it\u2019s not a deal breaker,\u201d Commander Hansen said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t translate well for police work. If you\u2019re in the military and told to clear a block of houses in a half-hour, you\u2019re going to do it quickly by kicking in doors and throwing grenades. It\u2019s a whole different theater of operations.\u201dAnother potential factor is the incentive sometimes provided by asset forfeiture laws when contraband or drug proceeds are found in a residence. Revenue generated by those seizures typically reverts back to law enforcement agencies.\u201cWe feel strongly that a lot of this is financial motive, not to keep the community safe,\u201d said Mr. Boyack, whose libertarian-leaning group advocated for the restriction.As SWAT officers administered first aid to Bou Bou Phonesavanh, other agents detained his parents \u2014 Bounkham and Alecia Phonesavanh \u2014 and their three other children, ages 3 to 7.\u201cYou know why we\u2019re here,\u201d an officer barked at Mr. Phonesavanh.He didn\u2019t. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you knock on the door?\u201d he asked.Elsewhere in the house, the agents came upon Mr. Phonesavanh\u2019s sister, Amanda Thonetheva, who owned the place, as well as her boyfriend, her grandson and one of her sons. They did not find her other son, 30-year-old Wanis, who no longer lived there but dropped by at times. Nor did they find guns or drugs beyond some meth residue in a glass pipe. Later that night, deputies arrested Wanis at another address.The Phonesavanhs had already suffered their share of misfortune. Earlier that year, the family\u2019s house in Janesville, Wis., had burned down. They stayed in a motel as long as they could afford it, then lived for two weeks in their 11-year-old Chrysler Town & Country minivan.They drove to Georgia when Mr. Phonesavanh\u2019s sister offered the room in her garage. Seven weeks later, after struggling to find work, they were preparing to drive back to Wisconsin.Remarkably, Bou Bou survived the explosion after being sped to a hospital in Atlanta. Now 4, he underwent his 15th surgery late last year, with more to come, his mother said. \u201cThe nightmares are still there,\u201d she said, \u201cseveral times a week. When he wakes up he\u2019s usually sweating and holding his face.\u201d She said all of her children became scared when they saw a police officer or security guard.The Phonesavanhs, who have returned to Janesville, received $3.6 million in settlements to the federal lawsuit they filed against the traumatized members of the drug and SWAT teams. The payments were made through government insurance policies purchased with taxpayer funds. All but $200,000, Ms. Phonesavanh said, has been spent on medical and legal bills.\u201cThings are still quite the struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t mean to hurt my son, but they could\u2019ve done a lot more to prevent this.\u201dIn their closing arguments, opposing lawyers found common ground in their criticism of no-knock searches.The prosecutor, Assistant United States Attorney William L.

{"Headline": "In Gorsuch, Conservative Activist Sees Test Case for Reshaping the Judiciary", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Deep into the Senate\u2019s 68-page questionnaire of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the Supreme Court nominee was asked to describe how he had come to President Trump\u2019s attention.He sits at the nexus of an immensely influential but largely unseen network of conservative organizations, donors and lawyers who all share a common goal: Fill the federal courts with scores of judges who are committed to the narrow interpretation of the Constitution that they believe the founders intended.\u201cThe Supreme Court needs to be an institution that helps to undergird limited constitutional government,\u201d said Mr. Leo, 51, whose cerebral, unassuming demeanor belies the enormous clout he has developed in Washington.While a free-market agenda and the desire to place judges who will be more skeptical of federal and state regulations is a driving force, several central players in the group are also motivated by intense religious beliefs.Judge Gorsuch, 49, is their first test case, with his confirmation hearing set to begin on Monday \u2014 but the conservative activists say more is at stake than just the Supreme Court.\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Mr. Leo said in a speech last month at the Ronald Reagan Dinner at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \u201cHow we deal with this vacancy now, the strength that we as the pro-Constitution movement demonstrate in this fight, will determine the extent to which we are able to both nominate and confirm pro-Constitution judges as we move forward.\u201dTens of millions of dollars flow each year to a collection of non profit groups \u2014 from the Federalist Society to the Judicial Crisis Network \u2014 that are trying to reshape the federal and state judicial systems. Most of the money moves anonymously, other is disclosed. Here we take a look.Because of the age of many judges today, the White House expects between 70 to 90 appeals court positions to open up over the next four years. That would give Mr. Trump the opportunity to fill anywhere from one-third to half of all appellate seats \u2014 a profound impact considering that those courts are often the final word on thousands of cases that never reach the Supreme Court.The scale and sophistication of the right\u2019s judicial confirmation efforts would seem to portend a dark period ahead for the left, which, despite having made great strides under Mr. Obama, finds itself outmaneuvered.\u201cThe right wing, very purposely and methodically, has built a stable of nominees that fit their ideological profile, and it\u2019s been a national movement, well organized and strategized,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, who serves on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cFrankly, I think the progressives of the Democratic Party have been less vigilant and vigorous than the right.\u201dThere was little question to whom Mr. Trump would turn when he was putting together his list of possible Supreme Court nominees last year: Mr. Leo, who has spent almost his entire legal career at the Federalist Society, after graduating from Cornell Law School in 1989.\u201cAny time that Leonard asks you to go to dinner, you stay, because he feeds you well,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said. But it was not only the menu that was impressive. Mr. Pruitt arrived to see Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas at the table.\u201cWe spent three hours talking about the Constitution and things that we were involved in as attorneys general,\u201d Mr. Pruitt recalled. \u201cIt was a fabulous time.\u201dMr. Trump could soon find himself responsible for appointing a greater share of federal court judges than any first-term president in 40 years.Mr. Leo has been at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s judicial selection process since last spring, when Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign lawyer and now the White House counsel, introduced them. It helped enormously that Mr. Leo came to the campaign at a critical time of need.Mr. Trump gave broad discretion to Mr. Leo and his colleagues. Mr. Trump\u2019s most important criterion, these lawyers said, was that he wanted judges who were \u201cnot weak\u201d and of \u201chigh quality.\u201dTheir approach in coming up with candidates was similar to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s. \u201cThey had this very sophisticated, detailed frame of reference from which they could begin to say, \u2018O.K., well, who understands these things like we do?\u2019\u201d Mr. Leo said in an interview, referring to the Reagan era. \u201cAs opposed to an administration that might sit around and say, \u2018Who\u2019s a really smart lawyer who\u2019s been really accomplished?\u2019 Or, \u2018Hey, what about my frat buddy from 1964?\u2019\u201dAnd as Reagan did by nominating Justices Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, Mr. Leo and his conservative colleagues have looked for judges who can serve as long as possible. \u201cYoung is good,\u201d Mr. Leo said. \u201cThere will be an opportunity for a transformation of the federal bench.\u201dEven before Mr. Trump walked into the East Room of the White House on Jan. 31 to name Judge Gorsuch as his first Supreme Court nominee, the public relations campaign to confirm him had started.By that point, television and radio advertisements about Judge Gorsuch were already on their way to stations across the country. The campaign focused on five states picked for a very explicit reason: Each had a Democratic senator up for re-election next year, and all the states had voted to elect Trump.Ms. Severino, asked whether her group was simply a shell to secretly move money on behalf of others, said the Judicial Crisis Network should not be judged based on the size of its staff.\u201cWe are not trying to be a large membership organization,\u201d Ms. Severino said in a written statement, sent by CRC, which asked that the remarks be attributed to her. \u201cThere are others who excel at that type of work, and we are happy to support them as allies.\u201dThere are even overlaps with the funding. Mr. Corkery is listed as treasurer of the Judicial Crisis Network. A separate Internal Revenue Service filing shows that Ms. Corkery is president of the Wellspring Committee. Tax records from the past two years also show that Mr. and Ms. Corkery were paid nearly $600,000 to help run 15 nonprofit groups, including the Judicial Crisis Network. They declined requests to discuss their overlapping roles in these organizations.The impact of this intertwined network can also be seen in a number of state-level efforts to appoint more originalist judges.The intervention was considered disturbing enough that the Republican-controlled state legislature held a special hearing last year where those targeted by the groups testified.\u201cI suppose some with misplaced or contorted egos might be flattered these shadowy groups would spend over a half-million dollars directed to keep one off the court,\u201c said Clark W. Mason, a Little Rock, Ark., lawyer who was one of the candidates for the Supreme Court. \u201cBut I am outraged. They are attempting to shift the scale of justice.\u201dThe legislature this year failed to pass a law that would require a group like Judicial Crisis to disclose the source of its funding if it wants to play a similar role in future elections in the state.Mark Holden, general counsel of Koch Industries, a donor to the Federalist Society, said in an interview that the efforts of these conservative legal activists were necessary to overcome a bias favoring judges who put their agendas before the law.\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we have the right people in place, people who will follow our laws, judges who will follow our laws as they have been written and not as they wish they were written,\u201d Mr. Holden said.One point all the parties agree on: Mr. Trump must not repeat the mistake that Mr. Bush made in moving slowly to fill the many vacancies in the federal court system.Mr. Leo is ready to play his part.Advertisement"}

And therein problems may lie. Price sensitivity isn\u2019t limited simply to objects on shelves in stores; it now goes with wardrobes, too. Better take it \u2026 well, into account.Ms. Trump apparently did. After all, though the general attitude toward any Trump-related product these days is to treat sales as a referendum on the president and whether people are buying the lines he (and his family) are selling, note that, according to a statement from the brand\u2019s president, Abigail Klem, the decision to discontinue the fine jewelry had nothing to do with revenue generation, but rather was made \u201cas part of our company\u2019s commitment to offering solution-oriented products at accessible price points.\u201d In other words, to make the jewelry consistent with the rest of the brand\u2019s positioning.The question being: Which brand?Mr. Fillon, on the other hand, has something of the opposite problem: His gift suits are consistent with a message; it\u2019s just the wrong one.Historically, we want our elected officials and their families, especially the families who are most often photographed next to them, to represent their countries as elegantly and admirably as possible, while at the same time representing the electorate as genuinely as possible. And these two imperatives often come into conflict, especially as the factions they serve grow further and further apart.While this has been an issue in the past (see Nancy Reagan and the scandal of her request for free suits when she was first lady and, at the opposite extreme, the complaints when Rosalynn Carter, during the 1970s recession, recycled her old dresses; also the hoo-ha around Sarah Palin\u2019s campaign wardrobe), it has never been quite as microscopically chronicled, as undeniable or as generally accessible as it is today.Want to know how much your leader\u2019s clothes cost?

{"Headline": "Tell Me What You See: The Rorschach Test and Its Inventor", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Type the phrase \u201clike a Rorschach test\u201d into Google and what pops up is everything from Hillary Clinton to Cheetos. In popular myth, the famous inkblots, part gothic horror, part toddler splat painting, are a shortcut to our subconscious, plunging through the artifice of our self-presentation and into our darkest mental recesses. In this cartoonish version of the Rorschach, what we see in the blots \u2014 whether a butterfly, or the bloodied stumps of our last victim\u2019s limbs after we hacked them off with a salad fork \u2014 is who we really are.It is perhaps no surprise that the Rorschach metaphor has become a clich\u00e9 of modern journalism. It\u2019s a fascinating idea that what we see in a given situation often reveals as much about our own selves \u2014 our quirks and prejudices and vanities \u2014 as it does about the thing we are looking at. This back and forth between self and world is at the heart of art and literature and criticism. Within this metaphorical universe, writing a book review is a perfect Rorschach test.Sadly, as it turns out, Rorschach the metaphor is a lot more compelling than Rorschach the reality. The actual test, still in sporadic use, takes a more persnickety, box-ticking approach to the human personality, less magical psychoanalytic Tarot cards and more Myers Briggs tests with splats. The scoring system is tediously technical, and surprisingly what you see in the blots counts less toward your result than the technicalities of how you perceive form and movement.It is the fortunes of this humdrum test that Damion Searls charts in his impressively thorough, if somewhat dry book. \u201cThe Inkblots\u201d is part biography of Hermann Rorschach, psychoanalytic supersleuth, and part chronicle of the test\u2019s afterlife in clinical practice and the popular cultural imagination.Rorschach, a young psychiatrist with the tousled rom-com looks of Brad Pitt, was working with deeply disturbed patients in a remote Swiss asylum during the golden years of psychoanalysis. Across the Alps, Freud was busy delving into the ids of rich Viennese housewives using an early version of talk therapy. But Rorschach speculated that in understanding the human psyche, what we see might be as important as what we say. A gifted amateur artist, he created the inkblots to see if his patients\u2019 differing styles of perception could help parse out the differences between various pathologies.Early results were promising. Schizophrenics responded differently to the blots than manic-depressives, and both responded differently than the people who were \u201cnormal\u201d controls. Before long, Rorschach was using the test to diagnose psychiatric illnesses and predict personality traits, claiming that he got it wrong less than 25 percent of the time.Rorschach died suddenly in his mid- 30s, but his inkblots had already captured the imagination of both experts and the general public. The rest of the book charts that history.While most of us stare at Rorschach tests and see life reflected back at us, Searls apparently looks at life and sees Rorschach tests staring back at him. His inventory of Rorschach sightings in popular culture over the last half-century is encyclopedic. But outside of journalistic clich\u00e9, many of the examples he gives feel relatively marginal, more a series of isolated occurrences than a genuine cultural pattern.More significant was the test\u2019s impact on clinical practice. At its peak, the Rorschach was used an estimated million times a year, in murder trials and child custody battles, psychiatric diagnoses and college admissions and job applications.It is only toward the end of \u201cThe Inkblots\u201d that Searls introduces research showing that when it comes to predicting human behavior, the Rorschach performs no better than chance. Up until this point, he treats the question of whether the test actually works or not as almost an incidental one, an abstract curiosity in his cultural history.But this is a mistake. Psychology\u2019s reputation has suffered body blows in recent years, with an epidemic of overclaiming among psychologists, widespread lapses in scientific rigor and the suggestion that only around a third of psychological findings across the board can actually be replicated. In this context, the question of the Rorschach\u2019s basic validity is not an interesting aside, but fundamental to the entire story.Searls, a journalist and translator, is a nuanced and scholarly writer, at his best dealing with philosophical abstractions. His passages on the nature of empathy, for example, are genuinely fascinating. But he is less strong on the human side of storytelling. While he goes into rigorous detail about the technicalities of the Rorschach and the infighting among psychologists, his book largely ignores the people at the sharp end, the patients and ordinary folks whose lives have sometimes been cataclysmically affected by the results of the test.Although he refers to a couple of these \u201ccase studies\u201d in passing in the final chapters of the book, their stories are told at a remove, as examples drawn from textbooks rather than key players in the narrative. It\u2019s not clear that he interviewed many of these people directly (or if he did, those encounters haven\u2019t been included in the finished text). In an insightful moment, Searls acknowledges that the Rorschach encourages experts to believe that they can speak for people better than the people can speak for themselves. But he falls into the same trap.Prioritizing the human beings impacted by this history would have made not only for a more readable book, but also a more responsible one. But, to belabor the Rorschach metaphor one last time, Searls should take comfort in the knowledge that any small criticisms I may have almost certainly say more about me than they do about his book.Ruth Whippman is the author of \u201cAmerica the Anxious: How Our Pursuit of Happiness Is Creating a Nation of Nervous Wrecks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hinton, its teenage author, was graduating from her high school in Oklahoma.BackgroundIf you choose to show this video to students, please preview it first to make sure it is appropriate.No matter where or when in history you look, you will find groups of people who are \u201cinsiders\u201d and groups who are \u201coutsiders\" \u2014 the haves and the have-nots, the center of society and the margins.Ponyboy\u2019s story has spoken to so many over the decades because balancing on a precipice between hope and despair is, for many young people, a daily reality. For most young people coming-of-age, learning to fit in and find their place in the world is a big enough challenge. But for the young men in these texts, gangs, with their promise of brotherhood and belonging, add additional allure and danger.Ms. Hinton wrote the book as a high school student, living the conflicts that became central to her book. Times reporter John Eligon wrote about Chicago gangs after spending weeks with current and former members. Both pieces raise questions about identity and belonging, manhood and respect \u2014 and introduce us to young men who \u201cdefy easy caricature\u201d as they wrestle with those issues.__________________Key Question: What can we learn by seeing the world through the eyes of outsiders?__________________... As I lit up, the Socs who had jumped Johnny and me at the park hopped out of the Mustang. I recognized Randy Adderson, Marcia\u2019s boyfriend, and the tall guy that had almost drowned me. I hated them. It was their fault Bob was dead; their fault Johnny was dying; their fault Soda and I might get put in a boys\u2019 home. I hated them as bitterly and as contemptuously as Dally Winston hated.Two-Bit put an elbow on my shoulder and leaned against me, dragging on his cigarette. \u201cYou know the rules. No jazz before the rumble,\u201d he said to the Socs.\u201cWe know,\u201d Randy said. He looked at me. \u201cCome here. I want to talk to you.\u201dI glanced at Two-Bit. He shrugged. I followed Randy over to his car, out of earshot of the rest. We sat there in his car for a second, silent. Golly, that was the tuffest car I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201cI read about you in the paper,\u201d Randy said finally. \u201cHow come?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I felt like playing hero.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have. I would have let those kids burn to death.\u201d\u201cYou might not have. You might have done the same thing.\u201dRandy pulled out a cigarette and pressed in the car lighter. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anything anymore. I would never have believed a greaser could pull something like that.\u201d\u201c \u2018Greaser\u2019 didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. My buddy over there wouldn\u2019t have done it. Maybe you would have done the same thing, maybe a friend of yours wouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s the individual.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to show at the rumble tonight,\u201d Randy said slowly.I took a good look at him. He was seventeen or so, but he was already old. Like Dallas was old. Cherry had said her friends were too cool to feel anything, and yet she could remember watching sunsets. Randy was supposed to be too cool to feel anything, and yet there was pain in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sick of all this. Sick and tired. Bob was a good guy. He was the best buddy a guy ever had. I mean, he was a good fighter and tuff and everything, but he was a real person too. You dig?\u201dI nodded._________The young men who call themselves Gangster Disciples skirted by an empty lot. They marched past a \u201cStop the Violence\u201d mural painted on a corner store, coming to a halt when they saw members of a rival gang, the Black Disciples.It was late September on a busy South Side intersection, and now tensions were escalating, gang members who were there recalled.There were glares, they said. Then words.\u201cYou\u2019re a rat,\u201d a Black Disciple said to one of the Gangster Disciples who he believed had given the police information about him.Things were about to blow.It had been exactly 90 days since some of these same men had sat across from one another in an airy church hall to broker peace and confront a hard truth: The gang war they had inherited and were viciously continuing was helping to unravel parts of this city, where the levels of violence were reaching horrific new heights.... The Times spent several weeks this fall with gang members to get a better understanding of what it means to be in a gang. They were often days of boredom, punctuated by bursts of drama and bravado. Gang life means animated debates over whether the guys on the next block meant to insult you or not. It means worrying over how to make enough for your next meal or your next high. And it means mourning the loss of loved ones, retaliating in their honor, yet wanting the cycle to stop.Ron, a 23-year-old Black Disciple who uses the nickname Kaos, and for safety reasons asked that his last name not be used, explained the relentless cycle of violence: I\u2019ve already lost friends. If we are making money, I can ignore the urge to retaliate. \u201cBut if we\u2019re sitting here bored, getting high and we got guns around, it ain\u2019t nothing else to do,\u201d he added.Still, these are young men who defy easy caricature. They are the sales associates who help you find shoes at a sportswear store or factory workers next to you on the assembly line. They kiss their young children on the lips and cry when someone close to them dies.And, yes, they do use and sell drugs, and sometimes lash out in inexplicable bursts of violence over disputes like a battle for a girl\u2019s attention, or disrespectful words uttered on a rap video posted to YouTube.Or, as was the case in front of the corner store in late September, over an insult hurled on a busy intersection._________For Writing and Discussion The clique worried that the war was about to flare again, said Antwine White, 24, a Gangster Disciple who is called Weedy. \u201cYou just get prepared for the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can walk over here. We can think it\u2019s cool. They shoot.\u201dThat defines day-to-day gang life in Chicago. The young men bound around with their chests out, but their heads are on constant swivels, eyeing everything around them.What does the article reveal about how perceptions and expectations can contribute to cycles of violence? Do you see similar attitudes playing a role in cycles of violence elsewhere, whether in your own personal experience or as you read headlines in the newspaper about conflicts around the world? How?_________Going FurtherGangs and Law EnforcementBased on what you read in these two articles, list specific steps that law enforcement might take to improve life in communities troubled with a history of gang violence. Which of these steps might make good immediate priorities and which make better long-term goals? Which might work best in a community near you?_________\u201cThe Outsiders\u201d at 50Hinton, earnest teenager that she was, wrote to reveal the universality of her Greasers, just as Wright and Ellison did for African-Americans, or Paley and Roth did for Jews.The review noted, however, that Ms. Hinton also borrowed techniques from other classic books. Mr. Peck writes that these \u201cechoes \u2026 soften the challenging nature of the book\u2019s subject matter by wrapping it in references, tropes and language familiar to its adolescent readers, even as they alleviate the fears of those readers\u2019 too-earnest parents.\u201dFor readers in 2017, is Ms. Hinton\u2019s novel still relevant?_________Stay Gold_________Defying Stereotypes_________Outsiders in the World TodayWho are the outsiders in your community? In the world at large right now? How can \u201coutsider thinking\u201d enhance or endanger a community?Discuss your findings with a small group. What do you notice? What patterns or clich\u00e9s do you find in these reports about those identified as outsiders? Which of these pieces seem most interesting? What stories seem to be missing?Finally, consider what stories of outsiders in your own community need telling, and brainstorm ways they could be told._________\u2018Sometimes the Tough Teen is Quietly Writing Stories\u2019After the session, Joshua came to the front of the stage and asked to speak with me in private. He told me he was born in a prison and that he\u2019d been held back in school. Twice. He didn\u2019t belong in junior high anymore. It made him feel like a loser. But he wanted me to know that he wrote stories sometimes. About San Antonio gangs. When he asked if I\u2019d be willing to read the one he\u2019d just finished, I told him I\u2019d love to. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to get it to me quick,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re about to shuttle me to the next school.\u201d_________Curating an \u201cOutsiders\u201d Museum In fact, one 48-year-old fan loves the book so much he wants to turn the house pictured above into an \u201cOutsiders\u201d museum:On a particularly windy day in the Crutchfield neighborhood here, the writer S. E. Hinton was touring the renovations of the future Outsiders House museum. The rundown Craftsman bungalow was where the Curtis brothers \u2014 Darry, Sodapop and Ponyboy \u2014 lived in the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola movie based on Ms. Hinton\u2019s book \u201cThe Outsiders.\u201dThe book, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month, was arguably one of the most influential young adult books of its time, and leading this tour was the self-described fanboy Danny O\u2019Connor, 48, who made his own contribution to pop-culture history as a member of the 1990s hip-hop group House of Pain.Mr. O\u2019Connor has been on a quest to find artifacts to include in the museum, amassing a collection of memorabilia from the movie, vintage photographs and hard-to-find editions of the book. Next on his search list, he told Ms. Hinton, 68, was a claw-foot tub like the one 18-year-old Rob Lowe (Sodapop Curtis in the movie) stepped out of with just a towel wrapped around his waist.If you were curator of the \u201cOutsiders\u201d museum, what would you want to feature? What exhibits would you have? How would you set it up? What special events might you offer? Sketch your ideal \u201cOutsiders\u201d museum, or create a sample exhibit for it. How might your museum or exhibit both satisfy longtime fans of the novel and pique the interest of a new generation?_________Friends and FamilyWrite a personal letter to a friend who has become like a family member to you. Just like Ms. Tannen does in her article, use specific anecdotes and memories to express to this person why you see them as family._________Related: More Text to Text Lesson Plans on Young Adult Literature\u2018Speak\u2019 and \u2018Waking Up to the Enduring Memory of Rape\u2019\u2018The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\u2019 and \u2018On the Reservation and Off, Schools See a Changing Tide\u2019\u2018The Giver\u2019 and \u2018The Dark Side of Young Adult Fiction\u2019\u2018The Catcher in the Rye\u2019 and \u2018The Case for Delayed Adulthood\u2019\u2018The Book Thief\u2019 and \u2018Auschwitz Shifts From Memorializing to Teaching\u2019\u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 and \u2018A Fight Club for Flies\u2019Do you have ideas for matching an excerpt from an often-taught work of literature with a Times article?

{"Headline": "Rugby\u2019s More Perfect Union", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported bySportingIn Dublin next Saturday, Ireland and England will play the final game of the Six Nations Championship. Thousands of miles away, in an office in New York, I will follow every pass, kick, tackle, ruck and scrum.Were it not for my day job, I would watch the game in a pub. Probably the Red Lion in Greenwich Village, with expats not only from England and Ireland, but also from Wales and Scotland. France and Italy, too. New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and maybe Canada, Argentina or Uruguay, even Japan. All of us watching \u2014 intently, passionately \u2014 a game of rugby union.To a great majority of Americans, this is rugby: a strange game loved by foreigners. An Englishman who came to live in New York, I thought the simple fact of distance would dull my love for the game. But what I discovered is that rugby is American, too. After five years in and around the American game, I have only fallen further in love.In the scrum (never \u201cscrimmage,\u201d which is not a rugby word) each player binds on to another and all work together to achieve their goal: to push the opposing pack off the ball, to subdue them \u2014 and to not get hurt.Rugby is gloriously counterintuitive. Players know it is not remotely a sensible thing to do. And despite this, they love it.All my rugby playing was in England, starting when I was 3 or so, and joining an organized team at 7. For the next 15 years, I played once, twice or three times a week, across the North of England, in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Northumberland and Durham. Later, I played in London.I\u2019m big, so I played in the second row of the scrum. Ears taped, mouthguard in, I held on to another big bloke and pushed. In loose play, I tackled, rucked and mauled \u2014 these are technical terms, though every bit as gloriously ugly as they sound. As a lineout jumper, I scrambled to a reasonable level: County junior teams, my university First XV and \u2014 just twice \u2014 a Premiership Second XV. By my mid-20s, I was playing for the second team at Rosslyn Park, one of the better amateur clubs in London, though our opponents were often youth players from professional teams.It wasn\u2019t the big injuries \u2014 two concussions, a broken arm \u2014 that ended my playing days. Nor even the spectacularly dislocated elbow: a burst of static behind my eyes, whirling trees at the river end of the Otley ground. It took five doctors to pull and push the joint back in.That kind of thing was survivable; it was the little hurts that did me in. Black eyes and worn-down knees; a hairline crack in a rib, sustained in a tackle that failed to stop a try that lost a game. By the time I was 25, the soreness and stiffness from Saturdays made Sundays otherworldly. I would browse the bookshops on the Charing Cross Road, wincing at my bruises.Something had to give. As I was working more and more on weekends, that thing was rugby.A few years later, I met a girl from Cambridge, Mass. We married and moved to New York City. I got a job, we had three children in quick succession, and I thought my rugby days were done.But the rugby world is small, and it was not done with me. It turned out that a former coach of mine in Otley, Yorkshire, was now the chief executive of USA Rugby, based in Boulder, Colo. I called him and we talked. He even remembered the day I dislocated my elbow. That conversation started my second life in rugby \u2014 not playing but writing about rugby. American rugby.My first experience of the American game, in fact, came long before I moved here. It was in 2002, on a brisk autumn night near London, when I played for Rosslyn Park against West Point, whose cadets were on a European tour. The pace was high, the hits were huge, the rucks ferocious. Later, over drinks, we swapped mementos. Then the cadets went home, and off to war.Some of those West Point alumni have become my friends. A few months ago, my former counterpart in the second row, a giant who went into the oil business, flew in from Texas. We met at the Village Tavern, in a back room where rugby shirts hang on the wall. The captain of the 2002 team, a fullback who fought in Mosul, Iraq, is in investments in Boston. He lives two towns over from my wife\u2019s family\u2019s summer place; his kids play mini-rugby against my niece.So here I am, an Englishman still reveling in the Six Nations but settled into American rugby. I\u2019ve written about rugby played in Philadelphia, Boston, Saratoga and Chicago. I aim to reach California, where rugby has a strong presence in the inner cities, as well as at Berkeley and Stanford. There\u2019s even a Google Rugby Football Club. (Don\u2019t believe me? Google it.)American rugby is youthful, scattered and raw. But a strong spirit unites it: On Saturday, the Irish and English teams in Dublin and those watching them will share something vital with any two teams or band of spectators on the rougher fields of Dublin, Ohio; Dublin, Calif.; or Dublin, Ky. Which is perhaps why, outside of my family, rugby has done the most to give me the sense that I belong here.Martin Pengelly is the weekend editor of The Guardian US.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Ways to Be More Effective in Meetings", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byMeetings!Those endless blocks of time during the workday in which we are given tacit approval to zone out but that we cannot skip.\u201cAn excess of meetings is a symptom; it\u2019s not a problem in and of itself,\u201d said Michael Mankins, an author of \u201cTime, Talent, Energy: Overcome Organizational Drag and Unleash Your Team\u2019s Productive Power\u201d and a partner at Bain & Company.That problem, Mr. Mankins said, is \u201ceither a culture that rewards collaboration for collaboration\u2019s sake, or more commonly, an organizational structure that basically necessitates more people being involved in critical activities than should be required.\u201dJustin Rosenstein, who worked at Google and Facebook and was a co-founder of Asana, a productivity management tool, said even those vaunted tech icons of productivity fall into the trap.\u201cIt was really sad the amount of time we spent not doing work, but doing work about work,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if a 30-minute meeting seems innocuous, context-switching is so hard, and it\u2019s hard to get back into the rhythm of things.\u201dDoing away with meetings altogether would be counterproductive, so the trick is to get more out of the meetings you attend.Here\u2019s how to do it.After accepting a meeting invitation, the first thing you should always do is ask for an agenda well in advance.Your best tool for doing well in meetings is relentless preparation, and studying the agenda will help you plot the moments for your contributions, said Jill Flynn, founding partner at Flynn Heath Holt Leadership, a consulting firm focused on training female leaders.\u201cThink of a couple of ways you hope to add value or your point of view ahead of time,\u201d she said. \u201cMeetings don\u2019t always go the way you anticipate, but it definitely helps to be mentally prepared.\u201dWhen you are bringing a new idea, try to build support for it in casual chats before the meeting begins. If you face resistance, you will already have someone in your corner to back you up.\u201cEverybody knows, although women often do not, that the real meetings happen before the meeting,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cYou need to have conversations with the key players before you ever get in the room.\u201dThe first few minutes of a meeting are paramount, too.\u201cYou want to get your voice in the room as early as you can,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cA lot of times people wait and think, \u2018Oh, I have to wait because I have to have something really, really insightful to say.\u2019 \u201dBut the direction of a meeting, including who will be contributing, is often decided in the first few minutes of a meeting, so it is important to participate early, she said.If you must be in a meeting and you have done your homework, you can still end up being sidelined by what one former chief executive coach calls the \u201ctyranny of the most verbose\u201d: a meeting\u2019s agenda being dictated by those who speak most forcefully, and often those who speak first.\u201cBy not speaking up, you\u2019re withholding something valuable from the team,\u201d said Kim Scott, the chief executive of Candor and the author of \u201cRadical Candor.\u201d\u201cSilence is not an act of generosity when you have a great idea,\u201d she said.For timid or more junior employees \u2014 or those marginalized by a workplace\u2019s culture \u2014 speaking up can be at best nerve-racking and at worst a terrifying experience. But expressing confidence through body language and word choice can make it easier to jump in.To appear more engaged, sit toward the front of your seat and do not lean back, Ms. Flynn said. Think about ditching the laptop; sometimes it can set up a barrier between you and everyone else.When the moment comes to speak up, try to use \u201cmuscular language.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re the junior member, or the only person of color, or the only woman, our tendency is to be way too deferential and use a lot of qualifiers,\u201d she said. \u201cGet to the point, be factual, persuasive, use a sense of humor if you\u2019re good at that. But be factual and clear and don\u2019t use deferential language and filler words.\u201dPointing out obvious but uncomfortable truths is never easy, but it is nearly impossible in a setting with your peers and colleagues. But that is all the more reason to go for it.\u201cPeople bumping up against each other is what helps us not just improve our work product but also ourselves as human beings,\u201d Ms. Scott said, noting the often-cited \u201cobligation to dissent\u201d at McKinsey & Company, the renowned management consulting firm.The benefits here often far outweigh the risks, even if your workplace has not embraced dissent as a necessary tool for improvement. If something does not feel right to you, odds are it is not just you.\u201cI\u2019ve seen meetings where I know that everyone in the room is thinking something, but no one feels comfortable saying it,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said. \u201cWe want to hear people say things like \u2018I don\u2019t know exactly why yet, but I have a weird feeling about this idea.\u2019 \u201dThat will not win any debates, but sometimes acknowledging an elephant in the room can be all that is needed.\u201cIt\u2019s become sort of a part of corporate culture that if you\u2019re not invited to a meeting, it must be that you\u2019re not important,\u201d Mr. Mankins said. \u201cThat reinforces the behavior of wanting to be invited even if you play no role.\u201dThe first step to recovery is, obviously, going to fewer meetings. That is easy for managers, but what about their employees?The most tactful technique, experts said, is to acknowledge the invitation and express your appreciation, then politely explain that you are unclear about how your presence will add anything and suggest that you skip it. Frame your absence as an opportunity for others to add more to the meeting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solar Experiment Lets Neighbors Trade Energy Among Themselves", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byBrooklyn is known the world over for things small-batch and local, like designer clogs, craft bourbon and artisanal sauerkraut.Now, it is trying to add electricity to the list.In a promising experiment in an affluent swath of the borough, dozens of solar-panel arrays spread across rowhouse rooftops are wired into a growing network. Called the Brooklyn Microgrid, the project is signing up residents and businesses to a virtual trading platform that will allow solar-energy producers to sell excess-electricity credits from their systems to buyers in the group, who may live as close as next door.The ability to complete secure transactions and create a business based on energy sharing would allow participants to bypass the electric company energy supply and ultimately build a microgrid with energy generation and storage components that could function on their own, even during broad power failures.\u201cCommunity members can work both individually and collectively to help meet demand in an efficient way,\u201d said Audrey Zibelman, who recently resigned as chairwoman of the New York State Public Service Commission, which regulates the state\u2019s utilities.\u201cIt takes a central procurer \u2014 in this case, historically, the utility \u2014 out of the mix,\u201d she continued, \u201cand really sets the market where they\u2019re not buying and selling to the utility but they\u2019re identifying each other\u2019s need and willingness to buy and sell.\u201dThe project is but one example of how rapidly spreading technologies like rooftop solar and blockchain are upending the traditional relationships between electric companies and consumers, putting ever more control in the hands of customers. Across the globe, upstart companies like LO3 Energy, which is designing the Brooklyn experiment with the industrial giant Siemens, are building digital networks that offer the promise of user-driven, decentralized energy systems that can work in tandem with the traditional large-scale grid or, especially in emerging economies, avoid the need for a grid at all.In Australia, where Ms. Zibelman will soon run the nation\u2019s energy markets, a company called Power Ledger announced the start of a residential electricity trading market based in blockchain last year at a housing development in Perth.And in Germany, Sonnen, a leading supplier of home batteries and smart energy products and services, has created a web of about 8,000 customers, both with and without solar on their roofs, who are trading their stored energy among one another.\u201cPeer-to-peer is slowly but surely becoming a reality,\u201d said Olaf Lohr, Sonnen\u2019s head of United States business development. \u201cThis really is a very disruptive technology. The customers are also the owners \u2014 they are the producers of the energy. There is no centralized feed-in from one big power plant.\u201dThe ideal power system, said Richard L. Kauffman, who as the governor\u2019s chairman of energy and finance is leading that effort, is one that combines large power plants and transmission lines with clusters of smaller-scale producer-consumers, \u201cwhere electrons can flow in more than one direction and supply and demand of electricity is dynamic \u2014 and that\u2019s different than the grid is today.\u201dPeer-to-peer power sharing is consistent with that vision, he said, though a number of regulatory changes are necessary for it to take off.The State Public Service Commission has already taken a few of them, including last week approving new ways to determine pricing for electricity from renewable energy projects that more accurately reflect the value to the grid based on geographic location, timing and other factors yet to be determined. But Lawrence Orsini, LO3\u2019s chief executive, said the state still needed to determine how to define his company and its network of participants before it could get its market up and running, a move he anticipates by June.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing technically infeasible about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order for transactive energy to take off as a whole, regulators have to be comfortable that markets can actually work this way and, more importantly, that people want markets like this.\u201dOver the past year, LO3 has been working to find those people, using Google Earth to identify homes with rooftop solar installations and then knocking on doors to enlist participants, with some success throughout Park Slope and Gowanus.On a block of President Street last year, the company carried out two sales of green electricity credits generated by one homeowner\u2019s solar system to a neighbor across the street \u2014 tiny transactions, but important in proving the concept\u2019s viability.Those sales involved test versions of renewable-energy credits \u2014 numbered certificates that are used to track electricity exported from a renewable system to the grid. Utilities, corporations and other customers can buy the credits to claim green energy use.In the Brooklyn case, LO3 used the credit sales, conducted over PayPal, to test its approach; it cannot legally buy and sell electricity until regulators determine its market status. Once that occurs, Mr. Orsini said, the company will be able to facilitate the trading of energy among its participants \u2014 though they would still pay the utility, Con Edison, for infrastructure fees and services, as customers now do when they choose to use a green energy supplier through the utility.Mr. Orsini\u2019s team is busy collecting data from meters installed in prosumer homes, measuring production, use and export of the solar electricity to help model the market. They are also testing a smartphone app that customers will be able to use to manage their electricity purchases, setting parameters to control the source \u2014 selecting from a range of conventional, renewable, local and bulk options \u2014 as well as how much they are willing to spend.Mr. Orsini said he expected that most users would want to make their choices and then let the system take over.\u201cNo one wants to day-trade energy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re giving something to people that they haven\u2019t ever had before, and that\u2019s really a way to personalize their energy consumption.\u201dThat is the aspect that appeals to a number of the participants, including Garry Golden of Windsor Terrace, a futurist who consults for a variety of businesses, including electric utilities and infrastructure companies. Mr. Golden installed solar as part of a group purchase that proved so popular with his neighbors that almost a dozen systems are within view of his roof, forming an attractive cluster for the microgrid experiment.\u201cWe need to make energy a product and a service that people can purchase on their own and not rely on a large centralized entity,\u201d Mr. Golden said. He added that it was important to build out infrastructure that would be able to better withstand disasters, both natural and man-made.Other participants echoed that concern.\u201cThe long-term goal is to be at least partially independent of the grid in emergencies, which was a reasonable argument to join,\u201d said Patrick Schnell, whose Gowanus basement flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, though he did not lose power. \u201cHopefully it will expand and more people will join and it will be more worthwhile.\u201dThe project includes plans to create a roughly five-square-block area \u2014 either around a collection of public housing projects or near a hospital \u2014 that could disconnect from the grid and operate independently in case of a power failure.\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of energy needs beyond your own,\u201d Mr. Golden said. \u201cThere\u2019s a microgrid of our community, and that\u2019s great, but the hospitals, the clinics, the schools, large housing complexes \u2014 you can feed the energy where it needs to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yandex has charged that makers of cellphones are obliged to use Google\u2019s services if they want to use the latest version of Android, but that such obligations are unfair because they create an uneven playing field.The regulator, the Turkish Competition Authority, had initially declined to investigate Yandex\u2019s complaint, but it said on Monday that it would look at whether Google\u2019s use of Android to promote its other digital services infringed on the country\u2019s competition rules. It is unclear how long the investigation will take.That inquiry by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, focused on a Google requirement that some cellphone manufacturers preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone app store.

{"Headline": "Trump Leaves Science Jobs Vacant, Troubling Critics", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On the fourth floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the staff of the White House chief technology officer has been virtually deleted, down from 24 members before the election to, by Friday, only one.Scores of departures by scientists and Silicon Valley technology experts who advised President Trump\u2019s predecessor have all but wiped out the larger White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.Mr. Trump has not yet named his top advisers on technology or science, and so far, has made just one hire: Michael Kratsios, the former chief of staff for Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley investor and one of the president\u2019s wealthiest supporters, as the deputy chief technology officer.Neither Mr. Kratsios, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from Princeton, nor anyone else still working in the science and technology office regularly participates in Mr. Trump\u2019s daily briefings, as they did for President Barack Obama.\u201cThe impression this leaves is that Trump isn\u2019t interested in science and that scientific matters are a low priority at the White House,\u201d said Vinton G. Cerf, a computer scientist, vice president of Google and one of the chief architects of the internet. The dwindling of the White House science and technology staff for scientific research could have long-term consequences, Mr. Cerf said.It is unclear whether the vacancies are the result of the Trump administration\u2019s overall slowness in hiring or a signal that the president places less importance on science and technology than Mr. Obama did.A White House official who asked not to be identified cast the issue as one of timing: Mr. Trump, the official said, is still reviewing candidates to be his chief science adviser, considers the science and technology office important and will soon have a new staff for it.President Trump has the lowest job approval of any president since Gallup began tracking in 1953.At the same time, conservatives \u2014 including a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team \u2014 have called for getting rid of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. (The chief technology officer is a part of that larger office.) They argue that the office, created by Congress in 1976, is a bloated bureaucracy that duplicates expertise already found at government agencies.Mr. Trump has echoed that sentiment, at least when it comes to government jobs over all.Last month he responded to criticism about the high number of vacancies across his administration by telling Fox News that \u201ca lot of those jobs, I don\u2019t want to appoint, because they\u2019re unnecessary to have.\u201d\u201cYou know, we have so many people in government, even me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI look at some of the jobs and it\u2019s people over people over people. I say, \u2018What do all these people do?\u2019 You don\u2019t need all those jobs.\u201dIf Mr. Trump applies that logic to the science and technology office, he will end decades of tradition in which the president increasingly relied on his own advisers for expertise on federal research budgets, emerging trends and technical crises.Mr. Trump\u2019s first budget proposes slashing $5.8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health and $900 million, or about 20 percent, from the Energy Department\u2019s Office of Science, which runs basic research at the national laboratories. The Environmental Protection Agency would be cut by 31 percent.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump issued executive orders that roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which would have closed hundreds of coal-fired power plants in an effort to curb planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions.Those actions have been taken without advice or guidance from scientists and engineers inside the White House. The few remaining policy advisers have ceased distributing daily memos on policy issues like climate change, machine-learning regulation, or the ethics of big data collection.\u201cThey are flying blind when it comes to science and tech issues,\u201d said Kumar Garg, who left the Office of Science and Technology Policy as a senior adviser after the election.There is no question that the science and technology bureaucracy at the White House expanded in recent years. In the George W. Bush administration, there were 50 people in the office, but Mr. Obama more than doubled the staff, to 130, and moved the office into a building on the White House grounds.\u201cThe agenda was always huge in scope and ambition, and something was always happening,\u201d said Nicole Wong, a former deputy chief technology officer under Mr. Obama.The departure of science and technology experts from the White House means dozens of science and technology programs begun under Mr. Obama have gone untended in the weeks since Inauguration Day.\u201cThe O.S.T.P. is the conduit for scientific perspective and scrutiny to the president and is a priority in White House decision making,\u201d said Danny Weitzner, a former deputy chief technology officer in the Obama administration and now the director of internet policy research at M.I.T.Under Mr. Obama, the science and technology office included 19 policy advisers in the environment and energy division, 14 in the national security and international affairs division, nine in the science division and 20 in the technology and innovation division.\u201cWe are all sitting on the edge of our seats hoping nothing catastrophic happens in the world,\u201d said Phil Larson, a former senior science and technology adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cBut if it does, who is going to be advising him?\u201dCurrent White House officials declined to say how many people remained in each division. But four former officials who recently left the office said that a wave of departures scheduled for Friday could potentially reduce the number of people left to a handful, not counting about eight administrative staff members.Advertisement"}

The Twitter breaches on Wednesday, however, came as Dutch voters were casting ballots in their general election. Separately, websites in the Netherlands that help people decide how to vote were hit by online attacks on Tuesday.The Twitter hacking on Wednesday appeared to be related to that growing dispute. The defamatory messages, in Turkish, accused Germany and the Netherlands of having Nazi ties, and they linked to a video of a speech by Mr. Erdogan.While the online messages were quickly removed and control of the accounts returned to their owners, many of the targeted organizations and policy makers moved to distance themselves from what had been posted.It was unclear who had carried out the digital attacks.In response, Twitter said that it was aware that the intrusion may have resulted from a third-party app.\u201cWe quickly located the source,\u201d Twitter said in a statement. \u201cNo additional accounts are impacted.\u201dOn Tuesday, a separate attack affected two websites set up to help voters choose among Dutch political parties in the general election.

And as it unfolds, it is remaking the urban and economic landscape.Within the next six months, three of the biggest academic building projects in years will be opened up to students, faculty and staff. Focusing on advanced technology and the sciences, these projects, together with others recently completed or in the planning stages, are aimed at helping the city lure and retain people to compete with places like Silicon Valley and Boston.New York, though, has the advantage of its sheer number of potential recruiters and employers, and its proximity to the financial services industry, said John Tepper Marlin, a former chief economist for the New York City comptroller\u2019s office.\u201cNew York City has always been a great market but we have always been a bit snobby about tech and about practical things, and that has hurt us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are now catching up.\u201dLee C. Bollinger, Columbia\u2019s president, acknowledged that on its main Morningside Heights campus, \u201cthere are a lot of laboratories that are substandard, and there are offices that really need work and conference rooms and laboratories that need to be renovated.\u201dBut failing \u201cto invest in the long-term,\u201d he said, would mean that \u201cColumbia would slide into a modest research university over time.\u201d Moreover, \u201cthe new expansion creates a sense of excitement internally and among alumni, and that leads to gifts, which benefits the institution in full.\u201dThe campus has attracted university officials and international visitors, who want to see how academics can work alongside start-ups and established companies. Universities want to \u201cpush the envelope to have that unique advantage,\u201d said Diana Allegretti, assistant director for design and construction, who previously had worked on both the N.Y.U. and Columbia projects.The third major project \u2014 to be unveiled in the fall \u2014 is N.Y.U.\u2019s $350 million plan, part of an ambitious push into Brooklyn and beyond.\u201cWe are not just Greenwich Village University.

Almost anything, it seems, is better than reading the news. One friend started running; another cooks overinvolved dinners; my mom went hiking in the Andes. I have taken to poring over the often grammatically incorrect half-memories of complete strangers. And I can\u2019t stop. It\u2019s like being on a cozy drug.Stump the Bookseller, which has existed in various forms for more than two decades, claims to have a \u201cnearly 50 percent success rate in finding these long-lost but treasured books.\u201d Frantic new parents, determined to recreate their own childhood libraries for their offspring, often write in; other times, it\u2019s someone like me who suddenly, for reasons no amount of psychoanalysis could ever explain, simply must know the un-Google-able title of an illustrated book about sarcastic pink cherubs flying out of paintings to taunt museum visitors.For $4, payable by personal check or PayPal, long-tormented adults can buy the possibility of psychic relief. Memories are submitted by email and then uploaded \u2014 barely edited \u2014 to the site, which makes clear that there is \u201cno guarantee that your Stumper will be solved.\u201d Some posts garner no comments and remain mysteries; others inspire dozens. Private frustration is converted into collective satisfaction, and trippy, was-that-really-a-thing recollections are confirmed to have indeed been real. Reading the blog feels like witnessing the corroboration of entire childhoods.\u201cApproximate publication year, guesses at the title, character names, quirky plot descriptions are all helpful,\u201d the site advises prospective posters. \u201cSo rack your brain for some details.\u201d The guidance is unnecessary: It\u2019s the details that inspire people to write in the first place. Of the posts\u2019 recurring motifs, some are perhaps predictable for a site specializing in children\u2019s books (time travel, witches, dolls), while others seem arbitrary. Coins come up a lot, as do bees and petty theft. Mostly, though, the posts are singular and strange. Together they do little to support the countless words that have been written about either the moral benefits of reading fiction or the centrality of storytelling to human nature; hardly any refer to lessons learned, and seldom do they even allude to plot.Instead they are tethered to psychotically specific set pieces \u2014 a mole who is displaced by construction work, a couple in Alaska who cook a beaver tail \u2014 and riddled with allusions to arcane inventions (dumbwaiters), exotic locales (rice paddies) and nightmarish images (an anthropomorphized sun with a zipperlike mouth). My favorite posts are written with the chatty pragmatism of an interoffice email as they lay out highly improbable events. From March 2013: \u201cI read this book in the \u201980s. I think the main character\u2019s name was Rusty. She was a teenage girl who I believe got pregnant and killed herself in a sensory-deprivation tank. Thanks!\u201dStump the Bookseller traffics in an enchanting sort of anguish that almost seems to constitute its own category of memory \u2014 more pleasurable to hold in the mind than a forgotten song lyric or acquaintance\u2019s name, but also more torturous, as no radio or party invitation will ever organically prompt its recollection. Shared with nobody, inaccessible in full even to us, refracted through the consciousness of a now-remote self, memories of books we read while only partly sentient are among the weirdest we have. Even when matter-of-factly summarized by their publishers, children\u2019s books sound fabricated and insane. Their plots are oneiric, preposterous; trying to authenticate their existence encourages self-doubt like no other sort of fiction does.The posts on Stump the Bookseller are far more utilitarian than they are sentimental, but reading them, which I now do for hours every week, routinely brings tears to my eyes. Each one forces an overwhelming rediscovery of just how real other people are, a confrontation with the fact that everyone\u2019s mind is cluttered with images that are incidental, almost always partly lost, affecting in ways that are subtle, unpredictable and impossible to explain. How can you not marvel at a person who has thought of a kitten carved from soap repeatedly and with agony for years? Or someone who has spent her whole life wondering why a fictional princess, encountered decades earlier, so hated being made to embroider? It\u2019s enough to make you feel as though every obscure thing you\u2019ve ever forgotten is still with you somehow, waiting to be recovered and maybe even shared.Alice Gregory is a contributing editor at T: The New York Times Style Magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opposing Views on What to Do About the Data We Create", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Data is the new oil, and we humans are the wells. Our digital crude is a rich brew of mundane, everyday activities \u2014 our searches, texts and tweets \u2014 along with the GPS coordinates from our phones, the biometric information we share with fitness devices, even the IP addresses of our connected refrigerators. To the average person, this raw material is undetectable noise. But for organizations that know how to identify signals, there\u2019s immense value in refining what has become an unlimited supply.Understanding what data we create, and how others exploit it, is vitally important. Soon, powerful machine-learning algorithms and artificially intelligent systems will analyze our data to reach decisions about and for us: whether we qualify for a bank loan, whether we\u2019re likely to commit a crime, whether we deserve an organ transplant. And unlike us, machines aren\u2019t burdened with an emotional attachment to privacy.The popular old data-as-oil idea opens Andreas Weigend\u2019s new book, \u201cData for the People,\u201d an exhaustive and insightful look at how data is collected and used, often without our knowledge and almost always without our input. Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon, details the \u201csocial data\u201d that emanates from billions of cameras, sensors and other devices, as well as social networks, online retailers and dating apps. Data refineries \u2014 those companies and people who turn our digital crude into profitable information \u2014 hunt for patterns, then sort us into buckets based on our behavior: what we might buy, what we\u2019ll watch, whom we might fall in love with. As Weigend points out, this exchange benefits everyone: If we let ourselves be mined, we receive personalized recommendations, connections and deals. Yet there\u2019s an imbalance of power. Companies make a lot of money from our data, and we have very little say in how it\u2019s used.Weigend argues persuasively that in this \u201cpost-privacy\u201d world, we should give our data freely, but that we should expect certain protections in return. He advocates a set of rights to increase data refineries\u2019 transparency and to increase our own agency in how information is used. Companies like OkCupid, WeChat and Spotify should perform data safety audits, submit to privacy ratings and calculate a score based on the benefits they provide \u2014 a sort of credit score for the companies that mine our data. Meanwhile, we should have the right to amend, blur and import or export our own data into any system we please.Not everyone believes that our information should be freely available as long as we agree to the terms of use. In \u201cThe Art of Invisibility,\u201d the internet security expert Kevin Mitnick advocates the opposite. Mitnick notes various reasons we may want to hide our data: We\u2019re wary of the government; we don\u2019t want businesses intruding into our lives; we have a mistress; we are the mistress; we\u2019re a criminal. Mitnick, who served five years in prison for hacking into corporate networks and stealing software, offers a sobering reminder of how our raw data \u2014 from email, cars, home Wi-Fi networks and so on \u2014 makes us vulnerable. He describes basic privacy protections (using a strong password, avoiding public computers) along with more advanced techniques (encrypting files on a hard drive, using a VPN and Bitcoin for online purchases). Most will seem familiar and perhaps rudimentary to those with any technical savvy. For everyone else, he offers an uncomfortable view of how data can be exploited.Both books are meant to scare us, and the central theme is privacy: Without intervention, they suggest, we\u2019ll come to regret today\u2019s inaction. I agree, but the authors miss the real horror show on the horizon. The future\u2019s fundamental infrastructure is being built by computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and security experts just like Weigend and Mitnick, who do not recognize their own biases. This encodes an urgent flaw in the foundation itself. The next layer will be just a little off, along with the next one and the one after that, as the problems compound.Right now, humans and machines engage in \u201csupervised learning.\u201d Experts \u201cteach\u201d the system by labeling an initial data set; once the computer reaches basic proficiency, they let it try sorting data on its own. If the system makes an error, the experts correct it. Eventually, this process yields highly sophisticated algorithms capable of refining and using our personal data for a variety of purposes: automatically sorting spam out of your inbox, say, or recommending a show you\u2019ll like on Netflix. Then, building on this foundation of data and algorithms, more teaching and learning takes place.But human bias creeps into computerized algorithms in disconcerting ways. In 2015, Google\u2019s photo app mistook a black software developer for a gorilla in photos he uploaded. In 2016, the Microsoft chatbot Tay went on a homophobic, anti-Semitic rampage after just one day of interactions on Twitter. Months later, reporters at ProPublica uncovered how algorithms in police software discriminate against black people while mislabeling white criminals as \u201clow risk.\u201d Recently when I searched \u201cC.E.O.\u201d on Google Images, the first woman listed was C.E.O. Barbie.Data scientists aren\u2019t inherently racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. But they are human, and they harbor unconscious biases just as we all do. This comes through in both books. In Mitnick\u2019s, women appear primarily in anecdotes and always as unwitting, jealous or angry. Near the end, Mitnick describes trying to enter Canada from Michigan, and wonders if he\u2019s stopped \u201cbecause a Middle Eastern guy with only a green card was driving.\u201d (He might be right, but he doesn\u2019t allow for the possibility that his own criminal record could also be responsible.)Weigend\u2019s book is meticulously researched, yet nearly all the experts he quotes are men. Early on he tells the story of Latanya Sweeney, who in the 1990s produced a now famous study of anonymized public health data in Massachusetts. She proved that the data could be traced back to individuals, including the governor himself. But Sweeney is far better known for something Weigend never mentions: She\u2019s the Harvard professor who discovered that \u2014 because of her black-sounding name \u2014 she was appearing in Google ads for criminal records and background checks. Weigend could have cited her to address bias in the second of his six rights, involving the integrity of a refinery\u2019s social data ecosystem. But he neglects to discuss the well-documented sexism, racism, xenophobia and homophobia in the machine-learning infrastructure.The omission of women and people of color from something as benign as book research illustrates the real challenge of unconscious bias in data and algorithms. Weigend and Mitnick rely only on what\u2019s immediate and familiar \u2014 an unfortunately common practice in the data community. University computer science, math and physics departments lack diversity in staff and coursework. Corporate data science is homogeneous. So are professional and academic conferences, where the future of data is discussed. If the people mining and processing our data are nothing like us, and if the machines learn only from them, our data can yield only warped caricatures, like the zombies you see on TV.As a futurist, I try to figure out how your data will someday power things like artificially intelligent cars, computer-assisted doctors and robot security agents. That\u2019s why I found both books concerning. Think of all the characteristics that make up who you are: how much coffee you drink, how fast you drive, how often you open your refrigerator, your respiratory rate, what slang you use, the random strangers you\u2019ve friended on Facebook. You may look like Weigend and Mitnick and therefore may not have experienced algorithmic discrimination yet. You, too, should be afraid. We\u2019ve only recently struck oil.Amy Webb, chief executive of the Future Today Institute, is the author of \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Case Could Be a Watershed for Women in Tech", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtStill, the Uber scandal feels different. It feels like a watershed. For gender-diversity advocates in the tech industry, Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations, and the public outcry they have ignited, offer a possibility that something new may be in the offing.What could happen? Something innovative: This could be the start of a deep, long-term and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women \u2014 not just at Uber but across the tech business, too.But precisely for those reasons, Ms. Kapor Klein argued that if Uber mounted an honest investigation into its culture and pledged to transparently remake what ails it, it could become a model for the industry.\u201cThey did ask me, \u2018Has anyone gotten it right in tech?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said not yet. And that means an opportunity for Uber.\u201dUnlike many aggressive start-ups that have come before it \u2014 Amazon and Facebook, for instance, were no pushovers \u2014 Uber is not a natural monopoly. It sells a service that has ready substitutes, and it has well-funded competitors in many of its major markets. Its rivals have put their supposedly friendlier brands at the center of their competitive strategy. They are all waiting for Uber to fail, and every time Uber finds a way to lower its reputation even further, competitors can peel off customers, drivers and engineers.Finally, there\u2019s the Trump factor. Ever since the presidential election, people in the tech industry have been amped up. Employees and customers have learned to take up arms against companies that don\u2019t espouse their values, and companies have started to listen.\u201cLeft-leaning Silicon Valley has been embracing the Women\u2019s March and had this heightened awareness about issues that women face due to misogynistic men,\u201d said Karen Catlin, a former software engineer who is now an advocate for women in the tech industry. Now the same social-media energy aimed at President Trump is being marshaled against Uber, better known on Twitter as #deleteUber.Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, and others at the company appear to understand the gravity of the threat. The company moved swiftly to open an investigation into Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations. Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur who sits on Uber\u2019s board, were among those it appointed to find out what\u2019s going wrong at the company.All of this could be for show. To a lot of people, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s word no longer carries much weight. But you don\u2019t have to just trust him. If Uber is serious about remaking its culture, we can watch for concrete action.Ms. Kapor Klein is looking for several steps. She wants Mr. Holder\u2019s report to detail for the public everything he\u2019s found at the company. She wants to see new policies for how Uber hires people, ones that put more weight on the diversity of its work force. She wants the company to offer more formal and informal ways for employees to report problems to management, including allowing them to do so anonymously in order to avoid retribution. She also wants Uber to offer more training for employees, and better workplace surveys to get a sense of what\u2019s going wrong.Finally, Ms. Kapor Klein said, she would be scrutinizing Mr. Kalanick\u2019s own actions.\u201cYou need unequivocal commitment from the top,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone does something abhorrent, do you fire your best performer? That is the litmus test.\u201dAn Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the outcome of Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation, which is just beginning, but said that all of Ms. Kapor Klein\u2019s recommendations were on the table.Whatever Uber does in the next few weeks will only be a start. People who fight for diversity in the tech industry point out it is a hard problem to solve; it could take years of careful and publicly embarrassing actions for Uber and other companies to become more hospitable to women.\u201cThis stuff is deeply entrenched,\u201d Ms. Kapor Klein said, relaying a story she had recently heard about a group of programmers at a different tech company. \u201cI heard about this engineer who said that what he and his friends do at work for fun is rate women job applicants according to who they wanted to marry, or who they wanted to kill, and there was a third thing.\u201d Suffice it to say the third thing was not the women\u2019s qualifications for the job in question.\u201cThat just goes to show you the backdrop we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d she said. \u201cFixing this will be a marathon, not a sprint.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Michael D. Shear, a White House correspondent for The Times, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As a White House reporter, you must be bombarded with news about the Trump administration. What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat?Now, no matter where I am \u2014 at my desk, at a restaurant, or in a van waiting for POTUS to play a round of golf \u2014 I have access to cable news reports and live streams from the White House.What do you like about the setup, and what could be better about it?I like the fact that Sling TV works just about everywhere. There are apps for my iPhone 7 and my iPad Air, as well as my MacBook Pro and the Apple TVs and Rokus I have at home.The apps load quickly and even work behind the firewall at work.I do have a few gripes. For now, you can\u2019t pause most shows on Sling TV, and there\u2019s no recording of shows. (The company has a DVR beta in the works, but I haven't been able to get in.) And there are often hiccups. The audio and video are often, frustratingly, out of sync, especially for MSNBC and NBC. And there are times that the channels say \u201cunavailable\u201d for a few seconds, or a few minutes, with no explanation. Also, because of licensing issues, I can get NBC and Fox, but not ABC or CBS.As a political reporter, how do you keep messages, contacts and phone calls secure from surveillance?I\u2019ve always been pretty careful about electronic security. I have two-factor authentication turned on for all of my accounts \u2014 email, iCloud, etc. And I\u2019m as careful as I can be to avoid being trapped by a phishing scam. I rarely click on any link from an email, and I\u2019m pretty aggressive about sending emails that I don't recognize to spam.How do you keep on top of President Trump\u2019s Twitter?Having covered the White House since the beginning of 2009, I\u2019m definitely having to adjust to a new rhythm. I have about a dozen Twitter accounts set to alert me to every tweet, including the @POTUS and @RealDonaldTrump accounts, as well as the president\u2019s senior staff like @Presssec (Sean Spicer), @KellyannePolls and others. I had to adjust my Do Not Disturb settings on my iPhone so that notifications resume earlier \u2014 at 5:30 a.m. now. (There are overnight editors who can call me if he tweets between midnight and 5:30 a.m.)I also make extensive use of my Apple Watch to keep tabs on the president\u2019s Twitter habit throughout the day. I generally keep the speaker on mute, but the watch\u2019s haptic engine taps my wrist anytime he or his aides tweet.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?So far, I use it as a timer when I cook. I find it much easier to simply say \u201cHey, Google, set a timer for 30 minutes\u201d than to use the old-fashioned timer on my oven.We also have fun using Google Home for our grocery shopping list. Throughout the week, as we notice things we need at the store, any of us can say, \u201cHey Google, add orange juice to the shopping list.\u201d It\u2019s eerily accurate, even on stranger items. The list is automatically compiled in a Google Keep note that all of us have access to. (I will admit that my 14-year-old daughter is having fun putting weird items on the list to surprise me when I go to the grocery.)What could be better about it?The problem with Google Home \u2014 and the reason it often sits, neglected, on the counter \u2014 is that it just doesn\u2019t do that much. It can\u2019t send emails or text (yet). It can do some limited shopping, but isn\u2019t connected (for obvious competitive reasons) to our Amazon shopping account. It can\u2019t (yet) be used as a convenient speakerphone. The news sources that it accesses are limited (no New York Times headlines read aloud).And there is one, serious limitation that has to be fixed for Google Home to be really useful in a home with more than one person: It needs individual profiles. It has a nice feature that reads out the appointments for your day, but it links to only one calendar. That means only one of us can use the feature.The internet is flooded with fake news. What\u2019s your advice for readers for distinguishing good information from bad information?First, read The New York Times.But more broadly, I guess my advice would be to constantly crosscheck what you see and hear on the internet. If you read a fantastic-sounding allegation in a Facebook post or a tweet, or on a no-name internet site, try to see whether that allegation is also being reported by The Washington Post or Fox News. Go to the fact-checkers at various news organizations. Look around on Twitter to see whether the allegation has been debunked.If it sounds like something is \u201ctoo good to check,\u201d it probably means it\u2019s not real. But check it anyway!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Pitch for Eyeglasses That Sounds Eerily Familiar", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerOn March 9, Sarah Lauch received an email from a company called OpticsFast that left her shaking with anger. It read: \u201cGood news! I finally found the 3115b glasses for you, that you originally wanted. I know it\u2019s been a while, I always follow up on my good customers.\u201dHis theory, it later emerged, was that the fear and fury he ginned up would increase postings to complaint sites by appalled customers, hubbub that improved his ranking on Google, because the search engine did not distinguish between positive and negative feedback.Ms. Lauch testified that after she returned a pair of Chanel glasses that were fakes, Mr. Borker, using an alias, threatened to cut off her legs. A judge, after hearing from her and other witnesses, ultimately decided that Mr. Borker needed a timeout to rethink his career. Thirty-five at the time, the Russian immigrant went to the pokey for three years, having pleaded guilty to wire fraud, mail fraud and making threats on the phone.Bureau of Prisons records show that he was released in September 2015. The question raised by the email to Ms. Lauch is whether Mr. Borker had returned to the eyeglass business and his bullying ways.While we can\u2019t say for certain, it seems possible. Mr. Borker had been listed in domain records as the owner of OpticsFast since well before he landed in prison. The site\u2019s phone number has not changed. Its post office box is currently in Sheepshead Bay.OpticsFast customers report dreadful and unnerving experiences with the company: obscenity-filled rants from service reps, cascades of hectoring emails, repair jobs gone terribly wrong, threats of litigation. Most customers deal with a volatile woman who identifies herself as Becky S. But once in a while, a guy works the phones and, to put it mildly, he plays rough.Consider what happened to Stacia Lambrinos in January. She spent more than $300 for a rare pair of Ray-Bans from OpticsFast, she said, and was sent junky knockoffs of a different model. When she persuaded Discover to refund her money, as OpticsFast refused to do, OpticsFast began a campaign that included 35 calls a day to her cellphone along with a torrent of emails, all to persuade her to give the company another chance.When she refused, a man who identified himself as a police officer called and said that she had to head immediately to a police station in Pasadena, Calif., near her home. A \u201ccivil harassment suit\u201d had been filed against her, he said, by none other than OpticsFast.\u201cI said, \u2018If this is a civil suit, why do I need to visit a police station?\u2019\u201d she recalled in a recent conversation. \u201cI knew right away who was behind the call.\u201dSoon after, she said, someone went on a shopping spree with her Discover card, buying pizza, wigs and other items, all of them in Brooklyn.No OpticsFast customers have reported threats of physical harm, but everything else about these stories is straight out of the Vitaly Borker School of Rude. And whoever is running the site has DecorMyEyes\u2019s customer files. The email Ms. Lauch received on March 9 came from the \u201cOpticsFast Sales Team\u201d and concerned glasses she\u2019d tried to buy in 2008 \u2014 from DecorMyEyes.A glaring piece of counterevidence must be noted. The litany of complaints about the site, and its full-nelson approach to commerce, continued through the years that Mr. Borker was in the Big House on sites such as Yelp and Trustpilot. That could mean Mr. Borker no longer has anything to do with OpticsFast. He could have long ago handed off the site or sold it to people who share his noxious ethos.The Haggler tried contacting Mr. Borker through the site. A woman who answered the phone and refused to give her name said neither she nor anyone else at the company had ever heard of Vitaly Borker.\u201cWhere are you located?\u201d the Haggler asked.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she replied.\u201cSheepshead Bay?\u201d the Haggler went on. \u201cAm I getting warmer?\u201d\u201cYou playing games with me?\u201d she retorted.\u201cYes!\u201d quoth the Haggler. \u201cAm I getting warmer?\u201dFor now, we put this one in the \u201cIt\u2019s a Mystery\u201d file.

School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said.\u201cApple is struggling,\u201d said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource.Apple said education was a longstanding value for the company.\u201cMac and iPad are the best tools in education to help teachers teach and students learn,\u201d Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of product marketing, wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly passionate about education and new programs like Apple Teacher,\u201d a site for teachers who want to learn how to more creatively use Apple tools with their students, she said.The rise of Google\u2019s Chromebooks has disrupted the momentum of Apple, which has been marketing its computers to schools for some 40 years.The shift toward Google-powered devices is hurting Apple\u2019s revenue. Of the $7.35 billion that schools, colleges and universities spent on mobile and desktop computers in 2016, sales of Apple devices fell to $2.8 billion in 2016, from about $3.2 billion in 2015, according to IDC, a market research firm. Windows devices generated $2.5 billion in 2016, up from $2.1 billion in 2015, while Chrome devices reached $1.9 billion, up from $1.4 billion.The Chromebook has beaten out classroom competitors on pricing, usability and other factors. Chromebooks run apps through Google\u2019s cloud-based Chrome operating system, making them cheaper \u2014 and often faster to boot up \u2014 than traditional laptops that rely on hard drives.Because Chromebooks store documents in the cloud, they can be shared among students, who can grab any school device to access their class work. Google also provides school administrators with an online dashboard to remotely manage thousands of the laptops at once.Then there is the keyboard issue. While school administrators generally like the iPad\u2019s touch screens for younger elementary school students, some said older students often needed laptops with built-in physical keyboards for writing and taking state assessment tests.The public school system in Eudora, Kan., for instance, used to have rolling carts of iPads for elementary school classrooms and MacBook carts for older students to share. But last year, when administrators wanted to provide a laptop for each high school student, the district bought 500 Chromebooks at about $230 each.\u201cAt the end of the day, I can get three Chromebooks for each of the Mac devices I would have purchased,\u201d said Steve Splichal, the superintendent of Eudora Public Schools. He added that Eudora students continued to use MacBooks for certain creative courses and that first graders and younger students still used iPads.A picture caption on Friday with an article about Apple devices that are losing ground in American classrooms to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on the Chrome operating system from Google, misspelled part of the name of a place in Maryland where children were shown using Chromebooks. It is Glen Burnie, not Glenn Burnie.Advertisement"}

As of Friday, the publisher had yet to resume marketing with Google, which takes a percentage from the ads placed on YouTube and the over two million sites in its display network, though it was \u201cvery likely\u201d to reinstate search ads soon, he said.\u201cWe needed to react very, very quickly,\u201d Mr. Nicklin said. \u201cWe knew the next day that our brand, which is fundamentally important to us, was about to be splashed over the Times front page for all the wrong reasons.\u201dAd agencies have seized on this moment to emphasize their value as middlemen between brands and the likes of Google and Facebook, which have become two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies through online ad sales, and to attempt to pressure the internet companies into providing them with more access to closely guarded data and metrics.\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see now is a conversation in the advertising industry, which we\u2019re definitely seeing in the U.K. and have for the last few weeks, around how do we start valuing context and quality, and how do we start factoring that into our decision-making when we start buying media?\u201d he said.He added, \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think YouTube is the only one here that\u2019s got challenges.

{"Headline": "Waymo Asks Court to Block Uber\u2019s Self-Driving Car Project", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google\u2019s parent company last year, asked a federal court on Friday to block Uber\u2019s work on a competing self-driving vehicle that Waymo claimed could be using stolen technology.Gary Brown, Google\u2019s security engineer specializing in forensics, said in a partially redacted declaration that Mr. Levandowski searched Google\u2019s network in December 2015 for login details to a document repository for \u201cChauffeur,\u201d the internal code name for the driverless car project.Mr. Levandowski then installed special software that allowed him to access that repository and proceeded to download over 14,000 files, or about 9.7 gigabytes of data, according to the declaration. A few days later, Mr. Levandowski attached a memory card to his laptop for eight hours, Mr. Brown said.Mr. Levandowski, along with former Google employees Sameer Kshirsagar and Radu Raduta, gained access to a Google Drive folder containing company files and exported documents about suppliers to a personal device, according to the declaration. Soon after, they left the company for Otto, Mr. Brown said in his testimony.Waymo asked the federal court here for a preliminary injunction against Otto and Uber. A hearing for the injunction motion is scheduled for April 27.Waymo said in its initial lawsuit that it was inadvertently copied on an email from a supplier with blueprints of Uber\u2019s circuit board design for its lidar technology, or light detection and ranging sensors, used in self-driving cars. Waymo said Uber\u2019s designs bore \u201ca striking resemblance\u201d to its secret designs.In another partially redacted declaration filed with the court, Pierre-Yves Droz, a hardware engineer at Waymo, said Mr. Levandowski, while still with Google, told him that he wanted long-range lidar for his start-up and that he wanted to \u201creplicate\u201d Waymo\u2019s technology.Mr. Droz said this did not surprise him because Mr. Levandowski had told him earlier that he wanted to start a self-driving car company and that Uber would be interested in \u201cbuying the team\u201d responsible for the lidar being developed at Google.Mr. Droz also said Mr. Levandowski, after being spotted at Uber headquarters while still working at Google, admitted to him that he had met with the ride-hailing service because he was looking for investors for his new company. Mr. Droz joined Google when it acquired 510 Systems in 2011, a self-driving car start-up he founded with Mr. Levandowski.An injunction that hampers Uber\u2019s ability to keep working on driverless cars could be meaningful in the fast-moving industry. Traditional automakers and technology companies see major opportunities in sensor technology and artificial intelligence to replace traditional automobiles with autonomous vehicles.New start-ups are popping up regularly as both car companies and established tech firms are plowing money into acquiring talent and technology. Proponents of driverless cars say that autonomous vehicles will reduce the number of automobile fatalities and injuries, as well as free people to be more productive.Mr. Levandowski, Mr. Kshirsagar and Mr. Raduta could not be reached for comment.Uber has called the Waymo lawsuit \u201ca baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.\u201d An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the injunction request.Once allies, Alphabet \u2014 the parent company of Waymo\u2019s and Google \u2014 and Uber are now fierce competitors. Alphabet was one of Uber\u2019s early investors, with an $250 million investment in 2013. And Uber used to rely on Google\u2019s mapping technology before deciding to develop its own maps.As an independent company, Waymo is under greater pressure to generate revenue. It could enter the ride-hailing business with its autonomous vehicles.Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has said that autonomous vehicles are central to the company\u2019s future. Replacing human drivers with robot cars theoretically would allow Uber to lower costs over time and offer safer rides around the clock.Google started working on driverless cars eight years ago, long before most companies thought the concept could be commercially viable. While the technology has improved dramatically, Waymo has yet to articulate a business strategy for how it intends to make money from autonomous vehicles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "\nBy Nitsuh AbebeA strange thing you learn about American popular music, if you look back far enough, is that for a long time it didn\u2019t much have \u201cgenres\u201d \u2014 it had ethnicities. Vaudeville acts, for instance, had tunes for just about every major immigrant group: the Italian number, the Yiddish number, the Irish one, the Chinese. Some were sung in a spirit of abuse; others were written or performed by members of those groups themselves. And of course there were the minstrel shows, in which people with mocking, cork-painted faces sang what they pretended were the songs of Southern former slaves. This was how we reckoned with our melting pot: crudely, obliviously, maybe with a nice tune and a beat you could dance to.Sometime in the 1950s, the mainstream saw its last great gasp of this habit. A nation that considered itself very space-age and worldly enjoyed quaint spins on sentimental Italian music (\u201cThat\u2019s Amore\u201d and its pizza pies) and Trinidadian calypso songs about hard, simple labor (\u201cDay-O\u201d and its bananas). You had your \u201cLatin\u201d numbers, your Hawaiian ones, your \u201cAsian\u201d songs \u2014 light ethnic pastiches laid out cheerily, like an international buffet that serves falafel one day and schnitzel the next, never too bothered about how accurate the recipes are.There was a simple notion behind all this stuff, and it was the belief that music, like food, came from someplace, and from some people. Even when it was played in a condescending ethnic-joke burlesque of who those people actually were \u2014 even when it was pretty aggressively racist \u2014 the notion remained: Different styles sprang from different people. Then all of this changed, and we decided to start thinking of pop music not as a folk tradition but as an art; we started to picture musicians as people who invented sounds and styles, making intellectual decisions about their work.But music is still, pretty obviously, tied to people. How else do you create a situation in which, after decades of hip-hop\u2019s being the main engine of pop music, it can still be a little complicated when nonblack people rap? That vexed thing we call \u201cidentity\u201d leans its considerable weight on all kinds of questions: which sounds comfort us or excite us; where and how we listen to them; how we move our bodies as they play. Watch a mere silhouette of a human being dancing to music, and you can immediately guess things about who they are and where they came from.In 2017, identity is the topic at the absolute center of our conversations about music. There may be times when this fact grates at us, when it feels as though there must be other dimensions of the world to attend to; \u201csurely,\u201d you moan, \u201cthere are songs that speak to basic human emotions in ways that transcend the particulars of who we are!\u201d But if you look through the essays in this magazine, you may notice two things. One is that, unbidden and according to no plan, they find themselves continually reckoning with questions of identity. The other is that they\u2019re doing this because the musicians are, too.A Japanese-American musician writes a song called \u201cYour Best American Girl.\u201d An R.&B. singer titles one \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d \u2014 or, \u201cfor us, by us.\u201d Are you part of her \u201cus\u201d? The house music in Kanye West\u2019s \u201cFade\u201d: Does it make you picture the black Chicagoans who helped invent it or the club-going Europeans who embraced it? How does it work when a queer woman matches the sexual braggadocio of male rappers, when L.G.B.T. activists sing a country song for a restaurant chain that once fired gay employees, when Leonard Cohen revisits his childhood religious inheritance?This is what we talk about now, the music-makers and the music-listeners both. Not the fine details of genre and style \u2014 everyone, allegedly, listens to everything now \u2014 but the networks of identity that float within them. Maybe decades ago you could aim your songs at a mass market, but music does not really have one of those anymore. Artists have to figure out whom they\u2019re speaking to and where they\u2019re speaking from. The rest of us do the same. For better or worse, it\u2019s all identity now. \u2666Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.All I want to do is dance \u2014 but it\u2019s complicated.By Wesley MorrisLoving Adele shouldn\u2019t be that hard. When a chorus brings her voice to its cruising altitude, it\u2019s like you\u2019re up there, flying with it. Down here, on earth, where her third album, \u201c25,\u201d made Adele the top-selling artist of 2015 and 2016, she has that realness we say we value in the people we elevate to stardom; last month, during the Grammys telecast, she cursed as she interrupted a laconic version of George Michael\u2019s \u201cFastlove\u201d in order to get the tempo right.But even Adele knows that loving Adele is complicated. At the Grammys, \u201c25\u201d won album of the year, and a poignant portion of her acceptance speech was a tribute to Beyonc\u00e9, whose album \u201cLemonade\u201d broke the cultural Richter scale \u2014 and didn\u2019t win any of the big awards. The moment was poignant because it was earnest: Adele stood just a few feet in front of the woman she called her \u201cidol\u201d and spoke of how \u201cLemonade\u201d had empowered her and \u201cmy black friends.\u201d This was the sort of candor you usually have to wait for Kanye West to deliver, only with none of West\u2019s biliousness, recrimination and, however myopic, sense of history. Adele didn\u2019t have to acknowledge that history \u2014 of a white industry\u2019s crowning preference for white artists. She was living it.Black people have never been necessary to make black music. But it has become obligatory for white artists who do (and who win prizes for it) to pay a public contrition tax to their black peers, whether it\u2019s Adele to Beyonc\u00e9 or, three years earlier, Macklemore texting (then publicizing) an apology to Kendrick Lamar for having won (with Ryan Lewis) the Grammys in the rap category. That\u2019s the future of music: recognizing, in the present, that you\u2019re permanently indentured to the past.Setting aside its enormous sales, \u201c25\u201d is not the artistically catholic landmark that \u201cLemonade\u201d is but an old-fashioned record, built around the bloom and flare of Adele\u2019s singing. Some of the hooks, though, could catch a whale. And isn\u2019t whaling pop\u2019s whole point?Yes, certain cultural institutions have a habit of setting traps that trigger trauma. But when it\u2019s just me and Adele \u2014 very good Adele, catchy-as-hell Adele \u2014 the triggers lock. \u201cSend My Love (to Your New Lover),\u201d the second track on \u201c25,\u201d makes you mad that we live in a world where what happens at the Grammys can\u2019t not matter. It makes you mad that we put a political price tag on this kind of perfection. I must have danced to this song 200 times, in blocks of repeats. (Why doesn\u2019t this woman make more fast songs?)It starts with her saying, \u201cJust the guitar. O.K., cool.\u201d Then comes the rhythmic plink of a guitar Lindsey Buckingham might have picked. The plink is married to a kick drum\u2019s heartbeat. Then comes The Voice, at a low smolder, the smoke still rising from a crater of disillusionment. By the prechorus, her voice is flanked by other Adeles swooping in, on multiple tracks, to dispel the dismay of having dated someone with cold feet and to wish the best for this person\u2019s next girlfriend. \u201cSend my love to your new lover. Treat her better,\u201d she sings, going up a note and adding an extra, addictive breath to \u201clover.\u201dIs this a black song? It moves in dance-hall time. The swelling repetitions are chillingly churchy. And the voice itself has what can be only called soul. It\u2019s in the pews, the rafters and the aisles. I love this song because it makes me feel strong \u2014 as strong as singing \u201cWe gon\u2019 slay\u201d any time Beyonc\u00e9 does. In other words, \u201cSend My Love\u201d sets out to catch a whale. This song makes me feel ridiculous for reacting to institutional biases that pressure us into calling Adele a trespasser. All I want to do when I hear it is call her Ishmael.\u2666Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.After a long life, he was ready.By Jonathan MahlerIt wasn\u2019t an email from God, but it was close. Leonard Cohen had written to ask if Gideon Zelermyer, the cantor of Congregation Shaar Hashomayim near Montreal \u2014 Cohen\u2019s childhood synagogue \u2014 was interested in recording with him.Zelermyer was soon sitting inside the synagogue\u2019s sanctuary with a few members of Shaar\u2019s all-male choir, playing with different arrangements for \u201cYou Want It Darker,\u201d the title track of Cohen\u2019s 14th and final studio album. Some of the words Cohen had given them to work with were familiar; they were borrowed from two of Judaism\u2019s holiest prayers. One is the Kaddish, recited by mourners after the death of a loved one. The other is the High Holy Days prayer Hineni \u2014 literally, \u201cHere I am\u201d \u2014 a personal entreaty to God, the worshiper asking plaintively for mercy. The choir\u2019s voices are the first sounds you hear on the album, their ethereal harmonics giving way to sparse instrumentation and Cohen\u2019s weary, subterranean growl, then returning to back up the song\u2019s choruses and final movement.This was hardly the first time that Cohen had drawn on his Judaism for his music. Though he had a complicated relationship with his religious inheritance, it provided a natural vocabulary for him; it was what he knew, and its stories of human suffering and, occasionally, redemption suited his poet\u2019s pull toward the existential. But never before have Cohen\u2019s biblical references felt so charged, so dark, so pointed. \u201cMagnified, sanctified, be thy holy name,\u201d he sings. \u201cVilified, crucified, in the human frame. A million candles burning for the help that never came. You want it darker.\u201d Then, echoing the words that Abraham spoke as he answered God\u2019s command to sacrifice his only son: \u201cHineni, I\u2019m ready, my Lord.\u201dYou can\u2019t listen to these words without thinking about the fact that Cohen was dying when he recorded them. It\u2019s one thing to meditate on faith and mortality when death is an abstraction. It is surely another when you can feel it bearing down on you. And yet the choir\u2019s harmonies manage to transform the song, lifting Cohen\u2019s solitary struggle into something universal, even eternal.Cohen once said that he did not think of himself as a religious person, but his life was in many ways an extended spiritual journey. Buddhism, Scientology, kabbalah, Hare Krishna, Hinduism \u2014 Cohen sampled them all. Yet in his final years, he found himself drawn back to the 171-year-old synagogue where he had become a bar mitzvah, where both his grandfather and great-grandfather served as presidents, where a photograph of his Hebrew-school class taken in 1949 still hangs on the wall. Cohen was living in Los Angeles, but a cousin in Montreal sent him a recording of Zelermyer and his choir, reuniting Cohen with sounds that had never stopped echoing in his head. He and the cantor struck up an email correspondence. \u201cMay your voice reach that Place and bring down the blessings,\u201d Cohen wrote Zelermyer in 2008, before the High Holy Days. (\u201cHe can\u2019t write anything normally, can he?\u201d the cantor remembers thinking.) And then several years later came the note, asking for help with a new record. As Cohen put it, \u201cI\u2019m looking for a sound like the Shaar choir and cantor of my youth.\u201dIn October, the record-release event for \u201cYou Want It Darker\u201d was held at the residence of the Canadian consul general in Los Angeles. Zelermyer was seated with the other V.I.P.s in the front row. It was the first time he had met Cohen in person. It would also be the last. Weeks later, Cohen\u2019s coffin was lowered into the earth at Shaar Hashomayim\u2019s cemetery. Zelermyer stood next to Cohen\u2019s family as they recited the Kaddish.\u2666Jonathan Mahler is a staff writer for the magazine.A rap legend bends the present into a hopeful future.By Julianne Escobedo ShepherdWhen Missy Elliott divines the future in her science-fiction-inflected videos, she never envisions dystopia. Even in the oversize jacket bearing the slogan \u201cSave the Humans\u201d that she wears in the video for \u201cI\u2019m Better,\u201d her optimism supersedes the plea. Positivity feels like an intrinsic part of her message and her temperament, and in a climate of uncertainty and fear, \u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d is an alien message of hope, full of sneaky inspiration meant to help us get up in the morning, rise-and-grind style. \u201cIt\u2019s another day, another chance,\u201d the Miami producer Lamb raps, helping Elliott out on the chorus. \u201cI wake up, I wanna dance. So as long as I got my friends ... I\u2019m better, I\u2019m better, I\u2019m better!\u201dReleased in the last week of January, the signature futurism of \u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d was a welcome jolt. The beat is so stark it\u2019s almost jarring, with a tiptoeing synth melody that makes Elliott sound like some kind of gumshoe on the case, tracking down dudes in the act of creeping. Characteristically slick, the video features dancers in headgear that mimics light-therapy acne masks. Elliott gleams in outlandish feathered adornment and lip gloss the color of a vinyl record, delivering cheeky brags about her coterie of admirers, who watch her \u201clike he watchin\u2019 \u2018Scandal\u2019 \u2014 but I\u2019m just here with my girls.\u201dElliott\u2019s approach has always been an antidote to conservatism, both within music and sometimes outside it. She\u2019s unwilling to abide by any perceived rules of language. For years, she has bent rhythmic parameters and willfully warped nouns so that they rhyme, as if to prove that there\u2019s always another, probably far cooler way of going about life and language than the rest of us have recognized. On \u201cI\u2019m Better,\u201d she rhymes the Spanish word for \u201cfire\u201d with an English word for a car \u2014 \u201cHe say I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m so fue-eh-go/Pull up on him in my veh-heh-co.\u201d These tricks carry such uncomplicated joy that they give us permission to celebrate too. \u201cHe say I\u2019m pretty, I\u2019m pretty, you must be from Brazil, I must be from M\u00e9xico,\u201d she concludes, rhyming the Spanish pronunciation \u2014 and giving dap to those of us with origins in the global South, who could use the shout-out these days.\u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d also positions Elliott in the American South, the Virginia of her upbringing, as well as Orlando, Miami, Atlanta. Its sound adheres to current trends in Southern hip-hop \u2014 which is curious, because Elliott sets trends but rarely follows them. Yet by employing the syrupy, stripped-down delivery so many young Southern rappers favor, she establishes a lineage, from her work to theirs: Stylistically, it is difficult to imagine a Migos without a Missy Elliott.For Elliott to position herself within a style that\u2019s popular and yet often derided, usually by Northerners and hip-hop fans over the age of 25 \u2014 for her to sprinkle her flavor on the 2017 iteration of music made for the subwoofers in your Jeep \u2014 does a real service to youth culture. More than most rappers, she seems to bend time to her will. And if she can\u2019t stop it, she will swerve around it.\u2666Julianne Escobedo Shepherd is the culture editor for Jezebel.Party music for the age of opiates.By Amos BarshadOn the first night I found myself at a chicken shop called Nando\u2019s, directly across the street from his overflowing concert venue, rather than backstage as planned. With great envy, I stared at the crowd flowing in as I munched my breast-and-wing combo.Future had just sat down for an interview with the BBC\u2019s Charlie Sloth, who asked him about his relationship with Blac Chyna, the Kardashian-affiliated reality-TV personality with whom he\u2019d possibly been romantically involved. \u201cAre yous two still cool?\u201d Sloth asked, in a punchy London rumble. \u201cWe great,\u201d Future responded, in his trademark flat-affect reserve.Privately, though, the entreaty into his personal life enraged him. He declared an immediate media blackout. I was in line for his concert when I got the call from P.R.: The interview was decisively off. I spent a weekend eating delicious Pakistani food, watching Tottenham play Leicester City, hoping for a change of mind that never came.At that point, Future was roughly two years into a radical public and artistic reimagining. It started in the fall of 2014, not long after his breakup with the R.&B. singer Ciara and the soft landing of his pop-friendly sophomore album, \u201cHonest.\u201d The failure became an important inflection point. Over the next few years, he created a swelling mass of music with a cloaking grandness to it: Take a step inside, and you were entombed. The songs were lean and incessant and almost completely devoid of any other voice but Future\u2019s. And what that voice was intimating to us, from behind the thickest of blackout curtains, was that our man had given up on his conscience and that he was guzzling the prescription cough syrup Promethazine and downing Xanax and that he was having sex with women he did not really care about and that this was neither making him feel good nor bad but rather it was making him feel nothing.And then, the really weird part: Suddenly, rightfully, Future was considered an artist who could not be ignored, our best next hope for rap-star transcendence. Embracing personal destruction took him there. Was it a meltdown or a rise? What were we to make of a man who made party music out of a death rattle? How should I know? I was stuck at Nando\u2019s.Take \u201cMask Off,\u201d a down-tempo track built, by the elite producer Metro Boomin, around a bizarre but lovely woodwind sample. The song hints at a certain kind of violence and ruthlessness, the kind suggested by a criminal setting off into the night and choosing to leave the ski mask at home. And yet it\u2019s the kind of song you would want the D.J. to slip on right when you\u2019ve lost count of your drinks and you\u2019re feeling buzzy and smiley and warm.Historically, M.C.s have treated narcotics as product to be moved; today\u2019s younger, party-happy rappers give drugs a gleeful knucklehead spin. But when Future describes his voluminous intake, he does so with all the zeal of a man popping open a days-of-the-week pill organizer. On the hook to \u201cMask Off,\u201d Future rattles off drugs, unsentimentally: \u201cPercocets/Molly, Percocets.\u201d For him, sometimes the drugs are great; sometimes, not so much. On \u201cMask Off,\u201d amid rhymes about how totally fun and good his life is, he calls Promethazine his \u201cguillotine.\u201dIt feels reductive to try to pin an artist down on the sins of his persona. Hip-hop\u2019s greatest running trick has been blurring the lines of \u201creal life\u201d and art. But with the rate at which Future was rapping about drugs, one question was inevitably posed: Is this an addiction? If so, it was a new spin on a classic trope. The arc of pretty much every drug movie mimics the whiz-bang of the initial high and the eye-blackening horror of the inevitable comedown. Future\u2019s music acknowledged that drug addiction isn\u2019t that cinematically neat: It\u2019s the high and the comedown over and over again.After London, Future\u2019s P.R. staff and I got back into our little dance. Emails, calls, texts, pleadings. Soon, I received word that Future was ready to talk again. It was in Toronto that we actually met, and where it was so cold that the streets had a kind of a permafrost hue. The pavement felt as if it could, at any point, shatter. For a few days, I tagged along with Future and his affable crew. The first order of business was an interview with a TV station on the 19th floor of a high-end hotel.The interviewer, a friendly reporter in all black, was drinking a glass of white wine. She showed Future the tattoos on her arm; I couldn\u2019t quite see them, but they were apparently inspired by his music. \u201cOh!\u201d he said in delight, then waved away Shooter, his ever-present personal photographer. \u201cLet us have this moment.\u201d Apparently emboldened, the reporter shared more. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking \u2019cause I\u2019m nervous,\u201d she told him. She had ended a long-term relationship, she said, because of his music.In person, Future provides no outward signs that you should approach him with confessionals. He\u2019s imposingly tall and more than a little grave. He is also beautiful. (L.A. Reid, chairman of Epic Records, who signed Future, told me of their initial meeting: \u201cUsually I ask people to audition. Future, I didn\u2019t even want him to move. \u2018Let\u2019s get you signed while you\u2019re sitting there looking like that.\u2019\u2009\u201d) But the TV reporter went for it, and it was brave. And almost immediately, Future went back to thumbing through his phone. He either hadn\u2019t heard what she said or he chose to ignore it. After a few beats of silence he finally looked up. \u201cAy, what\u2019s the name of this hotel?\u201dThe next day, I finally had my chance to connect. We were upstairs at a middlebrow bistro with a lot of bare wood, and Future had just finished off an impromptu date. His partner had off-white blond hair tucked under an actually white baseball cap and was wearing a combination bodysuit/tunic (also white). She\u2019d brought him a late Valentine\u2019s Day gift, a nice puffy coat: \u201cIt\u2019s that Chanel swag!\u201d she announced. They ate sushi, chicken wings and steak salad. She told him that when she travels, she likes to stay at Airbnbs because that way you get \u201cimmersed\u201d in local culture.And I know this because during the totality of the date, the team and I were sitting at the adjoining table. Eventually his date left, and Future announced his verdict on the holiday, to grins from the crew: \u201cMan this Valentine\u2019s Day [expletive] a setup.\u201dFinally, we talked. I brought up London. He smiled. I guess you could call it a sheepish smile. I told him it really didn\u2019t seem as if he wanted to do press at all. I asked him why he was going through with it. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do it,\u201d he said, maybe even relieved to say it out loud. \u201cMy publicist like: \u2018Man, why you got a publicist if you don\u2019t wanna do press?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to give you the real me, but they want me to be fake, so I\u2019d rather not even say nothing.\u201dThe conversation rolled on, meandered. It even clicked into gear at a few points. He talked about his itinerant childhood, how he never wanted to have a fixed address so no one with an antagonistic agenda would ever be able to find him. He talked about the love and care of the family members that sorted him out. He remembered the joy of playing \u201cRacks,\u201d an early hit, for the first time and how the D.J. loved it so much he didn\u2019t want to give the CD back. And he said that it all, eventually, changed everything. \u201cBack then, I had no feelings,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started doing music that I started to really have a conscience.\u201dIt was nice, and fleeting. But I never was able to get a hook into him. I never could formulate a question that made him want to really talk. When I called DJ Spinz, one of Future\u2019s regular collaborators, he told me about Future\u2019s work ethic, his remarkable ability to unfurl a whole song after 20 minutes of hearing a beat roll. But nothing he said felt as relevant as when he told me this: \u201cFuture doesn\u2019t speak much.\u201dI was reminded of a moment back in London. I had stuck around after Nando\u2019s long enough to try to finagle my way into the show. My move was to sidle close to the stage door, in the alley, hoping for an opening. It never came. Upon Future\u2019s arrival, his luxury sedan idled until minutes before his set time. Then he exited the back seat and walked directly through the stage door, surrounded by an imposing security detail, with the massive hood of an arctic parka over his head. I never even saw his face.I chased Future through two separate sovereign nations and walked away remembering one thing: I love rappers. They never break character.\u2666Amos Barshad is a senior writer for The Fader magazine.Can choir nerds bring harmony to a divided country?By Amy PhillipsThe third of those Grammys, for Best Country Duo/Group Performance, came in February, for a collaboration with Dolly Parton on a new version of her \u201970s heartbreak classic, \u201cJolene.\u201d The world has Cracker Barrel to thank for this team-up: Both Parton and Pentatonix have partnerships with the chain, which brought them together to record \u201cJolene\u201d as a promotional single. The result sounds like a barbershop quartet singing at an old-timey barn raising. \u201cWe\u2019re both very family-centric and very wholesome,\u201d Kirstin Maldonado, the Pentatonix mezzo-soprano, said in 2015, explaining why the group\u2019s image meshes so well with the brand\u2019s, \u201cand I think our demographics really integrate well.\u201dThis \u201cSesame Street\u201d version of American harmony makes the group\u2019s association with Cracker Barrel \u2014 which has a history of discrimination \u2014 particularly fascinating. Despite looking like a United Colors of Benetton ad styled by the Kardashians, the members of Pentatonix sound like the jukebox at a heavily chaperoned sock hop; through them, Cracker Barrel can dip its toes in the waters of inclusion without fearing any backlash. Indeed, if you\u2019re looking for criticism of Pentatonix, you\u2019re more likely to find it on liberal music websites trashing its \u201cnightmarishly hammy\u201d sound (to quote Rolling Stone) than on conservative sites attacking its politics. Members have appeared on \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d and \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d and nobody batted an eye. Could it be that five choir nerds hold the secret to bridging a divided nation?\u2666Amy Phillips is the news director for Pitchfork.Who makes the protest music?By Greg TateOf course it would be A Tribe Called Quest who gave the nation\u2019s pop body politic its first acidly anthemic counterassault on Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant sentiments. This is, after all, the Golden Age vintage hip-hop band with respective Trinidadian-American and Muslim founders in Phife Dawg and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, one half of the original team; the one that gave dap to the plight of Haitian immigrants on its 1990 debut album, \u201cPeople\u2019s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm\u201d; the group whose very name is a panegyric in praise of the hyphenated American dream. Of course they did it.By February, A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s Grammy performance was sustaining the same Black Panther- and Public Enemy-powered momentum that Beyonc\u00e9 brought to last year\u2019s Super Bowl \u2014 the same kind in Kendrick Lamar\u2019s own fire-breathing, flame-throwing, plantation-to-penitentiary salvo at last year\u2019s Grammys.To the extent that America\u2019s current protest movement has provoked any pop paeans worthy of Bob Dylan or Curtis Mayfield, they have emerged out of Black Lives Matter \u2014 and in remarkably short order. It has been 31 months since \u201cwe the people\u201d of Ferguson, and then Baltimore, inspired not just those cities\u2019 urban commandos but a generation of youthful-and-truthful hip-hop and R.& B. standard-bearers. Whether the white alt-rock left will seize this moment\u2019s baton as frankly or as fruitfully remains to be seen.We need not hold our breath waiting, though. \u201cWe the People ....\u201d is full of ready-to-rumble pushback. Its lyrics name and gather together all the targeted \u2014 Mexicanfolk, Muslimfolk, gayfolk, womenfolk, #BlackLivesMatterfolk \u2014 under one force field. And under one intersectional, Queens-bred guerrilla meal plan:\u201cWe don\u2019t believe you \u2019cause we the peopleAre still here in the rear, ayo, we don\u2019t need youYou in the \u2018killing off good young nigga\u2019 moodWhen we get hungry we eat the same [expletive] foodThe ramen noodle.\u201d\u2666Greg Tate is a writer and musician who lives in Harlem.Rap music fully unmoored from its past.By JAMIE LAUREN KEILESThere are two different ways you can keep up with pop. The first is by drifting along with the current, bobbing immersed in the changing of the charts \u2014 so lost from any point of reference on the shore that minor fluctuations (the downfall of an air horn, the outflow of a sound) hardly register. From there, in the tide, you don\u2019t ask, \u201cHow did pop get here?\u201d because you were with it the whole time. You, most likely, are in high school, or college, or somewhere that music flows like water all around. Pop, in such places, is understood by osmosis.The rest of us \u2014 less lucky \u2014 must accept the second system. Somewhere along the way we get busy with work, or prioritize movies, or decide to have kids and look up to find we\u2019ve lost the thread. We emerge from our hiatus and turn on the radio only to wonder, \u201cHow did pop get here?\u201d We have no idea. It is then that we begin to study pop trends by rote \u2014 by reading reviews and listening to podcasts, by looking up songs on Shazam in the drugstore, by turning to Google to ask it: \u201cWho is Lil Yachty?\u201dBefore I heard Yachty\u2019s music, I heard that he was awful. I heard he had no flow and couldn\u2019t rap, was a meme and a poseur, wasn\u2019t repping the culture. Wiz Khalifa called his style \u201cmumble rap.\u201d His sound, I heard, was dinky. When I finally relented and listened to \u201cOne Night\u201d \u2014 Yachty\u2019s top-charting song of last year \u2014 nothing I heard could dispel what I\u2019d been told. Flow? Clumsy. Lyrics? Bland. The beat on the track was the inverse of a banger \u2014 tinny and thin, compulsively looping, like something churned out with a really cool toy. In a voice that was somehow both droning and singsong, the 19-year-old Atlantan wanly shrugged off commitment. It was an anthem for the player who can\u2019t be tied down, run a thousand times though a Xerox machine. Catchy like a backing track in a commercial, it was sticky for all the texture it lacked. I listened on repeat with car-crash infatuation. It wasn\u2019t good rap by any technical metric \u2014 or at least not by any metric I knew \u2014 but for some unknown reason, I wanted to like it. Like any pop \u00e9migr\u00e9, I started to study.The hip-hop establishment had little to offer. Ebro Darden of Hot 97 took to Twitter to whine about Yachty; \u201990s production legend Pete Rock posted online, \u201cHe sucks mud on a rainy day!\u201d Yachty, meanwhile, seemed to pay little mind to the genre conventions he\u2019d supposedly betrayed. Of hip-hop forefathers Biggie and Tupac, he told Billboard, \u201cI honestly couldn\u2019t name five songs.\u201d Instead, his influences were Fall Out Boy and Coldplay. He signed an endorsement deal with Target, alongside the Canadian pop star Carly Rae Jepsen. In Nautica shirts and plastic-beaded braids, he was an ungraceful hybrid of your grandpa and your niece. In the style of Warhol backstage at WrestleMania \u2014 awkward and quiet, but nonetheless enthused \u2014 he made the rounds, telling press outlets, \u201cI\u2019m not a rapper.\u201d Instead, he claimed he was an artist, a brand. As old-schoolers and gatekeepers scratched their heads and wept, Yachty continued to rise through the ranks, buoyed by fans who had no trouble understanding.The subsequent music video made a mockery of an older generation\u2019s rap-vid fantasies. What begins as Yachty on a yacht with three women quickly descends into maritime madness \u2014 jump-cuts from hammerhead sharks and harpoons, to dress-up in wet suits and other nautical garb, to glitch-art graphics of slow-swimming fish, calling to mind the early days of home computers. It\u2019s a sloppy pastiche of what\u2019s cool right now: a surging nostalgia for the \u201990s, blended with the net-art aesthetic of today, wrapped in the cachet of an Atlanta pedigree. It might all be a gimmick, but it doesn\u2019t feel random. If rap music is founded on a process of layering \u2014 autobiography with references and samples \u2014 then Yachty does the same for the rap career itself, mixing what\u2019s trending with the right group of friends and tying it together with the loose thread of a sound. If it isn\u2019t good rap, then it\u2019s the perfect kind of music for those of us barely treading water in the zeitgeist, who can\u2019t understand new music by ear. Yachty had to do his research, just like the rest of us.\u2666Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer based in Los Angeles.She has found her own corner of R.&B.By JENNA WORTHAMThere were no whoops, claps or even smiles. The audience remained passive. Kelela likes to keep an eye out for the edges of the crowd, where her core fans (\u201cthe queer black and brown weirdos\u201d as she put it to me) usually congregate. But tonight, the scene was homogeneous in a very European way: Women favored striped boatnecks, red lips and messy topknots; the men, zipped-up pullovers and spotless white trainers. Kelela nodded at her D.J., Loric Sih, a sweet-faced boy with bleached blond hair and wire-rimmed Harry Potter glasses, and they dove into her set. True to her word, amid the switchbacks of her feathery falsetto voice, there was no mistaking the roots of classic R.&B. \u2014 all set to spacey electronic beats far outside the traditional canon. The room became a sound installation of Kelela\u2019s reverb-y vocals and synthetic \u201990s-era Miami bass.Kelela\u2019s stage was minimally adorned, but her lighting team is adept at creating James Turrell-like lightscapes that drape her figure in rich reds, purples and blues. At one point, her face and body were illuminated by an electric shade of cyan, while the background remained shaded in dark azure. The effect made Kelela look as ethereal and spectral as the music radiating from the speakers. The handful of times I\u2019d seen her perform in the United States, the audience was rapt for the entire performance \u2014 reverent during her atmospheric songs, breaking into exuberant, feverish dance during her fast-paced ones. (Her music can keep the lovesick company in bed just as easily as it can shepherd a party past sunrise.)But that night the concertgoers remained inscrutable. When she transitioned into a new song \u2014 \u201cBlue Light,\u201d the first single from her long-awaited debut album \u2014 I pulled out my phone and sent the recording to some friends back home. Some 4,000 miles away, they seemed more excited than the people physically present in the concert hall. Finally, about 30 minutes into her set, Sih began playing \u201cRewind,\u201d the closest thing Kelela has to a pop song. The audience, charmed at last, succumbed to the irresistible beat and danced along. The moment was buoyant but short-lived: It was her last number. She thanked the crowd and then bounded offstage.When she was back in her dressing room, the composure Kelela had projected to the audience quickly dissipated. She stood with her hands on her hips, chewing on her lip. Her boyfriend \u2014 a filmmaker named Cieron Magat, with whom she shares an apartment in London \u2014 murmured words of reassurance and handed her a cup of homemade ginger tea. \u201cThat was one of the worst ones,\u201d she said, sighing and taking off her earrings. Magat told her not to worry, but Kelela wanted to deconstruct the performance.\u201cThe thing I\u2019m always looking for are the eyes, or even the face that\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know what this is but I\u2019m into it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I got nothing.\u201d She peeled her clothes off absent-mindedly and paced around her dressing room. \u201cI was this guy\u201d \u2014 she threw her arms up in imitation of the shruggie emoticon \u2014 and sighed again. \u201cBut it\u2019s unrealistic in this context.\u201dIn her dressing room, Kelela folded herself into a pretzel on the couch next to me. A candle burned in the background. She knew it had been an off night, but because she loves performing so much, she was still buzzing from the energy. \u201cThe goal,\u201d she explained, \u201cis just \u2014 how many people can I put on, just so they can name it, even if they don\u2019t know what it is yet?\u201dIn her early to mid 20s, she would go to a Washington bar called 18th Street Lounge for its Sunday-night house sessions. A D.J. named Sam Burns played eclectic soul and deep house music, and after a few drinks, if she heard a bit of music that reminded her of another song, she would jump on the microphone and blend the two in real-time. \u201cI would run to the microphone and figure out a way to sing it. I would create a flip,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is where I live.\u201dHer first boyfriend, Kris Funn, whom she met when she was 19, played the upright bass, and she sat in bars for hours, watching him and his friends play. She joked to me that she was a \u201cjazz wife\u201d but also admitted that she received an unexpected education: She learned to listen to music, to get a feel for it. Eventually the couple broke up, but Funn encouraged Kelela to trust her instincts and not be intimidated by her lack of formal music training.By that time, Kelela was a student at American University, studying international studies and sociology. \u201cI was the only brown girl, all the time, talking about African politics,\u201d she told me. \u201cI thought I was going to be an academic. In my head, I am supposed to be a college graduate. I wanted to finish. But I was not motivated to sit there and do that paper. I had a lot of resistance.\u201d She felt alienated by the program. She dropped out.This was in 2006, and synthpop, epitomized by bands like the Knife, was trending. She began recording in a punk house in Washington, a city with a hard-core lineage that included acts like Fugazi and Bad Brains. She thrived in an environment devoid of rules. \u201cWhat\u2019s so beautiful about punk culture,\u201d Kelela says, \u201cis that the whole idea is that you don\u2019t have to be perfect. Just try. Let\u2019s just try to make it ourselves.\u201d At first she sang over indie rock, but it didn\u2019t feel authentic to her. She wanted to experiment with electronic music \u2014 \u201cnot real instruments,\u201d she says.She spent hours on MySpace, scrolling through pages of music and listening to instrumentals. She recorded herself singing over sounds she liked. Then she would send the artist her sample, along with an invitation to collaborate. Two notable electronic producers agreed, including Daedelus, who featured her on a track. At the same time, a friend introduced her to the electro duo Teengirl Fantasy, and they created a song. Will Boston, a founder of the music label Fade to Mind, heard their collaboration and was impressed by what he described to me as her \u201cwealth of startling honesty, felt through her vocals.\u201dBy then, Kelela was living in Los Angeles, and Boston brought her a thumb drive of sounds from the label and its British counterpart, Night Slugs. Kelela spent the next several days poring over the files, improvising lyrics over the sounds she liked, turning them into songs. She loved the otherworldliness of the instrumentals \u2014 staccato mixes that used sound effects like tinkling glass and guns reloading over drum machines. The music complemented the gossamer scales she likes to sing in. It was \u201cexactly what I\u2019d been looking for,\u201d she says. Two of the songs she produced during this time were on the mixtape she released in 2013. Kelela took care to describe her role in developing the mixtape, to make certain I knew how active she was in it \u2014 perhaps to counter the idea that she isn\u2019t self-made or in charge of her own sound. \u201cThe first thing people want to take away from me is my agency,\u201d she told me.Alex Sushon, an electronic producer who goes by Bok Bok, was one of the artists Kelela met as she was working on her mixtape, and these days, she tends to work mostly with British producers like him, possibly because they\u2019ve been pushing the boundaries of R.&B. more aggressively by blending it with grime, the East London style of dance music. Electronica, Sushon told me, is referential in the same way that R.&B. tends to be. \u201cThat\u2019s how we think about music, inserting small samples from other genres, little shortcuts that are saying something by playing something,\u201d he says. Because of the internet, he explained, musicians can share references more easily than they did in the past. Google, YouTube and SoundCloud make it easy. Sushon compares this dynamic to \u201cmemes, but in musical form.\u201dThe closest analogy is sampling, but it\u2019s more complex than that. I watched Kelela and her D.J. perform this trick onstage, during one of their songs in Strasbourg. While she was singing \u201cThe High,\u201d a fuzzed-out, gritty ode to desire, Sih mixed in a few seconds of a 2002 song by Tweet called \u201cOops (Oh My),\u201d and Kelela segued into its vocals. Here, suddenly, was the thrilling flicker of a decade-old hit that had almost entirely faded from popular culture, tucked into her own noir love song. It was the perfect encapsulation of Kelela\u2019s odd 21st-century gift for taking familiar sounds and repurposing them in a new context, a kind of lyrical d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.The dynamics that bothered Kelela in college didn\u2019t disappear when she became an artist \u2014 if anything, they intensified. As a student, she was introduced to black academics and feminists like Audre Lorde, Bell Hooks and Angela Davis. These women helped her make sense of the racial and sexist forces that shape the world, and she still turns to them to navigate the music industry. She internalized their insistence to not be apologetic for her womanhood or blackness and not be debilitated by exclusion.Sprawled on the bed in the apartment\u2019s master bedroom, Kelela told me that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s loss at the Grammys depressed her and made her question the metrics of success for mainstream musicians. \u201cIf that\u2019s the highest we can achieve in that framework, it doesn\u2019t even make sense to try,\u201d she told me. A notebook was open to a blank page on the night stand, alongside \u201cB Jenkins,\u201d a Fred Moten poetry book that explores the interstitial space among jazz, black aesthetics and politics. Moten\u2019s work concerns itself with the \u201cresistance of the object\u201d and the way that blackness refuses commodification. Kelela is aware of how artists like her get co-opted, morphed into something symbolic that they no longer control, and is determined to avoid it.I had already heard the lengths to which she would go to prevent this from happening. The first night we met, I asked her how she managed expectations as an artist in an age of hyperconsumption. I mostly meant her reserve on social media, despite the disturbingly insistent demands in her Twitter and Instagram mentions for her next release. Instead, she described an encounter with Fendi, the Italian luxury brand, which invited her to perform at its new headquarters in Rome to celebrate the start of a new website aimed at millennials. Researching the headquarters online, she discovered that the Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana, the impressive white marble colosseum that Fendi had taken over, was built to be a propaganda tool under Benito Mussolini. \u201cI\u2019m Ethiopian,\u201d she reminded me: Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935, just before World War II. She didn\u2019t want her body, her blackness, to be used by a brand, even a big fashion label like Fendi, as a proxy for cool in this context. She asked Fendi representatives to agree to release a statement addressing her concerns as a condition of her involvement. \u201cThat flipped the whole damn script,\u201d she said. They\u2019re still negotiating the partnership, but the interaction speaks to how Kelela views her role: \u201cIf an artist says something, people listen,\u201d she told me. She sees herself as someone who can wield her status as a celebrity to catalyze change.As the evening wound down, Kelela invited me to get comfortable and listen to some of her new tracks. She gave me earbuds and left me alone to listen. (When I pressed her about a release date, she made a coquettish face and demurred, saying the songs were still being mixed. In reality, she just signed with Warp Records, which will take over the release of the album.) Earlier in the night, she said that as politically aware as she feels she is, she didn\u2019t make an album that addresses those views. \u201cThere was a period after I finished all the songs, I was nervous because I was like: There\u2019s nothing about my experience as a black woman overtly in this. But I could never not make anything from any other place.\u201d The songs instead deal with the agony of falling out of love and the ecstasy of finding it anew. Her voice is as pretty as ever, rising and crashing like cresting waves over beats that swing from a druggy drone to throbbing bass lines perfect for dance-floor grinding. In their own way, they are a quiet protest: They feel radical in the way a Kerry James Marshall painting or a Ntozake Shange poem expresses the humanity and beauty of black life. \u201cAll of that is happening in a world that does not want me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a safe space for us to feel, and not necessarily for anyone else.\u201d\u2666Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.An earworm that nearly eluded its audience.By LYDIA KIESLINGThe song, \u201cThis Girl,\u201d is a result of the (at the time) 19-year-old French D.J. and producer Valentin Brunel, alias Kungs, trawling YouTube videos in his bedroom and finding an obscure 2009 soul-revival tune by the Australian band Cookin\u2019 on 3 Burners. Brunel remixed the song, speeding it up into what he calls a \u201chappy house track.\u201d With the aid of Spotify, the song soon became a viral hit, topping charts across the globe and leaving no one more surprised than its respective creators.What is it about \u201cThis Girl\u201d? The rich vocals of Kylie Auldist, the singer for Cookin\u2019 on 3 Burners? The retro, cheerful, almost cloying guitar riff? Cynics might say that Kungs left the heavy lifting to Auldist and her bandmates, but this diminishes Kungs\u2019s inspired additions: his trumpets and his house beat, crucial to the ecstatic danciness of the new version. The result is youthful magic, the aural version of dancing until dawn with a boy you just met. Of smoking cigarettes on a rooftop all hot summer night.These days, an enterprising 19-year-old can browse YouTube, find something that catches his fancy, transform it and broadcast it to the world. An algorithm can anticipate my taste so precisely that it serves up the song I\u2019ve been dying to hear. There\u2019s something about the timing: \u201cThis Girl\u201d is upbeat and joyful and nostalgic when the news has been a grim parade. The same year the video\u2019s young lovers frolicked on the Mediterranean, some 5,000 people died trying to cross the same body of water. Our atmosphere is on track to become one long hot summer night. In harrowing times, this earworm asks little and gives a lot. It\u2019s an echo of better times \u2014 and one you can dance to.\u2666Lydia Kiesling is the editor of The Millions.Very good music for very bad feelings.By JOHN DARNIELLESometimes you just want to kill somebody, you know? Really end their life: make mourners of their friends and family, make orphans of their children, leave a hole in the world where a person once was. You don\u2019t feel this way all the time \u2014 you\u2019re not a monster. But sometimes you do. Maybe this didn\u2019t always happen; maybe you can remember a time when you not only didn\u2019t want to kill anybody but also hoped, moreover, to never even know what it felt like to want such an awful thing. But you were a child then, probably, and poets are always making hay about how you can\u2019t get back to that condition in this world. You\u2019re not a kid anymore, and every once in a while \u2014 not every day, except maybe sometimes for several days in a row \u2014 you want to kill somebody.Maybe you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. But if you do, when you do, maybe sometimes it kind of gets away from you, right? Obviously you won\u2019t kill this person, because you can\u2019t kill them, because you\u2019re not that sort of person, and besides, you\u2019d get caught, and you\u2019re pretty sure you couldn\u2019t hack it in prison. Would you cover your tracks? Try to hide the body? Go into hiding and hear about yourself on the news? Walk through the doors of the police station and turn yourself in? You think about these things when you want to kill somebody. You have the occasional dream about them. They\u2019re not pleasant thoughts, and it\u2019s not a pleasant dream.What\u2019s your damage? How did you get like this? Brain chemistry? Trauma? Read too many stories about Ozzy Osbourne biting the heads off bats when you were a kid? It doesn\u2019t matter. Two things matter: First, you\u2019re not going to kill anybody, because you are a decent person who wishes no one any real harm; second, you need to do something a little more creative with your feelings than just pretending they\u2019re not there. For some people, that means hitting the gym. For others, it means a stereo with a volume knob.Heavy metal has been providing people with catharsis for nearly 50 years. There\u2019s more to metal than that, of course, which ought to go without saying \u2014 not every metalhead harbors some hideous inner sadist. When I listen to death metal, it\u2019s not for the splatter-gore violence of its themes but for the breathtaking proficiency and relentless musical curiosity of the musicians who play it: To even get your foot in death metal\u2019s door, you have to be awfully good at your instrument. But Church of Misery doesn\u2019t play death metal; it plays stoner doom (the band itself prefers \u201cdoom,\u201d without the modifier), and I don\u2019t listen to it for the pleasure of immersion in technical wizardry. I listen to it because of how it makes me feel.Who\u2019s Church of Misery? Chiefly, they\u2019re the brainchild of the bassist Tatsu Mikami. They\u2019ve been putting out records since the late 1990s. They have six studio efforts, numerous EPs and a live album to their credit, and every song on every album except one takes, as its theme, a known serial killer. (Their first studio recording was made before they settled on their thematic focus and wasn\u2019t officially released for years.) Songs indicate their subjects parenthetically: \u201cD\u00fcsseldorf Monster (Peter K\u00fcrten),\u201d \u201cShotgun Boogie (James Oliver Huberty),\u201d \u201cRed Ripper Blues (Andrei Chikatilo).\u201d Some of their subjects are widely infamous \u2014 Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, the Heaven\u2019s Gate cult. Others are so obscure that only true crime buffs are likely to recognize their names. Look them up at your peril: These are people whose crimes will give you nightmares.\u201cMake Them Die Slowly\u201d is the second song on the band\u2019s latest album, \u201cAnd Then There Were None ... ,\u201d and it is impossibly heavy. It begins with a thudding kick drum all alone, with the central guitar riff ambling in murderously after two bars \u2014 a figure that lurches methodically through three five-note patterns to resolve on three descending chords that land like boulders being dropped on a house. My iTunes play count shows that I listened to it more than I listened to any song in 2016 except for drafts of songs I was writing myself. Scott Carlson of the legendary Repulsion sings it; the 2016 incarnation of the band was essentially a reboot, with Mikami the only original member. Carlson\u2019s feel for metal forms is instinctive and inerrant; when he sings the initial chorus \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll hang you high and drain your blood/sip on the nectar while your bones reduce to sludge\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s as if all that stuff about Ozzy had been true: Here\u2019s a guy gleefully recounting obscure, unthinkable real-world crimes as if they were fond memories of his time in varsity football. It\u2019s seductive and irresistible. It has a cowbell. You can bang your head and sing along.I have spent a fair bit of idle time over the years wondering what it says about me that I want to indulge this mood at least a few times a week for the rest of my life, occasionally at earsplitting volumes in clubs. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m secretly a murderer; I\u2019m a liberal softy. I can\u2019t even eat animals. When I was young, if I heard something that sounded too celebratory of death, it terrified me. I\u2019ll never forget seeing the clip for \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d on \u201cDon Kirshner\u2019s Rock Concert\u201d when I was very young, maybe 9 years old, up too late. I listened to Freddie Mercury sing the verse about how he\u2019d just killed a man by shooting him point blank in the head \u2014 although I thought he was speaking in the third person rather than the vocative, that it was his \u201cmama\u201d who\u2019d just killed a man \u2014 and, horrified, I turned off the television. Over time, though, that feeling \u2014 the shock, the revulsion \u2014 became an object of interior curiosity: What\u2019s this about? How much time can I spend with it? What part of me is it? What does it look like up close?The cheap answer is something about the cathartic value of transgression, etc., all old hoary stuff I don\u2019t really buy into anymore. The truer answer, for me, is that sometimes you really wanna kill somebody. Naturally, you won\u2019t. You mustn\u2019t. It would be wrong. You try not to do wrong. But if you spend a little time in the presence of a perfect groove contemplating the wrong directly without moralizing about it, you can ride the feeling in safety and go in as deep as you want, emerging later not wanting to kill anybody. When this has become a pattern, it\u2019s an immense release, as addictive as the pellets they would give us every so often if we were rats in labs.\u2666John Darnielle is a musician and the author of \u201cUniversal Harvester.\u201dTwo composers beyond category.By RYAN BRADLEYIt had been a busy year. Levi is also a producer and D.J. who sings and plays guitar, most recently in the pop-art trio Micachu and the Shapes. She has written two movie scores; the second, for the biopic \u201cJackie,\u201d was nominated for an Academy Award. Coates has scored films, too, but is better known for his work as a cellist. He contributed to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cA Moon Shaped Pool,\u201d released last May, and in the same month put out his own \u201cUpstepping,\u201d a very danceable record of house music performed almost entirely on his cello.\u201cRemain Calm\u201d is an odd creation, even by their standards. Its 13 tracks, some less than a minute in length, jump from beat-heavy, densely layered and looped orchestrations to atmospheric and spacey noodlings. Often, Coates\u2019s cello seems to emerge, pure and acoustic, out of a stew of sonic burbles. It is a sketchbook in which every figure gestures toward newer, more exciting ideas to come, outlining musical rules (a key, a beat, a melody) one minute only to abandon them in the next.Before they listened to the record, Coates reached into his backpack and pulled out a coloring book. He showed Levi one of the images he had colored in, a mandala filled with bright blues and greens, thin wisps of gold, bursts of coral pink. Levi leaned in for a closer look, drawing her finger across the page. \u201cBruv, this is nuts,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s what I wish composing was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe form preordained.\u201d Levi nodded in agreement. It was a visual cantus firmus, she said: a fixed melody providing a structure for a limited range of improvisation. They had each studied classical composition: Coates at the Royal Academy of Music, where he received the highest marks in the school\u2019s history, Levi at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where, at 21, she was commissioned to compose a piece for the London Philharmonic.The first song began, Coates playing a solo figure, then Levi\u2019s electronic textures trickling in, like an orchestra tuning up. The pair sat in silence, pleased enough but also distracted. A few tracks later, Coates looked up at Levi, who was looking at his mandala. \u201cI\u2019d like for it to be music,\u201d he said. It seemed like a familiar conversation. Levi massaged her temples, thinking, listening. \u201cYou just get a set of rules,\u201d she said. \u201cEach color could be a different pitch.\u201d Coates frowned. The idea of \u201calgorithmic music\u201d troubled him. Maybe, Levi said, you set up the rules and then find a way to break them; color inside the lines, so to speak, and then scribble a face over the results. Coates liked it. The breaking of the rule, he said, is \u201cwhat makes a moment, musically.\u201dIn fact, he added, his coloring was loaded with mistakes already, but the mistakes were what made the thing come together, in a subtle way. He turned the page, exposing the blots where the pen ink bled through to the other side and the sharp lines of the pattern were barely visible. He said they reminded him of one of Levi\u2019s works.Coates and Levi met almost a decade ago. Coates had come to perform student string quartets for a class Levi was taking, and he was struck by her compositions. They were written so well, he said, \u201cthat you knew immediately what you needed to do to make them come to life.\u201d From then on, the two stayed in touch. Coates sent Levi a video by the electronic producer Daniel Lopatin, also known as Oneohtrix Point Never; Levi sent Coates a mixtape she made with some tracks by Harry Partch, a composer who created new musical scales and built his own instruments.In 2011, Coates was working on a commission for the London Sinfonietta and suggested a collaboration with Micachu and the Shapes, who were already trying to, in Levi\u2019s words, \u201csmudge a whole lot of things together.\u201d For the Sinfonietta collaboration, Levi and her bandmates, following in Partch\u2019s footsteps, deployed a new instrument she had built with a friend called the chopper \u2014 a hollow box with strings on top and a rotating wheel to pluck them, like a turntable that strummed. The live album that resulted, filled with wobbly, off-kilter strings, was called \u201cChopped and Screwed\u201d (a nod to screw music, the Houston hip-hop style). It landed in the hands of the filmmaker Jonathan Glazer, who was looking for someone to score \u201cUnder the Skin,\u201d his film about an alien exploring earth in a woman\u2019s body. He wanted an experienced composer who had never written music for a movie, someone who would come at the task differently. \u201cI think he wanted someone who was, you know, cheap,\u201d Levi said.For 10 months, she worked on almost nothing else, worried that if she listened to anything \u2014 particularly another soundtrack \u2014 she would unintentionally steal from it. She focused instead on the challenge of scoring the emotional development of the film\u2019s unknowable alien, played by Scarlett Johansson. Levi\u2019s stark themes all spring from a dense void, abuzz in discordant strings (including Coates on cello), then synthetic and hollow with muffled drums and distant drones. As the film progresses, though, the music becomes more melodic, reflecting the alien creature\u2019s struggle with humanity, with the untidiness of human emotions. The soundtrack is unsettling, but also strangely empathetic.Levi describes much of her work as mixtapes. For \u201cJackie,\u201d she imagined classy melancholy, loads of strings, the occasional flute, clarinet and piano \u2014 the kind of music that Jacqueline Kennedy might listen to, a mixtape for private mourning made for a woman in the center of so much public chaos. The day Levi and Coates recorded \u201cRemain Calm,\u201d Levi arrived with two CD turntables and thumb drives full of samples and premade digital files \u2014 all of which, in one way or another, had reminded her of Coates. She was thinking of music not in terms of classical or hip-hop or any other genre, but in terms of people. Some music was Oliver Coates music. Some music was Mica Levi music.Listening to \u201cBarok Main,\u201d one of the longest tracks on \u201cRemain Calm,\u201d Coates and Levi agreed that it was also probably the most unified piece. \u201cThis was a nice peaceful moment, just after lunch,\u201d Coates said, recalling the rainy day they recorded it.Levi said: \u201cI was thoughtful of what could fit here. Something that wasn\u2019t too thick, too full of information.\u201dThey listened a bit longer.The track swelled and echoed, and it was hard to know where Coates\u2019s cello stopped and Levi\u2019s sound began. \u201cIt\u2019s just happy music making,\u201d Coates said, and they sat, listening silently, waiting for their track to end.\u2666Ryan Bradley is a writer based in Los Angeles.Putting out fires by day, music by night.By JODY ROSENThere was a time when Ka took a guerrilla approach to promoting his music. In 2007, he had 1,000 CDs made of his debut album, \u201cIron Works.\u201d \u201cI gave them to my cousins, my friends. I still had, like, 990 CDs left. So I started giving them away. I\u2019d drive around the city, and if I heard music coming from the next car at a red light \u2014 boom-boom-boom \u2014 I\u2019d say, \u2018You like hip-hop?\u2019 Then I\u2019d toss a CD in their window.\u201d By 2012, when Ka released his second album, \u201cGrief Pedigree,\u201d he had a sizable-enough following to make an announcement on Twitter and hold a curbside sale in Greenwich Village. This has become a tradition: On the day that Ka drops a new album, he tweets, turns up on a street corner and sells a few dozen records out of the trunk of his car.When music writers use the word \u201cindie,\u201d they generally have a certain kind of recording artist in mind: a white bohemian, with a battered guitar and a tricky haircut, who dwells on the distant outskirts of the pop-industrial complex. Ka, whose given name is Kaseem Ryan, doesn\u2019t quite fit that description, but he may be the platonic ideal of an independent musician in 2017. It would be hard to find a more thoroughgoing D.I.Y. musical enterprise. Ka is the rare rapper who handles both rhymes and beats, writing his lyrics and producing the music that accompanies them. He has directed most of his videos, and he self-releases his music, on his own label. It is not a profitable venture. Ka spends as much as $15,000 per album and has never broken even. \u201cI make music, but I\u2019m not in the music business,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my hobby.\u201dFor Ka to have won even modest recognition is an improbable underdog triumph. He spent much of the 1990s trying to make it as a rapper, quit music altogether and returned a decade later, releasing his solo debut at age 35. Today he is 44. This career trajectory defies one of the seemingly immutable laws of pop, and of hip-hop in particular, a genre in which the cult of youth and novelty is especially pronounced.Then there is the matter of Ka\u2019s day job. He is a captain in the New York City Fire Department. It\u2019s a story that has the ring of folklore: One of the great recording artists of the current decade is a musical moonlighter, a middle-aged man who earns his living as the decorated company commander of Engine 235 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. \u201cI try to keep my job and music separate,\u201d Ka says. \u201cI never wanted be \u2018The Rapping Captain.\u2019 I try to be a good firefighter. And when I come home, I try to make some dope music.\u201dIn fact, Ka\u2019s music bears little resemblance to the \u201cgangsta rap\u201d caricature of tabloid fulminations. In Ka\u2019s songs, crime and violence are omnipresent but deglamorized. It\u2019s here that Ka\u2019s age shows: He raps in the voice of a world-weary O.G., looking back at \u201cthe hustle\u201d with regret and dismay, and reckoning with its spiritual toll. Ka\u2019s lyrics are cinematic, training a grit-caked lens on scenes of poverty and desperation. In \u201cNo Downtime\u201d (2012), he raps: \u201cI admit, not from environment that let a child flourish/In the street, slim physique, wild courage/Five deep, trying to eat, looking malnourished.\u201dThese stories aren\u2019t fictional. Ka grew up poor, in Brownsville. As a teenager, he drifted into the drug trade, dealing crack and selling firearms. It was a \u201cscary and lonely\u201d existence, Ka says, one that left a legacy of trauma and a wealth of material, a burden that\u2019s also a muse. \u201cThis man has experienced so much pain, seen so much death,\u201d says Ka\u2019s wife, Mimi Vald\u00e9s. \u201cIt\u2019s all over his music.\u201dIf Ka is not in the music business, his wife definitively is. Vald\u00e9s is the former editor in chief of Vibe, the music magazine. Today she is chief creative officer for i am OTHER, a multimedia company founded by Pharrell Williams, the superstar rapper-singer-producer. Vald\u00e9s\u2019s professional circle includes some of the world\u2019s most famous musicians. It is conceivable that Ka could trade on his wife\u2019s connections to raise his profile. But a commercial breakthrough is far-fetched, and a prospect for which Ka seems constitutionally ill equipped. He has performed just a few live shows and professes little interest in playing more. He\u2019s a homebody who prefers to sit in a closet-size work space and make records.Those records are, in the best sense, strange. Critics often call Ka a revivalist of rap\u2019s \u201990s golden age. But he is by no means \u201cretro.\u201d He takes the rudiments of \u201990s rap and fashions them into an eccentric other thing. His albums have idiosyncratic conceptual frames: \u201cThe Night\u2019s Gambit\u201d (2013) is full of chess imagery; \u201cDays With Dr. Yen Lo\u201d (2015), a collaboration with the producer Preservation, is an elaborate gloss on the novel \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate.\u201dBut it is the sound, the vibe, that sets Ka\u2019s music apart. His songs are unnervingly quiet and still; they hold a listener in thrall because they hold so much back. Ka\u2019s beats do not boom, they slither and slink and creep. Often the songs discard drums altogether, opening vast spaces that are filled by samples in brooding minor keys. The most arresting sound is Ka\u2019s voice, a guttural rasp that sometimes dips into a whisper. It is an unshakable voice of experience, delivering hard-boiled tales and hard-won wisdom.\u201cMourn at Night,\u201d from the 2016 album \u201cHonor Killed the Samurai,\u201d is a typical Ka mood piece \u2014 a rap-noir, burnished to lustrous dark hue. The song\u2019s title establishes the terms: The mood is elegiac, the setting nocturnal. \u201cMourn at Night\u201d has more of a beat than many Ka songs, which is not to say that it has much of one. A snare drum knocks out a steady pulse, like the sound of an unseen man\u2019s footfalls trailing down a low-lit street, or a time bomb ticking to an explosion. The music is nudged forward by guitar and keyboard arpeggios, which chime and toll behind a somber refrain: \u201cHe gone/We mourn at night.\u201d In the final verse, the action erupts: Gunfire blasts out of the shadows, strafing a street corner crowded with young drug dealers.On the block with the rockUp nights, dribblingTime spent getting bentHard to be upright citizenIt\u2019s more than troublingSame corners are bubblingThe pawns are huddlingThen all of a sudden it\u2019sPop, pop, popKa excels at this kind of writing, brisk storytelling that unfolds in a pileup of rhymes and puns. What you won\u2019t find much of on his records is the meat-and-potatoes of rap: trash talk. \u201cWhat do I have to brag about?\u201d Ka says. \u201cI ain\u2019t winning. I\u2019m a working man, with a blue-collar job. I\u2019m running into burning buildings for a living. So I speak about the things that I did, the things I pray I never have to do again. How do I finish my life in grace? That\u2019s what I rap about.\u201dOn those occasions when Ka does slip in a mild boast, it\u2019s about his skills as an M.C. In \u201cMourn at Night\u201d he permits himself one such moment, the testimony of a bootstrapper who has survived untold trials to ply his trade \u2014 as he would have it, his hobby \u2014 in the soundproof booth of a recording studio. \u201cWe was born in the thorns, few arose,\u201d Ka raps. \u201cOnce in town\u2019s noose/Now in soundproofs/Pursuing goals.\u201d\u2666When gospel goes viral \u2014 with an abundance of pure joy.By GREG HOWARDIt was 29 years ago that the legendary gospel artist Shirley Caesar first recorded the song \u201cHold My Mule.\u201d It was a banger then, and it still is. She has performed it many times, and at least once, 10 years ago, someone filmed her in a church. About midway through the nine-and-a-half-minute video, the band and the organ, which riff all the way through, fall quiet. Caesar hunches over, gazes into the distance and, playing the role of the song\u2019s protagonist, Shouting John \u2014 a farmer who has been reprimanded by the deacons at his local church for celebrating too much, dancing too wildly, speaking too loudly (and sometimes in tongues) \u2014 enumerates the many blessings God has bestowed on him and his farm. She counts each blessing off on her fingers and raps: \u201cI\u2019ve got beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes, lambs, rams, hogs, dogs, chickens, turkeys, rabbits\u201d \u2014 and then she shouts, \u201cyou name it!\u201dThe band kicks in again, and a slew of sonic histrionics, pyrotechnics and acrobatics follows. But that list is the climax, the moment when Caesar basks in the warmth of God\u2019s grace, when she and you both feel closest to him.While taking a gospel sample and warping it into a trap song not about Christ but about the wonders of soy and fake meat scrubs Caesar\u2019s joy of its context, the joy embedded in her voice still translates, is still familiar. I\u2019m not religious. But I grew up going to church, dancing and singing to raucous gospel bands and choirs nearly every Sunday. Once, after a particularly rousing concert, I walked from my seat to the front of the auditorium to be baptized and join the church, only to come to my senses once I got to the altar. I never truly believed in Caesar\u2019s God, but I was swept away as so many nonbelievers can be, in flashes of euphoria ignited by family and tofu and trap and everything else that sustains us.\u2666Greg Howard is a David Carr fellow for The New York Times.He soothes the anxieties of life as a gay man.By ALEXANDER CHEEFor more than a year now, I have listened to little else in my car other than the albums of Rufus Wainwright. This obsession began when my husband and I bought a car for weekend trips: a 2009 AWD Subaru hatchback with what in retrospect seems like an ancient playback machine, a 5-disc CD player. We pulled all our old CD wallets out to the car, loaded the changer and set off for our first drive. And what had been my self-imposed exile from music came to an end that day.Sometime between 2009 and 2015, without ever noticing it was happening, I stopped listening to music regularly. I was alienated, in part, by the new ways of listening: I don\u2019t like streaming music, or \u201csocial\u201d music platforms, my private whims made public. Around the same time, my doctor told me I had mild depression, which would respond to exercise and a change in habits. But this mild depression did not feel mild. I felt trapped at the bottom of a swimming pool, immobilized. Everything I had to do, everything I needed to take care of, was up at the surface, and the soundtrack to this situation was silence.During one of our first drives, we loaded the changer solely with Rufus Wainwright albums, and I still haven\u2019t changed those CDs out. I was always a fan of Wainwright\u2019s, but I\u2019m something more now: His lighthearted way of penetrating my anxieties about gay life became essential. In my year of carbound listening, I played through his songbook over and over. I gained a new appreciation for his extraordinary voice, and the way its nasal timbre humanizes him, as if someone ordinary had been given extraordinary powers, midnote. I am often tricked into trying to sing along, but I\u2019m always outclassed. I never care. Wainwright is a storyteller, and his albums work on my imagination the same way short-story collections do \u2014 poetically, dramatically. Singing along with his secrets became like telling mine to myself, and somehow, this helped me up from the bottom of that pool.A change of habits, then.Joan Didion has written of how the ability to make a note \u201cwhen something came to mind\u201d was the \u201cdifference between being able to write and not being able to write\u201d \u2014 a sign of life. For me, looking for new music from favorite musicians is also a sign of life. This fall, I finally thought to look for a new Wainwright album. What I found was \u201cTake All My Loves,\u201d released early last year. Wainwright adapts nine Shakespearean sonnets into a kind of variety show, with William Shatner; Helena Bonham Carter; Carrie Fisher; Florence Welch; the soprano Anna Prohaska; his sister, Martha Wainwright; the BBC Orchestra; and the Berlin String Section. He is on the cover in full Queen Elizabeth I drag, flowers in his hair. My favorite track is \u201cA Woman\u2019s Face \u2014 Reprise (Sonnet 20),\u201d which Wainwright first interpreted in 2010 on \u201cAll Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu.\u201d That first version is a would-be lover\u2019s complaint, sung softly over slow piano; it\u2019s elliptical, haunting, slight. A new version on \u201cTake All My Loves\u201d is almost a torch song \u2014 teasing, raunchy, openly seductive, as if Wainwright were seated on a piano in a slinky gown and Elizabethan collar, all made up and beckoning.The poem is, famously, the locus of academic debates over Shakespeare\u2019s queerness. His misogyny too. The sonnet is about an impossible love for a young man who the poet claims has all the beauty of a woman, but for the \u201cone thing.\u201d I had read it, but I never really understood it the way I did when I heard Wainwright sing it: It\u2019s a refrain many gay men know from waiting out the passion of a man who doesn\u2019t \u201cthink of himself that way,\u201d despite his feelings for you. \u201cIf only you were a girl\u201d becomes \u201cYou\u2019re better than a girl\u201d before either fear or desire wins.Wainwright knows this territory well. His second album, \u201cPoses,\u201d was dedicated to one of these reluctant, not-quite-queer lovers, stories from when Wainwright was the kind of seductive youth the sonnet describes. Now, for the duration of this song, he is the reluctant lover.As a storyteller, Wainwright has always been more of a memoirist than a novelist. He made his reputation singing wise songs of impossible loves and rejection, turning personal pain into public art. Wainwright is now married to J\u00f6rn Weisbrodt, an arts impresario, and he has a daughter with his friend Lorca Cohen, a photographer and the daughter of Leonard Cohen. Listening to \u201cA Woman\u2019s Face,\u201d I wonder if happiness has made him more private, happier telling fictional stories than true ones. His next project is an opera about the Roman emperor Hadrian, who, out of grief at the death of his lover Antinous, created a religion around him.I intend to be there when it opens, wearing a tuxedo in an opera box \u2014 no Subaru this time. I\u2019ll try not to sing along.\u2666Alexander Chee is the author of the novels \u201cEdinburgh\u201d and \u201cThe Queen of the Night.\u201dThe danger of being a singer-songwriter.By RUTH GRAHAMThe story was a good example of how forces like politics and war can affect regular people\u2019s lives, which is a running theme in McMurtry\u2019s work. McMurtry, who has released 12 albums over a 28-year career, has a reputation in some quarters as a political songwriter, in part because one of his most popular songs is an angry-lefty anthem. That song, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Make It Here Anymore,\u201d laments that minimum wage \u201cwon\u2019t pay for a roof, won\u2019t pay for a drink,\u201d and that the children of the poor are the ones who end up fighting in rich men\u2019s wars. Released shortly before the 2004 election, the song swept through an America hollowed out by departed manufacturing jobs and the middle-class stability that went with them. A few years after its release, the critic Robert Christgau named it the best song of the decade.But McMurtry more often writes about how seemingly distant political concerns nudge his characters\u2019 choices and prod at their psyches: the stretched budget of the Veterans Affairs Department, or the birth of a new national park\u2019s consuming the neighbors\u2019 land through eminent domain. In \u201cSixty Acres,\u201d the narrator laments that when his grandmother died, he inherited a plot of unpromising farmland while his cousin got \u201cthe good land,\u201d zoned commercial: \u201cLooks like a Walmart waiting to happen/I mean to tell you it\u2019s a pot of gold.\u201dMcMurtry\u2019s father is the great Texas novelist Larry McMurtry, and his mother, Jo Scott McMurtry, is a former English professor specializing in Shakespeare. McMurtry calls his parents \u201cfirst-generation-off-the-farm academics.\u201d He was raised in secular urban homes and even attended boarding school for a spell. But he dropped out of the University of Arizona, and he remains fluent in his extended family\u2019s dialect of ranches, oil fields and Jesus Christ. He has been on tour almost constantly since the late 1980s, and he just takes note of what he sees through the windshield, he said, like banners welcoming home soldiers in small towns.At an upscale barbecue restaurant near his hotel in Dallas, where we met before his concert, our talk turned to tribalism and anti-intellectualism. His grandparents wanted their children to go to college to get better jobs, he said, but they didn\u2019t want them to become intellectuals. Later he referred to the broader middle-American \u201chatred of anyone who is perceived to be getting a free ride of any kind\u201d and the racism woven into that ethos: \u201cThe image of the black welfare queen driving the Cadillac while good white folk drove Oldsmobiles was the boogeyman of the \u201980s. Now I suppose it\u2019s Mexican immigrants getting free health care.\u201d Over the course of an hour, he talked about the military-industrial complex, \u201cembedded\u201d war journalism and the role of charisma in electoral politics. I didn\u2019t know whether to believe him when he said he didn\u2019t read many books.McMurtry had ordered black coffee and a plate of fried oysters. In a few hours, he would take the stage alone with his guitar, and in a few weeks, he and his band would leave for a European tour that would carry them from Ireland to Italy, playing 33 nights in a row. McMurtry\u2019s music is usually classified as \u201cAmericana\u201d; it\u2019s at turns jagged and raucous, and at others deliberative and wistful. Other singers have smoother voices. But a movie star\u2019s perfect face can work against his authenticity as an actor, and McMurtry\u2019s unassuming vocal style and stage presence bring to the foreground the voices populating his songs. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger in being a singer-songwriter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re writing a character\u2019s point of view, and you\u2019ve got to sing it yourself. It comes out of your voice, so everybody thinks it\u2019s your opinion.\u201dAlthough I\u2019ve been listening to him for years, I have begun to think of him as interpreter of the places \u201cout here in the middle,\u201d as he puts it one song. He has written about Cheyenne, Wyo.; Tulsa, Okla.; and Wewahitchka, Fla; about crab fishermen, soldiers and Walmart stockers. His songs tap into resentments about things like coastal attitudes of superiority and political correctness. His narrators are often white men who know the Bible, own guns and give their kids a nip of vodka in their Cherry Coke to get through long road trips. A Texan friend of mine likes to say that McMurtry writes as though he has spent time eavesdropping on conversations in every Dairy Queen in America. Stephen King, who owns a classic-rock station in Maine, has written that he \u201cmay be the truest, fiercest songwriter of his generation.\u201dMcMurtry has seen things change in rural America over the last few decades, he said, the curdling of patriotism and self-reliance into something uglier. Gun ownership, for example, has become an identity, or even like a cult. He\u2019s a hunter \u2014 deer, turkey, wild hogs \u2014 and he said gun shows and shops used to be friendly spaces. But now there\u2019s a suspicion in the air if \u201cyou don\u2019t have the right hat or the right haircut.\u201d McMurtry himself has both, but he also has the kind of detachment required for skeptical reportage.\u201cCopper Canteen,\u201d the opening track on his 2015 album, \u201cComplicated Game,\u201d is the song I\u2019ve returned to most since Election Day. The narrator is a hunter, a fisherman and a small-business owner. He doesn\u2019t go to church, but his wife does. Although retirement is in sight, and he has a pension, he hasn\u2019t been able to save as much money as he would like, in part because the store he owns is getting squeezed by \u201cthe big boxes out on the bypass.\u201dBut like most of McMurtry\u2019s best songs, \u201cCopper Canteen\u201d eventually resolves into a portrait of a relationship. The long marriages and old love affairs he favors eschew the hot and cold dramatics of contemporary country music, a world in which you\u2019re either swooning over your one true love or bashing in your ex\u2019s windshield with a baseball bat. The \u201cCopper Canteen\u201d narrator is singing to his wife; they\u2019re grandparents now, reflecting back on what it meant to \u201cgrow up hard\u201d in a life that has moved by in a blur: \u201cThis life that we craved so little we saved between the grandparents\u2019 graves and the grandchildren\u2019s toys.\u201d Like many McMurtry characters, he sounds nostalgic even though he knows that the past was often bad. The song opens with a bang, or the suggestion of one: \u201cHoney, don\u2019t you go yellin\u2019 at me while I\u2019m cleaning my gun,\u201d he drawls. \u201cI\u2019ll wash the blood off the tailgate when deer season\u2019s done.\u201d Defying Chekhov, the gun never goes off, and the song sweetens \u2014 barely \u2014 as it moves along. Though that line about the gun got a big laugh when McMurtry played it in Dallas, I still don\u2019t know whether to hear it as a joke or a threat, and McMurtry has never been one to offer the easy comfort of a straight answer.\u2666Ruth Graham is a contributing writer for Slate.How a song can make its audience feel seen.By ANGELA FLOURNOYA song should not shut a door in a listener\u2019s face. Of course, many songs do drive listeners away \u2014 through objectionable lyrics, a vocalist\u2019s nasal intonation, a grating hook \u2014 but generally not on purpose. Still rarer is a song that identifies its audience in explicit, demographic terms. But in the first line of Solange Knowles\u2019s song \u201cF.U.B.U.,\u201d she welcomes black listeners \u2014 \u201cone for us,\u201d she proclaims \u2014 and she shows white listeners the door.Once this metaphorical point of entry is closed, an important conversation ensues. \u201cAll my niggas in the whole wide world/Made this song to make it all y\u2019all\u2019s turn,\u201d Knowles sings in the opening chorus. The word \u201cnigga\u201d (along with its \u201c-er\u201d counterpart) is so fraught with negative history that the N.A.A.C.P. held a funeral for it in 2007. Not every black person can hear it in a song and feel the exultation that Knowles intends. Still, words take their own sweet time to die, and right now, \u201cnigga\u201d remains a go-to, often-affectionate phrase in many black circles. In \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d Knowles uses it to draw a line in the sand: If you aren\u2019t supposed to say it, then this song isn\u2019t for you. \u201cFor us,\u201d she sings \u2014 \u201cthis [expletive] is for us.\u201dThe song\u2019s title references the clothing line of the same name \u2014 F.U.B.U., For Us By Us. At its height in the late \u201990s, F.U.B.U. was synonymous with black cool: I wore it in high school despite the clothes being impractical for my too-tall, too-thin frame. And the song appears on Knowles\u2019s recent album, \u201cA Seat at the Table,\u201d after an interlude featuring the rapper Master P., whose stories of success as an independent music artist and executive help provide thematic shape to the project. For many of us who were young and black, or young and black and Southern, like Knowles, during the years when he dominated the rap charts, his story has always been inspirational. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand my record, you don\u2019t understand me, so this is not for you,\u201d he says.Songs that can be described as \u201cblack-empowerment music\u201d make up a genre as diverse as that of black music itself. There are the time-tested tracks that focus on pride, like James Brown\u2019s \u201cSay It Loud \u2014 I\u2019m Black and I\u2019m Proud,\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cYoung, Gifted and Black.\u201d There are anthems that speak to struggle and protest, like Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cGet Up Stand Up\u201d and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cAlright.\u201d And there are a plethora of doggedly sunny ditties like Nas\u2019s \u201cI Can\u201d and Jaheim\u2019s \u201cFabulous.\u201d Knowles\u2019s \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d hews closer to the first two categories, and a majority of its messages of pride and protest are nuanced, centering the individual over the collective. She allows that not every black person will relate to the experiences she recounts: \u201cWhen you feeling all alone/And you can\u2019t even be you up in your home/When you even feeling it from your own.\u201d The song pushes past one litmus test for the black-empowerment anthem \u2014 that it present itself as made for black listeners, broadly \u2014 and tries to reach an even more elusive audience: the black listener who maybe hasn\u2019t felt included in such messages before.Art finds who it finds, and the white gaze lands where it lands. The more you try to ignore it, the more it seems keen on dissecting you. Knowles is aware of this. The deliberate rejection of white scrutiny is part of a long tradition of black art-making. In his famous 1926 essay, \u201cThe Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\u201d which would serve as the young poet\u2019s artistic manifesto, Langston Hughes declared that younger black artists should create \u201cwithout fear or shame. If white people are pleased, we are glad. If they are not, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d It\u2019s the sort of thing emerging black writers \u2014 me included \u2014 have to remind themselves when putting pen to paper, lest we succumb to pandering for white attention.In \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d Knowles doesn\u2019t just eschew the white gaze for the sake of creating her art; she performs that rejection in song, to pull her black listeners close. It\u2019s a rhetorical invitation for black folks to grab a chair and settle in for real talk about lives like theirs. To her white listeners (who are listening, after all), she offers a tongue-in-cheek indictment as consolation: \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad if you can\u2019t sing along/Just be glad you got the whole wide world.\u201dThe verses in \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d outline microaggressions, but the song isn\u2019t \u201cabout\u201d microaggression; it\u2019s about recognition. \u201cWhen a nigga tryna board the plane/And they ask you, \u2018What\u2019s your name again?\u2019/\u2019Cause they thinking, Yeah, you\u2019re all the same,\u201d Knowles sings. This is the sonic equivalent of shaking out your hair after long hours of wearing it pulled back and tied down for work, putting on your sweatpants and calling your girlfriend to tell her about the day you had. Between black folks, recounting microaggressions can offer valuable confirmation that you\u2019re not crazy, that someone else sees you. It\u2019s commiseration, but without the misery, because the slights are both hurtful and numbingly commonplace. Knowles isn\u2019t listing racial slights on \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d to educate those who perpetuate them; she does it to foster intimacy with her listeners.I first heard the song at the gym, on a cheap pair of headphones, so the bass on the record wasn\u2019t at the forefront as it should have been. The warbled notes of the piano and organ sounded muffled, as if underwater. On even very good headphones, the song\u2019s dragged-down pace is reminiscent of screw music \u2014 the slow-motion, purposefully warped aesthetic born in Knowles\u2019s native Houston. The featured artists are a nod to R.&B. over the past two decades. The-Dream sings in an airy falsetto, making the line \u201cI didn\u2019t come back down to earth to die\u201d sound resolute instead of bitter. The relative newcomer BJ the Chicago Kid\u2019s delivery \u2014 by turns exuberant and plaintive \u2014 is like that of a soloist during Sunday praise and worship. The backing vocals by Tweet are a special treat for those of us who sometimes shake our fists at the sky, wondering what ever happened to that singer and her hypnotizing voice.For all its angst and exasperation, \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d is a party song, just not one for the nightclub. Its measured cadence and dragging bass are perfect for a spontaneous, low-key house party. You might be able to pull off a drawn-out, stylized two-step to \u201cF.U.B.U.,\u201d but really it\u2019s a rhythm tailored to the simple head-nod \u2014 an appropriate move for a song about recognition. Its boisterous horns call to mind the New Orleans second line, those musical parades marched both for celebration and for mourning.Knowles wrote lyrics for \u201cA Seat at the Table\u201d in New Iberia, La., where her mother\u2019s family hails from. Her mother, Tina Lawson, has said that her family was essentially run out of town following a salt-mine collapse involving her father. In the contentious aftermath, a Molotov cocktail was thrown through the window of their home. They didn\u2019t go far \u2014 less than 300 miles west to Galveston, Tex. Hasty separation leaves a generational longing all the same. It follows that an album created in a town once fled for fear of white violence should include \u201cF.U.B.U.,\u201d a song that creates a space where black listeners might feel prized just for being seen.\u2666Angela Flournoy is the author of \u201cThe Turner House\u201d and a fellow at the New York Public Library\u2019s Cullman Center.Bubble-gum-pop queen turns tongue-in-cheek sex bomb.By HAZEL CILLSWhen a young pop star outgrows the wholesome, teeny-bopper sound that made her career, we tend to watch the results while peeking through our fingers, terrified of what we\u2019ll see. This is how we watched as Christina Aguilera put on her \u201cDirrty\u201d leather chaps, as Britney Spears stepped out of her \u201clittle girl\u201d world on \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U,\u201d as Miley Cyrus awkwardly fraternized with a stripper pole at the Teen Choice Awards. What makes these moments so cringeworthy is their self-seriousness, their declaration that to be adult is to be sexy \u2014 and to be sexy is to be straight-faced, preferably with a well-oiled body, writhing and pining for male approval.Ariana Grande, pop music\u2019s tiny, adorable diva, could easily have found herself in such a position. A former Broadway actress and the former star of the Nickelodeon show \u201cSam & Cat,\u201d she has an unabashed theater-kid spirit and a flair for costume \u2014 you often find her wearing cat ears and thigh-high vinyl boots. Her songs are brassy, retro numbers that deal with gushy PG-13 love, and she has a tendency to oversell them with the zeal of a collegiate a cappella singer, her impressive vocal range pushing against the edges of her bubble-gum hits as if trying to pop them entirely. Grande, still straddling the line between child star and adult hitmaker, is in the prime risk group for hypersexed transition songs.And on \u201cSide to Side,\u201d the biggest single from her excellent third album, \u201cDangerous Woman,\u201d she\u2019s aiming for something grown-and-sexy. \u201cSide to Side\u201d has her tapping the same watered-down dancehall trend that fueled songs like Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cSorry\u201d and Drake\u2019s \u201cControlla,\u201d with lyrics about sleeping with a bad secret boyfriend she keeps hidden from her friends. \u201cI\u2019ve been here all night/I\u2019ve been here all day/And boy got me walking side to side,\u201d she sings. Walking that way, Grande hinted in an interview last year with MTV \u2014 just in case anyone didn\u2019t get it \u2014 is a result of having too much sex, too vigorously.It\u2019s a huge hit. The song, in which Nicki Minaj coolly raps about riding a bicycle as if it were a male member (or vice versa), as if she were starring in some psychosexual Cronenberg horror film, has more than 420 million plays on Spotify. But \u201cSide to Side\u201d isn\u2019t exactly sexy. With its coy innuendo, as well as a video that uses SoulCycle-esque bikes as a metaphor for Grande\u2019s sexual workouts, \u201cSide to Side\u201d plays more like a giggly inside joke.We\u2019re in a golden age for things like this: media made by women, aimed at women, in which sex is explicit, messy and, most important, funny. Listening to \u201cSide to Side,\u201d I\u2019m reminded of Issa Rae\u2019s HBO series \u201cInsecure,\u201d in which Rae\u2019s eyes continually wander to an ex named Daniel, whom her best friend describes as Rae\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel \u2014 except instead of \u201cheel,\u201d she uses a certain nickname for a phallus. On shows like \u201cBroad City\u201d or Amazon\u2019s \u201cFleabag,\u201d female protagonists dig into their worst and raunchiest sexual impulses. Last year, the Swedish pop star Tove Lo named her record \u201cLady Wood,\u201d a goofy, equal-opportunity reinvention of stereotypical male arousal.With its brazenly over-the-top premise, \u201cSide to Side\u201d joins them, beating you to the punch line about Grande\u2019s revamp as Sexy Adult. It doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s designed to stir anyone\u2019s arousal \u2014 only their laughter. Does this song sound ridiculous? Well, that\u2019s the point. In a genre that fetishizes sexual passion that lasts for eternity, Grande\u2019s song happily delivers comic realism, with a surprisingly smart wink.\u2666Hazel Cills is a staff writer for MTV News.What would black music sound like in an alternate universe?By THOMAS CHATTERTON WILLIAMSThe genius of \u201cFade,\u201d the penultimate track on Kanye West\u2019s living work of art, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d is evident from the opening lines, a sample from the white Motown group Rare Earth. But it was a half-minute in, at that first unmistakable rip of bass, that I lost my mind. Like many of West\u2019s songs, \u201cFade\u201d is built around several commingling samples. Its rhythmic backbone is the deceptively simple arrangement from the 1985 classic \u201cMystery of Love,\u201d by Larry Heard, better known as Mr. Fingers. That track, along with a handful of others, marks a seminal moment in the history of deep house \u2014 a rich and criminally neglected chapter in the book of black music.Today it\u2019s easy to forget that in the early and mid-\u201980s there existed a window when New York rap, Chicago house and Detroit techno \u2014 as well as a slew of other fledgling genres and subcultures \u2014 functioned more or less as equals, each as likely as the next to flounder or thrive. New York won the contest handily, and now hip-hop has so thoroughly subsumed mainstream black culture that it often feels as if earlier artistic forms have either been eradicated or retrofitted to its preferences (see: funk, R.&B. and jazz). House music \u2014 much like West himself \u2014 is unabashedly black and Chicago-bred, but somewhere along the line, it grew cozy in Europe and came to be seen as catering to white people. And though it has only ever managed to find significant audiences overseas, this transfixing style of minimal electronic dance music was pioneered by Midwestern D.J.s spinning mainly for black and gay audiences looking to \u201cjack\u201d their bodies at Windy City nightclubs like the Muzic Box and the Warehouse (where, under the stewardship of Frankie Knuckles, the style was birthed and named). While trailblazers like Mr. Fingers \u2014 a virtuosic multi-instrumentalist \u2014 are worshiped in London, Paris and Berlin, they are barely remembered back at home.\u201cFade\u201d sets out to correct this. Onto the wide-open surface \u201cMystery of Love\u201d provides, West spreads out his own sparse raps alongside what grows into an aural smorgasbord of samples, allusions and guest appearances spanning eras and ethnicities \u2014 \u201990s Nuyorican house, the white rapper/singer Post Malone \u2014 a subtle reminder of the outsize influence of black aesthetics on all manner of American and global culture.Which is why, as a radio-friendly hit (with an awe-inspiring video to boot), \u201cFade\u201d feels not only generous but subversive: In the span of a little over three minutes, it gives the lie to simplistic conceptions of musical borders. West has always displayed a rare encyclopedic and intuitive grasp of both mainstream and regional black sounds, from traditional gospel and R.&B. to college-inflected spoken word and even black Greek stepping, not to mention dance, reggae, trap and drill music. He knows that, glimpsed from the proper vantage, these are but facets of the same, constantly shifting whole. I don\u2019t think there is another pop star who could conceive of such a medley, let alone bring it to life in a way that coheres. Yet \u201cFade\u201d doesn\u2019t just cohere; it functions as a sly and infectious meditation on the variety of formal possibilities of black sound \u2014 as invented and interpreted by black people themselves as well as Latinos and white people. It also serves as a bittersweet thought experiment: Things could have been otherwise. Imagine, if you will, a world in which Mr. Fingers got his due.\u2666Thomas Chatterton Williams is a contributing writer for the magazine.The counter-diva who brings a comedian\u2019s timing and sensibility to jazz.By MARGO JEFFERSONShe\u2019s C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant, a 27-year-old with an exhilarating command of the jazz vocal tradition, which has long been dominated by women, many of them black. Salvant\u2019s parents are French-Guadeloupean and Haitian; she grew up in Miami studying classical music, then moved to Paris and added jazz to her studies. In 2010, she won the Thelonious Monk Institute International Jazz Vocals Competition; three albums later, \u201cFor One to Love\u201d won the jazz vocal album of the year at the 2016 Grammy Awards.I said she\u2019s in \u201ccommand of\u201d the jazz tradition. Better to say she\u2019s in communion with it. I like how she listens. I like how she tests herself and learns as she performs. Salvant has a supple, well-trained voice with spot-on pitch. (No vibrato-teases; no meandering warbles passing as melisma.) Her low notes go from husky to full-bodied; her high notes float purely and cleanly. When she scats, it\u2019s not an ego trip but a musical game, where notes and syllables get to shape-shift.Like many young jazz singers, she does the Great American Songbook \u2014 the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart or Hammerstein, Sondheim, Ellington. The risk? Sounding decorous and derivative. Like some other young jazz singers, she does the black vaudeville hits of Bert Williams and Bessie Smith, even some of the exotica that female musicians once tossed out to keep their fans tantalized. Here the risk is archness: the knowing postmodern wink.I wouldn\u2019t be writing about Salvant if she had fallen into either trap. But mainstream success has other traps. And while it has been a long time since jazz was at the center of pop commerce, the star- (or cult-) making machinery still labors to produce familiar types. Especially for women, and even more especially for black women.For black women in pop music, the dominant and preferred model remains the Diva. Here\u2019s my personal theory. The black diva\u2019s obverse is the black matriarch, that forceful mammy, maid or housekeeper, whose mythic reign lasted through a century of film and television. And yes, it\u2019s a long way from mammy to diva, but there\u2019s one constant. Racially and socially, this figure is considered lower and lesser. Theatrically, then \u2014 it\u2019s the law of fantasy compensation \u2014 she must appear greater. In the old days, that meant she was literally bigger, louder, bossier. Now she\u2019s symbolically bigger: more expansive, more intense, more outrageous.Call the roll of the last half-century, from Patti LaBelle to Fantasia, Jennifer Holliday to Jennifer Hudson. My favorites are Aretha Franklin and Tina Turner because of their contradictions. There\u2019s a core reserve, even sadness in Franklin, while Turner channeled her lust-goddess intensity through the dance moves of a gritty pugilist. Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna are the grandest of contemporary divas. Their social, financial and cultural riches are vast; they command global kingdoms. They aren\u2019t prey to traditional diva narratives of abuse or self-destruction; they turn all vulnerabilities into victories. Beyonc\u00e9 is the gracious sovereign, Rihanna the cocky bad girl turned It Girl. But they share a mandate: The Black Diva must flaunt, court and rule.Jazz divas have tended to have alter egos. Billie Holiday was a laconic wit before she was the Lady with the Gardenia; Sarah Vaughan could counter her Divine One with up-tempo Sassy. Dinah (The Queen) Washington was also a salty good-time gal. I hear their traces in Salvant\u2019s singing, and it gives me great pleasure to watch her revise the tropes of black divadom. Don\u2019t misunderstand \u2014 she\u2019s not an anti-diva. I\u2019d call her a counter-diva: the heroine as ebullient comedian.Salvant, like all counter-divas, constructs her look with care. Hers is gamine glam: Her face is round, her hair close-cropped. She wears big, blocky white glasses \u2014 a droll trademark, like Fats Waller\u2019s derby; a red fascinator with feathers that look like insect feelers.The black counter-diva is now making her way into the culture at large. I hear her when the mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran builds a song around nothing but a repeated \u201cShhhh\u201d or arranges to fuse John Dowland\u2019s \u201cFlow My Tears\u201d and Smokey Robinson\u2019s \u201cCruisin\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s in the mischief that snakes through Corinne Bailey Rae\u2019s rueful feathery songs too.I see her when Tracee Ellis Ross goes goofy on \u201cblack-ish.\u201d (It\u2019s as if she has reclaimed the soubrette wit her mother renounced for lofty grandeur.) I like how Rashida Jones uses cheerful slapstick to counter her sweet-girl prettiness in \u201cAngie Tribeca.\u201d As Lucca Quinn, the clever lawyer on \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d Cush Jumbo seems to be letting us in on a private joke; a tiny pause, the hint of a double-take, suggests a quizzical \u201cCan I get away with this?\u201d and a gleeful \u201cOMG, I just did.\u201d And won\u2019t it be fun to watch Lupita Nyong\u2019o in the film version of Chimamanda Adiche\u2019s \u201cAmericanah\u201d? Freed from period dramas that stretch from slavery to the Empire galaxy, she will bring her talents to a here-and-now comedy of morals and manners.John Gielgud once said that style is knowing what play you\u2019re in. It\u2019s true for all performers who work with varied traditions and repertories. And it means that the performer must know what age she is performing in, and why. Along with a merry band of counter-divas, Salvant is thinking hard about what conventions, habits and desires need revising \u2014 in her art, and in her audience.\u2666Margo Jefferson is the author of \u201cNegroland: A Memoir.\u201dA boozy toast to friendship.By BOBBY FINGERThis wasn\u2019t Lady Gaga\u2019s comeback, as many claimed: She never really left us, nor had she abandoned the music that made her famous.Two of Gaga\u2019s early albums, \u201cThe Fame\u201d (2008) and \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011), were bursting at the seams with instantly memorable dance-pop hits. But after her fourth solo album, the both fairly and unfairly maligned \u201cArtpop\u201d (2013), failed to deliver that kind of instant success, Gaga redirected her focus from an ostentatious existence \u2014 she wore a dress of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, after all \u2014 to less-bombastic acts of musical bravura that showcased her virtuosic skills as both a singer and a pianist. Last October, she released her much-anticipated fifth album, the deeply personal and country-tinged \u201cJoanne.\u201dSo when she fell to Earth during last month\u2019s Super Bowl and performed the hits that made her famous, fans who thought \u201cJoanne,\u201d with its stripped-down production and abundance of twang, was yet another sign that she had abandoned her old ways were able to breathe a sigh of relief: Gaga\u2019s verve hadn\u2019t gone anywhere. It\u2019s a message she made clear in \u201cGrigio Girls,\u201d a midtempo acoustic bonus track and the album\u2019s best song.In \u201cGrigio Girls,\u201d Gaga recalls a moment in her early 20s when she was \u201cspiraling out,\u201d only to be saved by the contagious spirit of her 30-something friend Sonja Durham, who was battling breast cancer at the time. \u201cGrigio Girls\u201d is an ode to friendship and singing along to your favorite songs off-key. But through some strange alchemy involving pop-culture references and cheap wine, it manages to do more than just celebrate sisterhood: It\u2019s proof that Gaga is still fundamentally Gaga, whether she\u2019s wrapped in meat or the arm of her recent collaborator, Tony Bennett. Though explicitly about Dunham and the inspirational \u201ctough girl\u201d persona she shared with Joanne Germanotta (Gaga\u2019s aunt, who died in 1974 and for whom the album is named), \u201cGrigio Girls\u201d becomes something more universal once Gaga\u2019s own voice is joined by the backing harmony. \u201cSisters never pack up,\u201d the singers reassure us. \u201cWe always run back.\u201d\u2666Bobby Finger is a staff writer for Jezebel and co-host of \u201cWho? Weekly.\u201dA woman\u2019s unabashed appreciation of women.By HANNAH GIORGISLike some of the best New York rap that preceded it, the track emboldens. M.A told the website Genius that the song wasn\u2019t modeled after fellow Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda\u2019s \u201cHot Nigga,\u201d but the two share similar beats \u2014 and \u201cOOOUUU\u201d lends itself perfectly to the \u201cShmoney Dance\u201d that took over Vine in 2014 and turned Shmurda into a viral star. The city\u2019s rappers took note: Less than a year since its release, the track has been remixed by local heavyweights like Nicki Minaj, French Montana, 50 Cent, Jadakiss and Remy Ma.The original song is full of references to M.A\u2019s own life in Brooklyn, where she\u2019s \u201cin these streets more than Sesame.\u201d While the track\u2019s narrative might span only one day, it feels firmly grounded in the habitual: Young M.A raps what she knows. She\u2019s not only a woman rapping but also a masculine-presenting queer woman in an industry that is dominated by heterosexual men. Queer hip-hop artists are hardly new; rappers like Le1f, Zebra Katz, Mykki Blanco, Cakes Da Killa and many others have been at the forefront of shifting the genre\u2019s landscape in recent years, and rumors of sexual fluidity have always surrounded many of hip-hop\u2019s biggest stars, both despite and because of the industry\u2019s reputation for homophobia. (Queer women in particular must grapple with intersecting axes of misogyny and homophobia.) Still, M.A seems refreshing, and quintessentially New York, in her frankness. She is who she is.The \u201cOOOUUU\u201d punch lines that inspire the most raucous singalongs are those in which she speaks, openly and matter-of-factly, about sex with another woman. Rapping about women is not the entirety of her catalog, nor is it a gimmick; she simply traffics in the same kind of braggadocio the industry\u2019s men are often known for, which is to say she\u2019s your average Bed-Stuy stud. M.A is seductive \u2014 even to women who don\u2019t identify as lesbian, queer or bisexual \u2014 and she knows it. If M.A\u2019s contemporary Remy Ma is conceited, M.A is cocky: \u201cIf that\u2019s your chick, then why she textin\u2019 me?/Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?\u201dThe lines that follow are salacious, but they\u2019re not performative. M.A may be a commanding, bite-her-lip-when-she-looks-in-your-direction queer woman, but her music neither starts nor ends there. What\u2019s more significant than M.A\u2019s queerness is the way she deftly weaves references to sex with women into her music without overstating or explaining them. If you know, you know. And if you don\u2019t, you can still enjoy her music \u2014 but M.A isn\u2019t going to waste her bars enlightening you.\u2666Hannah Giorgis is the special-projects editor for The Ringer.A \u201970s rock star\u2019s troubles, and a 68-year-old soul singer\u2019s.By CHARLES AARONA chord from a Hammond B3 organ quavers, and Charles Bradley\u2019s head snaps up, his eyes locking with the camera. When the woozy accompaniment hits, his deep-creased face wrenches; he shakes his head, places his palms together and gazes Godward. So begins the remarkable video for Bradley\u2019s soul rendition of Black Sabbath\u2019s 1972 gloom-folk lament \u201cChanges\u201d \u2014 no lip-syncing, just the 68-year-old singer in a black turtleneck against a blank backdrop. For six minutes, as his sculpted rasp wails, Bradley uses his face and hands to silently act out a vast grief, one at which the plain-spoken lyrics, originally written about the Sabbath drummer Bill Ward\u2019s breakup with his first wife, only hint. Bradley conceived his version while comforting and reconciling with his dying mother, but even if you didn\u2019t know that, his pantomime would still rip you up.\u201cChanges\u201d was originally the product of rock\u2019s early-\u201970s commercial largess. After three albums spent forging heavy metal in the unglamorous English Midlands, Sabbath was afforded a Bel Air mansion to record its fourth. The house was filled with equipment and enough drugs to get \u201ccoked out of our brains every day,\u201d as the bassist Geezer Butler recalled in \u201cBlack Sabbath: Doom Let Loose,\u201d Martin Popoff\u2019s illustrated history of the band. One debauched night, the guitarist Tony Iommi wandered over to a grand piano in the manse\u2019s ballroom and tapped out the melody of \u201cChanges.\u201d Butler wrote the lyrics, and Ozzy Osbourne, the singer, found some gentle nuance in them, despite being in such a drug-freaked state that he was \u201cdreaming there was, like, a tape machine coming into my room and eating me.\u201dWhen Bradley\u2019s guitarist, Tom Brenneck, raised the idea of covering \u201cChanges,\u201d he had never heard of Black Sabbath. \u201cBut as I was learning the song, my mom was very ill, and she was talking to me a lot, and what she was saying fit the lyrics,\u201d he told me. \u201cBefore that song, I was just trying to forget about her dying. But how can you forget the deepness of your mom finally telling you about her personal life and what she\u2019d gone through?\u201d Osbourne was so impressed by Bradley\u2019s version that he sent an appreciative email.Bradley\u2019s relationship with his mother was deeply fraught. She left her 8-month-old son to move from Gainesville, Fla., to Brooklyn, then sent for him when he was 8. He left at 14, saying she was abusive. Decades later, she begged him to come home to Brooklyn and take care of her. He agreed, reluctantly, but time didn\u2019t soften his resentment. It was only when she finally shared the terror she experienced in the Jim Crow South of the 1930s and \u201940s \u2014 and her struggles as a single mother of three in Bed-Stuy \u2014 that he was able to see his mother clearly.By 2011, when Bradley released the first of three top-shelf albums for the Brooklyn label Daptone, he was 62 and badly scarred by his own misfortunes. Even his ensuing, 11th-hour success has come at a cost: He has been pressured to support family and friends, and because his artistic method demands a deep emotional connection with his material, he has found himself revisiting buried memories of homelessness and violence. Late last year, he underwent a debilitating operation for stomach cancer. When I spoke with him in February, he was making plans to sing again, but his voice was practically a whisper. Still, he eagerly testified about \u201cChanges.\u201d\u201cOh, my God,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I heard the middle of the song, where it\u2019s, \u2018It took so long/To realize/That I can still hear/Her last goodbyes,\u2019 that really touched my soul, truthfully. I used to think my mom was evil, but we were able to find forgiveness at the end of her life. Now I can go out into the world without animosity or anger and show people the love in my soul.\u201d\u2666Charles Aaron is a contributing writer for MTV News.On the boldness and cowardice of love.By JASON PARHAMWhether you have the emotional bandwidth to admit it or not, all of us, at some point in our volatile existence on Earth, want to be acknowledged by another human being \u2014 seen, touched, heard and paid attention to, and not just platonically. Maybe those two lines jolted me because I live in an ebb-and-flow of denial about my own romantic relationships. Of the four semi-serious ones I\u2019ve had, not one has lasted longer than a year. (Once I asked an ex, with whom I\u2019d remained on good terms, to send me a favorite sentence of hers for a collaborative writing project I was working on; maybe half-jokingly, but probably not, she responded with the St. Vincent lyric \u201cYour heart is a strange little orange to peel.\u201d) And if music, like all art, should be an exercise in just how honest you are willing to be with yourself, then here are two truths: One is that I have never once known the texture of love \u2014 its nirvana-inducing high, its valley of heartbreak. The other is the logical, dead-on explanation for this \u2014 I am a coward. I refuse to take my guard down and open up.Cowardice is also something you innately recognize in another. And on \u201cSeigfried,\u201d a moody, astral slow burner from Frank Ocean\u2019s \u201cBlonde,\u201d I see an ideal palette for Ocean to mask cowardice as love. Has self-confliction ever sounded this divine? Over a bed of drowned-out guitar chords, he sings: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a fool/To settle for a place with some nice views/Maybe I should move/And settle down, two kids and a swimming pool/I\u2019m not brave.\u201d But it\u2019s the end of the song that finds Ocean sounding his most tormented. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you,\u201d he croons in the final minute, pausing for a beat and then adding, \u201cin the dark.\u201d He repeats the line five or six times. It\u2019s such a pure exchange, and a beautiful one too. Feelings run up against one another: vulnerability and intimacy, the possibility of love. But there\u2019s also that undercurrent of cowardice. It\u2019s a deep, genuine promise with a built-in provision. I am yours, but only when the lights are low and no one is looking.Perhaps it\u2019s not a surprising admission in a song that borrows from the singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, himself an effigy of melancholia, who died in 2003. But Ocean has always seemed so unafraid to me, both in his personal life and in the way his music emerges from the inside out. I suppose the bravery we see in him is evidenced by his very promise: though cloaked in a haze of emotional discord, it is one offered on his terms (Ocean has insisted on this position of self-authorship and ownership with increasing brazenness ever since the success of his first LP, \u201cChannel Orange\u201d). Maybe he has become more of the man he has always wanted to be in the years since the summer of 2012. I certainly haven\u2019t.The truth is, many of us are still \u201cspinning on blackness\u201d in our day-to-day lives \u2014 at times lost, afraid, uncertain. But tonight, here in the dark and away from everybody else, Ocean\u2019s orchestral psalm is a reminder that you can still be in full control, even if that means retreating to a place you vowed never to return to. It is only with this kind of startling humanness \u2014 wading through life\u2019s moral gray \u2014 that Ocean could deliver such a promise. Because, really, this isn\u2019t about love or lust; it\u2019s about power. Harness it. Hold it close. And don\u2019t let go.\u2666Jason Parham is a senior editor for The Fader magazine.Growing up wondering if the American dream is for you.By JENNY ZHANGSo when the indie musician Mitski Miyawaki titled her fourth studio album \u201cPuberty 2,\u201d I felt an immediate flicker of recognition. I felt another when she released the first single, \u201cYour Best American Girl,\u201d last March. Coming from someone like Mitski, who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an American father, the title alone was powerful enough to reopen a wound that had been rotting inside me ever since I came of age as an Asian girl in America: an old hatred for myself, my culture, the way I looked and the way I was raised.The simple bass line that opens the song should feel familiar to anyone who ever bobbed along with \u201990s indie rock while indulging in self-pity (as I most certainly did). Mitski murmurs and sighs and sings about a lover. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d be your little spoon/And kiss your fingers forever more.\u201d Did it mean something to me to hear another Asian-American woman refer to herself in the diminutive? Of course it did, and even more to hear her sing, \u201cBut big spoon, you have so much to do/And I have nothing ahead of me.\u201d The guitar and drum beat join in, adding bulk, while Mitski\u2019s voice remains at a steady, low ache, elevating him to the status of a god, unable to imagine that anything could be off-limits to him: \u201cYou\u2019re the sun, you\u2019ve never seen the night.\u201d She denigrates herself again: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the moon, I\u2019m not even a star.\u201d Then, after the power chords kick in and the chorus lifts off: \u201cYour mother wouldn\u2019t approve of how my mother raised me/But I do, I think I do.\u201dMothers have always held such symbolic weight in determining a person\u2019s worth. Your mother tongue, your motherland, your mother\u2019s values \u2014 these things can qualify or disqualify you from attaining myriad American dreams: love, fluency, citizenship, legitimacy, acceptance, success, freedom. \u201cYou\u2019re an all-American boy,\u201d Mitski sings. \u201cI guess I couldn\u2019t help trying to be your best American girl.\u201dI wanted to hear Mitski\u2019s story in this song, but I only heard my own. Listening brought me back to the fuzzy \u201990s D.I.Y. scene of my adolescence in the suburbs of Long Island, back when no one much questioned why a subculture that saw itself as rebelling against the establishment was quite so dominated by white men. I grew up in that scene, as far as someone like me could \u2014 a self-hating Asian kid with strict immigrant parents who wouldn\u2019t let me go over to white people\u2019s houses for fear that their values (laziness, selfishness, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity) would infect me. My mother had two unshakable beliefs that she tried to drill into me. The first was that I had to study and work twice as hard as my white peers if I wanted to survive in America, and the second was that it was delusional and dangerous to believe I possessed the same freedom white people had to pursue my dreams.When I told my mother I wanted to be a writer, she reacted as if I had said I wanted to kill myself. She vowed that she would do everything humanly possible to stop me. Compared with how she had behaved as a teenager, I was ungrateful; compared with the white mothers I knew, she was a dictator. At her most cutting, she asked me, \u201cWho\u2019s ever going to read your stories?\u201d I was stumped. I couldn\u2019t say. At that point in my life, kids were still shouting my last name back to me in the hallways as if it were a punch line and asking me if Chinese people really ate dogs. For the first time, it occurred to me that maybe my mother wasn\u2019t trying to stop me so much as she was trying to protect me.There\u2019s a line in the second verse of \u201cYour Best American Girl\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re the one/You\u2019re all I ever wanted/I think I\u2019ll regret this.\u201d It hints at what so many nonwhite Americans have long suspected: that our desire to be loved may be truly masochistic. It goes unquestioned that the non-American girl would want to assimilate into the all-American boy\u2019s world. But she cannot. That world is not for her.Racism thrives when the people being harmed by it blame themselves and one another. As a teenager, I blamed my parents for failing to secure me admission into whiteness, which I was certain was a prerequisite to being loved. I was mad at them, not at the cruelty of the American dream or the ways in which white supremacy had warped each of us. My privileged upbringing and education and linguistic fluency gave me such proximity to whiteness that it stung all the more to still find myself outside of it. My mother, on the other hand, not only accepted that she would always be an outsider in this country but also believed it to be a finer fate and home than any other she could have had.As I grow older, I find myself trying to turn to her more, to ask the questions I never asked when I was too busy feeling sorry for myself: why she came here, what it was like to uproot a life and move across the world, whether it was hard to raise me here. Does Mitski\u2019s narrator really approve of how her mother raised her? It\u2019s unclear, but you can hear in her voice just how much she wants to.\u2666Jenny Zhang is the author of the forthcoming short-story collection \u201cSour Heart.\u201dRaindrop. Drop top. Is rap music the new punk rock?By NAOMI ZEICHNEREver since the election in November, I\u2019ve gone out more and stayed out later. This doesn\u2019t feel glamorous or especially healthy. People who go to clubs regularly are usually there to work \u2014 whether they make or manage or write about music or just labor to look great. You spend more money than you have and try not to think about it, because late at night, positive energy is the most valuable currency. If anything made the hangover the next morning worth the trouble, it was Migos\u2019s \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d which dominated parties of all kinds this freakishly warm winter.The Atlanta rap trio \u2014 made up of the rappers Quavo, Offset and Takeoff \u2014 have been around for years, but \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d represents their most significant foray into the mainstream, and it\u2019s still a slightly awkward fit. For a recent music-video shoot, they wore heavy-metal tees and studded leather; Quavo\u2019s jacket was painted with the skull logo of the Misfits. This is an increasingly common trope in rap these days; many hip-hop artists insist they are rock stars to signal that they are at the center of today\u2019s counterculture \u2014 which is true. The trio records constantly and has worked the live circuit hard. First the rappers conquered Atlanta\u2019s strip-club scene, then the V.I.P. booths of the surrounding states and then the money of corporations. On their recent album \u201cCulture,\u201d Quavo reflects on their lifestyle: \u201cAll this pain, we can live through it. It\u2019s called success.\u201d\u201cCulture\u201d triumphed on the back of \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in January after months of gestation, thanks in part to internet memes that parroted back its most memorable parts. Migos is known for building songs around catchy lines, and \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d is expertly crammed with them, from its opening preamble to its abstract poetic \u201craindrop, drop top\u201d hook and the five ecstatic woos that announce the beginning of Offset\u2019s verse. The song is nearly six minutes long, and these noises are like souvenirs collected by everyone who has traveled through it, a trip that usually happens at the pinnacle of a night out, when the dance floor is packed and the women in the crowd are ready. \u201cYou can just tell,\u201d one D.J. friend said, when I asked how he decides when to play it. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if someone whispers in your ear, \u2018It\u2019s time.\u2019 \u201dWith all its parts to latch onto, \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d draws people together. When its bass shakes, people do, too; you could cut the music off and everyone would still be yelling in unison. Surrounded by that kind of collective precision, you might find it difficult not to feel less alone. If Migos has to pose in punk-rock outfits to be recognized as a voice for its generation, at least it\u2019s an authentic pose: The punks I know love their music deeply. Whether they meant to or not, with \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d Migos created a space of refuge for people who needed a break and were willing to work for it. The song offered a sanctuary: Settle in, stay a while, belong here for as long as you need.\u2666Naomi Zeichner is the editor in chief of The Fader.You play you.By Steven HydenLast November, Metallica did something extraordinary: It put out a new album, \u201cHardwired .\u2009.\u2009. to Self-Destruct,\u201d that actually sounded like Metallica. On paper, a band acting like itself seems normal. But consider Metallica\u2019s output since its megaselling self-titled LP in 1991, better known as \u201cThe Black Album.\u201d There was the \u201calt-rock haircut\u201d phase of \u201cLoad and Re-Load.\u201d The \u201cLet\u2019s stop playing guitar solos\u201d phase of \u201cSt. Anger.\u201d And, most regrettable, the \u201cCollaborate with Lou Reed on a confounding art-rock opus about a 19th-century German femme fatale\u201d phase of \u201cLulu.\u201dContrast those digressions with \u201cSpit Out the Bone,\u201d the kinetic seven-minute closer of \u201cHardwired.\u201d Dueling riffs by the guitarists James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett race forward at a frightening velocity. Lars Ulrich bashes out a martial beat that sounds like a velociraptor trapped inside a washing machine. And Robert Trujillo\u2019s melodically sinister bass snakes below the maelstrom, a demon lurking in the shadows. \u201cSpit Out the Bone\u201d epitomizes the thrash-metal formula that Metallica helped invent in the early \u201980s and then tried to avoid for the past quarter-century. On \u201cHardwired ... to Self-Destruct,\u201d it\u2019s almost as if those 25 years never happened.Not giving the people what they want has been admired as a gesture of artistic fortitude in music, going back at least to Igor Stravinsky, whose premiere of his dissonant masterwork, \u201cThe Rite of Spring,\u201d caused a riot at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris in 1913. More recently, a boxed set collecting every known concert recording from Bob Dylan\u2019s 1966 tour \u2014 36 discs in all \u2014 was released last fall. The exhaustive document chronicles a pivotal period for rock\u2019s poet laureate, who angered folk fans by \u201cgoing electric.\u201d Now it\u2019s possible to hear nearly every instance of an audience jeering loudly as Dylan introduced \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d and other songs into his live repertoire.Metallica once embraced a foundational idea of \u201cprogressive\u201d popular music: Change constantly or become instantly irrelevant, even if those stylistic shifts alienate your fans. But in an age when a plurality of niches has supplanted the mainstream that Metallica once conquered, there\u2019s a new kind of street cred that comes with sticking to what you\u2019re known for. Now it\u2019s listeners who contain multitudes. It\u2019s up to us to create eclectic playlists designed for a variety of moods and situations. For a veteran band like Metallica, that means being rewarded for playing to type. \u201cHardwired ... to Self-Destruct\u201d debuted at No.\u20091 and was the best-selling rock album in years.Is it antithetical to art to suggest that \u201cknow your brand\u201d is the future not just of music, but also all of entertainment? George Lucas sold the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise to Disney in 2012, and now J.\u2009J. Abrams makes the sort of \u201cfun\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies that Lucas was trying to get away from with his little-loved, self-serious prequels. Lucas never recovered after making his versions of \u201cLoad,\u201d \u201cSt. Anger\u201d and \u201cLulu.\u201d Metallica should be grateful that it still gets to make Metallica records.\u2666Steven Hyden is cultural critic for Uproxx.We talk with some of the great writers in this issue about the songs that spoke to them over the past year, and what those songs might tell us about the world right now.Digital Design: Rodrigo de Benito Sanz and Linsey Fields.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook and Twitter Could Face Fines in Germany Over Hate Speech Posts", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Social media giants including Facebook and Twitter are not doing enough to curb hate speech on their platforms and could face fines of up to $53 million if they do not strengthen their efforts to delete illegal posts, a German government minister said on Tuesday.For tech companies and free speech campaigners, this global regulatory push could limit how individuals communicate online by restricting people\u2019s digital activities and allowing governments to expand their control over vast parts of the internet.Yet for a growing number of policy makers in Europe, the United States and elsewhere, social media companies have a responsibility to block harmful content from their digital platforms, and they must respect national rules that often run counter to Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to operate across borders.On Tuesday, Heiko Maas, Germany\u2019s minister of justice and consumer protection, said he would propose a law that would impose stiff fines on companies whose social media platforms did not respond swiftly enough to complaints about illegal content. Mr. Maas has been a vocal critic of how companies treat online content that violates the country\u2019s strict rules on hate speech.\u201cThis will set binding standards for how companies running social networks must handle complaints and require them to delete criminal content,\u201d Mr. Maas said of the proposal.If the law is approved, tech companies may face fines of up to 50 million euros, or $53 million, for not combating hate speech, potentially the highest such penalty in the Western world.It would require social media platforms to make it easy for users to report contentious material, and to respond to those requests promptly. It calls for \u201cobviously criminal content\u201d to be deleted or blocked within 24 hours, while companies would have seven days to remove posts that are less clear-cut.Communications experts in Germany welcomed the move.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the internet will no longer be a free space,\u201d said Birgit Stark, head of the institute for communications at the University of Mainz. \u201cYou can\u2019t just defame people, just because it is the internet.\u201dThe development followed the publication on Tuesday of the results of a study that showed that Facebook and Twitter failed to meet the German target of removing 70 percent of hate speech within 24 hours of being alerted to its presence.The yearlong study noted that while the two companies eventually erased nearly all illegal hate speech, in January and February, Facebook managed to delete 39 percent in the time frame sought by the German authorities and Twitter 1 percent. Google\u2019s YouTube video service fared the best, taking down within 24 hours 90 percent of all content flagged.Since September, the figure for Facebook has fallen by seven percentage points, while Twitter\u2019s takedown rate has not changed. The issue has taken on new urgency as Germany gears up for parliamentary elections in September.Tech companies deny playing fast and loose with national hate speech laws, saying they have taken down illegal material when it has been flagged by users. They also argue, however, that there is a fine line between complying with a country\u2019s rules and outright censorship.\u201cWe are doing far more than any other company to try and get on top of hate speech on our platform,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe, said in an interview late last year. \u201cWe recognize that this is a work in progress.\u201dGermany, where it is illegal to promote Nazi ideology or to deny the Holocaust, has been at the center of the debate about what can be published on social media platforms and who is responsible for such content.Many Germans \u2014 among the most engaged users of these services \u2014 also remain overtly wary of how much information American tech companies routinely collect about their online activities. Facebook and Google have run into problems with local lawmakers over what can be disseminated on their social networks and on video sites like YouTube.\u201cWe are disappointed by the results,\u201d Klaus Gorny, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday referring to the German government study. \u201cWe have clear rules against hate speech and work hard to keep it off our platform.\u201dAl Verney, a YouTube spokesman, said that the company was analyzing the proposed legislation and that the video service\u2019s procedures for taking things down were robust. Twitter declined to comment on Mr. Maas\u2019s proposal.The German criticism over how social media companies handle hate speech and other illicit content online is part of a wider global pushback.\u201cTrust is one of the main assets that social media has,\u201d Andrus Ansip, a European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital agenda, said in an interview last month. \u201cIf people can\u2019t trust these channels, then they will stop using these platforms.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Richard Allen. This correction was delayed because the error was pointed out to editors only recently.Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin, and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Darwin Evolved: 25,540 Paper Fragments Tell the Story", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe love cool problem-solving under the dinosaur tail,\u201d said Jin Chung, a software engineer at eBay. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a piece of history. We\u2019re even touching the Darwin artifacts themselves.\u201dInstantly explosive when it was published in 1859, the book is still viewed as the keystone of evolutionary biology. Legions of scientists remain devoted to its text and to the observations that went into its preparation.Against this backdrop, the manuscripts project is reassembling Darwin\u2019s notes as he originally wrote them. To speed the process, the computer experts use superfast computers to match up the rough edges of the disassembled notes, many in nearly undecipherable handwriting.A chronic reorganizer, Darwin arranged his notes according to topics that interested him at the time. One page, for example, might be observations made about bees visiting flowers in 1840, originally placed in a portfolio on the behavior of bees. Perhaps 10 years later, he tore or cut that page, moving some of the observations into a portfolio on the pollination of flowers. By reassembling the original pages, researchers hope to understand fully the long arc of Darwin\u2019s research and the gradual maturation of his thinking.Before the manuscripts project began 10 years ago, Dr. Kohn tried to crack the code of Darwin\u2019s handwriting. He would sit for hours at the Cambridge University Library, where the original manuscripts are stored, and focus on the slopes and curves of the botanist\u2019s scrawl. In 2007, a five-person team embarked on the task of transcribing thousands of pages of Darwin\u2019s scientific papers, drawings and book research.Working from the transcriptions, the computer experts then began trying to reassemble the manuscripts digitally. Their work will accomplish in months what would take years to do by hand.Darwin, an experimenter extraordinaire, might have appreciated the efforts.A wealthy landowner, he used Down House, his property of 20 acres or so in England, for hands-on testing of his theories. His laboratory included five greenhouses and a vegetable garden, and his initial experiments consisted of observing 1,000 flowering plants over three summers in the gardens on his relatives\u2019 grounds.Darwin also enlisted some of his 10 children to gather flowers or collect moths at night. They even drew enchanting pictures of flowers on the backs of his notes. Darwin himself \u201cwas a terrible drawer,\u201d Dr. Kohn said.\u201cI was, however, surprised at the depth of involvement with his family,\u201d he added. \u201cDarwin had a network to gather and test his theories.\u201dDuring the 24-hour hackathon, Dr. Kohn inspired the computer experts with some of these stories about Darwin\u2019s exploits in experimentation. For example, Darwin would put vegetable or flower seeds in little bottles with salt water to see how long they could float. That way, he could test his theories about how far seeds could travel and survive.To sort through the notes, the computer experts used coding and image processing to differentiate pages with ragged, fuzzy or sharp edges. Then they matched curves by performing a shape analysis. The project is expected to be completed by the end of March.Luis Ibanez, a software engineer from Google who helped with image-processing functions, found out about the manuscripts project at his company, which promoted it internally. He said he had taken part in 15 hackathons for various projects and enjoys picking up \u201cnew tricks\u201d from other hackers.Mr. Ibanez was especially impressed that Darwin was able to experiment at his own pace over the decades. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do that at Google,\u201d he said.For her analysis of the manuscripts, Ms. Chung applied tools like the Fourier transform, which breaks wave forms into alternate representations. \u201cI got more exposure to image-processing tools during the hackathon,\u201d she said.Dr. Kohn suggested that Darwin would be tickled with the new technology tools.The naturalist kept up his research until the day he died in 1882. His manuscripts were stored in steel trunks that remained in a son\u2019s house until the 1940s, when they were transferred to the Cambridge University Library. In the 1950s, they were finally cataloged, prompting a cottage industry of historical research, Dr. Kohn said.With the notes newly assembled digitally, Darwin\u2019s work can now move into the 21st century.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With C.I.A. Hacking Revelations, How to Protect Your Devices", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Tech FixWant to protect against surveillance through your iPhones, Android devices, Wi-Fi routers and Samsung televisions? Update, update, update.Supported byThat\u2019s just about every major category of consumer electronics. So what does that mean for you if you own one \u2014 or several \u2014 of these gadgets?For many people, it may mean nothing at all. The thousands of pages of documents refer to programs that attacked outdated versions of the software systems running on devices, and many security vulnerabilities have since been patched.On the other hand, many people may still use outdated software on their devices. And although the C.I.A. designed these tools to spy on terrorists in the interest of national security, the hacking tools may have ended up in the hands of a whole range of entities.The fallout may also end up being broader. WikiLeaks, which released documents covering 2013 to 2016, has said its initial publication was just the first installment in a bigger cache of secret C.I.A. material.So even if you aren\u2019t worried about what WikiLeaks revealed about the C.I.A. right now for yourself, here are some tips for protecting your cellphones, televisions and internet routers.What you can do if you\u2019re on AndroidHundreds of millions of Android users still use devices based on older versions of the Google-made mobile operating system. The WikiLeaks document collection, which includes 7,818 web pages and 943 attachments, showed that the Android devices targeted by the hacking programs were mostly running a version of Android 4.0.With the limited information we have now, the best thing people can do is to stop procrastinating on updating their software.\u201cThe one thing that people can and should be doing is keeping their apps and phones as up-to-date as possible,\u201d said Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit.What you can do on an iPhoneMany iPhone owners are far more up-to-date with their mobile software than Android device owners. So only a minority of iPhone users have devices with the versions of the Apple iOS operating system that the WikiLeaks documents mention.Runa Sandvik, The New York Times\u2019s director of information security in the newsroom, and Nicole Perlroth, who writes about cybersecurity and privacy, answered reader questions about cybersecurity.Specifically, the WikiLeaks documents referred to exploits working on versions of iOS up to 8.2. About 79 percent of Apple users are running iOS 10, the latest version of the system, and only 5 percent are running a version older than iOS 9, according to Apple.In raw numbers, with more than one billion iOS devices sold worldwide, that amounts to at least 50 million people running the outdated software.For those worried about their iPhone security, the advice is generally the same here as for Android owners: iPhone and iPad users should make sure to be running the latest operating system, iOS 10. Apple said on Tuesday that many of the security issues described in the WikiLeaks documents had already been patched in the latest version of its software and that it was working to address remaining vulnerabilities.What you can do with your Samsung TVThe documents published by WikiLeaks disclosed that a tool called Weeping Angel puts the target TV in a \u201cfake off\u201d mode. Then, with the owner believing the TV is turned off, the set secretly records conversations in the room and sends them over the internet to a C.I.A. server computer.That advice might not be sufficient for addressing privacy concerns around Samsung\u2019s smart TVs, because the Weeping Angel hack continues to control the television even when it appears to be turned off.Craig Spiezle, executive director of the Online Trust Alliance, a nonprofit privacy group, said the WikiLeaks revelations could spur action that he sees as lacking from makers of connected devices.\u201cI see this as a wake-up call for the industry to build better security and for consumers of these devices to rethink what they have and, in some cases, disconnect their connectivity,\u201d Mr. Spiezle said.What to do with your routerThe WikiLeaks documents also described methods of injecting malware into routers offered by Asian manufacturers like Huawei, ZTE and Mercury.In general, it is wise for everyone to regularly check routers for so-called firmware updates to make sure they get the latest security enhancements.Depending on which router you own, downloading the latest firmware update isn\u2019t very intuitive because it usually requires logging into the router. More modern routers like Eero and Google Wifi include mobile apps that help you download the latest updates automatically, so consider one of those if you are worried.What to do with your computerThe WikiLeaks documents mentioned attacks on Linux, Windows and Apple computers. Personal computers have always been the most vulnerable devices we own, so this tip is fairly obvious: Make sure to install the latest operating system updates and use antivirus software. And as always, stay on guard for suspicious websites that may be serving malware.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chase Had Ads on 400,000 Sites. Then on Just 5,000. Same Results.", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byAs of a few weeks ago, advertisements for JPMorgan Chase were appearing on about 400,000 websites a month. It is the sort of eye-popping number that has become the norm these days for big companies that use automated tools to reach consumers online.The change illustrates the new skepticism with which major marketers are approaching online ad platforms and the automated technology placing their brands on millions of websites. In recent years, advertisers have increasingly shunned buying ads on individual sites in favor of cheaply targeting groups of people across the web based on their browsing habits, a process known as programmatic advertising \u2014 enabling, say, a Gerber ad to show up on a local mother\u2019s blog, or a purse in an online shopping cart to follow a person around the internet for weeks.But as the risks around the far reaches of the web have been cast into stark relief, some advertisers are questioning the value of showing up on hundreds of thousands of unknown sites, and wondering whether millions of appearances actually translate into more sales.If more advertisers follow JPMorgan\u2019s lead and see similar results, it could hurt the operators of smaller sites that make up the so-called long tail of the internet, as well as the advertising technology companies that profit from funneling trillions of ad impressions from brands to consumers through systems that mimic a stock exchange, according to Eric Franchi, co-founder of the ad technology firm Undertone.\u201cIf you charge a percentage of all of the ads that run through your platform, then the prospects can be pretty dim if all of a sudden your volume has been cut by 95 percent,\u201d Mr. Franchi said. \u201cSo many of these companies, and some of them are public, tout the number of ads they deliver per second, per day. If you start seeing more marketers move in this direction, it will be pretty interesting. What are the metrics then that those companies start to report?\u201dJPMorgan started looking into preapproving sites, a strategy known as whitelisting, this month after The New York Times showed it an ad for Chase\u2019s private client services on a site called Hillary 4 Prison. It was under a headline claiming that the actor Elijah Wood had revealed \u201cthe horrifying truth about the Satanic liberal perverts who run Hollywood.\u201dOf the 400,000 web addresses JPMorgan\u2019s ads showed up on in a recent 30-day period, said Ms. Lemkau, only 12,000, or 3 percent, led to activity beyond an impression.

{"Headline": "Google Tries to Stop Ads From Appearing Next to Hate Speech", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byGoogle moved on Tuesday to protect its lucrative advertising business by giving marketers greater control over where their ads appear online, after major clients withdrew spots that were shown next to hate speech and other offensive material.Google has become a global advertising behemoth, pocketing billions of dollars every year from brands promoting their goods through the company\u2019s search engine and on YouTube. But the changes, which will be introduced in the coming weeks, highlight the difficult balance between protecting Google\u2019s advertising business while also allowing free speech.By giving brands more say over where their ads appear, experts say, Google is acknowledging that it has not done enough so far to police the material on its sites.Last year, Alphabet made $19.5 billion in net profit, a 23 percent annual jump, almost all of which was generated from Google\u2019s advertising business.Google\u2019s public mea culpa follows the pulling of ads by Havas, a French advertising multinational. Havas withdrew spots for several of its clients from the search giant\u2019s digital services in Britain after failing to receive assurances that they would not be shown next to offensive material.As part of the advertising revamp, Google said that it would rigorously vet online content that could be considered hate speech or derogatory content. That would include giving brands greater say over where their ads would be shown online, and powers to remove them if companies were still not satisfied.The company said that it would hire more staff members to police its advertising standards, adding that it would also use artificial intelligence and other technology to remove harmful content.\u201cWe believe the combination of these new policies and controls will significantly strengthen our ability to help advertisers,\u201d Mr. Schindler said.Google refrained, however, from saying that it would actively remove material before it had been flagged by users, a move that some policy makers, notably in Europe, have called for.Google\u2019s stance has come under increased scrutiny in recent months with the rise of so-called fake news and with hate speech connected to elections in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.Some freedom of speech campaigners have urged Google to stand its ground, but policy makers around the world have called on the company to do more to combat the spread of offensive material on the internet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Battle for Digital India, Vodafone Teams Up With Idea Cellular", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byIndia is fast becoming the new battleground for global technology and telecommunications giants, as Facebook, Vodafone and others vie to connect the country\u2019s population of 1.2 billion to the internet.The fight took another turn on Monday when Vodafone, a British carrier, announced that it was combining its Indian unit with Idea Cellular, a local operator, in a $23 billion deal that would create one of the world\u2019s largest cellphone providers, with roughly 400 million subscribers in India.The country\u2019s cellphone industry is undergoing a drastic overhaul, as more Indians make the digital leap.In recent years, the use of smartphones, which can be bought for as little as $20, has ballooned, and Indians have rushed to digital services like Google and Facebook. India is already Facebook\u2019s largest market, based on number of users. Local start-ups like Flipkart, a growing e-commerce player, have taken on the likes of Amazon.\u201cWhen I get home, if my kids need help with their homework, they Google it on my phone,\u201d said Sikendar Kumar Jha, 37, a chauffeur in Mumbai whose family lives near the border with Nepal. \u201cMy wife and kids live here with me, but I video chat with my brothers in my village.\u201dThe explosion of internet usage has created cutthroat competition among carriers seeking ever faster mobile networks and cheaper data packages in a country where consumers are particularly sensitive to price. And the dynamic has prompted a flurry of investments and deals.\u201cConsolidation in the Indian market is the name of the game,\u201d said Rishi Tejpal, an analyst in Gurgaon, India, for Gartner, a technology research company. \u201cThe survival of 10 to 12 local operators isn\u2019t a long-term reality.\u201dThe companies said the merger would allow them to invest heavily in faster mobile networks across India. Those networks, called fourth generation, or 4G, are a basic requirement for movie streaming and watching TV programs on smartphones.While many in India already have so-called feature phones \u2014 rudimentary devices with limited, or no, access to the web \u2014 operators are trying to coax people to invest in budget smartphones that can take advantage of mobile data. Such services offer higher returns than carriers\u2019 traditional voice or text message offerings.\u201cWe have responded effectively to the newcomer,\u201d Vittorio Colao, Vodafone\u2019s chief executive, said on Monday, referring to Reliance Industries and its free offerings. \u201cAnyone who gives anything away for free in life has to charge, inevitably.\u201dThe merger is expected to close by late 2018. Vodafone would retain a 45 percent stake in the business, while the Aditya Birla Group, Idea\u2019s majority shareholder, would hold a 26 percent stake. Idea\u2019s other shareholders would own the remaining stock.The promise of India\u2019s large market has caught the attention of some of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest companies, too.Analysts say the main instigator for the latest merger was the entrance of Jio last year. Jio quickly drew about 100 million subscribers, thanks largely to its free voice and data packages for new users.Reliance has invested at least $25 billion to build a fast mobile network across India, and that has forced rivals to cut their prices and to spend big to try to keep pace. Reliance plans to pare back its free offerings by the end of March. Instead, it will encourage users to buy low-cost monthly data plans, in which voice calls are expected to remain free of charge.For Indians, the price war has led to a flurry of mobile data offers, allowing many to connect to the internet at significantly discounted rates. That has allowed subscribers to use digital services, such as those from Google and Uber, that would previously have been prohibitively expensive.Varun Mahtani, 30, a stock trader in Mumbai, signed up with Jio in December, combining the carrier\u2019s free data plans with his existing Vodafone subscription.Mr. Mahtani uses a smartphone with a so-called dual SIM that allows him to toggle back and forth between the two carriers, depending on which one offers him the best rate. That strategy has let him cut his Vodafone cost by 75 percent, to just $6 a month, while increasing his average internet usage.\u201cI use data constantly \u2014 Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube \u2014 in addition to work,\u201d said Mr. Mahtani, adding that if Jio cut back on its free offerings, he would likely switch to another provider. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be a consumer.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from MumbaiAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Platform Companies Are Becoming More Powerful \u2014 but What Exactly Do They Want?", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyDuring a February ride in San Francisco, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was recorded arguing with and eventually berating an Uber driver from the back seat of his car. The driver, who had been working with the company since 2011, accused Kalanick of undercutting drivers of high-end cars like his, plunging him into bankruptcy. Kalanick responded with a lecture about the basic economic logic of his company: Soon, the supply of luxury cars on the app would be reduced, causing demand to increase. Besides, he went on, if the company hadn\u2019t added a lower-priced tier, it would have been beaten by competitors. This did not satisfy the driver, which seemed to enrage Kalanick, who erupted into a moralizing tirade. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own [expletive],\u201d he said, before leaving the car.Uber, like so many other successful tech companies in 2017, is a \u201cplatform business,\u201d one built around matchmaking between vendors and customers. If successful, a platform creates its own marketplace; if extremely successful, it ends up controlling something closer to an entire economy. This is intuitive in a case like eBay, which connects buyers and sellers. Airbnb, too, resembles an age-old form of commerce, connecting property owners with short-term lodgers. TaskRabbit and Fiverr connect contractors with people looking to hire them. Some of the largest platforms are less obviously transactional: Facebook and Google connect advertisers with users, users with one another, software developers with users. But while the transactions that happen on their platforms largely take a different form \u2014 taps, shares, ads served and scrolled past \u2014 the principles are essentially the same, as are the benefits. These businesses are asset- and employee-light, low on liability and high on upside. They aspire to monopoly, often unapologetically, and have been instrumental in rehabilitating the concept. (The logic is seductive and often self-evident: Facebook is more useful if everyone is on it, therefore everyone should be on Facebook.)Predictably, platforms have long been intoxicating to investors. They\u2019ve also been the subject of rapturous popular business writing. In their 2016 book \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms,\u201d the economists David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee cast the subject in revolutionary terms, calling for a \u201cnew economics\u201d to account for businesses that are \u201ctransforming economies\u201d around the world, \u201cmaking life easier and better for billions of people\u201d \u2014 the sort of broad and ideological claim previously reserved by economists for capitalism as a whole.Amid the cheerleading, a comprehensive criticism of the platform model has been slow to emerge. Nick Srnicek\u2019s \u201cPlatform Capitalism,\u201d published in December, tries to situate the rise of platforms in a broader history of capitalism and to project those lessons forward. Srnicek recasts a few features of platform businesses as potentially problematic. Among them is their tendency to metastasize from transaction enablers to, with sufficient success, participation gatekeepers. A food-delivery app like Seamless begins its life with promises of liberation, connecting customers with nearby restaurants, taking care of payments and eliminating phone calls. But in the cities where it has been most successful, its customer base becomes too big to ignore, even for restaurants that struggle to afford its steep commissions. In other industries, the stakes are much higher. An insurgent Airbnb feels as if it\u2019s enabling new types of transactions between previously unconnected people. A dominant Airbnb might come to resemble something between a superintendent and a landlord for millions, not to mention a force reshaping cities in its image.Platform companies have themselves hired economists to help conceptualize and manage the economies they\u2019ve created. Google, Airbnb, Uber and Amazon have aggressively recruited professors and researchers to help understand what, exactly, they have on their hands, and how to expand, regulate and exploit it. Within a rigidly structured platform like Uber, for which the company sets prices, the economic problems are somewhat akin to those of a command economy: How low can we push the cost of a ride before drivers stop participating? (Quite low, for now.) How do we deal with sudden increases in demand? (Surge pricing, controversially.) How might new drivers be both induced to join the platform and more deeply compelled to stay? (Through the introduction of vehicle-financing programs and short-term loan services.)Platforms are, in a sense, capitalism distilled to its essence. They are proudly experimental and maximally consequential, prone to creating externalities and especially disinclined to address or even acknowledge what happens beyond their rising walls. And accordingly, platforms are the underlying trend that ties together popular narratives about technology and the economy in general. Platforms provide the substructure for the \u201cgig economy\u201d and the \u201csharing economy\u201d; they\u2019re the economic engine of social media; they\u2019re the architecture of the \u201cattention economy\u201d and the inspiration for claims about the \u201cend of ownership.\u201dBut the tensions that platforms like Uber create with their customers, their workers and the world that surrounds them will soon become harder to ignore as these companies foment economic and social change, the consequences of which will increasingly be thrust into spectacular display. The Kalanick video was a P.R. nightmare not just for Uber but also for the platform economy in general, posing grand questions about the world it promises, or threatens, to create. The zeal for platforms, combined with the technology industry\u2019s internalization of their merits and inevitability, will push them into areas where the tensions they create become starker and the ideologies they carry become more apparent.Nowhere is that ideological dimension more clear than in the Kalanick video from February. Driver and founder sat inches apart, alienated from each other by the system over which one presides and within which the other toils: the founder explaining to the driver how the platform works and must work; the driver appealing to this person for better pay. It resembles nothing more than one man remarking on the rain while the other thinks, \u201cDon\u2019t you control the weather?\u201d Platforms seek total control even as they abdicate responsibility. In other words, they\u2019re perfect.For now, the tensions that platforms can breed have been obscured \u2014 or at least ignored \u2014 in large part because platformized labor has arrived first in sectors where employment was already widely precarious and contract-based, like taxi driving. As the model expands, these tensions may become more visible as workers with more political and social capital are subjected to them. The recent history of platforms, however, has been defined by the failure of all but a few smart or lucky people to imagine just how successful and powerful they can be.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Party of No", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "FeatureHow a president and a protest movement transformed the Democrats.Supported byOn election night, Schumer was at Hillary Clinton\u2019s party at the Javits Convention Center in Midtown Manhattan when, around 8 p.m., he saw some troubling exit polls coming out of Florida and North Carolina. They showed that college-educated women in both states \u2014 a demographic that everyone assumed would be a lock \u2014 were underperforming for Clinton. Schumer called one of her top campaign advisers, who tried to reassure him. \u201cHe says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, our firewalls in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Michigan are strong,\u2019\u2009\u201d Schumer recalls. \u201c\u2009\u2018There\u2019s no way Trump can win.\u2019\u2009\u201dSchumer, who was in line to succeed Harry Reid as the top-ranking Democrat in the Senate after Reid\u2019s retirement in December, had spent roughly $8 million of his own campaign funds on Democratic senatorial campaigns in other states in hopes of retaking control of the upper chamber, which the Democrats lost in 2014, and of making himself the majority leader. On his bookshelf he kept a copy of \u201cMaster of the Senate,\u201d the historian Robert Caro\u2019s exhaustive chronicle of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s years as the Democratic majority leader, which Caro had inscribed to Schumer: \u201cWhose career I have been following for years with real admiration, so that I have no doubt that he will be a great leader of senators.\u201d But by the early hours of Wednesday it was clear that the Democrats would not take the Senate and that Schumer would not be Lyndon Johnson.\u201cWe\u2019ll work together,\u201d Trump said on the phone call. He said he wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 \u201cthat A.C.A. is terrible,\u201d he told Schumer \u2014 which was an obvious nonstarter for the incoming minority leader. He also said he wanted a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, a trillion dollars sounds good to me,\u2019\u2009\u201d Schumer told me. But to get Democrats on board, he warned, three conditions had to be met. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it with these tax breaks,\u201d he said. Second, he could not \u201ccut the programs we care about \u2014 Medicare, education, scientific research \u2014 to pay for this. It\u2019s got to be new spending.\u201d Finally, the bill had to preserve existing environmental and labor protections. \u201cI said, \u2018To do that, you\u2019re going to have to get half your party really mad at you.\u2019\u2009\u201dSchumer, as he saw it, was calling Trump\u2019s bluff. \u201cDonald Trump ran as an anti-establishment populist \u2014 against both the Democratic and Republican establishments,\u201d he told me. Whether or not he had meant it, the Democrats could try to hold him to it. On the several occasions that Trump called Schumer in the weeks after the election, Schumer argued that he could try to govern as a hard-right conservative, but \u201cAmerica is not a hard-right country,\u201d and there would be electoral consequences.It might not have been the strongest card to play, but Schumer did not have a strong hand. The election in November left the Democrats stripped of power at every level of federal authority. Schumer would now possess the only means they had of exerting even limited influence over Trump\u2019s agenda: a Senate Democratic caucus that, while several seats shy of a majority, was large enough to make life complicated for Senate Republicans. But that could happen only if the Democrats formed a united front \u2014 and it was unclear whether they could, or even wanted to.The 2016 election was not just an electoral crisis for the party but also an existential one, more severe than any that the Democrats had experienced in decades. The party had glided through the campaign with a sense of destiny: In July, Schumer breezily remarked that \u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\u201d Then Hillary Clinton lost to a candidate who revived a strain of nativist, nationalist politics that had been dormant in the Republican Party for at least a generation, and who won in part on the ballots of Barack Obama voters in traditionally Democratic strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin. \u201cI sleep like a baby,\u201d Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, told me. \u201cAnd I can sleep anywhere \u2014 on the road, on the floor, in my kid\u2019s bed jammed up against the wall.\u201d But on election night, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but I stayed up all night. I was, mentally, totally unprepared. At some level, you do have this \u2014 \u201d he trailed off and was silent for a moment. \u201cYou do start to question whether you know the country as well as you thought.\u201dThe Democratic primaries and caucuses, meanwhile, had left the party sharply divided. Clinton lost 22 states to Bernie Sanders, Vermont\u2019s independent and self-identified socialist senator, whose out-of-nowhere challenge had stirred a grass-roots excitement that Clinton\u2019s campaign conspicuously lacked and acrimoniously split the Democratic Party\u2019s centrist and left-leaning contingents \u2014 the latter of which viewed the Obama years as a missed opportunity to fight economic inequality, reorient trade policy and rein in Wall Street. Clinton might have won the popular vote, but in a way, this only amplified the confusion: about whether the party needed to transform or simply tinker; whether it needed to move to the right or to the left; whether the voters who were willing to vote for a candidate who said the things Trump said could be won back at all.Among the Democrats who appeared to share Klain\u2019s postelection view was Harry Reid, Schumer\u2019s predecessor as minority leader, who would be retiring in December. Reid and Schumer, then Reid\u2019s deputy, were an effective team for years in the Senate, partners in a long-running good-cop-bad-cop act. Schumer was known as a sharp-elbowed partisan during his 18 years in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate he had become an avatar of the gabby aisle-crossing bonhomie that had historically characterized the upper chamber. \u201cYou know, I get along,\u201d Schumer told me. \u201cI\u2019m in the gym in the morning, I\u2019m talking with Thune, and Lamar, and Cornyn all the time,\u201d he said, referring to the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn. \u201cI\u2019m friends with them. They attack me, I attack them. We understand that.\u201dThis was the old way of the Senate \u2014 one that began to fade in the late 1970s as the ideological consolidation of the parties accelerated, reducing their need and taste for compromise. By the time Schumer arrived in 1999, four years after the Newt Gingrich-helmed Republican revolution, it was fast becoming an anachronism, with meals in the senators\u2019 bipartisan dining room giving way to one-party caucus lunches. By the time Reid became minority leader, amid the scorched-earth polarization of George W. Bush\u2019s second term, it was all but gone.Reid, like his Republican counterpart, McConnell, was one of the rare politicians who seemed to genuinely not care if people liked him or not. He was known for his blunt-instrument floor speeches, sandbags of verbiage delivered with minimal theatrics and less ambiguity of purpose. It was in this mode that he took to the Senate floor, a week after the election, and drew a line.Senate Democrats had tried for years to pass the kind of infrastructure bill Trump had suggested, Reid reminded his colleagues, only to run up against Republican opposition. \u201cIf Trump wants to pursue policies that will help working people, Democrats will take a pragmatic approach,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also have other responsibilities.\u201d He made clear that the price of Democratic cooperation should be Trump\u2019s dropping of Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive chairman who ran his campaign and whom Trump named as his chief White House strategist two days earlier.\u201cIn his first official act, Trump appointed a man who is seen as a champion of white supremacy as the No. 1 strategist in his White House,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAs long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office,\u201d he added, \u201cit will be impossible to take Trump\u2019s efforts to heal the nation seriously.\u201dSchumer, who began holding weekly dinners with the Big Five after the election, believed it was best to allow these senators to cooperate with Trump as necessary. But according to members of Reid\u2019s staff at the time, Reid (who declined to comment) worried that, given Trump\u2019s lack of interest in policy detail and disregard for ethical conflicts, even well-intentioned legislative compromises could prove to be politically costly \u2014 that an eventual backlash against the president would also fall upon Democrats who gestured toward working with him. \u201cReid didn\u2019t want to validate the assumption that this incompetent blowhard could get a bill to the floor in the first place, which has proved to be a struggle for Trump so far,\u201d Adam Jentleson, at the time Reid\u2019s deputy chief of staff, told me.Democrats were also still deeply divided over whether it was even possible to navigate 2017 without resolving the ideological and policy differences that fractured the party in 2016. At a closed-door meeting of the Democracy Alliance \u2014 a network of high-rolling Democratic campaign donors \u2014 at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington the week after the election, Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered an emotional address, excoriating the party for losing its way. One attendee paraphrased her speech to me: \u201cPeople want someone to fight for them \u2014 that\u2019s why they voted for Donald Trump. He might not actually do it, but he said he would fight for them. On trade, in American politics, we\u2019ve gotten where we either look like we\u2019re all about free trade without any empathy for people who have lost their jobs, or we\u2019re rabid nationalist-protectionists. We need to build a policy in between. In 2016, we did not come out clear. When we are clear about what we believe, when we fight for people, we\u2019ll win.\u201d To beat pugilistic right-wing populism, maybe you needed pugilistic left-wing populism.It was a minor fight, but an illuminating one. From one perspective, Warren\u2019s move looked quixotic at a time when the party had bigger problems. From another, it was an argument for survival: Whatever unity the Democrats could manage would be worthless without settling what, and who, the party stood for.The Twitter account that first circulated the blueprint belonged to Ezra Levin, then a 31-year-old associate director for federal policy at an antipoverty nonprofit and one of the document\u2019s authors. Shortly after graduating from college, Levin was hired by Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman representing Levin\u2019s hometown, Austin, Tex., and he was working at Doggett\u2019s office on Aug. 1, 2009, when the congressman went to meet his constituents at a Randalls grocery store in South Austin. At the time, Democrats were trying to maneuver the Affordable Care Act through the House of Representatives, and organizers of the nascent Tea Party movement decided to mount a show of force at the town halls that representatives typically held in their districts during the August recess.As Doggett spoke outside the Randalls, a large crowd of demonstrators gathered, armed with DON\u2019T TREAD ON ME flags, signs assailing \u201csocialized health care\u201d and, in one case, a large poster of Doggett\u2019s face augmented with devil horns. \u201cThey chased him out into the parking lot,\u201d Levin told me recently. When Doggett tried to leave, the crowd surrounded his car.For the congressional staff members who experienced the uprising that August, the lessons of the Tea Party were mostly tactical, and unambiguous. Representatives live in fear of the wrath of their constituents, but also at a remove from it; the legislative process is complicated, blame is easily distributed and Washington is far away. There is an adage on Capitol Hill that five letters from the district about a bill is cause for alarm, and 10 is a full-blown emergency. By those standards, a couple hundred Tea Partyers besieging their elected officials in person was a borderline apocalypse.Republicans had in recent decades outperformed Democrats at this kind of dispersed, ground-level activism. This was in part because the party was more geographically distributed than the Democrats, who were increasingly concentrated in urban areas and interior suburbs. But Democrats had also historically relied heavily on unions and urban party machines to reach voters \u2014 a support apparatus that receded sharply by the late 20th century. The Republicans, who never had such luxuries, assiduously cultivated their own grass roots \u2014 an effort whose success has contributed to the deep erosion of the Democrats\u2019 presence in state legislatures (down 23 percent) and governor\u2019s mansions (down nearly 45 percent) since 2008.The most combustible Tea Party town halls were confrontations with Democrats, like Doggett, whose positions on the A.C.A. stood little chance of changing. But these representatives weren\u2019t really the intended audience; Republicans were. The shaky, hand-held videos posted to YouTube \u2014 the first real recognition, in American politics, of the platform\u2019s potential as a stage for agitprop theater \u2014 and looped endlessly on Fox News were a message to wavering Republicans that obstruction would be rewarded and compromise would be punished. \u201cThey were really smart on strategy,\u201d Levin told me: \u201cFocus on your local members, and be defensive in nature.\u201d Perhaps most important, \u201cThey understood that \u2018No\u2019 was a complete sentence.\u201d\u201cIndivisible\u201d was a bullet-pointed pr\u00e9cis of the tactics the document\u2019s authors had seen work against them \u2014 a guide to getting to \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusion that the resistance will defeat every piece of Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Levin told me. The Tea Party lost many battles, including its biggest: \u201cObamacare was passed. Dodd-Frank did pass. Lloyd Doggett did vote for health care. But it did slow down and water down legislation. We didn\u2019t get card check for unions. We didn\u2019t get cap and trade. We didn\u2019t get a lot of things.\u201dIf the Indivisible Guide was a blueprint for a movement, it was an unusual one, bearing little resemblance to liberal or left-wing movements of the past. It called for no ideological remaking of the Democratic Party, no housecleaning of the establishment, no throwing-out of the bums \u2014 or at least not the Democratic ones. Its authors weren\u2019t political outsiders; they were members of Washington\u2019s mainstream Democratic professional class. The document presented not just a strategy for standing up to Trump but also an argument for sidestepping the party\u2019s most divisive internal conflicts. It offered a way of thinking about resisting the Trump administration that set aside the debate over what kind of party the Democrats should be. \u201cThis is not a panacea,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cnor is it intended to stand alone.\u201d It was not a policy agenda, and that was the point. \u201cThe Tea Party took root in 2009, focused on fighting against every proposal coming out of the new Democratic administration and Congress. This focus on defense rather than policy development allowed the movement to avoid fracturing. Tea Party members may not have agreed on the policy reforms, but they could agree that Obama, Democrats and moderate Republicans had to be stopped.\u201dBy the week after Inauguration Day, however, rallies were happening nationwide every Tuesday and had acquired an angrier edge. Trump was issuing a flurry of executive orders: reduced regulations on manufacturing, a pledge to disassemble the Affordable Care Act, advancements of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, the end of federal funding for \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal authorities in detaining people suspected of immigration-law violations \u2014 and the go-ahead to build his long-promised United States-Mexico border wall. Then, on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 27, the White House announced it was immediately blocking all travel to the United States by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries.The following afternoon, when a crowd of 10,000 gathered to protest in Manhattan\u2019s Battery Park, the first person in line to address the demonstrators, after the rally organizers, was Chuck Schumer. Taking the microphone, Schumer led the crowd in an old standby of a chant \u2014 \u201cA people united will never be divided!\u201d \u2014 and, somewhat tentatively, raised his fist.A couple near where I was standing, next to the stage, started laughing. It was a strange thing to see: Schumer was at the barricades, but Schumer was not really a barricades kind of guy. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is life and death for so many people,\u201d he intoned, and waved his arm in the direction of the Statue of Liberty, glinting in the distance over his shoulder. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is that beautiful lady in the harbor \u2014 and what America is all about.\u201dSchumer\u2019s presence at the rally suggested just how quickly, and definitively, the politics of the moment had been settled. In the week since the Women\u2019s March, Trump\u2019s executive orders had confirmed liberals\u2019 worst fears of his intentions and the helplessness of congressional Democrats to stand in his way. And by the end of that week all four cabinet appointees under consideration \u2014 Mattis; Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly; Mike Pompeo, director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations \u2014 sailed through their confirmation votes with no serious opposition.Schumer, in particular, had become a target of outrage. He had not only declined to rally his caucus against the cabinet nominees, but he had also voted for all four of them himself. As he was speaking, I heard a burst of effusive applause and cries of \u201cSenator! Senator!\u201d coming from behind me. I turned and saw, gliding through the scrum in the direction of the stage, the bald dome of Cory Booker\u2019s head. He was beaming, obliging fans with high-fives and back slaps. By some measures, Booker\u2019s voting record in the Senate placed him a couple of clicks to the right of Schumer. But Booker voted no on Kelly and Pompeo, and Schumer did not. Booker was at the airport protests the night before, and Schumer was not.\u201cMy middle name is Ellis \u2014 Charles Ellis Schumer,\u201d Schumer was saying. \u201cI was named after Uncle Ellis, who was named after Ellis Island. I named my daughter\u2019s middle name Emma, after Emma Lazarus, and what she said 100 years ago that\u2019s emblazoned on that beautiful statue \u2014 \u201d\u201cVote no on Sessions!\u201d a handful of people around me were chanting now. Jeff Sessions, Schumer\u2019s Senate colleague, would be up for a confirmation vote as attorney general the following week.\u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore \u2014 \u201dAfter Schumer yielded the stage to Gillibrand \u2014 \u201cShe voted no!\u201d another woman near me shouted approvingly \u2014 he started making his way through the crowd, right into what happened to be a particularly dense pocket of his detractors. \u201cPut \u2019em up, everybody!\u201d he said, grinning, offering his hands for high-fives. \u201cPut \u2019em up for our immigrants!\u201d\u201cVote no, Senator,\u201d someone yelled. \u201cVote no!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m no on DeVos,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cNo on Tillerson. No on Mulvaney. No on Carson. No on Mnuchin. No on all of them!\u201d (He had, in fact, already announced he was voting against Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Mick Mulvaney \u2014 the prospective secretaries of education and state and head of the Office of Management and Budget, respectively.)\u201cWhy did you confirm Haley and Mattis?\u201d someone demanded.\u201cGrow a spine, Chuck!\u201d a gray-haired, trimly mustachioed man screamed, practically in Schumer\u2019s ear, his voice cracking: \u201cGrow a spiiiiiiiine!\u201d A scruffy young man, perched in the crook of a tree, began leading a chant: \u201cGrow a spine, Chuck! You must obstruct!\u201dSchumer is one of those politicians who seem to feed on the attention of a crowd, even a largely hostile one, and he pressed on gamely, smiling and shaking hands, pointing in the direction of the occasional familiar face: \u201cHey Dave, nice to see you!\u201d He was almost out to the street, the crowd around him thinning, when a middle-aged woman in a \u201cpussy hat\u201d called out, in a Brooklyn accent nearly as thick as Schumer\u2019s, \u201cWhat about the first four votes?\u201dSchumer stopped, a hint of a smile on his face, as if intrigued by the specificity of the harangue. \u201cWould you have voted against Mattis?\u201d he asked.\u201cEverything they do.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the only one who came out against torture.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s a defensive vote?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo we\u2019re going to keep figuring out who\u2019s a relief?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no \u2014 all the other bad ones, we\u2019re going against.\u201d He swept off up the block with his aides, a man trying to figure out how to be reasonable in deeply unreasonable times.The Democrats called for an all-night marathon debate of DeVos\u2019s nomination leading up to the vote on Feb. 7. It wasn\u2019t a filibuster \u2014 Reid had done away with those for cabinet nominees in 2013 \u2014 but a kind of sit-in: an effort to draw attention to the vote in hopes of further overloading the Senate office buildings\u2019 phone lines and nudging off the fence one of several Republican senators who had been identified, perhaps wishfully, as potentially persuadable. It was also an unsubtle challenge to Senate Democrats: the first moment since the airport protests for the party to stand up and stand together.As they held the floor Monday night and through the early hours of Tuesday, the senators stood in front of the C-Span cameras and read off messages from constituents, urging them to send more to their Republican colleagues before the noon vote. By Monday evening the hashtag #HoldTheFloor was trending on Twitter, accompanied by emoji of praying hands, by inspirational quotes, by photos of Nelson Mandela or of Hodor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dAfter an hour, the camera cut away, and a mildly disheveled-looking Tim Kaine ambled onto the floor to take his turn. \u201cTimmy!\u201d Schatz exclaimed. \u201cAre you going to speak for, like, an hour without notes?\u201d Kaine grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve got three pages,\u201d he said.\u201cFourteen Democrats voted for Mike Pompeo,\u201d Ezra Levin, the Indivisible Guide co-author, told me. \u201cThis was a man who slandered Muslims, was open to torture, and 14 Democrats voted for him! That\u2019s why you saw people outside Dianne Feinstein\u2019s office, outside of Schumer\u2019s office, Amy Klobuchar\u2019s office. The base wants them to stand on principle. In the two weeks between Pompeo and DeVos, there were massive protests. And zero Democrats voted for DeVos. Pompeo was an awful pick; DeVos was an awful pick. The thing that changed was not the degree of their awfulness, it was that people stood up.\u201dBut even as a sort of guarded optimism set in among many Democrats, there was a gloom among the party\u2019s left flank that appeared nearly as thick as it was in November \u2014 a sense that the party, buoyed by the easy gratification of opposition, was punting on resolving difficult questions, at its own peril. Just before visiting Schumer, I went to see Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office. In a couple of hours, the Vermont senator\u2019s colleagues would be gathering in Senate dining room to share a meal \u2014 a bipartisan tradition before presidential speeches to Congress. But Sanders did not intend to be among them. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to skip the dinner tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in a very convivial mood. I don\u2019t want to pretend. These are very, to my mind, frightening times.\u201dI asked him if he thought the Democratic Party knew what it stood for. \u201cYou\u2019re asking a good question, and I can\u2019t give you a definitive answer,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly there are some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo. They would rather go down with the Titanic so long as they have first-class seats.\u201dWhen I met Warren a few weeks later, I asked her about the speech, and whether the postelection unity that Trump provided the Democratic Party made her ambitions to reform it easier or harder to realize. \u201cI think it has reminded Democrats we need to run on our values,\u201d she replied, parrying the question. \u201cBecause our values are more in line with most of America.\u201d If you squinted at the bodies packing the streets and the town halls, though, the picture looked an awful lot like the recent past: Here were people drawn together in defense of liberal immigration and refugee policies, reproductive rights, civil liberties and preserving Obama\u2019s policy legacy, and in opposition to a president who was moving against all those things. These were last year\u2019s arguments, only louder. If Trump, as president, seemed unable to let go of his 2016 campaign, the Democrats seemed like they were acting out an improved version of their own \u2014 the crowds bigger and more unified, the stakes more clearly understood.\u201cThere\u2019s more enthusiasm, more energy, more passion now than there was at any point in the 2016 campaign \u2014 which is both heartening and discouraging, all at the same time,\u201d Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, told me. \u201c\u200bI think that\u2019s what a lot of us are seeing and feeling. And we\u2019re trying to figure out the right way for us to respond to it.\u201dFor now, the question was how far \u201cNo\u201d could carry the Democrats. The Indivisible Guide, in the three months since Levin first posted the Google Doc, had birthed the organization he and his colleagues had not intended to start, with Levin as the executive director. It had registered more than 5,800 local affiliate groups, at least two in each of the country\u2019s 435 congressional districts. In February, Priorities USA, which raised $192 million to support Clinton in 2016, announced it was reorienting itself to support grass-roots organizing \u2014 including an investment in online advertising driving people to the Indivisible Guide\u2019s website listing congressional members\u2019 town halls.Schumer, meanwhile, was planning to lead the Democrats against Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, forcing the Republicans to find 60 votes or get rid of the filibuster. If Republicans tried to gut federal funding for Planned Parenthood in a forthcoming budget bill, he told me, he was perfectly willing to filibuster that too. \u201cI think McConnell and Ryan know they can\u2019t shut down the government,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re in charge now.\u201dAnd Schumer, precisely no one\u2019s idea of a revolutionary, was now, at least in a narrow constitutional sense, the leader of the resistance. On my way out of his new office, I noticed a green marble fireplace and asked him if he\u2019d used it yet. \u201cOh, man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite perk. I live in Brooklyn \u2014 I never had a fireplace. I\u2019m learning to start fires.\u201dAn article on March 19 about the growing opposition movement within the Democratic Party misstated Hillary Clinton\u2019s Manhattan location on election night.

{"Headline": "With WikiLeaks Claims of C.I.A. Hacking, How Vulnerable Is Your Smartphone?", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byWhat is the C.I.A. program?By the end of 2016, the C.I.A. program had 5,000 registered users, including government employees and contractors. And they had produced more than a thousand hacking systems. The agency\u2019s arsenal, the documents indicate, included an array of malware ranging from viruses to clandestine \u201czero day\u201d vulnerabilities in the software of major companies.The files have circulated among former United States government hackers and contractors in \u201can unauthorized manner, one of whom provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive,\u201d WikiLeaks said.WikiLeaks said it was publishing the documents while redacting and anonymizing some passages, including the names of \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of C.I.A. targets. WikiLeaks said it was not distributing \u201carmed cyberweapons.\u201dHow vulnerable is my smartphone?The software targeted by the hacking program included the most popular smartphone operating systems: Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android.The C.I.A. hacking initiative had a \u201cmobile devices branch,\u201d which developed an array of attacks on popular smartphones to infect and extract data, including a user\u2019s location, audio and text messages, and to covertly activate a phone\u2019s camera and microphone.Apple\u2019s iPhone software, according to the documents, was a particular target, including the development of several \u201czero day\u201d exploits \u2014 a term for attacking coding flaws the company would not have known about.Though Apple has only 15 percent of the global smartphone market, the intensive C.I.A. effort was probably explained by the \u201cpopularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.\u201dGoogle\u2019s Android, the most widely used smartphone operating system, seemed to have received even more attention. By 2016, the C.I.A. had 24 weaponized Android \u201czero day\u201d software programs.Did the C.I.A. directly target encryption software?They did not appear to find a way into the apps themselves.Were other kinds of devices targeted?The C.I.A. also targeted Microsoft\u2019s Windows personal computer software, other internet-connected computers, and home and industrial devices running the Linux operating system, according to the documents.There was a specific program to penetrate and take control of Samsung smart TVs. The program, code-named Weeping Angel, was intended to convert new digital televisions into \u201ccovert microphones.\u201d The malware was developed in cooperation with the British spy agency MI5, according to the documents.The Weeping Angel program puts the target TV in a \u201cfake off\u201d mode, according to the WikiLeaks documents. Then, with the owner believing the TV is turned off, the set works as a clandestine recording device, picking up conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a C.I.A. server computer.And in October 2014, according to the documents, the C.I.A. was exploring technology to penetrate the vehicle control systems of cars. The documents do not detail the goal of the vehicle hacking program, but WikiLeaks speculated that it would \u201cpermit the C.I.A. to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.\u201dHas encryption software changed how the C.I.A. behaves?The leaked documents indicate that the broad use of encryption has pushed the C.I.A. to become one of the world\u2019s foremost creators \u2014 and buyers \u2014 of malware. Much of the cache released by WikiLeaks appears to show how the agency has created or acquired a variety of tools to thwart tough encryption or intercept messages before encryption tools make them useless to the intelligence agency.What is new about the C.I.A. program?Using malware to hack into devices ranging from smartphones to webcams has been going on for years. Sometimes the intent is to steal information \u2014 like names, addresses and credit-card numbers for identity theft and fraud. Sometimes the goal seems to be to create havoc.But the C.I.A. program seems to have been particularly sophisticated, far-reaching and focused on surveillance. Just how innovative the individual software techniques were will not be known until independent computer security experts and scientists at the companies whose software was probed can examine the malware and tactics involved.What time period is covered by the documents?WikiLeaks says the document dump will cover 2013 to 2016. The organization says this is the largest publication of intelligence documents in history.If the documents are accurate, did the C.I.A. violate commitments made by President Barack Obama?In 2010, the Obama administration promised to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft.

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Is Trump\u2019s Next Target, Administration Says", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byThe Trump administration served notice on Thursday that its next move to deregulate broadband internet service companies would be to jettison the Obama administration\u2019s net neutrality rules, which were intended to safeguard free expression online.The net neutrality rules, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015, aimed to preserve the open internet and ensure that it could not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.Supporters of net neutrality have insisted the rules are necessary to protect equal access to content on the internet. Opponents said the rules unfairly subjected broadband internet suppliers like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter to utility-style regulation.In a news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, mentioned the net neutrality rules affecting telecommunications and cable internet services, noting that the Obama administration had \u201creclassified them as common carriers.\u201dMr. Spicer said President Trump had \u201cpledged to reverse this overreach.\u201d The Obama-era rules, Mr. Spicer said, were an example of \u201cbureaucrats in Washington\u201d placing restrictions on one kind of company \u2014 internet service suppliers \u2014 and \u201cpicking winners and losers.\u201dTelecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as common-carrier utility services, which are subject to anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules. They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers.Mr. Spicer remarked on the rollback of privacy rules before he spoke more broadly about regulations on broadband internet services. President Trump, he said, will \u201ccontinue to fight Washington red tape that stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth.\u201dExcerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.Mr. Trump earlier this year appointed Ajit Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon and a minority Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, as chairman of the agency. Mr. Pai voted against the net neutrality rules as a commission member in 2015.Since becoming chairman, Mr. Pai has indicated that he plans to either roll back or decline to enforce many consumer protection regulations created during the Obama administration, including those regarding net neutrality.Getting rid of the net neutrality rules, policy experts said, will be more difficult than peeling away the privacy regulations. Congress, in a vote mainly along party lines, and by a narrow margin, overturned the privacy rules enacted last fall, using a streamlined process under the Congressional Review Act.But that faster procedure will not apply to the net neutrality rules, which were approved by the F.C.C. two years ago, beyond the timetable for such reviews.Another path to repeal would be for Mr. Pai, who now leads a Republican-majority commission, to revisit the issue at the F.C.C.Politically, net neutrality might be a bigger challenge as well. When it was weighing the rules in 2014 and 2015, the F.C.C. received more than one million public comments. The vast majority of them endorsed strict nondiscrimination rules that supporters viewed as necessary to preserve the democratic ethos of an open internet.That wave of response influenced the Democratic-majority commission. \u201cNet neutrality could be a volatile and explosive issue,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Trump administration appreciates that it addresses nondiscrimination for all kinds of speech, as much for Breitbart and Newsmax as it is for MSNBC and CNN,\u201d referring to news sources that are staunch backers of the Trump administration and ones often seen by Republicans as harsh critics.Opponents of the net neutrality rules say the rules were mainly the result of a very effective lobbying campaign by powerful internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. They have deep pockets and could pay more for fast lanes for their services, they say, but used the net neutrality campaign to avoid that expense.\u201cRegulations result in the allocation of wealth by the government,\u201d said Jeffrey Eisenach, an economist and visiting scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who was also an adviser to the Trump transition team. \u201cThey are often an opportunity for one group of firms to grab an advantage over another group.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Dearth of I.P.O.s, but It\u2019s Not the Fault of Red Tape", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe confirmation hearing last week for Jay Clayton, who has been nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, focused on the continued sluggishness of the market for initial public offerings. Senators pushed the nominee to do something, anything, to revive it.The problem is that there is no magic wand \u2014 including deregulation \u2014 that can fix the decline.The problems were recently documented in a research note by Credit Suisse titled \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks.\u201d The bank documented that the total number of companies listed on the United States stock market plummeted by nearly half, to 3,671 last year from 7,322 in 1996.Such shrinkage has prompted hand-wringing for over a decade. At Mr. Clayton\u2019s hearing, at least five senators brought it up, pointing to the regulatory burdens on companies going public.There\u2019s only one problem with casting regulation as the villain: There\u2019s not much evidence for it.Moreover, the JOBS Act has done nothing to revive the market for small companies, those with a market capitalization of under $75 million. They still number less than a handful each year.And while fingers get pointed at regulation like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the number of initial public offerings fell off the cliff in 1996 \u2014 years before either bill was passed. So there must be something more here.Those who have examined this issue have come up with a number of possible reasons.The Credit Suisse paper also brings up this theory, noting that mergers are the major cause for companies to be delisted from a stock exchange. It appears that this deal activity has spread to the private markets, co-opting the process of taking companies public.For example, Cisco Systems purchased AppDynamics on the eve of its market debut. And acquirers seem willing to pay top dollar in these instances, as research and development by many large corporations now consists largely of acquiring smaller, usually private, companies.This is aptly illustrated by the buying sprees of Google and Facebook, which took candidates to go public \u2014 like Instagram, Nest, Waze and WhatsApp \u2014 out of contention.In 1996, average proceeds for an initial public offering were $85.7 million, and 54 percent of these offerings were considered small, with a market capitalization below $75 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 2014, however, average proceeds were $186.4 million and only 4 percent of offerings were small.The market for new issues has moved toward liquidity and bigger stocks. Mutual funds prefer making big investments rather than small ones for liquidity and administrative purposes \u2014 lots of small investments simply require more people and more monitoring.A third possibility is that companies simply no longer need the public market. The private markets are more efficient, and financing is readily available from venture capitalists and banks.There are even markets and mechanisms that exist not only to allow for financing, but to allow for selling employees\u2019 and founders\u2019 shares in private markets. In addition, the JOBS Act allowed companies to expand the number of shareholders and still be private, a change that encouraged companies to remain private.There are other theories. One of these notes that the 1990s saw a surge in I.P.O. activity and that we are just back to what the activity was in the 1970s and \u201980s. Who is to say what is a normal market?Another possible reason is that companies are shying away from the public markets to avoid shareholder activism, short-termism and the glare of public scrutiny.Yet the growing use of dual class shares and staggered boards by new companies, measures that help founders retain control, argues against this need. And they are tools that can be used by any company \u2014 even Shake Shack went public with dual-class stock.The bottom line is that while there might be rational reasons to reduce regulation on capital raising \u2014 to make it easier and less expensive \u2014 we are kidding ourselves if we think that simply deregulating will bring back initial public offerings.The task is much harder. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, could help build an infrastructure for buying small company offerings. Allowing mutual funds more latitude to buy illiquid small investments and to change their compensation structures if they do would be a big step.Then there is the argument that maybe we shouldn\u2019t do anything, given how hard it will be. The idea behind the public markets is to provide capital funding. But if the private markets are now efficient and capable of providing even less expensive capital at lower cost, maybe we should be fine with the current state of affairs.Still, that overlooks the fact that for most of us, our retirement money is in the public markets. We should be worried about all of this money flowing into a smaller and smaller group of companies.One answer is to allow mutual funds to invest more in private companies. Already 26 mutual fund groups had $11.5 billion invested in late-stage companies in 2016, according to Credit Suisse.That\u2019s one answer, but that will result in yet more intermediaries. The better solution is to push more companies to the public markets. Deregulating is one thing, but the real work will require more innovative thinking from market regulators. That\u2019s your homework, Mr. Clayton.On a personal note, I\u2019ve been writing the Deal Professor column for DealBook for over nine years now, and this will be my last column before I take an extended sabbatical to work on other projects.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "WikiLeaks Will Help Tech Companies Fix Security Flaws, Assange Says", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been derided as an anti-American anarchist, indiscriminate in publishing leaks and far too cozy with Russia. For more than four years, he has been hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid sexual assault investigators in Sweden.The 8,000 C.I.A. documents that WikiLeaks made public this week \u2014 the first installment in a far larger collection, Mr. Assange said \u2014 showed that the agency had found flaws in the most popular products of the internet age: iPhones, Android phones, software used in every office and even internet-connected televisions. But instead of alerting the companies so they could plug the security holes, the agency exploited the weaknesses to carry out cyberspying around the world.\u201cWe have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured,\u201d Mr. Assange said.The companies reacted cautiously to the WikiLeaks offer, saying there could be legal complications in accepting classified information stolen from the government. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, advised the companies to seek legal advice before accepting the leaked code.\u201cI do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about if a program or a piece of information is classified,\u201d he said at a press briefing. \u201cIt remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not.\u201dWikiLeaks\u2019 reputation was marred in some circles by its previous splash in the news, the release last year of emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign that were believed to have come from Russian government hackers. Now Mr. Assange, who once worked as a computer security specialist, insists that his goal was to safeguard the privacy of everyone\u2019s communications from the intrusive gaze of the C.I.A.\u201cWhy has the Central Intelligence Agency not acted with speed to come together with Apple, Microsoft and other manufacturers to defend us all from its own weapons systems?\u201d he asked.The C.I.A. issued an unusually lengthy response, emphasizing that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, with Americans off limits.\u201cAs we\u2019ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,\u201d the C.I.A. statement said. \u201cDespite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, C.I.A. continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.\u201dBy his offer, Assange was inserting WikiLeaks into a strained relationship between the government and Silicon Valley, where some executives believe their products\u2019 reputations are endangered by aggressive American espionage efforts.The Obama administration addressed this conflict by setting up a formal review process for technical vulnerabilities that the government discovered \u2014 or purchased from hackers.When an intelligence agency or the F.B.I. wanted to make use of a major chink in a company\u2019s technological armor, it first had to get approval through a committee organized by the White House. At a sort of court of vulnerabilities, intelligence agencies argued for using the flaw for surveillance, while other officials made the case for revealing it to Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other firm.\u201cThe default position was to disclose the vulnerability,\u201d said Michael Daniel, the cybersecurity coordinator at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, who ran the process. Last year, the administration said in congressional testimony that over 80 percent of vulnerabilities discovered by the government had been revealed to the industry.But there were moments, Mr. Daniel said on Thursday, when the committee he assembled judged that it was in the national interest to keep secret a \u201czero day\u201d flaw \u2014 so named because the target would have zero days of notice that there was a vulnerability. That would give the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. time to exploit it.Not all of the flaws revealed in the new WikiLeaks trove of C.I.A. documents would necessarily have gone through this process, and the committee would not have reviewed the \u201ctools,\u201d or software techniques, used to exploit a vulnerability. But Mr. Daniel said that \u201call the appropriate agencies, including the C.I.A., participated in this process.\u201d That suggests that using at least some of the vulnerabilities exposed by WikiLeaks would have required White House approval.Brian White, the chief operating officer of RedOwl Analytics, a cybersecurity firm, said the companies were caught between conflicting pressures, especially if some of their employees have security clearances to work on government contracts.\u201cIf you are holding a security clearance and you engage in the movement or sharing of this data, you could have your clearance revoked,\u201d he said.But he said that companies like Apple and Google also had a responsibility to their shareholders and customers to make their products as safe as possible. \u201cThe likelihood of prosecution is much less important than understanding any vulnerability in their products,\u201d he said.In addition to the legal quandary, dealing with Mr. Assange, a mercurial personality who is considered a criminal by some people and a hero by others, is fraught with political complications.While WikiLeaks has often been criticized for releasing sensitive data without regard for the consequences, Mr. Assange is acting responsibly this time, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. WikiLeaks redacted the actual computer code for C.I.A. exploits from its initial release to avoid spreading such cyberweapons.\u201cHe is trying to do the right thing,\u201d Ms. Granick said.She said that the legal risk to companies using the leaked information to fix their products is minimal, but that the government could make it easy by sharing more information about the vulnerabilities directly with the companies.Paul Kocher, a cryptographer who was previously an executive at the chip company Rambus, said that helping companies patch security holes was accepted practice in the industry.\u201cThere are lots of things at WikiLeaks that are ethically questionable,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cBut the normal thing to do if you come across vulnerabilities, regardless of who\u2019s using them, is to help them get fixed.\u201dScott Shane and David E.

Theater work is more fragile because I want to make sure that I get it right.Are you a barbecue fan?I\u2019m a vegetarian so whenever I have to draw meat I usually have to Google it to figure out what people eat. When I do barbecues they are different than the typical barbecue. It\u2019s veggies instead of T-bone steaks.Advertisement"}
