{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank to Raise $8.5 Billion and Reorganize Some Operations", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Deutsche Bank said on Sunday that it planned to raise an additional $8.5 billion in capital, reorganize its retail business in Germany and combine its markets business with its corporate and investment bank in the latest reshaping under its chief executive, John Cryan.The bank announced the capital raising, through the issuing of new shares, and a bevy of other actions as part of its strategic reorganization after a meeting by its supervisory board on Sunday.\u201cOur decisions are a significant step forward on the path to creating a simpler, stronger and growing bank,\u201d Mr. Cryan said in a news release. \u201cThe capital increase will reinforce our financial strength substantially. The new three-pillar structure of our operating business should position us for significant growth, both in revenues and earnings.\u201dOn Sunday, the bank said it would seek to strengthen its business in its home market by reintegrating Postbank, a German retail banking business, with its private and commercial clients business in Germany. Deutsche Bank had been seeking to sell the Postbank business since spring 2015.\u201cThis now offers Deutsche Bank the opportunity to create Germany\u2019s biggest private and commercial bank, retaining a multibrand approach,\u201d the bank said.The combined business would have more than 20 million customers and give the bank greater scale in a competitive environment. It would cost 1.5 billion to 2 billion euros to reintegrate the business, Deutsche Bank said.\u201cThe strategic benefits are overwhelming,\u201d Mr. Cryan said on a conference call with journalists on Sunday.Deutsche Bank also said it would combine its global markets business with its corporate and investment bank. The company had separated the businesses in 2015 as part of a restructuring.\u201cThe bank intends to shift the focus in this business to corporate clients while retaining a strong but more focused institutional client base,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cFrom one integrated division, clients will be offered services ranging from financing and payments to hedging and advisory. A higher proportion of the division\u2019s balance sheet is in time expected to be deployed to support corporate clients.\u201dDeutsche Bank also plans to sell a minority stake in its Deutsche Asset Management business in a partial initial public offering.The bank said Deutsche Asset Management would remain an integral part of its business model, but it hopes the offering will allow the unit to develop its business lines and attract additional talent through increased operational independence.The bank said it intended to maintain a majority stake in the business and to complete the stake sale in the next two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Everyone \u2018Knows Hockey\u2019: Tiny Clarkson Stands Tall Again", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byOne of the side benefits of playing women\u2019s college hockey in a small town is that when a team wins an N.C.A.A. championship, as Clarkson University did for the second time in four seasons last week, its bus gets escorted into town by fire trucks and a police cruiser, sirens wailing.The Golden Knights were escorted into Potsdam, N.Y., population 17,000, from the county line, some 40 miles from town. The players might have come to Clarkson for good hockey and a top-notch education, but they are also local celebrities.\u201cI think it makes it more special that you know everyone who comes to the games \u2014 and they know you,\u201d said Cayley Mercer, a senior forward from Exeter, Ontario, who led the Golden Knights in scoring.The team, the 4,300-student body and the North Country community less than 30 miles from Canada are not finished commemorating the title yet: A celebration is scheduled for Tuesday at Cheel Arena, with a Clarkson Women\u2019s Hockey Day in Potsdam slated for next month.In 2014, the Golden Knights became the first women\u2019s team outside the Western Collegiate Hockey Association to win the national title. Their second championship was a small surprise because they upset top-ranked Wisconsin, 3-0, in the title game at St. Charles, Mo., on March 19.The Badgers (33-3-4) had been No. 1 all season and had not lost their previous 22 games. But Clarkson (32-4-5) was ranked No. 2, losing only once since Wisconsin beat Clarkson in back-to-back nonconference games in Potsdam in mid-October.\u201cI feel like we\u2019re a small school, but at the same time, we\u2019re kind of not,\u201d said Savannah Harmon, a junior defender from Downers Grove, Ill. \u201cWe think we\u2019re a school to be reckoned with.\u201dThe Golden Knights received two goals from Mercer and a 41-save shutout from Shea Tiley, a junior goaltender from Owen Sound, Ontario, to upend Wisconsin. In 2014, Clarkson stunned Minnesota, which had only one loss that season, to win the title. The Golden Knights beat the Gophers again to advance to the 2017 championship game.Clarkson has had a men\u2019s hockey team since 1921, but it didn\u2019t start a Division I women\u2019s team until 2003. The team made steady progress, playing in its first N.C.A.A. tournament in 2013.Now the university is a women\u2019s hockey hot spot, even if it is a little off the beaten trail.\u201cMost people who don\u2019t know us think we\u2019re 10 miles south of the North Pole,\u201d said Steve Yianoukos, the director of athletics and recreation at Clarkson.Golden Knights Coach Matt Desrosiers, 37, knew about Clarkson years before he got the job. Before playing in the minor leagues as a defenseman for five years, Desrosiers attended St. Lawrence University, Clarkson\u2019s big rival.It was at St. Lawrence, nine miles from Potsdam, where Desrosiers met Shannon Smith, a top forward for the women\u2019s team from Fernie, British Columbia. After graduating, Smith pursued a master\u2019s degree at Clarkson, working as an assistant coach in the team\u2019s first Division I season.After Desrosiers was finished playing, he joined the Clarkson staff as an assistant coach. When Coach Rick Seeley left for Quinnipiac in 2008, the couple, who were married in 2006, became the first husband-wife co-head coaches in college hockey.\u201cWe went from never seeing each other to seeing each other about 23 hours a day,\u201d Matt Desrosiers said, laughing.Sixteen of the 22 players on this season\u2019s roster came from Canada. The university is a 90-minute drive from Ottawa and a two-hour drive from Montreal, and Desrosiers said Canadian players like that their parents can come see them play.Mercer grew up six hours west of Potsdam, and her sister, Carly, played at Clarkson from 2010 to 2014, serving as the women\u2019s team captain for two years. Caylee liked the university and its small-town setting. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in finance last spring.\u201cIt really resembled home,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wanted to play women\u2019s hockey at a place where women\u2019s hockey was going to be important.\u201dBefore her freshman year, though, Mercer tore an anterior cruciate knee ligament, sidelining her for the season. She did get to play one full season with her sister, and they helped Clarkson win the N.C.A.A. title. Cayley and Clarkson returned to the Frozen Four in 2016.Harmon grew up outside Chicago but played high school hockey in the Boston suburbs, then two years for a junior women\u2019s team in Boston. It did not matter to her that Clarkson was a relatively small school in a small town.\u201cYou just kind of get the vibe when you go visit,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the time, there weren\u2019t a lot of American players there \u2014 there was only one American there \u2014 and I thought that would be pretty cool. It just felt like home. Everybody around Clarkson knows hockey.\u201dShannon Desrosiers still follows the Golden Knights fervently, acting, as Mercer said, as \u201can eye in the sky for us.\u201dThe athletic facilities will continue to be upgraded, but Matt Desrosiers will continue selling the university\u2019s academic reputation and small-town, small-campus feel.\u201cA certain type of kid likes that \u2014 not being in a city setting,\u201d he said.That means when emergency vehicles escort a team bus back from a championship, they can seem a little louder, and the ride a little longer.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know about that,\u201d said Mercer, who will earn an M.B.A. in May and would like to go to law school after a professional hockey career. \u201cIt was like a cherry on top.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, French Presidential Candidate, Vows to Run Despite Inquiry", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byMr. Fillon\u2019s announcement, made at a news conference, added another element of uncertainty to an already unsettled campaign and increased the likelihood that France\u2019s presidential race would be fought by two candidates from neither of the traditional mainstream parties.That would leave the field open to the far-right candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, whose rise in polls has sent jitters through financial markets and immigrant suburbs. Her likely contender is Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister, who is running as the candidate of his own political movement.Mr. Macron, 39, is currently the favorite to defeat Ms. Le Pen, 48, in the second round on May 7. But Mr. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, is untested and inexperienced politically. His centrist program, some of it in line with the Socialist government he served, is viewed as unappealing to parts of the right-leaning electorate. The momentum, in most of the polls, is with her.A top National Front official, Florian Philippot, used a television interview after Mr. Fillon\u2019s appearance largely to attack Mr. Macron \u2014 a clear indication that Ms. Le Pen already considers him her principal opponent.Even as Mr. Fillon, 62, is increasingly being written off, he has doubled down on his defense, yielding no ground to his critics.In another country, the shadow hanging over Mr. Fillon would most likely end a campaign for the highest office. But in France, legal problems, even serious ones, rarely end political careers, even though the electorate appears to be showing \u2014 in polls, at least \u2014 less tolerance than previously for accommodating financial misdeeds in high places.Even if he were to step aside, his center-right Republican Party has few good options. Mr. Fillon\u2019s two main challengers in the party primary both campaigned under the shadow of past and current investigations.The runner-up in the primary, Alain Jupp\u00e9, was convicted in a phony jobs scheme undertaken while he worked at City Hall several decades ago. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president, who finished third, is the subject of multiple investigations, and in February, he was ordered to stand trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012 presidential campaign.But Mr. Fillon\u2019s problems, immediate and future, are different. He campaigned as the candidate of probity. That image has been shattered. And the sums reported to have been pocketed by his wife have shocked the French.Ms. Le Pen is not untainted by corruption accusations. But her legal difficulties, for now, have hardly dented her standing in the polls \u2014 partly because she has never cultivated an image of virtue, and partly because her principal adversary is the European Parliament in Strasbourg, in which she sits and which is widely unpopular, especially among her supporters.Her legal troubles are also more complex than Mr. Fillon\u2019s, and she is not suspected of having personally benefited from any of the alleged financial wrongdoing.Last week, a top Le Pen aide was charged in an alleged phony jobs scheme. The aide was paid out of Parliament money but was thought to have spent her time working for the National Front.Another close associate of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon, has been charged with violating campaign finance laws. Mr. Chatillon\u2019s ties to extremist groups on the far right have been closely documented in the French news media as well.Ms. Le Pen, invoking her parliamentary immunity, has refused a summons from the police who want to question her in the alleged phony jobs scheme, eliciting harsh criticism from government officials who accuse her of holding herself above the law. Like Mr. Fillon, she could still be formally charged.She and Mr. Fillon have struck remarkably similar defenses as the accusations have piled up around them. Both blamed the news media as well as the judicial system and civil servants for their problems.Ms. Le Pen said all of them were working in concert to undermine her. \u201cThe rule of law is the opposite of government by judges,\u201d Ms. Le Pen told her cheering supporters.\u201cJudges exist to apply the law,\u201d she said, \u201cnot to subvert the will of the people.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t embezzle any money,\u201d Mr. Fillon told reporters. \u201cI employed \u2014 like almost a third of the members of Parliament \u2014 family members because I knew I could count on their loyalty and competence. They helped me, and I will prove it.\u201d\u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d he continued, \u201cI haven\u2019t been treated as an ordinary suspect.\u201dAnd he insisted: \u201cThe rule of law has been systematically violated. The press has been an echo chamber for the prejudices of the prosecutors.\u201dMr. Fillon said angrily that the presidential election was being \u201cassassinated,\u201d and he announced his determination to stay in it, because \u201conly the voters can decide who will be president.\u201dThe judicial screws have been steadily tightening on Mr. Fillon since newspaper reports in January \u2014 especially those in the satirical weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 \u2014 said that for years he and his deputy had paid his wife hundreds of thousands of euros in state funds for a possible do-nothing job, and that his children had also benefited from the largess of Mr. Fillon, a former prime minister.In addition, Mr. Fillon is being scrutinized on suspicion of trafficking a high civilian honor, while prime minister, in exchange for money to his wife from a wealthy publisher friend.On Wednesday, in front of dozens of aides and members of his center-right party, Mr. Fillon told reporters he would answer a March 15 summons by the magistrates in the case, after which he is expected to be charged formally. The investigation will continue and Mr. Fillon could then stand trial, or the magistrates could drop the charges.Circumstances look increasingly unfavorable for him. In an article published on Wednesday before Mr. Fillon\u2019s news conference, the French newspaper Le Monde described him as a \u201ccandidate in a bunker\u201d who was hunched up and in his shell. It noted that he no longer took the train for campaign trips out of fear of being called out by protesters.He is often met by protesters banging pots, or \u201ccasseroles\u201d in French \u2014 a slang term for corruption affairs. Sometimes the placards read, \u201cFake jobs for everybody.\u201dAurelien Breeden and Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Neil Gorsuch Has Web of Ties to Secretive Billionaire", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The publicity-shy billionaire Philip F. Anschutz inherited an oil and gas firm and built it into an empire that has sprawled into telecommunications, railroads, real estate, resorts, sports teams, stadiums, movies and conservative publications like The Weekly Standard and The Washington Examiner.Mr. Anschutz\u2019s influence is especially felt in his home state of Colorado, where years ago Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, a Denver native, the son of a well-known Colorado Republican and now President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, was drawn into his orbit.When a reporter called Mr. Anschutz\u2019s company and asked for a press officer, a woman who answered said, \u201cWe do not respond to media requests.\u201d She hung up when asked her name.But he has connections with others who work with the Colorado billionaire. For nearly a dozen years, Judge Gorsuch has been partners in a limited-liability company with two of Mr. Anschutz\u2019s top lieutenants. Together, they own a 40-acre property on the Colorado River in the mountains northwest of Denver, where they built a vacation home together.Judge Gorsuch began representing Mr. Anschutz and his companies when he was working for the Washington law firm then known as Kellogg Huber. Mark Hansen, a senior partner at the firm, said he assigned the future judge, then a junior partner, to help on various cases involving the Anschutz Company \u201cboth because of his skills and experience and because he had expressed to me an interest in getting involved in things relating to his home state.\u201dJudge Gorsuch helped win a ruling in Regal\u2019s favor by arguing that it could handle the extra debt, telling a judge, \u201cThis company is what some analysts call a cash cow.\u201dIn 2005, Judge Gorsuch left private practice to work at the Justice Department. But soon afterward, a seat on the federal appeals court in Denver became vacant, and Mr. Anschutz sought to secure it for him.Liz Johnson, a spokeswoman for Judge Gorsuch, portrayed his participation in that Anschutz-linked case as inadvertent, explaining that he did not include the old firm\u2019s name in a recusal list he filed with the court clerk because \u201cit did not exist as an independent company\u201d when he became a judge.But the judge appears to be leaving the door open to participating in Anschutz-related cases on the Supreme Court.Ms. Johnson said the Walden Group has three partners: Judge Gorsuch, Mr. Harvey and Kevin Conwick. The judge befriended Mr. Harvey while representing Anschutz companies, and Mr. Conwick was a friend of the judge\u2019s late father, a Denver lawyer, she said.Ms. Johnson said Judge Gorsuch contributed $360,000 to the Walden Group, giving him a 20 percent stake; Mr. Harvey and Mr. Conwick each own 40 percent. She said the partners divide the time when each has a right to vacation on the river property, as well as taxes and utilities, based on their respective shares.A longtime friend of Judge Gorsuch\u2019s whom Ms. Johnson made available to discuss the property said the partnership had its origin years ago, when Judge Gorsuch\u2019s father and a dozen friends \u2014 including Mr. Conwick \u2014 bought an adjoining property to be a timeshare they called the Walden Hollow Fishing Club. When the 40-acre property became available, the judge persuaded Mr. Harvey and Mr. Conwick to partner with him to buy it for a similar timeshare, the friend said.Mr. Conwick and Mr. Harvey declined to discuss the partnership, but since 2015, the Walden Group has been trying to sell the property, and few neighbors know who owns it.\u201cThey\u2019re very protective of their fishing,\u201d said Dawn Murphy, 46, who said she was one of only a few year-round residents nearby.But down the gravel road from Ms. Murphy\u2019s cabin, a man outside a ranch house identified himself as the river property\u2019s caretaker.\u201cI\u2019m one of maybe half a dozen people in this valley who know of Neil Gorsuch,\u201d he said.Then, emphasizing that he was a former law enforcement official, he asked a reporter to leave.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article mischaracterized the origin of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch\u2019s partnership with two other men to buy a 40-acre property. Judge Gorsuch proposed the arrangement, not his father.Charlie Savage reported from Washington, and Julie Turkewitz from Granby, Colo.

{"Headline": "Ignoring Diplomacy\u2019s Past and Its Future Promise", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialOne of America\u2019s greatest contributions to international peace resulted from a historic investment in foreign aid. After defeating Fascism in World War II, Washington channeled billions of dollars into the war-torn nations of Europe and Japan, helping transform them into economic success stories and vital democratic allies.That\u2019s a lesson worth remembering as President Trump tries to slash the State Department and its foreign aid programs by about 30 percent in the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, while raising Pentagon spending by 10 percent. The cruelest cuts may be a reported $1 billion reduction for the United Nations\u2019 peacekeeping operations and programs that care for needy children.Mr. Trump seems to assume that national greatness comes from the barrel of a gun \u2014 he wants to expand the fleet of Navy ships and the nuclear arsenal \u2014 rather than from a combination of military might and \u201csoft power\u201d tools. One such tool is the example America sets by adhering to constitutional principles, the rule of law and human rights. Others involve pursuing smart diplomatic engagement and initiatives, including nuclear agreements and disaster assistance for some of the poorest countries.Diplomacy doesn\u2019t always prevent war, Syria being one example, but war becomes far more likely if there are not enough diplomats to work with other countries to resolve disagreements. Compelling examples of diplomacy working include the 2015 deal that is preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; the 1995 Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnia War; and the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty. Other examples include several treaties that committed America and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals significantly. American diplomats have strengthened alliances, built new partnerships with countries like Cuba and Myanmar, promoted democracy so that countries are less likely to go to war with one another and created jobs by helping to open overseas markets to American business.American interests are also advanced by helping other countries become more stable. A health program begun by President George W. Bush helped check the spread of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and then was used to stop an Ebola epidemic in West Africa during the Obama administration. Other programs aid refugees; finance improvements in sanitation and water, primary education, energy and counterterrorism; and underwrite exchanges between foreign students and professionals and their American counterparts.The question is whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson, businessmen unfamiliar with the ethos of public service, will listen to more experienced voices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Budget Is Heavy Lift, Even for G.O.P. Congress", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 After eight years of chafing under President Barack Obama\u2019s fiscal priorities, congressional Republicans were longing for a budget proposal that did the two things that have become the party\u2019s mantra: Make broad cuts to federal spending and reduce the federal deficit.Instead, President Trump sent them a budget even many Republicans found difficult to love.To fulfill a campaign promise to leave Social Security and Medicare \u2014 which represent more than 40 percent of annual federal spending \u2014 untouched while constructing an expensive border wall, Mr. Trump went after a relatively small pot of money, discretionary spending, goring Republicans\u2019 pet programs in the process.Mr. Trump ran as a populist and stacked his cabinet like a conservative, yet he delivered a budget that in many respects is neither. The result is deeply unsatisfying for many in his party, which has been yearning for a unified government to finally make major changes to entitlement programs to bring the deficit in line.\u201cThis is a good budget if you want to spend your time fighting small fires,\u201d said former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who as the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee spent years trying to rally lawmakers to do the hard work to balance the budget. \u201cIt\u2019s a statement of policy, which is legitimate, that the government is too big,\u201d Mr. Gregg said. \u201cAs a practical matter, it does not affect the big issues that drive that.\u201dThe president\u2019s plan would make deep cuts in most areas to pay for increased military spending.Congress could have eliminated every penny of domestic spending at its annual discretion this year, and it would not have balanced the federal budget, according to Congressional Budget Office projections, much less rid the nation of its nearly $20 trillion in government debt \u2014 which Mr. Trump told voters he could do easily in eight years.It is precisely what conservatives have wanted to control.\u201cThe fact is that until the president and Congress are willing to address the real drivers of our debt, Medicare and Social Security, we will be complicit in shackling future generations with the financial burden of our own lack of discipline,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cThat is not a legacy I want to leave.\u201dMick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, who as a member of the House was one of the biggest deficit hawks, was confronted with the budget\u2019s failure to deal with the debt in a news conference with reporters on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s a fair question,\u201d he said. \u201cI would just suggest to you it\u2019s not the right time for the question. The budget blueprint, again, does not deal with the debt. It even doesn\u2019t even deal with the deficit. It is simply the first part of the appropriations process.\u201dThe budget document represents a broad-brush aspiration for Mr. Trump, leaving it to the House and Senate appropriations committees to do all the painful work, like finding a way to pay for a wall along the Mexican border that the White House wants.The president\u2019s plan would cut spending for many agencies to historically low levels.But trying to pass appropriations bills with large cuts to popular domestic programs seems almost impossible in both chambers, especially the Senate, leading Congress on another path to short-term spending measures that Republicans have long wanted to escape.The Congressional Budget Office foresees a federal deficit for the 2018 fiscal year of $487 billion, rising steadily from there until it reaches $1 trillion in 2023. But that is driven all by an aging population, rising health care costs and rising interest payments from the escalating debt.Projected declines in discretionary spending under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would be more than swallowed by rising payments to Social Security and Medicare because the population aged 65 and older is expected to grow by 39 percent through 2027. In that time, spending on people 65 and older who receive Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and military and federal civilian retirement income will rise from 37 percent of federal spending in 2017 to 45 percent in 10 years.And many of his proposed cuts are at odds with congressional priorities.\u201cThe president proposes and Congress disposes,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican appropriator from Pennsylvania. \u201cWe can\u2019t finance a defense buildup entirely on the back of domestic, nondefense spending. It\u2019s not realistic and unfair.\u201dIt even takes an ax to programs that are important to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, by proposing cuts in funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission and some air service that would probably eliminate two airports in his state.Mr. McConnell on Thursday went in search of a silver lining.\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see an increased focus on our national security and veterans budgets,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThese are positive steps in the right direction. I look forward to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring.\u201dMr. Trump is hardly alone in putting forth a budget dismissed by his own party. Mr. Obama pushed the idea of changing the way the inflation rate was calculated to slow the growth of big programs like Social Security, a proposal many Democrats opposed. President George W. Bush pressed to partially privatize Social Security, and many Republicans disliked that idea.But it is striking to read Mr. Trump\u2019s budget and see clearly mixed messages from the opening pages delivered by Mr. Mulvaney, who praised the budget as a debt crusher, and from Mr. Trump, who emphasized his increases in military spending.Those contradictions are among the many reasons that even members of Mr. Trump\u2019s party see his budget more as a mere suggestion than an edict.\u201cHistorically, presidential budgets do not fare well with Congress,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.Advertisement"}

Surrounded by senior White House advisers, Ms. Trump controlled most of the discussion, several attendees said.The meeting was one of many ways that Ms. Trump has been working with Republicans to advance a policy agenda all her own, one focused on helping young mothers. The effort has placed her in an exceptional, and possibly sticky, position \u2014 working on issues traditionally championed by Democrats by forging alliances with Republican women.In the process, Ms. Trump has quickly gotten an education in the art of the possible in Washington, where efforts on the issues dear to her have been stymied in recent years by partisan disagreements and general inertia.While Ms. Trump has been a frequent presence in the Trump White House \u2014 she has had a place at the table as President Trump has met with diplomats, chief executives and government officials \u2014 she is now taking an active role in the fight to reduce the crippling costs of child care. During the campaign, she persuaded her father to make a vow to do just that.She has gone to Capitol Hill to meet with female lawmakers to discuss child care issues and invited two Republican senators, Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Susan Collins of Maine, to sit at her table at the White House for a lunch this past week to honor women. She recently met with Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, to talk about modern-day slavery.\u201cShe has the ear of the president,\u201d said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, who attended the White House meeting with other Republican women. \u201cShe\u2019s a young mother, she wants to help young mothers in the work force, and I think she can be a good voice here.\u201dMs. Trump, 35, faces a difficult challenge as she tries to use that voice to span the deep divides between Republicans and Democrats on these issues. Republican women in Congress, who often work at the fringe of their party on federal child care matters, have still found themselves shunned by Democrats who dismiss their child care and income equality proposals as insufficient.In the past, Ms. Trump was aligned with people like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, who currently has a bill that would provide workers with up to 12 weeks of partial income when they take time off to have babies or take care of sick members of their family. That proposal, rejected by most Republicans, would be paid for through employer payroll contribution increases.The Trump administration\u2019s proposal originally focused only on birth mothers and would have been paid for through savings found in the unemployment insurance program. Both parties found that plan untenable because its beneficiaries were too limited and its funding was too uncertain.Now, Trump administration officials are contemplating a plan that would provide both mothers and fathers \u2014 adoptive and biological \u2014 with a leave that would be financed in another way, possibly through the tax increase preferred by Democrats or another option to be determined with Congress.The administration also wants to promote dependent care savings accounts that allow up to $2,000 in tax-free contributions annually for qualified child care and elderly care expenses, with a 50 percent federal match on the first $1,000 in contributions for low-income earners.Another plan would expand the child and dependent care credit, increasing the per-child benefit and allowing the benefit for up to four children. It would also make the credit refundable for low-income households, meaning the government would write a check for the amount beyond what a taxpayer owes in federal income taxes. An increase in the child tax credit for pre-school-age children is also under consideration. These benefits would not be available to upper-income households.Perhaps the toughest test is changing the tax code to ease the burdens on two-income families. As Ms. Trump enters the legislative fray, she hopes to influence not only child care policies that the federal government has avoided, but also the impending debate over tax reform.\u201cOne of the important elements of this plan revises the current tax code to eliminate the disincentive for re-entry into the work force,\u201d Ms. Trump said.She continued, \u201cWomen, who are disproportionately most likely to step out of the work force to provide unpaid care, often lack the ability to return to work because it can be hard to rationalize stepping back into the work force and incurring the enormous expense of child care when you are also making less than the primary earner in your home yet taxed at the highest household rate.\u201d\u201cIvanka is putting these issues on the table,\u201d said Mark Weinberger, the chief executive of EY, a professional services firm, and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum.Republicans have long preferred more modest measures. Ms. Fischer, along with Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, has a child care bill that would create a tax credit for businesses that offer at least two weeks of paid family leave per year, in hourly or daily increments. That is intended to favor hourly workers.Employers would receive a nonrefundable tax credit equal to 25 percent of what they pay employees during their leave, up to $3,000 per worker. The two have had trouble advancing the bill because of a lack of interest among Republicans and criticism from Democrats that it is too limited.\u201cIf Republicans think they can get away with offering workers window dressing in response to huge problems like the astronomically high cost of child care or the fact that so many parents still can\u2019t take a day to care for a sick child without losing pay, they are sorely mistaken,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.Republican women hope they can have a meeting of the minds with Ms. Trump.\u201cSenator King and I are both really pragmatic about this,\u201d Ms. Fischer said. \u201cWe need to address this problem in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt other families. For mom-and-pop-type businesses, it is harder for them to offer paid leave.\u201dLawmakers are curious: Will Ms. Trump move toward Democrats who have long pushed more far-reaching plans, or cotton to the possible?Mr. King said Ms. Trump could be a bridge to the middle. \u201cMy interest is in getting something done that will help people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be as far as some people would like \u2014 that\u2019s called a compromise.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Rebels Gone, Colombia Jumps Into the Pot Industry", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byCORINTO, Colombia \u2014 For years, Blanca Riveros has had the same routine: After fixing breakfast and taking her son to school, she heads home to a large plastic trash bag filled with marijuana.She trims the plants and gets them ready for Colombian drug traffickers. After school, her son helps cut more.\u201cHow am I supposed to feed my family?\u201d Ms. Riveros asked.She now has an unlikely option: growing marijuana with the government\u2019s blessing instead.A Canadian company called PharmaCielo, with the government\u2019s approval, is working to produce the drug legally in Colombia and is looking to hire.Colombia has received billions of dollars in American aid to eradicate the drug trade. But in the coming weeks, the government says, it will begin processing licenses for a small number of companies, including PharmaCielo, under a 2015 law that allows the cultivation of medical marijuana.In places like Mexico and Afghanistan, crop substitution programs have typically involved coaxing farmers to switch from illicit crops to mainstream agriculture. Poppies are replaced with wheat; coca leaf with coffee.\u201cHere we have an entirely new opportunity,\u201d said Alejandro Gaviria, Colombia\u2019s health minister, whose agency is issuing the licenses.Mr. Gaviria said that decades of efforts by Colombia to move drug cultivators to other crops had hit a wall: The peasants made less money, rural development moved backward, and some farmers simply returned to drug cultivation.\u201cIt\u2019s been a complete failure,\u201d he said.Now, Mr. Gaviria argued, legal drugs could become an important economic tool for postconflict Colombia.The logic now: What if those profits were put into the hands of the government and peasants instead?There is also a third actor that will profit greatly from the newly legal business, Canada\u2019s PharmaCielo. Others, including a Colombian company, are seeking licenses, but PharmaCielo is the most prominent in pursuing cultivation in areas once controlled by the rebels.Formed in 2014 as the new law was taking shape, PharmaCielo is already testing strains of cannabis more potent than those the rebels ever controlled. Its directors include former executives of Philip Morris and Bayer. The company sees a future in which the legal drug industry is controlled by the same kind of multinational corporations that the Marxist-Leninist guerrilla movement aimed to drive from the country.Here in Corinto, the company has already signed a deal with a workers\u2019 cooperative to provide labor, with plans to eventually move in with its own greenhouses, plants and fertilizer.\u201cThe peasants were forced to produce these plants,\u201d says Federico Cock-Correa, who heads the Colombian subsidiary of PharmaCielo and promises to pay his growers far more than what they earned during the war.The company\u2019s Colombian headquarters are on rolling farmlands outside Medell\u00edn, best known for the kingpin who ruled them for decades, Pablo Escobar.Mr. Cock-Correa, however, is new to the drug business, coming to cannabis after a long career exporting cut chrysanthemums, which he says grow in a similar way as marijuana, to the United States.Mr. Cock-Correa swung open a padlocked door to his facility and showed off a kind of industrial future for Colombian drugs. Vast greenhouses. Organic fertilizers. A test area of 19 marijuana plants, barely four months old, some of which had grown taller than him.For PharmaCielo, the first challenge was lobbying to change the laws in Colombia, the recipient of $10 billion in American aid over the past two decades to fight the drug trade. The Colombian government will continue its eradication efforts for crops like coca leaf, which is used to make cocaine, and for marijuana grown in violation of the new law.But Mr. Cock-Correa, who counts the former president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, among his neighbors, said government officials were fascinated by the idea of using legal, medical cannabis as a tool for development once the rebels were out of the picture. The 2015 law allows medical marijuana cultivation for the domestic market and the export of medical marijuana products like oils and creams.In another part of the country, the Central Andes mark the rugged homeland of Colombia\u2019s indigenous Nasa people. For years, the Nasa were terrorized by the rebels, who not only taxed the marijuana trade, but also extorted from legal businesses in towns like Torib\u00edo.Mauricio Caso, Torib\u00edo\u2019s deputy mayor, recalled a Saturday morning in 2011 when the rebels planted a car bomb in a bus that passed a crowded market. Five people were killed and dozens of buildings were damaged. The engine of the bus landed in the church.\u201cWe will never forgive what they did in Torib\u00edo,\u201d Mr. Caso said.He was speaking to Mr. Cock-Correa, who had traveled to the town to make his medical marijuana pitch, promising jobs and development. But while Mr. Caso was pleased to have the rebels gone, he seemed skeptical of Mr. Cock-Correa, too.\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is we don\u2019t go 500 years backward to the times where indigenous people were working for outsiders and marginalized,\u201d Mr. Caso said.\u201cWe felt the conflict, too, with our own flesh,\u201d said Mr. Cock-Correa, changing the subject to more recent history.\u201cWe Nasa walk slowly but safely,\u201d Mr. Caso replied. \u201cYou men from Medell\u00edn tend to be crafty and fast.\u201dNot all local leaders were as cool to PharmaCielo. Edward Garc\u00eda, the mayor of Corinto, estimates that two-thirds of his town of 32,000 people depend on cannabis for a living.\u201cThat people can even pay their taxes is because they are growing marijuana,\u201d he said.The prospect of moving to any other crop gives growers in this area chills. Who would buy tomatoes when there are plenty on the market already?Elmer Orozco tried planting them about eight years ago and discovered that, unlike with marijuana, which goes to international markets, the only market he had access to for his tomatoes was the one downtown. Buyers offered him about 13 cents per kilogram of his tomatoes.Mr. Orozco went back to marijuana and its high prices.\u201cOther agriculture isn\u2019t profitable here,\u201d he said.But Ms. Riveros, the mother who trims marijuana plants, says the profits of the illegal trade have fallen since the FARC stood down, by more than half. Experts say the peacetime market has been flooded with cannabis that can move out of rebel territory more easily now that the rebels do not control it.Her hopes now rest with PharmaCielo. \u201cIt would be a miracle for us,\u201d she said.But for now she still cuts cannabis for the mafia groups that come by Corinto.She pulled out a half-filled sack and started trimming, using scissors with an index finger that had grown crooked after years of the same work. Her son, 8, sat next to her, watching Colombian show horses on YouTube, using a wireless router they had bought with the marijuana money.At one point, prospective clients pulled up in a car to her small adobe home. Ms. Riveros pulled out a plastic bag with trimmed cannabis.\u201cIt will be much more technical with the company,\u201d she said, referring to PharmaCielo.It was getting to be evening. Ms. Riveros strolled through a field of her own plants, then wandered over to an oven in a shed where long cannabis branches were hanging to dry from the ceiling.As the sun set, the growers in the village were beginning to turn on the lights above their plants, plot by plot. Before long, the entire hillside seemed lit up. The other mountains were, too. The lights of the high-rises of Cali shimmered in the far distance.\u201cIsn\u2019t it all just beautiful?\u201d Ms. Riveros asked.Ezra Kaplan contributed reporting from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Republicans Are Battling Republicans on Obamacare Repeal", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are rarely as exercised as when they are fighting with themselves.And as the House debates how to best dismantle the Affordable Care Act, a familiar array of interest groups with deep pockets, incensed talk radio hosts and online agitators is again assuming its posture of aggression toward the House Republican leadership.Political groups backed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and other powerful players on the right, such as Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, have come out quickly and strongly against the bill. Some have threatened to punish lawmakers by docking their conservative ratings on the influential \u201cscorecards\u201d they distribute to voters. Activists are already swarming Capitol Hill and demanding that Congress take a harder line and pass a repeal measure that would leave no trace of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI feel lied to,\u201d said Anna Beavon Gravely, the deputy state director of the North Carolina chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed group that is funding a grass-roots push against Republicans in Congress who want to stop short of an outright repeal.\u201cWe trusted you because you said you were going to do something about this. And this is not it. Not even close,\u201d she added as she prepared to set out for the offices of North Carolina lawmakers with other activists from her state.The displeasure is forcing an uncomfortable reckoning in the Republican Party much earlier and in a much more disruptive way than many think is constructive. And it has many conservatives asking why \u2014 now that they control both houses of Congress and the White House and have remained largely united so far \u2014 they are picking a fight with each other.The criticism from the right has grown so harsh that President Trump asked leaders of several conservative groups in an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday to tone it down. He was especially troubled, one participant said, by the comparisons of the plan to \u201cObamacare lite,\u201d which he said was inaccurate and harmful to their shared cause of gutting the current law.One senior White House official described the meeting as \u201ctough.\u201d Referring to the president, the official said: \u201cHe listened. They vented.\u201dAfter the meeting, the White House appeared more confident about the prospects in the House for the health care overhaul. In a meeting with conservative leaders in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he anticipated the most trouble in the Senate, where Republican moderates and conservatives are opposing the plan for different reasons. He said he was prepared to pressure holdout senators by having the kind of stadium-style rallies he had during his presidential campaign.Unified government was supposed to eliminate some of the infighting that plagued the Republicans during the Obama years, when the party\u2019s right flank brought down a House speaker, defeated a House majority leader and blocked another majority leader\u2019s ascent. Instead, it is underlining the difficulties of running Washington now that their party bears full responsibility.\u201cFor a while, it did seem like Trump\u2019s victory had transcended the old political battles,\u201d said Matt Lewis, a conservative author, who added that the fighting was doubly odd because the repeal was not an issue central to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration- and jobs-themed campaign. \u201cThis is not why people elected Donald Trump. And yet here we are.\u201dMaps comparing tax credits under the Affordable Care act and those in the plan House Republicans recently released across groups of incomes and ages.As they find themselves sudden targets of a well-organized and well-financed opposition from within, some Republicans are beginning to question whether the squabbling is ultimately self-defeating. And their doubts raise a new question for this Republican faction that has been mocked as the \u201cParty of No\u201d: Can they ever get to yes?\u201cI fully respect people on the outside \u2014 who don\u2019t have to take a vote or produce an outcome \u2014 who strive for perfect,\u201d said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, one of the Republicans who found activists in their offices this week. Perfect, he said, is never as attainable as people think. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to get good here.\u201dStopping government-mandated health care has been a cause unifying conservatives since Mr. Obama began talking about it as a presidential candidate nine years ago. Perhaps no other issue created as much energy among conservative voters, helping Republicans make historic gains in Congress as they railed against the law as an egregious government overreaching into a vast part of the economy.But differences over how exactly to unravel the Affordable Care Act have long divided Republicans, even when the stakes were low and they knew that whatever they passed in Congress would be vetoed by Mr. Obama. In 2013, differences within the Republican Party over defunding it led to a 16-day government shutdown.Back then, the fault lines in the debate were largely the same: hard-line conservatives butting up against the party leadership, which they accused of not acting aggressively enough.But as much as the squabbling seems the same, there is one crucial difference: They are firing with real bullets now.A comparison of the House Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare and the current law.\u201cWe\u2019re on the hook this time,\u201d said Representative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, who is part of the group of conservatives pushing for an outright repeal. \u201cThis one counts.\u201dThat they are firing some of those bullets at one another seems to be less of a concern the more conservative you are.Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, an opponent of the House bill who along with Mr. Brat is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, the driving force on Capitol Hill behind the resistance, said that any Republicans who will not vote to fully repeal the law will not be keeping a promise they made to voters. \u201cAnd they can go back to their districts and explain to the American people why they lied,\u201d he said.Conservatives see many of the same problems in the Republican leadership plan today that bothered them about the Democrats\u2019 2010 health care bill: It extends a taxpayer-funded subsidy to help individuals buy insurance; though it revokes the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that nearly all Americans have insurance, it replaces the mandate with a new penalty if a consumer buys insurance after letting coverage lapse; it was negotiated largely without consulting the rank and file; and, they insist, its benefits could go toward people who should not receive them, like undocumented immigrants.Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, echoed a concern that many conservative activists have voiced about not being briefed or consulted on the plan. \u201cIt goes a long way when you hear people out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are a lot of natural allies that this caught by surprise as much as it did Democrats.\u201dThe unhappiness on the right could be especially worrisome for Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose status as a favorite target of the conservative base seemed to fade in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election.Now, many conservatives appear willing to reopen the wounds of old leadership fights. Some of them have already taken to mocking the repeal plan with what they consider to be the most damning of pejoratives \u2014 not \u201cTrumpcare,\u201d as Democrats call it, but \u201cRyancare.\u201dEmmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pursuing Tax, Bill de Blasio Embraces Snowball\u2019s Chance in Albany", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byFor almost two years, Mayor Bill de Blasio has been arguing that Albany should allow New York City to levy a new tax on home sales above $2 million.It has not worked out that way.The State Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Republican, has called the idea a \u201cnon-starter.\u201dLikewise, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has seemed uninterested in helping out Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat. \u201cThat proposal was made in January,\u201d the governor said on Monday. \u201cIt never went anywhere in January and it hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. de Blasio has persevered, eagerly playing the snowball to Albany\u2019s hell.He has dismissed those who say it cannot get through the state capital, and compared it to universal prekindergarten, one of his signature initiatives as mayor, which initially met resistance in Albany. But whereas that effort ultimately succeeded, the main sticking point was in fact a new tax on high-income earners that Mr. de Blasio wanted to levy, to pay for it. The tax component quickly fell by the wayside, but not before the mayor\u2019s stubborn insistence, still near the outset of his term, set him permanently on the wrong foot with Mr. Cuomo and Republicans in the State Senate.Building a coalition in support of tax increases now could also help offset what are expected to be deep cuts in federal funding to the city and state when President Trump and the Republican Congress enact their budget this year.\u201cThe $15 minimum wage was once declared dead on arrival,\u201d said Bill Lipton, the New York State director of the Working Families Party, which backs the mayor\u2019s effort. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the next few days or over the coming months, working families are going to demand that new taxes on the rich be part of the solution to Trump.\u201dMr. de Blasio was able to count a win on Tuesday in another area of housing policy: a state court judge preserved a freeze on rents in regulated apartments that had been championed by the mayor and opposed by landlords.Mr. Cuomo, for his part, is negotiating with State Senate Republicans to extend a tax on those earning $1 million or more; if it were to lapse, the state would see its revenue fall by about $4 billion over two years. But the governor has not been open to tax increases. \u201cI don\u2019t want to raise taxes,\u201d he said on Tuesday.The median price of a home affected by the mayor\u2019s proposed tax would be $3.4 million, according to the Independent Budget Office. This is not so much the price range in the new residential towers high above midtown; it is closer to that of the Queens home that once belonged to Mr. Trump\u2019s family that was sold this month. Under the mayor\u2019s proposed tax, that sale, for $2.14 million would have generated about $3,500 in new revenue.Along the way the mayor has managed to step on the toes of a natural ally on the issue: older citizens.In Albany last week. Mr. de Blasio said that AARP, the advocacy group for people 50 and older, was helping to lobby legislators for his tax proposal. He repeated the assertion at his New York news conference.But the group later put out a statement saying it was not true, and while it favored the goal of rent relief for older tenants, it had not taken a position on how that relief should be financed. In his weekly radio appearance on WNYC last Friday, Mr. de Blasio acknowledged the flub, saying, \u201cI certainly will take responsibility for my team if we misunderstood that particular nuance in their position.\u201dBrad Lander, a Democratic City Councilman who often stands shoulder to shoulder with the mayor, lamented on Tuesday the stranglehold that the state legislature has on many issues affecting the city, saying of the proposed tax: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a chance of passing and that\u2019s been clear from Day 1.\u201dAsked why the mayor was spending so much time pushing an idea that not even his allies thought was viable, Mr. Lander shrugged and said, \u201cPolitics?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio Stymied in Attempt to Pay Legal Fees With Donations", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byMr. de Blasio has said he does not have the personal wealth to cover the bills, which most likely stretch into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. And the mayor has vowed to use no public money to pay for the lawyers from Kramer Levin who represented him personally in the matter.But his solution, a legal-defense fund that would accept donations, suffered a blow on Wednesday when the city\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board ruled that donations to such a fund would be treated as gifts and capped in most instances at $50.While the precise amount of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s legal debts was not immediately clear, the $11.6 million in city contracts to pay the outside counsel hired by the Law Department suggests that the board\u2019s ruling could severely hamstring Mr. de Blasio\u2019s attempts to raise money for the fund. For example, partners at Debevoise & Plimpton, which provided legal services to the city in the investigations, were contracted at $850 an hour.At that rate, the mayor would have to raise money from 17 people to cover an hour of legal work.\u201cLegal expenses can burden public servants,\u201d the conflicts board said in its ruling, known as an advisory opinion. \u201cHowever, contributions to legal defense funds to defray those legal expenses must be viewed as gifts to those public servants.\u201d The board has the power to impose fines if its guidance is not followed.The mayor said Wednesday that he would be open to changing the law to explicitly allow legal defense contributions larger than $50, but that first he wanted to discuss the ruling with the board.\u201cThis is an initial view from the board,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to have more dialogue to work through and show other examples of what\u2019s happened in the past.\u201dAsked about the prospect of legislation on legal defense funds, a spokeswoman for the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, said only that the council was \u201creviewing the advisory opinion.\u201d A spokesman for the State Assembly speaker, Carl E.

In some cases, the practice has transmitted herpes from mohel to infant.The mayor had called the news conference to herald a drop in the city jail population \u2014 down 18 percent over all and 23 percent on Rikers Island, he said \u2014 and discuss a $10 million city investment to provide temporary employment to inmates leaving city jails after serving a sentence there.But the timing, less than an hour after the conflicts board issued its ruling, ensured that there would be several questions on the legal defense fund, which has not yet been set up. Mr. de Blasio did not explicitly say whether he had requested the ruling by the board, and Wayne G. Hawley, the board\u2019s general counsel, declined to say who had asked for it.\u201cThe decision speaks for itself,\u201d Mr. Hawley said.But it divided some election lawyers. Jerry H. Goldfeder, a special counsel at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, called it a \u201cstrict and rigorous interpretation of the ethics law.\u201dSarah Steiner, another election lawyer, was more critical. \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculously low amount of money,\u201d she said, noting that the ruling applied to other city officials beyond the mayor. \u201cIt\u2019s an ugly position for him to have gotten himself into, and now it affects everybody else.\u201dBeyond any legal defense fund, Mr. de Blasio could use money that was raised for a 2013 Democratic primary runoff that did not ultimately occur \u2014 though much of it has already been spent. Funds in the runoff account are governed by state election law and can be spent on legal fees related to criminal matters (something barred for other types of campaign accounts that are subject to city law).A campaign filing in January showed that $212,070 had been paid since last August to two law firms. A spokesman for the campaign, Dan Levitan, said the firms represented people associated with the campaign on matters related to the state and federal investigations, not the mayor. The runoff account contained $117,105 as of early January. Mr. Levitan would not say if any funds had since been spent on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s personal lawyers.The conflicts board also left open one method for the mayor to raise unlimited funds: a donation from family or a \u201cclose friend.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to meet that close friend,\u201d the mayor joked when asked about the possibility. \u201cI don\u2019t know of that person.\u201dWilliam Neuman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cautious Optimism in Brazil as Appetite Returns for I.P.O.s", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The three-year drought of initial public offerings in Brazil is finally starting to dissipate, giving hope to investors from S\u00e3o Paulo to New York and Boston. Some expect that more than a dozen deals will be filed by the end of the year.Among them is the trading debut of XP Investimentos, a 15-year-old financial services firm, backed by the American private equity firm General Atlantic. XP Investimentos hired JPMorgan Chase in the past few weeks and is looking to go public by the end of July. In addition, the dental and health care insurer Grupo NotreDame Interm\u00e9dica, owned by Bain Capital, recently picked Morgan Stanley to work on a possible I.P.O. this year.Companies that had to cancel or postpone past attempts are giving it another go as well.On Thursday the Brazilian e-commerce company Netshoes, which is 37.8 percent owned by Tiger Global Management and first considered an I.P.O. over four years ago, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bradesco BBI, Allen & Company and Jefferies are the underwriters.Azul, a Brazilian airline started by JetBlue\u2019s founder, once again filed for an I.P.O. in February after abandoning two previous attempts.Two other companies have already debuted: the car rental company Movida and the health care company Instituto Hermes Pardini, raising a combined $425 million for the year through Tuesday. Though Movida had to slightly lower its price, and another company, Unidas, which is in the same industry, had to scrap its I.P.O. plans last month, that is the most money raised over the same period since 2011, according to the data firm Dealogic.Renato Ejnisman, the managing director of Banco Bradesco BBI, the investment bank arm of Banco Bradesco, said more than 10 companies were considering stock offerings this year. Moreover, they come from diverse sectors including consumer goods, infrastructure and utilities.\u201cWe have not had such a level of activity in the last four years,\u201d Mr. Ejnisman said.Others share that sentiment. Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Ita\u00fa BBA, estimated that 10 to 15 I.P.O.s could be held in Brazil this year.If that prediction were to come true, the number of offerings this year would dwarf that of the previous three years, when there was only one I.P.O. a year. It would be on par with 2010 and 2011, which each had 11 I.P.O.s. Since 2010, the best year was 2013, which had 13. The deal activity is not off the charts, however. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a selective market,\u201d Mr. Ejnisman said.The thaw is partly because of investors\u2019 pent-up demand after a period of economic downturn. \u201cThe market has been starving for equity for so long,\u201d said Patricia Moraes, the head of banking in Brazil for JPMorgan, who, like the other bankers quoted in this article, would speak only about the state of the market and not about any specific I.P.O.Brazil\u2019s economy contracted by 3.6 percent last year, and shrank by 3.8 percent in 2015.The impeachment remains controversial, the motives dubious, and President Michel Temer, who took over for Ms. Rousseff after helping engineer her fall, is highly unpopular. Yet the finance sector credits his government with some changes.Inflation has fallen, and Brazil\u2019s currency has gained value relative to others. The Central Bank lowered its benchmark interest rate multiple times over the past several months.\u201cOn the macro front, the country is on the right path with the right team handling the economy,\u201d said Fabio Nazari, a partner and head of equity capital markets at BTG Pactual.The activity means more business for investment banks in the region. In January and February, JPMorgan was involved in four equity offerings in Latin America, two of them in Brazil. In those, it raised $2.7 billion with over $12 billion in demand, Ms. Moraes said.That amount alone is already 26 percent of the $10.4 billion raised in all equity offerings in Latin America in 2016, according to Dealogic.The next several months will determine how much optimism is warranted.JPMorgan is leading a group of banks, including BTG Pactual, Ita\u00fa BBA and Morgan Stanley, on the anticipated 4 billion reais ($1.3 billion) stock debut for XP Investimentos. It is expected to start its presentations for potential investors in May.Edemir Pinto, president of BM&FBovespa, said in February that by the end of the year, he expected about 17 companies to raise approximately 25 billion reais (about $8.1 billion) in equity offerings on the S\u00e3o Paulo exchange.Uncertainty still looms, however, accounting for the cautious optimism.While the S\u00e3o Paulo market surged last year, the real economy has still lagged far behind. Most growth estimates for this year are under 1 percent. Banco Safra\u2019s head economist, Carlos Kawall, forecasts 0 percent.Brazil\u2019s most recent unemployment rate, measured over a three-month period ending in January, rose to 12.6 percent, up from 9.5 percent one year ago. Real wages continue to fall.Some believe this may worsen. \u201cThe labor market is likely to deteriorate further as the economy is yet to show signs of minimal positive growth,\u201d Alberto Ramos of Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note last month.Moreover, any enduring progress in Brazil\u2019s fiscal health depends on major reform of its pension or social security system. Until some of these uncertainties are resolved, investors might be wary of overexposing themselves to the Brazilian market.\u201cI don\u2019t think that most foreign investors will start diverting a large chunk of their resources into Brazil until we have the social security reform approved and especially until we start showing some growth in G.D.P.,\u201d said Mr. Ejnisman of Banco Bradesco BBI.The corruption investigation, now starting its fourth year, has Brazil\u2019s political class on edge, in particular Mr. Temer and his allies in Congress.\u201cThe biggest domestic risk is the political scenario,\u201d said Mr. Greenlees of Ita\u00fa BBA.Ms. Moraes of JPMorgan said one of her biggest concerns was \u201cthe political volatility in Brazil, which could delay investment decisions by companies and investors.\u201dStill, she and others said recent developments offered reasons to be hopeful, in particular the return of foreign investors to recent stock offerings.\u201cNow it\u2019s a more balanced demand,\u201d said Mr. Greenlees of Ita\u00fa BBA. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some respectable foreign investors that were not in the market last year come back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When it comes, the answer may feel somewhat contrived, but on the way to it readers will enjoy this full-bodied novel about a family of vintners.A haunted family manse overlooking the majestic moors of the British countryside, an orphaned young woman at the mercy of heartless relatives, a Jekyll-and-Hyde doctor \u2014 these are among the strikingly familiar elements of Ward\u2019s debut novel. A Gothic tale that spans 80 years, from 1839 to 1919, \u201cThe Girl From Rawblood\u201d chronicles the downward spiral of the Villarcas, a Spanish-British clan whose ancestral home, Rawblood, is stalked by a ghost, known only as \u201cher,\u201d who rains misery on this benighted family.Under Rawblood\u2019s roof, Mary Villarca flies into rages and stabs out her own eyes with a poker. (Found on the floor beside her, \u201cthe tip still glowed red.\u201d) Her son, Alonso, becomes \u201caddled with opiates,\u201d and his daughter, Iris, the novel\u2019s central narrator, impales him with his own hypodermic needle during a bloody fight. Even the family dog dies of \u201cfear.\u201d Alonso, once a budding immunologist like his idol and contemporary Pasteur, likens \u201cher\u201d to a disease. As he explains it, \u201cshe travels in our blood, passed down.\u201d She is \u201ca biological inheritance, as much as a spiritual one.\u201dBlood-borne pathogens, both real and metaphoric, figure prominently in \u201cRawblood.\u201d The most interesting chapters are set in the 1880s, a time when superstitions about the connection between physical and mental illness were giving way to the emergence of a \u201cbright landscape of science.\u201d If only \u201cRawblood\u201d cohered around the notion of illness as metaphor. Instead, the narrative rambles off to sunny Italy, then back to misty England, where Iris, heeding a message her father sends her in a dream, sets Rawblood afire.The novel is told from the perspectives of five characters: Iris Villarca, the last of the line; Charles Danforth, her maternal uncle; her mother, Meg Villarca; her grandmother, Mary Hopewell Villarca; and Tom Gilmore, a stableboy who serves as Iris\u2019s romantic interest. Adding to the confusion, the timeline zigzags back and forth over the decades for no apparent reason. In the end, this multigenerational saga strains not only the storytelling talents of the author but the patience of the reader.This first foray into adult fiction by a young adult novelist has a family tree worthy of Greek tragedy. Yates Roanoke, a Kansas oil baron and family patriarch, is a predator who has had sex with his sisters and female descendants, creating a monstrous genealogical heritage in which daughters might be nieces, sisters cousins and granddaughters actually daughters. As the narrative moves back and forth in time, the secrets of these tangled relationships are gradually revealed \u2014 most notably when Yates\u2019s adult granddaughter Allegra goes missing and he summons home her cousin Lane, who left Roanoke as a teenager, to help in the search.As vile as Yates\u2019s transgressions are, their repugnance pales in comparison to Engel\u2019s portrayal of the Roanoke girls, who seem to crave his attention. Even Lane, the novel\u2019s central narrator and seemingly the least emotionally scarred, fondly recalls the time when, as a teenager, she churned ice cream with Granddad as he gripped her thigh, his \u201cpinkie slipping under the edge of my jean shorts.\u201d Upon her return to Roanoke, Lane feels \u201cdismayed by how much my body wants to keep moving in his direction, sit beside him, rest my head on his shoulder.\u201d Worse, in a flashback chapter, Lane\u2019s mother, Camilla, pictures her organs \u201cturning black and rotten, even as she keened with pleasure\u201d during a \u201cdark, twisting horror show of love.\u201dThe novel\u2019s grotesquerie is somewhat mitigated by the banality of its prose.

{"Headline": "Trump Picks a Side: How Tax Credits Would Work in a G.O.P. Health Plan", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthMr. Trump did not go into detail on this subject, saying merely that \u201cwe should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits.\u201d Yet those words were a signal to Republicans fighting over two options about how the government should pay for health insurance.Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and the leaders of the House committees overseeing health care, want to fund health insurance with something called an advanceable, refundable tax credit. That functions sort of like a gift card; people can use it to buy health insurance regardless of their income.Another group, led by the conservative Republican Study Committee and the House Freedom Caucus, believes that insurance benefits should be funded through the more common tax deductions, which allow you to subtract an amount from your income before paying taxes. Tax deductions are most valuable for people in the highest tax brackets. They\u2019re less like a gift card, and more like a coupon.During the campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s official health plan called for allowing people to use a tax deduction to buy health insurance. This is a strategy embraced by many conservatives, who have said they dislike tax credits because they represent too much federal spending. They are right that deductions tend to be less costly: They apply only to people who itemize deductions on their tax returns; they pay out less to people whose tax rate is low.A 20-year-old would get a $2,000 tax credit to buy health insurance, while a 64-year-old would get $4,000. People could use the full amounts to buy health insurance, even if they paid no income taxes at all. (That bill is just a draft, of course; the final value of the tax credits could well change.)Obamacare also uses advanceable, refundable tax credits to help people buy health insurance. But those credits are calculated on a sliding scale, according to income. The goal is to make insurance affordable for lower-income Americans by limiting how much they can be asked to pay.But compared with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plan, his new embrace of tax credits is a step in the direction of progressivity. And it sets a marker in the fight among congressional Republicans, who remain divided about how much tax help the government should be providing for health care. To pass, the current Republican health plan will need to win over some conservatives who currently prefer deductions. Mr. Trump appears to have taken sides in that debate.Advertisement"}

Johann Rupert, chairman of the luxury group Richemont, told investors during a presentation last November that he wanted to see \u201cless gray men, less gray Frenchmen\u201d in its executive ranks, adding \u201cwe have too few women, we don\u2019t have enough diversity.\u201d The group has 11 watch and jewelry brands \u2014 all headed by men.That will change April 1, when Chabi Nouri becomes global chief executive of Piaget.Ms. Nouri, a Swiss national, joined Cartier in 1998 right out of the University of Fribourg, where she studied economics and marketing. She rose quickly through the ranks to become jewelry group manager at Cartier International in 2004, and left in 2009 to work as global head of brand for Vogue cigarettes at British American Tobacco.But she returned to the Richemont group in 2014 as Piaget\u2019s director of marketing, communications and heritage, and was named to her current job \u2014 international managing director of sales and marketing \u2014 in September. Here, Ms. Nouri discusses her industry and Piaget.There are very few women at the top in the luxury watch and jewelry industry. Do you think you\u2019re breaking a glass ceiling?I have personally never felt a ceiling and have always evolved within organizations that were and are willing to increase their diversity, which is fantastic because diversity, in my view, offers different perspectives, different filters and allows [us] to define more robust strategies. And the professional world definitely needs more diversity. I am very happy to represent that in a way.How has your career prepared you for the new position?I\u2019m very curious and I like to look at things with different filters, which is why I didn\u2019t really focus on one side of the business throughout my career. Instead, I did a lot of different jobs.When I joined Cartier in Switzerland, I started as a watch product manager, then I went to the headquarters [in Paris] and was in charge of merchandising for all the retail stores, cutting across all the brand\u2019s offerings. And then I went into retail, and was put in charge of boutique operations for half of the network [United States, emerging markets and a part of Europe]. I was also lucky enough to experience the fast-moving consumer goods business [at British American Tobacco] and developed my trade, finance and management skills.All of this has given me a multicultural and multicontext background, and I think it has helped me in the last few years and will help me in comprehending the complete environment. It has put me in a good position to understand all the different parts of the business I have to deal with.The announcement of your appointment mentioned you\u2019ve \u201calready had a strong impact\u201d at Piaget.It\u2019s really been about refocusing on our DNA and values and bringing forward the uniqueness of Piaget.We always had a fusion of sorts between jewelry and watches, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve found very interesting: The brand was not saying we\u2019re going to approach jewelry as jewelry, and watches as watches, it was always a fusion between the two worlds, which is very unique to Piaget. And this is really what my team and I wanted to focus on, and bring this back again to the surface.For women, historically, Piaget has also been about trying to find new ways to wear jewelry, with the sautoir watches, the cuff watches and bracelets, and so we\u2019ve brought those back, and recently we\u2019ve also introduced the ear cuffs. This is the pioneering side of Piaget, its more audacious side.I had a clear mission to balance our business and accelerate the development of our jewelry segment. So we decided to relaunch and focus on our jewelry icon [collection] Possession, and we are enjoying very successful results with that.Are you focusing more on the high end of the market?No, it\u2019s really about finding a balance between the haute joaillerie, the high-end exclusive world, and fine jewelry. They are complete different worlds, with different creations, different people working on these products and selling them, and different types of clients. So you need to engage clients via specific channels.For example, for high jewelry, it\u2019s more one-on-one in terms of engagement and communication, while for fine jewelry, it will be more about digital campaign: two completely distinct business models, low volume versus high volume.On the watch side, Piaget has been increasing its collaborations with artisans, bringing out collections with micro-mosaics, feathers and other unusual craftsmanship on dials. Do you see this continuing?Absolutely. Since the beginning we\u2019ve tried to work differently on the dials, and we\u2019ve been able to unleash our creativity because our ultrathin movements take less space.In the 1960s, the 9P ultrathin manual-winding caliber opened up all manner of possibility for ornamentation and color using hard stones like malachite, lapis lazuli, jade and tiger\u2019s-eye on the dials. What\u2019s interesting is that we\u2019ve reached out to artisans that were usually not working on dials and asked them to interpret their own work in a smaller space. And I think it has been exciting for both sides.Most recently, we worked with feather artists Nelly Saunier and Emilie Moutard-Martin, and we presented in January some new jewelry watches working with an artisan using an unusual gold lacework technique that she\u2019s developed.Last year, Piaget introduced its first steel model, the Polo S. What was the thinking?What is your vision for Piaget?The priority is really to raise the awareness of the rich assets of this maison. It has a very unique personality and we want to make that known much more. We have a very interesting balance between elegant and audacious creations, and going back to the origin and our DNA, it\u2019s a brand that has always been driven by a very positive energy, a shared joy and audacity. And that\u2019s really what we want to bring forward, what I called the sunny side of life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Currency Champ Lives South of the Border", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byStrategiesCan you guess which world currency has gained the most since Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration as president?Here\u2019s a clue.Of all major currencies, the one that has strengthened the most since Jan. 20, the day Mr. Trump became president, is the Mexican peso. In his inauguration speech, Mr. Trump pledged to \u201cbring back our jobs\u201d and \u201cbring back our borders,\u201d in veiled references to Mexico. Since that day, the Mexican peso has gained more than 15 percent.What\u2019s startling is that the peso served throughout the presidential campaign as a proxy for Mr. Trump\u2019s political fortunes. The connection isn\u2019t perfect, but the two have had a very close and extremely uncomfortable relationship. And at the moment, it has taken an unexpected turn.Recall that on the night of Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning election victory, the peso immediately took a brutal beating, plunging 12 percent against the dollar. That move was consistent with patterns throughout the presidential campaign. Whenever Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects rose, the peso\u2019s dived. Whenever he raised the volume on promises to build a towering wall on the Mexican border or to stamp out \u201cbad hombres\u201d or to crack down on immigration, the peso lost some of its value.That\u2019s why the data from the foreign exchange markets is so interesting. The peso isn\u2019t being battered these days. It has been getting much stronger.The peso may still be a proxy for the Trump presidency. If so, the foreign exchange rates may be telling us that the Trump administration\u2019s policies are no longer being viewed as quite so harmful to Mexico \u2014 and to other emerging markets.There are several possible explanations for this.For a start, now that some important members of the Trump administration are in place and beginning to get down to work, the statements of policy makers other than the president are turning out to be far less troubling than those of the president himself.He added, however, \u201cEven taking that into account, and given the other fundamentals of the Mexican economy, I think the peso is still undervalued.\u201d He also said that both the bank and the finance ministry are intent on stabilizing the peso. The central bank has raised interest rates in the last four meetings to 6.25 percent.Since Inauguration Day, against a basket of world currencies, the peso was the top performer, with a gain of 15.2 percent, according to Bloomberg. Since the beginning of the year, it was second, with a gain of about 7.3 percent compared to 7.5 percent for the South African rand.Other emerging-market currencies have fared well since the beginning of the year, too, and while the Mexican peso\u2019s rise may be the most striking, it didn\u2019t occur in isolation. The South Korean won, Taiwanese dollar and Brazilian real have had sizable gains, even though the United States Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates, a move that might have unnerved the currency markets.Of course, there is an intriguing possibility. The strong peso may reflect an apparent disarray in the Trump administration, a situation that could easily be reversed.During the campaign season, for example, the peso also surged. That happened in moments when Mr. Trump appeared to be weakest. On the evening of Sept. 26, for example, when Hillary Clinton performed particularly well in a debate and Mr. Trump performed poorly, the peso soared, along with Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index futures. Those moves were widely interpreted as an assessment of Mr. Trump\u2019s chances in the presidential election.The financial markets may well be voting now. But in at least one respect, finance is not like politics. The markets will vote again and again, thousands of times a day. The peso\u2019s ascendancy won\u2019t last forever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Monsanto Weed Killer Roundup Faces New Doubts on Safety in Unsealed Documents", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byThe reputation of Roundup, whose active ingredient is the world\u2019s most widely used weed killer, took a hit on Tuesday when a federal court unsealed documents raising questions about its safety and the research practices of its manufacturer, the chemical giant Monsanto.Roundup and similar products are used around the world on everything from row crops to home gardens. It is Monsanto\u2019s flagship product, and industry-funded research has long found it to be relatively safe. A case in federal court in San Francisco has challenged that conclusion, building on the findings of an international panel that claimed Roundup\u2019s main ingredient might cause cancer.The court documents included Monsanto\u2019s internal emails and email traffic between the company and federal regulators. The records suggested that Monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency had worked to quash a review of Roundup\u2019s main ingredient, glyphosate, that was to have been conducted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.The documents also revealed that there was some disagreement within the E.P.A. over its own safety assessment.Court records show that Monsanto was tipped off to the determination by a deputy division director at the E.P.A., Jess Rowland, months beforehand. That led the company to prepare a public relations assault on the finding well in advance of its publication. Monsanto executives, in their internal email traffic, also said Mr. Rowland had promised to beat back an effort by the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own review.Dan Jenkins, a Monsanto executive, said in an email in 2015 that Mr. Rowland, referring to the other agency\u2019s potential review, had told him, \u201cIf I can kill this, I should get a medal.\u201d The review never took place. In another email, Mr. Jenkins noted to a colleague that Mr. Rowland was planning to retire and said he \u201ccould be useful as we move forward with ongoing glyphosate defense.\u201dBut the court records also reveal a level of debate within the E.P.A. The agency\u2019s Office of Research and Development raised some concern about the robustness of an assessment carried out by the agency\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs, where Mr. Rowland was a senior official at the time, and recommended in December 2015 that it take steps to \u201cstrengthen\u201d its \u201chuman health assessment.\u201dIn a statement, Monsanto said, \u201cGlyphosate is not a carcinogen.\u201dIt added: \u201cThe allegation that glyphosate can cause cancer in humans is inconsistent with decades of comprehensive safety reviews by the leading regulatory authorities around the world. The plaintiffs have submitted isolated documents that are taken out of context.\u201dThe E.P.A. had no immediate comment, and Mr. Rowland could not be reached immediately.Monsanto also rebutted suggestions that the disclosures highlighted concerns that the academic research it underwrites is compromised. Monsanto frequently cites such research to back up its safety claims on Roundup and pesticides.In one email unsealed Tuesday, William F. Heydens, a Monsanto executive, told other company officials that they could ghostwrite research on glyphosate by hiring academics to put their names on papers that were actually written by Monsanto. \u201cWe would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just edit & sign their names so to speak,\u201d Mr. Heydens wrote, citing a previous instance in which he said the company had done this.Asked about the exchange, Monsanto said in a second statement that its \u201cscientists did not ghostwrite the paper\u201d that was referred to or previous work, adding that a paper that eventually appeared \u201cunderwent the journal\u2019s rigorous peer review process before it was published.\u201dDavid Kirkland, one of the scientists mentioned in the email, said in an interview, \u201cI would not publish a document that had been written by someone else.\u201d He added, \u201cWe had no interaction with Monsanto at all during the process of reviewing the data and writing the papers.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s important that people hold Monsanto accountable when they say one thing and it\u2019s completely contradicted by very frank internal documents,\u201d said Timothy Litzenburg of the Miller Firm, one of the law firms handling the litigation.The issue of glyphosate\u2019s safety is not a trivial one for Americans. Over the last two decades, Monsanto has genetically re-engineered corn, soybeans and cotton so it is much easier to spray them with the weed killer, and some 220 million pounds of glyphosate were used in 2015 in the United States.\u201cPeople should know that there are superb scientists in the world who would disagree with Monsanto and some of the regulatory agencies\u2019 evaluations, and even E.P.A. has disagreement within the agency,\u201d said Robin Greenwald, a lawyer at Weitz & Luxenberg, which is also involved in the litigation. \u201cEven in the E.U., there\u2019s been a lot of disagreement among the countries. It\u2019s not so simple as Monsanto makes it out to be.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about documents unsealed in a case over exposure to glyphosate, a crucial ingredient in the weed killer Roundup, misspelled part of the name of a law firm involved in the litigation. It is Weitz & Luxenberg, not Luxembourg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Superstar Firms\u2019 May Have Shrunk Workers\u2019 Share of Income", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byBut in recent decades, that steady share \u2014 which includes everything from the chief executive\u2019s bonuses and stock options to the parking-lot attendant\u2019s minimum wage and tips \u2014 started to flutter. In the 2000s, it slipped significantly. Although the numbers have inched up in the last couple of years, labor\u2019s portion has not risen above 59 percent since before the recession.Some economists argue that technological advancements are to blame as employers have replaced workers with machines. Others point to trade powered by cheap foreign labor, a view championed by President Trump that particularly resonated among voters.Over the last 15 years, for example, labor productivity has grown faster than wages, a sign that workers are not being adequately compensated for their contributions. And some industries have fared worse than others. Slices of the pie going to mining and manufacturing narrowed the most, while service workers (including professional and business services) had the biggest gains.From manufacturing to retailing, giant companies have managed to gobble up a larger and larger share of the market.Think about the retail sector, where mom-and-pop stores once crowded the landscape. Now it is dominated by a handful of giants like Walmart, Target and Costco.\u201cThey\u2019re very sophisticated and efficient and they don\u2019t use as much labor,\u201d said Mr. Autor, who worked on the research with a team of economists that included David Dorn, Lawrence F. Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen.With efficiencies come advantages.Software platforms and online services, for example, may be expensive to install, but not so costly to expand. Technology can make it easier to exploit smaller competitive advantages. And there is no need for duplicate payroll, shipping or human resources departments.The idea of superstars vacuuming up a majority of goodies is perhaps more obvious on the individual level. Because of technology like cable and satellite television and the internet, music luminaries like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift or sports phenoms like LeBron James or Cristiano Ronaldo can reach a much larger audience and gain a greater proportion of the revenue generated.What was once true of pop stars can now be seen in more mundane industries. \u201cOver the past several decades, only the highest earners have seen steady wage gains,\u201d a report from the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers concluded late last year. \u201cFor most workers, wage growth has been sluggish and has failed to keep pace with gains in productivity.\u201dLarger companies tend to pay better than smaller ones, Mr. Autor and the other researchers say, and in the technology sector especially, salaries can be impressive. Workers there are sharing in the larger pie \u2014 there are just fewer of them to do so.The researchers examined six industries that account for 80 percent of private employment in the United States. In each one, they discovered \u201ca remarkably consistent upward trend in concentration.\u201d In manufacturing, for instance, the top four companies controlled 43 percent of sales in 2012, up from 38 percent in 1982. In finance, the figure grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, and in retail trade it went to 30 percent, from 15 percent.The faster concentration grew, the bigger the drop in labor\u2019s share.\u201cWhat\u2019s different about new superstar firms is they don\u2019t have the cadre of middle-class jobs for nonelite workers,\u201d said Mr. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard.\u201cThat\u2019s very worrisome,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe trend is going on in country after country.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the effect large companies may have had on a decline in workers\u2019 share of income misspelled the surname of an author of the study on such \u201csuperfirms.\u201d He is John Van Reenen, not Van Reenan.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After $225 Billion in Deals Last Year, China Reins In Overseas Investment", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China struck $225 billion in deals to acquire companies abroad last year, a record-breaking number that signaled to the world that Chinese business leaders were hot to haggle.Now, China \u2014 with a worried eye on the money leaving its borders \u2014 is telling some of its companies to cool it down.On Saturday, in the strongest public signal yet that Beijing is changing course, China\u2019s commerce minister castigated what he called \u201cblind and irrational investment.\u201d At a news briefing during the annual meeting of China\u2019s congress, the minister, Zhong Shan, said officials planned to intensify supervision of what he called a small number of companies.\u201cSome enterprises have already paid the price,\u201d said Mr. Zhong, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of President Xi Jinping. \u201cSome even have had a negative impact on our national image.\u201dJust a day earlier, Zhou Xiaochuan, the country\u2019s top central banker, had also questioned the wisdom of some recent Chinese overseas deals. \u201cSome are not in line with our requirements and policies for overseas investment, such as in sports, entertainment and clubs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis didn\u2019t bring much benefit to China and caused some complaints overseas.\u201dThe comments are the clearest confirmation that the government is hitting the brakes on the sometimes chaotic rush overseas by deep-pocketed Chinese companies with a reputation for having more money than deal-making aptitude.\u201cAre these guys in over their heads?\u201d said Brock Silvers, a longtime investment banker in Shanghai. \u201cThe answer to me is, in some cases, they seem to be.\u201dA series of Chinese deals have come apart this winter \u2014 although it is not always clear whether Beijing stepped in or whether buyers themselves suddenly decided they were making a big mistake.Chinese families and companies have been rushing to move money out of the country for more than a year amid worries over a slowing national economy, a weakening currency and numerous other problems. The outflow has been expensive \u2014 China has spent $1 trillion over the past two and a half years to shore up the value of its currency \u2014 and threatens to damage the country\u2019s efforts to help its rising middle class.Among its moves, Beijing secretly told banks in late November that any movement of $5 million or more out of the country required special approval. Since then, regulators have also told each bank not to move more money out of the country for clients than they take in. Some banks had been moving up to six times as much money out of the country.That rule has complicated not only mergers and acquisitions but also the way many global companies move their China-made profits overseas, in the form of dividends. That could put into question whether China is complying with its commitments to the International Monetary Fund, which are part of a broader Chinese effort to increase the profile of the country\u2019s currency.Foreign executives describe broad difficulties moving money out of China. \u201cOn dividend payments, European Union companies experience more tedious paperwork, extended times of processing and the issue of breaking up the dividends over several months if it is a sizable amount,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.Mr. Zhou, China\u2019s central banker, said on Friday that dividends should not be subject to restrictions, but he did not go into details.China\u2019s $225.4 billion in announced deals for overseas properties last year amounted to more than double 2015\u2019s total, according to Dealogic, a data firm that tracks deals.Chinese officials appear eager to portray China\u2019s tougher stance on deals abroad as an effort to prompt more responsible investing rather than an effort to shore up the country\u2019s financial system. Mr. Zhong, the commerce minister, said the country had not changed its long-term policy of encouraging Chinese companies to become more global.But Chinese officials have a strong incentive not to acknowledge the administrative limits they have put on large movements of money out of the country. Such limits may make foreign investors more wary of putting money into China, at a time when Chinese leadership is trying to encourage more bond purchases by foreigners and other investments into the country to offset the money moving out.Anhui Xinke New Materials, a copper processing company in central China, made a deal in November to buy Voltage Pictures, an American film financing and production company, for $350 million. A month later, Anhui Xinke pulled out of the transaction before its completion.Many Chinese companies already have a lot of money overseas. More than $500 billion sluiced out of the country in the few months after the stock market plummeted in summer 2015 and before China began gradually enforcing previously dormant rules on money transfers in February 2016. Much of that money is still being allocated to longer-term investments, along with another $50 billion or more that is leaving the country each month and the accumulated earnings on previous investments made overseas.Qiang Li, a managing partner for China at the law firm DLA Piper, said that only a quarter of the many deals in which he was involved relied on transferring money out of China and might face obstacles. The rest are proceeding without difficulty because they use Chinese-owned dollars that are already overseas, he said.\u201cThere is no question,\u201d he said, \u201cthat investors will continue to invest overseas, by getting the proper approvals.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Congressman From Texas Charged With Stealing Charitable Donations", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byA former United States representative from Texas and one of his aides were indicted on Tuesday on charges that they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars meant for charity, some of which was used to illegally finance his campaigns.The former representative, Steve Stockman, 60, and the former director of special projects in his congressional office, Jason Posey, 46, were charged in a 28-count indictment related to the alleged yearslong fraud scheme. The charges included mail and wire fraud, conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and money laundering, the Justice Department said in a statement.Mr. Stockman, a Republican, solicited $1.25 million in charitable donations from May 2010 to October 2014 that was later used for other purposes, the Justice Department said.Dane Ball, who represents Mr. Stockman along with his colleagues at the law firm Smyser Kaplan & Veselka, said the former congressman plans to plead not guilty.\u201cSimilar to what Steve said outside the courthouse after his arrest, he\u2019s innocent and we are reviewing the indictment now,\u201d Mr. Ball said on Tuesday night.In a red state where former President Barack Obama was never very popular, Mr. Stockman stood out for being intensely anti-Obama.In 2014, Mr. Stockman walked out of Mr. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in protest. He invited Missouri rodeo clowns who mocked Mr. Obama in a controversial skit to perform in his district. He also sold Obama \u201cbarf bags\u201d as a campaign fund-raiser. And in 2013, he took the conservative rocker Ted Nugent, no fan of Mr. Obama, to the president\u2019s State of the Union address as his guest.Mr. Stockman served one term in the mid-1990s and again from 2013 to 2015. He also ran unsuccessfully for United States Senate in 2014.In 2010, Mr. Stockman redirected a sizable share of $285,000 intended for charity to cover personal expenses for himself and Thomas Dodd, another aide, and to further his \u201cown interests,\u201d the Justice Department said, citing the indictment. He used much of $165,000 in charitable donations raised in 2011 and 2012 to pay for his congressional campaign, the department said.After taking office in 2013, Mr. Stockman and Mr. Dodd used the name of a nonprofit to raise an additional $350,000, which he spent on personal and campaign expenses, including campaign contributions, opposition research and payments related to his failed Senate campaign, according to the Justice Department.Mr. Posey used the name of a nonprofit to raise approximately $450,000, which was later spent on mailers attacking an opponent of Mr. Stockman and campaign and personal expenses, the Justice Department said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service conducted the investigation into the scheme. The case is being prosecuted by lawyers with the Justice Department and the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of Texas.Mr. Dodd, a former special assistant in Mr. Stockman\u2019s congressional office who was also charged with use of the ill-gotten donations, pleaded guilty to his involvement last week.Advertisement"}

These events have gone on throughout his mayoralty, and have typically been held at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan so senior officials can discuss the results.Other than crime statistics, New York has plenty of news that the mayor would like to avoid. The state and federal authorities are investigating why people who wanted to do business with the city contributed to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s causes.The mayor and his allies may believe that they were practicing ordinary politics, legally; the prosecutors are trying to determine whether lines were crossed in granting favors to donors.

{"Headline": "A Rare Venture Capitalist \u2014 Female and Retail-Focused", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kirsten Green had only dabbled in investing in start-ups before she began a venture capital fund in 2012. What she had instead was years of experience covering the retail business as an analyst on Wall Street.So Ms. Green, 45, parlayed that retail knowledge into her venture capital endeavors and used it to bring specialized advice to her companies. In one of her first moves as a venture capitalist, she was part of a $1 million investment into Dollar Shave Club, then a tiny company, which sells razors to consumers online. Later, she invested in Jet.com, an e-commerce start-up that was vocal about wanting to take on Amazon.Thinking about \u201cthe acquirers, the state of the public markets, how a business is being valued \u2014 that\u2019s an essential way to understand the overall ecosystem\u201d of start-ups, said Ms. Green, whose little-known venture firm, Forerunner Ventures, is based in San Francisco.That means the venture capitalists who nurtured those businesses can finally reap some cash. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re seeing more exits, and a stronger opportunity for exits, is a good thing,\u201d said Theresa S. Hajer, a managing director at Cambridge Associates, an investment advisory firm.Knowing when to sell a start-up or take it public remains as important as deciding to sell. Founders Fund, a venture firm started by the investor Peter Thiel, had put money into Stemcentrx, which makes a cancer-fighting drug. Last year, Stemcentrx agreed to sell itself to the drug maker AbbVie for $5.8 billion, an amount that generated returns exceeding the $625 million fund that Founders Fund had used to invest in the company.These 20 venture capitalists \u2013 the investors who unearth the tiny start-ups that turn into tomorrow\u2019s behemoths \u2013 are on the winningest streaks.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly important to generate realized returns, but the question is still when,\u201d said Brian Singerman, the Founders partner who oversaw the Stemcentrx investment and who is No. 5 on the list of top 20 venture capitalists.CB Insights put together the list using criteria such as the size of a return an investor was able to generate when his or her investments went public or were acquired. The firm focused on the performance of investors since 2009 for the list.Ms. Green is an unorthodox venture capitalist for several reasons. Apart from having never worked at a venture capital firm before starting her own in 2012, she is also a woman in a male-dominated field. (Of the top 20 venture investors this year, only two were women.) And unlike many generalist venture investors, who work in a range of areas, Ms. Green focuses specifically on commerce and other retail-related start-ups.Ms. Green\u2019s roots in retail run deep. She began her career as an accountant auditing retailers. In the late 1990s, she covered those companies as a stock analyst for Montgomery Securities, studying wonky measurements like customer traffic in retail locations and a store\u2019s profitability per square foot. She also observed the rise of brands like Abercrombie & Fitch, Coach and Ugg.\u201cRetail is now totally propelled by consumers and their needs,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can buy what they want in any way that they want it. That trend started a long time ago, and it has really changed everything.\u201dIn 2003, Ms. Green decided to jump from analyzing this shift to investing in it. For a time, she worked as a consultant to a private equity firm before turning to venture capital because of her interest in young companies. In 2010, she raised an angel investment fund to make one-off investments in companies like Birchbox, a cosmetics subscription service, and Warby Parker, an eyeglasses retailer, while she studied how to raise a venture fund.In 2012, Ms. Green raised a $40 million venture fund. The investment firm Cendana Capital contributed $10 million, despite the fact that she had never worked as a traditional investor or tech entrepreneur.\u201cWhen we talked to founders she had worked with, they all said that she had the best expertise and gave the best advice,\u201d Michael Kim, a managing partner at Cendana, said of Ms. Green.With that fund, Ms. Green helped lead a $1 million investment into Dollar Shave Club when the start-up was valued at just $5 million. She also joined the company\u2019s board.After Ms. Green invested in Jet.com in 2014, she chatted with Jet\u2019s executives almost weekly about matters including strategy and potential acquisitions, said Katie Finnegan, who was the online retailer\u2019s head of corporate development. Ms. Finnegan said Jet still consults with Ms. Green even after the company\u2019s sale to Walmart.Ms. Green has \u201ca real instinct for brands,\u201d said Rachel Blumenthal, the founder of the children\u2019s apparel start-up Rockets of Awesome, which sends subscribers a customized box of clothing for every new season. Ms. Blumenthal got to know Ms. Green from Warby Parker, which was founded by Ms. Blumenthal\u2019s husband, Neil.Ms. Green invested in Rockets of Awesome last year and has brought her opinions about consumer behavior to the start-up. At a recent company board meeting, Ms. Green argued that the online retailer\u2019s subscription box needed to remain distinct from its other packaging.

Of the 30 companies in her first fund, eight have been acquired. In her second $75 million fund, which she raised in 2014, two companies have been acquired, including Jet.com.\u201cNow that people are bombarded with information, we are in a golden age where brands matter,\u201d Ms. Green said. \u201cI want to be part of this new era.\u201dAn article on Monday about the venture capital investor Kirsten Green overstated her investment in Dollar Shave Club. Ms. Green was one of the investors in a $1 million financing round for the company; she did not invest the entire $1 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Agree on Paid Leave, but Not on Who Should Pay", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported bySurvey SaysMost people say workers should get paid leave to take care of a baby, a sick family member or themselves, according to two new surveys. But they disagree on the details: who should pay, and whether it should be mandatory or optional.In a first, presidential candidates from both parties talked supportively about paid leave, but the Trump administration\u2019s proposal, led by Ivanka Trump, faces hurdles because of deep divisions about what the policy should look like.Yet the surveys make clear that the need crosses income, gender and political lines, and affects people\u2019s career decisions and wages.Ninety-four percent of respondents said paid leave would help families, and 65 percent said it would help the economy. When asked which work arrangements would be most helpful to them, they ranked paid leave the highest, alongside flexibility of hours. Sixty-two percent told Pew they\u2019d taken paid leave or are very likely to.Large majorities support paid leave \u2014 between 67 percent and 85 percent, depending on the type of leave \u2014 according to the Pew report, which included two nationally representative online surveys of 8,000 Americans total. One survey was about people\u2019s general opinions about family leave, and the other about their personal experiences with it.A woman who works for the Ohio state government in Columbus said during a Pew focus group: \u201cPeople are making too difficult of a choice every day: Do I go to work? Or do I take care of this person who I love dearly?\u201dBut Americans are torn about the government\u2019s role. Only half of people over all and one-third of Republicans think it should mandate leave, versus continuing to let employers decide. Sixty-nine percent of Democrats supported a government mandate.Most people say employers should pay for leave instead. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government should pay for it because, I mean, we\u2019d all be paying for it anyway because it would be in our taxes,\u201d a Denver father and sales manager said in the focus group.Respondents said offering paid leave would help employers recruit and keep good workers. Still, nearly half of respondents said offering paid leave would harm businesses.\u201cYou are going to have a much more productive employee, and you\u2019ve also got an employee who has better health, their children have better health,\u201d said a mother in Denver who runs a small business. \u201cBut it is hard in the front. It\u2019s a huge expense.\u201d\u201cThe feeling that policies that encourage women to be in the work force are not in the best interest of the family is pervasive among Republicans,\u201d Ms. Mathur said. \u201cBut having access to these policies is really critical for these working families who are not in a position to even choose do I go back to work or not.\u201dDespite the fact that both parents work outside the home in most two-parent families, 44 percent of respondents said it was best if one stayed home. Thirty-nine percent said it should be the mother, and 56 percent said it didn\u2019t matter.Despite the enthusiasm for paid leave, there is disagreement about how to pay for it. The most popular idea was a tax credit to employers who offered leave; it was strongly or somewhat supported by 87 percent of respondents. Next was pretax savings accounts for employees to save for leave, supported by 84 percent.Sixty-two percent of people at least somewhat supported a government fund that employers and employees pay into \u2014 a policy used in three states. Least popular, with 60 percent support, was a government paid leave program financed through higher taxes on wealthy people or corporations.The need is most acute for low-income workers. Of people employed in the last two years, 16 percent told Pew that they needed to take leave but were unable. They were more likely to be low earners, as well as women, black, Hispanic or without a college degree.One woman, who worked in retail in Denver, had to quit after giving birth; she accepted Medicaid and food stamps because her employer gave her no time off.\u201cIt was really, really rough,\u201d said another woman, in Birmingham, Ala., who needed to care for her mother but had no leave. \u201cSome days I would just have to let them know I couldn\u2019t come in because I had to assist her, and that would mean not a full paycheck and that was very stressful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Pioneering German Feminist Looks Back in Anguish", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileAlmost 50 years later, Ms. Schwarzer, Germany\u2019s best-known feminist, is still fighting, but time has not much changed the targets: white men, autocrats and anyone else who wants to decide for a woman what she does with her body, from abortion to shrouding herself in a burqa.\u201cThe easy times of postfeminism are over,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer, 74, now proclaims. \u201cAt the latest since Trump\u2019s election, it is feminism pure which is needed.\u201dThat battle cry sounded from the pages of EMMA, the feminist magazine that Ms. Schwarzer started in 1977 on the proceeds of the most successful of her 25 books, \u201cThe Little Difference and Its Huge Consequences,\u201d first published in 1975 and now translated into 12 languages.EMMA celebrated its 40th birthday in January, with Ms. Schwarzer proudly noting that it is solvent and independent, financed by subscriptions and newsstand sales, with a bimonthly circulation of 50,000.\u201cHad someone told me 40 years ago that I would still be doing EMMA in the year 2017, I would probably have just shaken my head in disbelief,\u201d she wrote in the birthday editorial.She is by no means meekly shaking that head, still banging loudly on any table within banging distance, giving speeches nationwide and enlivening television debates.\u201cThere is scarcely a person in our country who experiences such a high degree of admiration but also rejection as her,\u201d said Markus Lanz, a talk-show host, when introducing Ms. Schwarzer two weeks ago.The current particular targets of Ms. Schwarzer\u2019s ire are President Trump and Turkey\u2019s increasingly authoritarian leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\u201cWhat is so shocking for all of us,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said of Mr. Trump\u2019s election, \u201cis that such an old-school sexist makes it to the top, and that so many women voted for him. That is backlash, that is reactionary.\u201dIn her vehement view, both he and Mr. Erdogan \u2014 \u201ca lifelong proponent of God\u2019s state\u201d \u2014 can be compared to the Nazis. And she is adamant that it is \u201cso fatal that in our democracies we have failed to recognize Islamism as the fascism of the 21st century.\u201dThe episode called into question the wisdom of Chancellor Angela Merkel in allowing hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants, many of them Muslim, into Germany in the months before. Investigations have highlighted police incompetence as one cause of the chaos. Almost no one has been convicted in the assaults or the disorder, much to Ms. Schwarzer\u2019s chagrin.Passion and the feminist cause seem to have come naturally to Ms. Schwarzer, who was born in December 1942 in the Ruhr industrial town of Wuppertal. She was raised by youthful maternal grandparents after her mother gave birth at age 22 and then largely vanished from her life.Most unusually for those times, Ms. Schwarzer\u2019s grandmother, Margarete Schwarzer, known as Grete, who was 46 when Alice was born, \u201chad a point of view\u201d and was unafraid to say so.\u201cShe was very anti-Nazi,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. \u201cWhich isolated anyone in the Nazi time. And not just then. You must know that also after 1945 it was not fashionable to be anti-Nazi and that \u2014 as my grandmother could attest \u2014 the Nazis all still sat at their posts, in City Hall, everywhere.\u201dHer grandmother was also \u201ca visionary,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. \u201cShe was an eco-activist already in the 1950s and campaigned for animal rights. I don\u2019t know where she got it from, but she was proved right. She was a very sharp political thinker.\u201dBy contrast, Ms. Schwarzer said, \u201cmy grandfather changed diapers\u201d and \u201cwas a very sensitive, fun, dear person.\u201dGrowing up as one of a trio with equal rights, \u201cI thought women may think and men also have something maternal,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I went out into the world, and it was different. Perhaps that\u2019s also what enrages me.\u201dEvacuated to Bavaria during World War II, Ms. Schwarzer returned to Wuppertal in 1950, finished school at 16 and became an office worker. Soon, she went to neighboring France, learning French and doing odd jobs until getting a journalist traineeship in 1966 in D\u00fcsseldorf.After a stint at a German satirical magazine, she returned to Paris and joined the Movement for the Liberation of Women in 1970.That was where she met de Beauvoir, as well as Jean-Paul Sartre, Daniel Cohn-Bendit and other luminaries of France\u2019s then-vibrant left-wing political scene. In April 1971, Ms. Schwarzer joined de Beauvoir, the actress Catherine Deneuve and 340 other women in admitting publicly that they had had what were then illegal abortions.By June of that year, Ms. Schwarzer had exported the idea to Germany, where 374 women, including herself and popular actresses like Romy Schneider, published similar admissions in their ultimately successful campaign to legalize abortion.Ms. Schwarzer, a confirmed Francophile, still splits time between Cologne, a city very much of Germany\u2019s west, and a pied-\u00e0-terre in Paris. France \u201cis really a way of living that I otherwise miss,\u201d she said.It also perhaps feeds a lifelong sense of being an outsider. Ms. Schwarzer never married, has written about one long-ago 10-year relationship with a Frenchman and has been variously associated with male and female partners.One joy of recent years, she said, has been befriending Ms. Merkel.Their acquaintance began in 1991 when Ms. Merkel, then a slightly awkward former scientist from the Communist East, became minister for women and youth. As she rose in the next decade, she was constantly underestimated by male counterparts, but not by Ms. Schwarzer, who called her to set up a lunch in Cologne.\u201cI was impressed by her intelligence, her openness and her palpable integrity,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. They fell into a pattern of meeting once or twice a year, she said.When Ms. Merkel was sworn in as Germany\u2019s first female chancellor in November 2005, Ms. Schwarzer said, \u201cI almost wept.\u201d She recalled saying that day: \u201cYes, now little girls in Germany know they can become a hairdresser, or chancellor. Let\u2019s see.\u201dMs. Merkel has played down her role as a pioneering woman, but she made a point of congratulating EMMA on its 40th birthday, wishing that it \u201cmay continue to fight stubbornly on women\u2019s issues and not get blown off course.\u201dThat is unlikely to happen to Ms. Schwarzer. As she recalled how the abortion rights stance helped start the women\u2019s movement in France and Germany, anger overcame her once more.\u201cIt is just unbelievable that we are simply treading water,\u201d she said. \u201cWe came forward so at least in the Western world we could walk with our heads held high.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brand to Know: The Men\u2019s Wear Line Rethinking the Button-Down Shirt", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byOn the Verge10 PhotosIndeed, their less-is-more ideology is more pragmatic than enigmatic. Cobra\u2019s debut collection, which launched last month, comprises 33 button-down dress shirts \u2014 nothing more, nothing less. The shirts, which come in an array of dusty colorways and high-end fabrics and sell for about $300 to $500 each, are all fitted in the same loose, casual silhouette that wouldn\u2019t look out of place on unbuttoned tough guys like Viggo Mortensen or Jim Jarmusch. \u201cGoing out on your own, you quickly find out the amount of work it takes to make one item well,\u201d Taghizadeh said. \u201cWe want to be able to provide something that a guy can come back to every single time without having to think about it because he knows the shirt fits.\u201dIn many ways, Reynolds, 29, a Kansas native with long messy hair who has a degree in finance, and Taghizadeh, 32, an ex-skateboarder from Melbourne, Australia, with a cleaner, more polished look, embody the yin-and-yang formula behind their brand. Standing in Taghizadeh\u2019s cramped Chinatown apartment as the sounds of the experimental musician Nicolas Jaar played softly in the background, the duo spoke animatedly about the variations of their signature shirt: There are multicolored silk pajama tops, double-buttoned oxfords and a thrift-store-style Western shirt in buttery red leather that goes for $1198. \u201cPersonally, I would wear a cowboy shirt under a suit. I\u2019m that guy,\u201d Reynolds said.They explained that \u201ccobra,\u201d from their label\u2019s moniker, \u201cwas used as an adjective to describe a mind-set\u201d during the initial days of the brand\u2019s development. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed a bit of an esoteric language being together,\u201d Taghizadeh said. After he introduced Reynolds to Nick Cave\u2019s art-rock oeuvre, the singer became their unofficial muse. \u201cNick Cave has a real Australian cowboy aesthetic that feels very Kansas to me,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cMusic is essential to our creative process,\u201d he added, \u201cstrictly because it brings us together.\u201dBeer has also served as the occasional creative spark. \u201cWe probably came up with three or four of our main ideas sitting in a pub after five or six Guinnesses one night,\u201d Taghizadeh said. \u201cWe were thinking about the old polka-dot shirts Bob Dylan or Ringo Starr used to wear. We thought, \u2018Let\u2019s not make it polka dots, but let\u2019s turn it into another motif entirely.\u2019\u201d It was during that initial meetup that the duo first imagined the custom florals, monochrome cobweb patterns and race-car-flame stripes that are now standouts of the brand.The pair\u2019s commitment to details (in May, Reynolds is moving to Milan for two months to complete work on the brand\u2019s labels and hangtags) is what allows the collection\u2019s more outlandish prints to not feel garish or overly fashionable. Their approach seems to be paying off: Opening Ceremony, the Swedish boutique Tr\u00e8s Bien and Ssense, the trendsetting e-commerce site from Montreal, have signed on to carry Cobra. But for now, the project remains personal. \u201cWe\u2019re designing for this ideal guy we want to be and who our friends want to be,\u201d Taghizadeh said. Reynolds jumped in: \u201cBut I want my dad to wear some of these things, too,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he will.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a clothing brand. It is Cobra, not Cobra Global. Additionally, the article misstated the heritage of the model Cosme Castro. He is half Chilean and half English; he is not Italian.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Room for Dissent in Women\u2019s Movement Today", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byWomen TodayIs there a \u201cwomen\u2019s movement\u201d in 2017? What is it? Who is it?I became involved with the women\u2019s movement in the early 1970s, when, as a junior at the University of Oklahoma, I was one of five founders of the Oklahoma Women\u2019s Political Caucus. For over a decade, I traveled the state working for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Later, as an Oklahoma state legislator, I was a champion of women\u2019s rights, including supporting abortion rights within the Roe v. Wade framework.In the 1970s, we fought for legal equality and eradication of the laws, based on English common law, that put women in the same legal category as children and insane persons. We wanted access to the Ivy League schools, the professions, the clubs \u2014 everything. Wherever men could go and become successful, we wanted to be there, too.And we got it all. Big time. The antiquated statutes were repealed. Women got into the professions and the C-suites and the schools and the TV news anchor desks. We got there. We ARE there.So why, pray tell, were those women and girls wearing those ridiculous hats at the purposeless \u201cwomen\u2019s marches\u201d in January? Why do they perpetuate the Freudian question, \u201cWhat do women want?\u201dThe women\u2019s movement has ebbed because it succeeded. Yet the suffragist Susan B. Anthony\u2019s mantra \u201cFailure is impossible\u201d has been so hijacked by post-millennium feminism that declaring victory is unforgivable.All that a \u201cmovement\u201d could responsibly achieve, has been achieved. My 32-year-old daughter doesn\u2019t know the meaning of \u201cgirls not allowed.\u201d Now, it is up to individual women to lean in, step up or walk through the doors opened by and for us over the last 40 years.Our fight was ostensibly about respecting women\u2019s choices, whatever they may be.But the women\u2019s movement doesn\u2019t live up to that idea. If women choose to be chief executives and officeholders and columnists and doctors and partners in law firms, great! If they choose, however, to be moms and wives and attend Bible study or bake cookies, they are \u201cbitter clingers\u201d and \u201cdeplorable.\u201d And if they happen to be conservative professional women, they are invisible.The ugly truth is that the women\u2019s movement has morphed into a giant abortion-rights lobby, demanding abortion far beyond the Roe v. Wade trimester construct. For someone like me, who has done a lot of soul-searching over the years, ultimately coming to believe that life begins at conception, I\u2019m no longer welcome in the women\u2019s movement. Women who oppose abortion are deemed contrary to the very idea of equality. Being a feminist in 2017 equals zero tolerance for anti-abortion views.We are told that legal abortions protect women from deadly back-alley abortions. Feminists, then, should be the vanguard of strict licensing and enforcement of regulations governing abortion facilities and practitioners. Instead, they object to regulation on the grounds of restricting \u201cchoice.\u201dYet, how do feminists reconcile the mission of protecting women from male brutality and predators when a perpetrator is the abortion industry itself? Think Philadelphia abortion provider Dr. Kermit Gosnell, convicted in May 2013 of murdering three infants born alive during attempted abortion procedures, as well as 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent law. He had been charged after the deaths of seven newborns whose spinal cords were severed with scissors after being born alive during attempted abortions, and an adult patient who died after an abortion.Feminists did not spread the word about Dr. Gosnell or demand investigations to ensure his evil wasn\u2019t being practiced elsewhere. Nor did he receive any of the round-the-clock media sensationalism afforded Representative Todd Akin, Republican of Missouri, after his statement in 2012 about \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d Such is the double standard from the abortion-rights mainstream media.But women are not that monolithic, nor that pliable. I know, work with and am friends with scores of women who are smart, talented, strong, capable, independent, who are also pro-business, pro-life, pro-gun, pro-traditional marriage, devout Christian, Jewish, conservative women, as well as others who are neutral or simply nondoctrinaire.The \u201cfeminist club\u201d tolerates no such independent views. In fact, there\u2019s a special feminist seething against such women who rise to public prominence. Think Kellyanne Conway.The vestiges of a once proud women\u2019s movement have deteriorated into a new politically correct tyranny where women are subjected to the presence of men in places that should be safe and should protect women\u2019s privacy, like restrooms, all in the name of \u201cequality.\u201d Was this was the enlightenment we had in mind 40 years ago? It certainly wasn\u2019t what I intended.Society\u2019s ills are many. The number of women living in poverty, for instance. But the greatest protections against female poverty are girls\u2019 finishing high school, getting full-time jobs and not having babies out of wedlock. Oppressive big government policy solutions promoted at the women\u2019s marches by the communist Angela Davis and by Hollywood starlets have never worked and never will. Not for women, not for anyone.Are there still obstacles facing women in society? Yes, there are. But American women\u2019s equality under the law is what I worked for and is, today, a reality. And I, for one, am not ashamed to declare victory.Cleta Mitchell is a Washington lawyer who represents Republican candidates and conservative groups in matters involving campaign finance, election law, lobbying compliance, ethics and financial disclosure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top British Official Scraps Plan to Overcome Shortfall", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Only last week, Philip Hammond, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, joked about the nickname he has won for dull, technocratic, attention to detail \u2014 \u201cSpreadsheet Phil\u201d \u2014 as he outlined his budget to lawmakers.On Wednesday, Mr. Hammond was back in Parliament, this time withdrawing some of those financial plans, in an embarrassing about-face that raised questions not just about his carefully crafted image of competence but also that of the government of Prime Minister Theresa May.Mr. Hammond acknowledged the widespread opposition. He said in a letter to lawmakers and then later in Parliament that he would scrap the plans, announced just seven days ago, to raise more revenue from some self-employed British workers.The move came after criticism both from tabloid newspapers and from some lawmakers in Mr. Hammond\u2019s Conservative Party, who had said that the measure broke a 2015 campaign pledge and penalized some of the party\u2019s strongest supporters.There was more controversy on that issue, too, on Wednesday, when David Davis, the minister in charge of negotiating the terms of the British exit, told lawmakers in a committee hearing that the government had no official assessment of the economic cost of failing to strike a trade deal with the European Union after it left the bloc.What made that inexplicable to opponents, and even a few supporters, is that Mrs. May and Mr. Davis have warned repeatedly that Britain might walk away from negotiations if it cannot get the agreement it wants.But the political heat may have been felt most directly by Mr. Hammond, whose shift surprised lawmakers. In announcing the change of policy in the letter to lawmakers released Wednesday morning, Mr. Hammond wrote: \u201cIt is very important both to me and to the prime minister that we are compliant not just with the letter but also the spirit of the commitments that were made.\u201d He did not say how the shortfall in public funds would be made up.In his budget statement last week, Mr. Hammond said that the government would increase the rate of national insurance contributions \u2014 the taxes that finance health care, the state pension and other benefits \u2014 for roughly 1.6 million self-employed workers.Currently, their contributions are levied at a lower rate than others pay, which Mr. Hammond has said was \u201cnot fair to the 85 percent of workers\u201d who are not self-employed.Addressing lawmakers in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr. Hammond made matters worse when he appeared to suggest that the breach of a manifesto commitment had first been identified by a journalist. He later backtracked and suggested that he had been referring to the first person to challenge him publicly on the issue.\u201cI think credit where credit is due, I think it was Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC, shortly after I said it in the budget speech,\u201d Mr. Hammond told lawmakers, when challenged on who had raised the matter.In any event the story, and the blame game that has accompanied it, exposed tensions between Mr. Hammond, who occupies No. 11 Downing Street, and his neighbor, Mrs. May, in No. 10.The budget \u201cwas followed by a briefing war between No. 10 and No. 11, as allies of Mr. Hammond and Theresa May blamed each other for the mess. In the end, the prime minister won and the chancellor was ordered into a retreat as humiliating as any in postwar political history,\u201d the article argued, adding that Mr. Hammond\u2019s reputation for competence \u201cis now in shreds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ventry Jr., a member of the I.R.S. advisory council and a law professor at the University of California, Davis. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to sustain itself.\u201dThe White House budget office has proposed a 14.1 percent cut to the I.R.S. for the fiscal year that begins in October, reducing the agency\u2019s budget to $9.65 billion; six years ago, it stood at $12.1 billion ($13.6 billion when adjusted for inflation).If approved, the cuts would happen when the number of audits is down and customer service complaints are up as a result of the drop in funding.Mr. Mnuchin surprised some Republicans at his Senate confirmation hearing in January when he said that one of his priorities as Treasury secretary would be to rebuild the I.R.S.\u2019s staff.Promising to modernize a Treasury unit that many conservatives have threatened to abolish, Mr. Mnuchin said he was certain that Mr. Trump understood the concept of \u201cwe add people, we make money.\u201d Investing in the I.R.S., Mr. Mnuchin suggested, was a smart move because the agency\u2019s work ultimately paid for itself through the revenue that it brought in.The White House, it seems, has other ideas.The potential reduction in I.R.S. funding is the latest example of potential division within the Trump administration\u2019s economic team, which has wrestled with how to cut taxes, invest in the military and lower the debt at the same time.New internal data released by the agency this week underscored the pressure it is under. The number of individual tax return audits fell last year to its lowest level since 2004, and enforcement staffing levels were down by nearly 30 percent from 2010, to just below 16,000. Criminal investigations related to tax-related identity theft, money laundering, public corruption, cybercrime and terrorist financing also are on the decline, and I.R.S. officials cited budget constraints as the reason.\u201cThis is only going to continue that trend,\u201d Roberton C. Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, says of the potential cuts the agency is facing. \u201cAudits are really a necessary function in the sense that it maintains the integrity of the system.\u201dThere is the issue of unpaid taxes, an enormous cost to America\u2019s finances. The federal budget deficit in fiscal 2016 was $587 billion, while the \u201ctax gap\u201d \u2014 the gulf between taxes owed and taxes paid \u2014 averaged $458 billion from 2008 from 2010, according to an analysis conducted by the I.R.S. last year. Collecting even half that sum could make up a significant chunk of the government\u2019s budget shortfall, without increasing taxes or cutting spending.Handicapping the agency with additional budget cuts will make matters worse, experts say, emboldening scofflaws to take their chances against an increasingly toothless tax collector. And as funding continues to fall, honest taxpayers are suffering from a lack of attention.The I.R.S. Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s most recent annual report to Congress detailed how stretched the agency had become, citing the closing of dozens of walk-in assistance centers and longer waits to speak to customer service agents on the telephone.In 2004, a taxpayer with a problem could speak to someone in less than three minutes, according to the report. Last year, it took nearly 20 minutes to navigate a maze of automation and hold times to reach someone.Security is also a worry, with cyber-threats on the rise around the world. In 2015, the I.R.S. computer systems were hacked. As a result, personal data connected to more than 700,000 taxpayer accounts was stolen. With hackers showing increased skill and even a willingness to meddle in American elections, the agency is under pressure to keep its defenses on high alert to prevent further breaches.But help does not appear to be on the way.The agency\u2019s fate was a hot topic in last year\u2019s presidential campaign. The Republican candidate Ted Cruz, senator of Texas, suggested that the I.R.S. should be abolished altogether. Mr. Cruz proposed dispatching its remaining staff members to police the country\u2019s southern border.Mr. Trump has his own fraught history with the I.R.S., accusing it of unfairly auditing him year after year and citing a pending audit as a reason he would not publicly release his tax returns. While the president praised Mr. Koskinen in 2014 as \u201ca very good man,\u201d Mr. Trump also fights hard, he has said, to keep his tax bill as low as possible.Mr. Koskinen, who declined to be interviewed, has argued forcefully that those who would cut the I.R.S. budget in the name of fiscal conservatism misunderstood the agency\u2019s value. At hearings around Washington, he regularly reminds members of Congress that every dollar of investment in the I.R.S. yields $4 in revenue.That revenue will have added importance as congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump embark on plans to cut taxes while increasing military spending and investing more in the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.Still, I.R.S. critics are unlikely to lavish money on an agency whose mission many of them loathe, even as its workload shows no signs of letting up.\u201cThe confluence of a 14 percent reduction, on top of a string of reductions of $900 million over the last eight years, with a promise of major tax reform later this year is a recipe for disaster at the country\u2019s most significant revenue-producing agency,\u201d said Lawrence B. Gibbs, a former I.R.S. commissioner.Patricia Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Asked by a German journalist about this approach, the president insisted that while he was not against trade, the United States had been treated unfairly in global trade agreements. \u201cBut I am not an isolationist,\u201d he said.Less than 24 hours later, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s government refused to back a pledge to fully oppose trade protectionism at a meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany, of the finance ministers of the Group of 20, which comprises industrial and emerging-market countries as well as the European Union. Participants last year had agreed to resist \u201call forms\u201d of protectionism.Germans have been both fascinated and horrified by Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to ignore the strictures of diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. For example, he has castigated Ms. Merkel for allowing refugees to flow into Germany in 2015, and he has called into question post-World War II alliances, including NATO and the European Union. Germans have not been entirely sure what to make of him.\u201cOne thing we can depend upon, that we saw yesterday: Donald Trump says what he wants,\u201d Nikolaus Blome, deputy editor of Bild, wrote in its online edition. \u201cHe has predictable political interests. What he doesn\u2019t have is a predictable way to pursue them.\u201dMs. Tempel, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said simply: \u201cIf this mission was really about getting a first impression, you got your first impression.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to figures for American and German military spending as a percentage of gross domestic product. The figures were for overall military spending, not for the countries\u2019 contributions to NATO.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fact Check: Trump and Military Spending", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday was more tempered in tone and less laden with inaccuracies than many of his previous remarks. Until he went off script.Unlike his freewheeling news conferences and rallies, Mr. Trump\u2019s prepared text contained few outright falsehoods. But when he talked up his own achievements in NATO negotiations and military spending, his claims were at times exaggerated and misleading.Here\u2019s an assessment of some of them.\u201cI am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\u201d Todd Harrison, the director for defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, posted this chart on Twitter, showing at least 10 higher increases since the 1977 fiscal year and four since 2002.And this calculus does not take into account Overseas Contingency Operations, a separate bucket of money used to fund wars. Factoring in war spending, Mr. Trump\u2019s claim is even less credible.Richard Kogan, a federal budget expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, calculated 27 years since 1940 in which total military spending was as high or higher than Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed increase. Even taking into account major and minor wars, military spending increased by 10 to 15 percent every year but one from 1975 to 1985.\u201cOutside major and minor wars, it\u2019s still not true,\u201d Kogan said. \u201cAs a percent of G.D.P., there have been roughly 35 years \u2014 half the time \u2014 when the increase has been as large or larger than what Trump is calling for.\u201d\u201cWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism and a Cold War and defeated communism. But our partners must meet their financial obligations.\u201d How much each of NATO\u2019s 28 member nations contributes to the alliance\u2019s direct spending is proportional to G.D.P. The United States has the largest national income and contributes the most to NATO, at about 22 percent, but the other member nations all pay their bills.Under NATO guidelines, members agreed to commit a minimum of 2 percent of G.D.P. on the alliance\u2019s defense efforts, but few nations actually do so. The United States does fund a disproportionate amount of indirect spending, 72 percent, characterized by NATO as an \u201coverreliance.\u201d\u201cAnd now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.\u201d\u201cAnd the reason for this is not Donald Trump \u2014 it\u2019s Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea and aggressive stance,\u201d said Ivo H. Daalder, a NATO ambassador under President Barack Obama.While Mr. Trump\u2019s statements criticizing NATO members are helpful, every president since Harry Truman has asked the Europeans to contribute more, Mr. Daalder added.And money is not \u201cpouring in.\u201d Member nations have essentially halted cuts in their military spending, slowly reversing a downward trend.\u201cOur military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\u201dStill, the United States spends more money on the military than the next seven countries combined do. Mr. Trump and White House officials have pointed to a smaller Navy to bolster their claims of a weakened military. While today\u2019s fleet size is the smallest since 1916, the ships are much more capable. And the United States has more aircraft carriers than any other nation in the world.\u201cWith the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\u201dThe American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country\u2019s infrastructure a D+ in its latest report and estimated it would cost $3.6 trillion to repair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Numbers That Say a Lot About the Election", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byTurnout in the 2016 presidential election, initially characterized as low, actually exceeded that of the 2012 race in which President Barack Obama won re-election. The candidates devoted virtually all their time and money to 14 battleground states, regarding the vote in the rest of the country as a foregone conclusion. Elections to the House of Representatives were the least competitive since political junkies began rating them in 1984. And unsurprisingly, states that made it easier to register and vote usually experienced significantly higher turnout than states that did not.A few of the highlights:The share of the voting-eligible population that cast ballots \u2014 \u201cvoting eligible\u201d means all adults who were legally entitled to cast a ballot, regardless of whether they registered \u2014 was the third best since 1972, slightly below the 60.7 percent turnout in the 2004 presidential race and slightly better than the 58.6 percent turnout in 2012. (Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 victory holds the crown for largest recent turnout.) Among the four in 10 who did not vote, a Pew Research Center survey suggested that about 25 percent believed their ballot would not change anything, and 15 percent believed the election outcome was in little doubt.Minnesotans exercised the franchise more than any other state\u2019s residents, followed by voters in Maine, New Hampshire, Colorado and Wisconsin. The five share a common trait: Each allows same-day voter registration. The 15 states that have adopted that policy have consistently had higher turnout rates than most others. One surprise: Although Wisconsin made the top five, its turnout rate actually fell compared with 2012. Professor McDonald said the drop appeared related to changes in the state\u2019s voting laws \u2014 particularly a contentious requirement that voters produce an acceptable ID. The bottom five states? Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and, bringing up the rear, Hawaii.The presidential contest was waged almost entirely in the 14 states that both parties regarded as winnable. Those states were home to barely a third of the electorate. And just four of them \u2014 Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 gobbled up 71 percent of campaign ad spending and 57 percent of candidates\u2019 visits (President Trump won them all). Reflecting the polarized nature of American political loyalties, the remaining 36 states and the District of Columbia were viewed as too solidly Democratic or Republican to bother contesting.Holding a seat in the House of Representatives, it seems, is the political equivalent of holding municipal bonds: Both are rock-solid safe. Of the 435 House races, 402 were won by a margin of 10 percent or more of the votes \u2014 and 317 of those were won by a margin of at least 20 percent, a certifiable landslide. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has been rating House races since 1984; the 2016 election had the fewest competitive seats of all. A point of comparison: In the three elections from 1992 to 1996, no fewer than 123 seats were seen as competitive.One in 12 voters under 45 spurned the major parties and cast ballots for independent presidential candidates, mostly the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein and the Libertarian Party\u2019s Gary Johnson. That is more than double the number of over-45 voters who chose independents, and a possibly decisive factor in the election\u2019s outcome in some battleground states. Election participation rises with age, so younger voters had less sway over the election\u2019s outcome than older ones did. Still, among the youngest voters \u2014 those under 30 \u2014 the estimated turnout was 50 percent of the voter-eligible population for that age group, the fourth highest of the last 12 presidential contests.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Moscow Lost Its Luster as the School of Revolution", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byRed CenturyLONDON \u2014 After the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917, the Soviet state became a beacon of hope for the left, and Moscow a place for pilgrimage. It was four decades before the magic faded, and the world is still waiting for something to replace it.It\u2019s easy to see the original appeal. In 1917, men were dying like flies on the blood-soaked fields of France and Belgium. Many of them were working men who made the ultimate sacrifice for countries where they could not vote, and whose deaths left their families in penury while the rich got richer.So Vladimir Lenin\u2019s message found willing listeners. Communist parties formed quickly in the nations that had fought the war. A young boilermaker named Harry Pollitt, later to become Britain\u2019s Communist leader, summed up the reason: \u201cWorkers like me and all those around me had won power, had defeated the boss class.\u201dPeople like Pollitt loved the Soviet state even more when the rich and powerful attacked it in extravagant terms: \u201cEastward, also prostrate, also in dire confusion, lay the huge mass of Russia \u2014 not a wounded Russia only, but an infected Russia, a plague-bearing Russia,\u201d declared Winston Churchill, who regarded such revolutionary ideas as \u201cpolitical doctrines which destroyed the health and even the soul of nations.\u201dThe international friends of the Soviet state were numerous and active enough for Lenin to harbor hopes of states based on the Soviet model all over the world. So he created the Communist International, or Comintern as it was known, and took a personal interest in the formation and development of revolutionary socialist parties everywhere, including the Communist Party U.S.A., formed around 1919, the British and French Communist Parties the following year, and many others.Lenin School students and visiting foreign Communist leaders stayed in the Hotel Lux, a bare but functional building in the city center. There, they ate, slept and imbibed the intoxicating revolutionary fervor \u2014 literally, in the form of Russian vodka and strong Georgian brandy.Comintern agents were sent all over the world, but they tended not to last long. Once their activities were discovered by the police, they were sent back to Russia or to prison. In Britain, the only agent of consequence who evaded the police for any length of time was Max Petrovsky, Moscow\u2019s envoy to the British and French Communist Parties from 1924 to 1929.He was born either David Lipetz or Max Goldfarb, and either in Ukraine or Russia, around 1883. Reliable details are scant because he lived his adult life under a series of false names: first, to avoid czarist police as a member of the Jewish Socialist Bund, then to avoid the American authorities in the years immediately before the 1917 revolution, when he helped run the socialist newspaper The Jewish Daily Forward in the United States.In Britain, under the assumed name of Bennett (or Bennet), he spoke with the authority of Moscow. According to Ivy Litvinov, the British-born wife of a Soviet diplomat named Maxim Litvinov, Petrovsky was \u201cthe ugliest man you ever saw, but very charming.\u201dAround the time he arrived in London, in 1920, another Comintern agent named Rose Cohen returned to Britain, after traveling the world distributing party funds. She and Petrovsky fell in love. Cohen, from a poor Jewish family in London\u2019s East End, was lively, clever, literate and hauntingly beautiful, with brown eyes and long dark hair.Petrovsky and Cohen married and moved to Moscow around 1929, where their son Alyosha was born. After Lenin\u2019s death in 1924, Joseph Stalin had assumed leadership. For a time, all went well: Max had an important government job, and Rose became the foreign editor of a new English-language newspaper, The Moscow Daily News.Their idyll collapsed in 1937. Suspected of sympathy with the exiled Leon Trotsky, Petrovsky and Cohen were arrested. Alyosha was sent to an orphanage and never saw his parents again. They were soon shot.Because of Stalin\u2019s purges, it was getting very hard to see Moscow as a beacon of hope rather than as a cruel oppressor. Yet many still managed to do so, for the world looked bleak in 1937. Hitler ran Germany, Mussolini ruled Italy, and the fascists were winning the civil war in Spain. In Britain and America, the Depression, with all the human misery it caused, looked to dedicated Communists like the final death throes of capitalism.As Harry Pollitt saw it, those who had defeated tyranny in Russia \u201ccould never do, nor ever can do, any wrong against the working class.\u201d Pollitt had counted Petrovsky and Cohen among his friends, but mistakes are made, he thought. You can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking eggs.So the agents of the Comintern and loyal comrades like the graduates of the International Lenin School learned to hunt down Trotskyists and anarchists, and to think only of the brave new world that was to follow all this misery.The French Communist leader Andr\u00e9 Marty went to Spain as a political officer in the International Brigades. There, he coldly ordered men to be shot for alleged Trotskyist sympathies. Marty and others called those they executed \u201cenemies of the people,\u201d a term that has found a newly chilling resonance today.Marty is unforgettably portrayed in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d (disguised in some editions as Massart): \u201cSo many men had cursed him at the end. He was always genuinely sorry for them as human beings. He always told himself that and it was one of the last true ideas that was left to him that had ever been his own.\u201dThe Bulgarian Communist Georgi Dimitrov knew some of the Soviet Union\u2019s darkest secrets. Sentenced to death in 1923 for political activities in his homeland, he escaped to Yugoslavia, then settled in Germany. There, in 1933, he was arrested by the Nazis for alleged complicity in the Reichstag fire, which Hitler used as a pretext to suspend parliamentary government. With extraordinary courage in the circumstances, Dimitrov chose to represent himself at trial.\u201cI am defending myself, an accused Communist,\u201d he said from the dock. \u201cI am defending my political honor, my honor as a revolutionary. I am defending my Communist ideology, my ideals.\u201dHe was eventually acquitted for lack of evidence, and moved to Paris, then Moscow. A hero there, he was appointed secretary of the Comintern in 1935. In 1944, he returned to Bulgaria after two decades in exile to lead its Communist Party. In 1946, he became his country\u2019s prime minister.Dimitrov, like Marty, was no sordid careerist, scrambling to power over the dead bodies of innocent people. He thought the great prize was worth the hardship and injustice along the way.Communist parties thrived during World War II thanks to the alliance against fascism. When Stalin dissolved the Comintern in 1943, foreign Communist parties seemed on the verge of a new era, when they would act independently, make their own decisions and no longer be instruments of Soviet foreign policy. But once the war was over, Stalin reasserted his control.In 1947, he created the Communist Information Bureau, or Cominform, to transmit Moscow\u2019s decisions to Communist parties worldwide. In the case of the British party, Stalin personally intervened in the drafting of its postwar manifesto.The difference between the Comintern and the Cominform was that the Cominform merely transmitted decisions. There was no longer any pretense that anyone outside the Kremlin participated in making them. The new agency\u2019s first test came in 1948, when Moscow decided that Yugoslavia\u2019s independent-minded leader, Marshal Tito, was no longer a heroic Communist leader but a traitor. Foreign Communist parties quickly adopted the new line.After Stalin\u2019s death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev prevailed in the succession struggle. In a secret session of the 1956 Party Congress \u2014 secret in that reporters and foreign Communists were excluded \u2014 Khrushchev laid bare the terror that Stalin had inflicted on the Soviet Union over three decades.Finally, the light of Moscow\u2019s beacon went out. The new generation could not now produce people like Pollitt, Dimitrov, Petrovsky and Cohen, who would loyally risk all for what they believed was a great and just cause. To be sure, Communist parties around the world kept the allegiance of many hard-liners and still recruited some young idealists, but 1956 was a turning point, and the Soviet Union as an idea was irretrievably tainted. Thereafter, Communists were as likely to define themselves as against Moscow as for it.Francis Beckett is the author of \u201cEnemy Within: The Rise and Fall of the British Communist Party\u201d and \u201cStalin\u2019s British Victims.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting for New York\u2019s Homeless: What\u2019s Fair?", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byBig CityAfter a long, lagging period of resistance, Mayor Bill de Blasio recently announced a plan to develop 90 shelters across New York, to mitigate the soaring rate of homelessness, which has characterized life in the city as profoundly as luxury-condominium construction in recent years. The plan is part of a broader strategy, outlined in a 128-page paper released by the city, to reduce the number of homeless people living in primary shelters by 2,500 over the next five years, employing prevention \u2014 fighting illegal evictions, for instance \u2014 and rehousing efforts.During the first month of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s administration in 1994, the shelter population stood at approximately 24,000; by the first month of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s administration eight years later, it had risen to 31,000; and by the time Mr. de Blasio took office in 2014, it had reached 53,000. The city contends that the level of street homelessness in New York is lower than it is in other major cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, and that without the measures the de Blasio administration has already taken, the shelter population would be hovering around 70,000.Although the mayor inherited a terrible problem, rooted in escalating housing costs, stagnant wages and cuts to rental assistance programs, his approach has, in many cases, been hastily reactive rather than inspiringly visionary. Not long ago, a report from the office of the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, who like the mayor is a Democrat, revealed that the city\u2019s reliance on putting people up in commercial hotels had jumped greatly during the past year, with bills rounding out around $400,000 a day. Shelters are a temporary response to an acute housing crisis as well, but they provide much more stability than a Holiday Inn. That the authors of the mayor\u2019s report found it necessary to state that new shelters \u201cwill be clean\u201d indicates just how little progress had been made.Conflict, though, is likely to get worse. The mayor\u2019s plan arrives at the precise moment that the City Council has introduced a package of bills known as \u201cfair share\u201d legislation, the goal of which is to shape the city so that both social assets and social responsibilities are distributed according to a sense of geographic equity. Just as poorer neighborhoods should include more good things \u2014 parks, libraries \u2014 affluent neighborhoods should help shoulder the burden of shelters, waste transfer sites and so on, the logic goes. If the Rikers Island complex were to close, for example, smaller jails would pop up around the city, and they would need to be in Forest Hills, Queens, as much as they would in the South Bronx.The de Blasio plan calls for shelters to be created in the neighborhoods where homeless people come from, so they can be as near as possible to the schools their children might attend, and to family and friends who could offer support. To whatever extent that might seem to limit disruption, fair share advocates believe such an approach only exacerbates the problems of concentrated poverty.\u201cIf a school has so many homeless and low-income kids, it\u2019s hard for a school to do well,\u201d said Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat who backs the legislation. \u201cWhen things are borne fairly, we pay more attention to them doing well. It\u2019s sort of the opposite of Rikers.

{"Headline": "\u2018Wild Nights\u2019 Offers a History of Sleep (and Sleeplessness)", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesThe night before I stopped sleeping, I slept. This is something I try to explain to any well-meaning person who asks about my mysterious, pigheaded, yearslong case of insomnia. It came on abruptly. It was precipitated by no crisis I could discern. It was not the culmination of many years of poor or varied sleep. One day, I simply closed my eyes and nothing happened. It was as if I\u2019d been poisoned.Whenever a self-help book about sleep crosses my desk, I toss it. I already know what it says. Not getting enough: Bad. Pills: Avoid. Sunlight: Essential. But when I saw Benjamin Reiss\u2019s \u201cWild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World,\u201d I lunged for it, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if my fellow travelers in exhaustion had the same response. Certainly, strangers reacted favorably to Reiss while the book was still in progress. As he writes in his epilogue: \u201cSomething about becoming the Sleep Guy seems to have made me a magnet for interesting divulgences and unusual conversations.\u201dMost people, even those who sleep well, have at least one story about a brutal cage match with Morpheus.What makes \u201cWild Nights\u201d so liberating is that it is descriptive, not prescriptive. It does not hector. It barely engages with the science of slumber at all. It aims, rather, to describe the social history and evolving culture of sleep \u2014 through literature (Reiss is an English professor at Emory University), through ethnographies, through old diaries and memoirs and medical texts.I wish the quality of this book didn\u2019t jiggle like a sine curve. Only every other chapter, or thereabouts, pops with insight. The others stray too far from the subject or hew too closely to the familiar. I already know that the 24/7 demands of the information economy conspire against sleep. I certainly do not need Reiss\u2019s analysis of Kanye West\u2019s video \u201cFamous,\u201d which includes this spoonful of jargon-flavored goo: \u201cThis particular bit of public, collective sleeping practically sacralizes fame.\u201dYet solitary sleeping generated problems of its own. Moralists panicked over masturbation. (During the 19th century, a small market of appliances discouraging it, like erection alarms and penis cases, bloomed.) Neurotic worries over children\u2019s sleep grew. Dr. Benjamin Spock, the cuddly child-rearing eminence of the mid-20th century, recommended securing kids in bed with a loop of badminton net.Industrialization did not just privatize sleep. It also consolidated it and then shoehorned it into rhythms better suited to commerce and railway travel than the rhythms of the seasons \u2014 or our bodies\u2019 own needs. We know that before the machine age, people slept in a variety of ways, including (famously) \u201csegmented sleep,\u201d or sleep in two shifts. But with industrialization, we became servants of clock time, \u201ca time newly homogeneous across season, region or profession.\u201dThe most harrowing parts of \u201cWild Nights,\u201d however, are not about the great loss of sleep diversity. They\u2019re about sleep inequality, for want of a better term. Sleep is supposedly a great equalizer \u2014 \u201cth\u2019indifferent judge between the high and low,\u201d as the Elizabethan poet Philip Sidney once wrote \u2014 but Reiss makes it achingly clear that sleep is anything but democratically distributed. Or interpreted.Nowhere was this more evident than in the institution of slavery. Frederick Douglass wrote that \u201cmore slaves are whipped for oversleeping than any other fault.\u201d Slaves slept in squalor and were never permitted sufficient rest; yet somehow, Thomas Jefferson took a slave\u2019s tendency to fall instantly asleep as evidence not of bone-weariness, but intellectual inferiority \u2014 the slave lacked introspection.This, more than 150 years before Twitter.Yet sometimes Reiss overindulges his penchant for literary analysis, simply using sleep as an excuse to riff on authors he loves. Embedded throughout \u201cWild Nights\u201d is also a nostalgia, no doubt influenced by Thoreau (whom he calls the book\u2019s \u201cguiding spirit\u201d), for a time when our bodies were synchronized with the seasons, unchained from the adamantine demands of the clock.But the days of candles and oil lamps didn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a good night\u2019s rest. As the author acknowledges, insomnia is an ancient problem, for which there have been a staggering variety of proposed cures over the centuries \u2014 including the strategic application of one sheep lung to each side of the head.And on occasion, Reiss\u2019s perspective becomes so narrow it brings to mind that old aphorism \u201cTo a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d To a writer about sleep, everything looks like an uncomfortable bed. At one point Reiss declares that \u201cit\u2019s not too much to speculate\u201d whether the solitary confinement of children to their own rooms was \u201cone of the hidden sources of the rebellious youth movements that marked the late 20th century.\u201dActually, it is too much to speculate.What does remain certain is that humans will continue to try to subdue sleep. If putting children to bed by themselves was once unfathomable to us, what might the next unthinkable development be? Reiss writes about a NASA-financed project that explored inducing astronauts into a \u201cprolonged torpor\u201d for a mission to Mars. It didn\u2019t make much headway. But researchers are still working on the possibilities of human hibernation, and maybe even losing sleep over it.Advertisement"}

Cuomo arrives here early on Sunday, he will bring a message of solidarity with the Israeli people, a smattering of economic ideas and a small coterie of red-eyed staffers.What he will take away, politically speaking, could be even more valuable: an undivided moment on the international stage.The trip was announced with little notice on Wednesday morning, and the governor\u2019s exact plans came into focus just hours before he departed on Saturday after several days of scrambling by his staff. What was disclosed about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s itinerary seemed heavy on symbolism and light on downtime.The whirlwind tour, with less than 24 hours planned on the ground, was scheduled to include meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, both of whom rearranged their Sunday schedules to accommodate Mr. Cuomo\u2019s visit.The impromptu nature of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s trip is not accidental. With a rash of anti-Semitic threats and racist vandalism occurring in New York and nationwide, the governor said he had made a deliberate decision to travel to Israel now as a show of support.\u201cThe undercurrent is this: There has been a wave of anti-Semitism, and it has been very disturbing to members of the Jewish community,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Friday. That anxiety, he said, needed to be addressed with substantial, intercontinental gestures.\u201cYeah, you could go down the block to a temple, but if you\u2019re really sincere, you do more,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cYou act more boldly. And the actions should be commensurate to the grievances.\u201dThat said, Mr. Cuomo also added an appearance at the Park East Synagogue in Manhattan on Saturday before heading off for his 10-hour flight.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his second term, insisted that the trip was not politically motivated, but a genuine response to the surge in anti-Semitic acts. The governor\u2019s office also noted that the trip was part of a broader effort by the administration, including an increase in funding for security at religious schools.The trip is being paid for by the state, not by Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, though its exact cost was unclear. (The governor\u2019s office noted that costs would be kept down because the entourage would not be staying overnight.)Still, experts said the trip was likely to pay dividends among Jewish voters and supporters, a core constituency for any elected official from New York, which has the largest population of Jewish residents outside Israel.\u201cThe Jewish community, that is still very important in New York electoral politics,\u201d said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University at New Paltz, \u201cand in the financing of them and national campaigns.\u201dProfessor Benjamin was referring to speculation surrounding Mr. Cuomo, whose name has come up as a possible Democratic candidate for president in 2020.But on Friday, Mr. Cuomo spoke in candid terms about the connection \u2014 or lack of one, he said \u2014 between his advocacy and his ambitions.\u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve always done, and this is an action I would always take.\u201dThe 2014 trip was not a solo mission: Mr. Cuomo led a delegation of elected officials, including the then-speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, and the then-leader of the Senate, Dean G. Skelos.This time, Mr. Cuomo is alone; both Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver were convicted of federal corruption charges, and their successors \u2014 Carl E. Heastie in the Assembly and John J. Flanagan in the Senate \u2014 did not come along.That may provide Mr. Cuomo with more room to shine, though he denied that seeking the spotlight had anything to do with making what amounted to 12,000-mile day trip.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a long trip for a short period of time and yes, it\u2019s a dramatic action,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the point.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Sunday about an impromptu trip to Israel by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo described incorrectly an earlier visit he made there. The governor visited near the Gaza border; he did not go to Gaza.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Reasons Trump\u2019s Promised Tax Overhaul Won\u2019t Be So Easy", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s failure to push through the broad health care overhaul he promised has raised questions about the prospects of a sweeping rewrite of the tax code. It is a politically fraught and dizzyingly complex endeavor that pits powerful interests against one another and threatens to increase the federal deficit.\u201cTrump has to win on this,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation who advised Mr. Trump on tax policy during his campaign and transition. \u201cThere\u2019s no margin for error here, and failure is just not an option.\u201dJust how difficult will it be? Here are five obstacles to getting a new tax law:The greatest hurdle to a tax overhaul may be the White House itself. Mr. Trump has yet to make basic decisions about the structure and scope of his plan, the strategy for pushing it through Congress or even who in his administration will be in charge of crafting and selling it. While White House officials said they would unveil a plan weeks ago, one has not materialized.\u201cObviously, we\u2019re driving the train on this,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday as he deflected basic questions about what the president\u2019s proposal would look like. That is hardly obvious to many members of Congress, administration insiders and outside observers who now question whether Mr. Trump and his close advisers are capable of executing on such an ambitious and high-stakes negotiation.Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will most likely play a major role in devising a tax package. He said last week that the administration would soon release a plan. He also predicted that the tax effort would be easier than health care, a notion that many longtime congressional aides consider laughable. With many central jobs still unfilled at the Treasury Department, Mr. Mnuchin does not yet have the number-crunching and policy-analyzing firepower he needs to lead a major tax overhaul effort.Then there is Gary Cohn, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, who has told people that he is leading the president\u2019s tax overhaul effort. Mr. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has expressed interest in using revenue raised by a special tax on American companies\u2019 offshore earnings to finance a major infrastructure rebuilding effort, an approach that could have some appeal among Democrats eager to see new spending on roads and bridges.Yet House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, are among those who have held firm to the idea of a tax overhaul that does not increase the debt.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that Republicans still very much care about balancing the federal budget,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cAnd in truth, this doesn\u2019t have to be a choice.\u201dBut choices will have to be made.One choice dividing Republicans is whether to include a large import tax, also known as a \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d in the package. Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady have been aggressively pushing the inclusion of a 20 percent tax on imports that they think would raise as much as $1 trillion to offset cuts in individual and business tax rates.Such a proposal appeals to Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct for toughness at the border, promoting American-made products and igniting the creation of new manufacturing jobs. While he has sent mixed signals about whether he supports including it in a tax overhaul, the president told The New York Times this month that he did. \u201cI\u2019m the king of that,\u201d he said.It is a clich\u00e9 in Washington to say that tax reform creates winners and losers. But it is true, and that is one of the most formidable obstacles that has frustrated previous efforts at enacting broad changes to the tax code.The tax code is riddled with special-interest provisions and deductions enacted over many decades. Reorienting is bound to give advantages to certain groups and impose disadvantages on others.Popular tax breaks for individuals such as deductions for mortgage interest, charitable giving, and state and local taxes account for huge amounts of revenue. They would probably have to be curbed or eliminated in order to compensate for bringing down tax rates. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Brady have proposed doing so.The real estate industry, charitable groups, municipal bond traders, and state and local governments are just a few of the constituencies that are likely to revolt at the first hint of such changes. And they could be expected to spend freely to defeat them.The arcane procedural rules of Congress \u2014 the same ones that contributed to the demise of the health care repeal bill \u2014 will complicate the process of pushing through a tax overhaul. The White House and congressional Republicans would need to decide whether to use a process known as budget reconciliation to speed changes through Congress on a simple majority vote or allow the legislation to proceed under normal rules. Go with the normal rules and they would need 60 votes in the Senate \u2014 including some Democratic support \u2014 to pass it.Because of the strictures of the reconciliation process, the plan would not be allowed to add to deficits outside of a 10-year budget window. That is why President George W. Bush had to include a sunset provision in his tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.But businesses that crave long-term certainty are not likely to favor such an impermanent approach. And on Monday, Mr. Brady said he had no intention of producing such a plan.\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about leapfrogging America back to the lead of the pack, if we\u2019re serious about creating jobs and jump-starting this economy, a 10-year bill will not accomplish either of those,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cThe most pro-growth tax reform is a permanent tax reform.\u201dThat is a lot that could go wrong. Notice we have not even mentioned Democratic opposition.An earlier version of this article imprecisely described strictures of the reconciliation process. The tax plan would not be allowed to add to deficits outside of a 10-year budget window, not for the next 10 years.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carrie Lam Wins Vote to Become Hong Kong\u2019s Next Leader", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A committee dominated by supporters of the Chinese government chose Carrie Lam as Hong Kong\u2019s next leader on Sunday, opting for Beijing\u2019s preferred candidate in a move likely to dismay residents who see the city\u2019s freedoms as being under threat from China.Mrs. Lam, a former No. 2 official in the city, received 777 out of 1,163 votes cast to become the next chief executive, as Hong Kong\u2019s leader is called. She defeated John Tsang, a former finance secretary who polls indicated was more popular with the public.The leader of this semiautonomous Chinese city of 7.3 million is chosen by just 1,194 electors, most of them business and political figures who have close ties to Beijing.In an apparent act of protest, one elector drew a cross on the ballot with check marks, and another wrote an obscenity on it.Hong Kong is guaranteed civil liberties and a high degree of autonomy under the terms of the 1997 handover that returned the city, a former British colony, to Chinese rule \u2014 an arrangement known as \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d But many believe China has violated that agreement with increasingly open interference in its affairs.\u201cChina promised that Hong Kong people would run Hong Kong,\u201d said Mabel Yau, 52, one of hundreds of protesters outside the voting site. \u201cToday, only 1,200 people are representing us in electing the chief executive. Is it fair?\u201dSuch concerns are unlikely to be eased by the choice of Mrs. Lam, who was a loyal deputy to Leung Chun-ying, the unpopular departing chief executive.In a speech after the vote, Mrs. Lam, who will be the first female chief executive in Hong Kong history, vowed to prioritize mending social rifts. \u201cHong Kong, our home, is suffering from quite a lot of divisiveness,\u201d she said. During her campaign, she added, \u201cI heard so much more from people\u2019s hearts and learned and experienced many new things as well as different angles to things. I see my shortcomings and understand that I must put in more efforts.\u201dSuch economic grievances have fed calls for greater public participation in elections, although no change in that area is likely to occur quickly under the new administration. Mrs. Lam has said she will not rush to restart talks on reforming the electoral process, citing a need to avoid confrontation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Raves About Chicago Have Become Rants", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 Donald J. Trump\u2019s feelings about Chicago couldn\u2019t have been clearer. He loved the place.It was 2004, and Mr. Trump, then a developer and reality show star, was waging a charm campaign here. He raved about Chicago\u2019s \u201cstunning\u201d skyline and admired its architectural ingenuity as he proposed adding his own building to the mix. It was a \u201cgreat city,\u201d he said, right up there with his hometown, New York. Had Twitter existed at the time, Mr. Trump\u2019s hashtag might have read #mykindoftown.Politics could be partly to blame for Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent change of heart. Chicago is Democratic to its core. It is where Barack Obama got his political start. And it is an easy foil when describing, as Mr. Trump does quite a bit, how dire urban America has become.But personal pique may also be an important factor when it comes to Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the city.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that he has a bone to pick with Chicago,\u201d said Jesus G. Garcia, a Democratic Cook County commissioner.And in 2014, long after Chicago had mostly accepted the 98-story Trump International Hotel and Tower and its nautical, curving walls near gems like the Wrigley Building, there came a final, surprise flourish: Mr. Trump\u2019s name suddenly began appearing on the building\u2019s side in shiny, two-story-high stainless-steel letters. Chicago groaned.The idea that the police have retreated under siege will not go away. But even if it's true, is it necessarily bad?\u201cI saw a big \u2018T\u2019 going up and thought, \u2018Oh, they are not doing this,\u2019\u201d said Margaret Riordan, a native Chicagoan whose downtown condominium has a clear view of the letters. \u201cAs a general rule, it\u2019s just considered bad taste to talk about your money, and certainly bad taste to be showy about it. That\u2019s just not a Midwestern thing.\u201dTensions between Mr. Trump and Chicagoans escalated again in 2016, as Mr. Trump fought for the Republican nomination and thousands of people converged in the heart of Chicago in March to await his arrival.Cars with license plates from Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin inched their way into parking garages on the University of Illinois at Chicago campus. Hundreds of people poured out of an \u201cL\u201d station, many holding signs with anti-Trump slogans. Skirmishes broke out between Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters and his opponents, who exchanged taunts and shoves.Until then, Mr. Trump had made only tentative forays here as a candidate. For this rally, his campaign chose a venue that to some people seemed puzzlingly provocative: a university known for its diverse population of African-American, Muslim and Latino students.Then an announcement was made before the candidate even appeared on stage: The rally was off.But why it had been canceled was an open question. The local police said that the situation was under control and that they had not been consulted. Some here, irked by Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion later that his rights had been violated, speculated that it had always been his plan to call it off.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see anybody get hurt,\u201d Mr. Trump said on CNN that evening. \u201cAnd you would have had some people possibly getting hurt, or beyond.\u201dAfter that, Mr. Trump mostly steered clear of Chicago. And Chicago \u2014 even some in the top echelon of the city\u2019s establishment Republicans \u2014 largely steered clear of him.In a city where outnumbered Republicans tend to stick together, some top donors who usually gather checks from their friends stayed home. When Steven Mnuchin, then Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman, approached William Kunkler, an influential Chicagoan who served with Mr. Mnuchin on the board of Sears Holdings Corporation, Mr. Kunkler was blunt.\u201cI can\u2019t help you on this,\u201d Mr. Kunkler, who had helped lead fund-raising efforts here for Mitt Romney, recalled telling Mr. Mnuchin, now the Treasury secretary.\u201cThis is one Republican who is never jumping on that bus,\u201d Mr. Kunkler reflected in an interview.Ron Gidwitz, a stalwart fund-raiser among Chicago Republicans who led Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts here, said plenty of Chicagoans did join his White House bid. He cited a fund-raising luncheon where several dozen people gathered inside Mr. Trump\u2019s Chicago tower as Mr. Trump sought advice on his vice-presidential choices, then posed for photos with guests and the local security detail.\u201cThey weren\u2019t always the traditional Republicans I would normally go to first,\u201d Mr. Gidwitz said. \u201cBut he brought out people you might not usually see.\u201dElaine Conti \u2014 a Republican donor who was introduced to Mr. Trump at a hastily arranged meet-and-greet at the Polish National Alliance, a fraternal society on the Northwest Side \u2014 said that as he shook her hand, he asked her what she thought of Chicago.\u201cHe let me know that he wants to fix it, the robberies, the killings,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thinks Chicago is a mess.\u201dYet others here dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks as devoid of solutions and concrete federal help. They say the comments are aimed at alarming white, nonurban voters, and at landing political blows on a city that was home to Mr. Obama and is run by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat who advised Mr. Obama.Not so, said a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who wrote in an email: \u201cThe entire premise of your story is false and ridiculous. The president doesn\u2019t have a disdain for Chicago, he has a disdain for senseless violence. No one can deny that Chicago has a problem with violent crime, and the president has made a commitment to return our country to a law and order country, not just in Chicago but in every city in America.\u201dMeanwhile, the pace of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments has only picked up.None of it has gone unnoticed by Mr. Emanuel, a leader who can be as loud and contrary as Mr. Trump. At first, his public response seemed uncharacteristically muted. He said he welcomed federal help in the form, for instance, of tougher gun prosecutions. But nothing has been announced.\u201cDonald Trump sees this more as a punch line than a true, top-of-mind concern,\u201d said David Axelrod, a friend of Mr. Emanuel\u2019s and former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.Lately, Mr. Emanuel has sounded more testy, questioning last month \u201cwhether the president cares enough about violence in our city to do more than talk or tweet about it.\u201dMr. Emanuel\u2019s spokesman, Adam Collins, said Mr. Trump\u2019s derision had been aimed not just at Chicago, but at urban America writ large. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t hear is him talking about the carnage in rural America that\u2019s being caused by the opiate crisis gripping those areas,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cOne resonates with his political base, the other doesn\u2019t.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s friends say he is acquainted with Mr. Trump through Mr. Emanuel\u2019s brother, Ari, who once worked as Mr. Trump\u2019s agent. But the two are at odds on many issues and did not meet until December, Mr. Collins said. Still, in 2010, Mr. Emanuel\u2019s first mayoral campaign received $50,000 from Mr. Trump, who also gave to other Chicago politicians.Richard A.

While whoever is hired for that job will ultimately shape the vision for how to use the gift, Dr. Tisch said in an interview that she hoped the library would be able to expand popular offerings like English language classes, as well as to add job training courses, after-school homework help and programs aimed at exposing students to the rich holdings of the system\u2019s four research centers.\u201cIf we get the right director, and hopefully we will,\u201d Dr. Tisch said, \u201cthis becomes a blueprint for what urban libraries across the country should be turning themselves into.\u201dChristopher Platt, the chief branch library officer, said that, to his knowledge, \u201cThis is the first educational gift to public libraries of this scale in the country.\u201dThe New York Public Library, which has branches throughout Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island \u2014 Brooklyn and Queens have their own systems \u2014 receives just over half its overall operating costs, and more than 80 percent of the operating costs of its branches, from the city. The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio has increased funding to the city\u2019s three library systems by $43 million in the last two years, allowing the libraries to expand offerings and opening hours.The New York Public Library is also in the process of renovating many branches, including five of the original libraries financed by Andrew Carnegie.Apart from city agencies, the library is the primary provider of free adult literacy and English language classes in the city, and in recent years it has quintupled the number of seats in such classes, serving 12,000 people at 42 locations. But Mr. Platt said that the demand for such classes was much greater than that.\u201cThat\u2019s a drop in the bucket,\u201d he said.The library system also has 3,000 slots available in after school programs and 100,000 slots in technology classes for children and adults. Adult coding classes have had waiting lists of around 1,000 people, a library spokeswoman, Angela Montefinise, said.Dr. Tisch, whose husband sits on the library\u2019s board of directors, said that she grew up going to the Seward Park Library on the Lower East Side with her friends and sometimes with her grandmother, an immigrant from Poland. She said that some people had urged her to finance a building project for the library, but she was more interested in supporting programs. She said she would not micromanage the use of the gift, but she will participate in the search for the education director.Dr. Tisch has not commented on the board\u2019s actions, and she did not break that streak in an interview this week. Instead, she laid out a new political agenda for herself: She said that, along with her gift, she planned to push the mayor to increase funding for the library system so that more branches can open on Sundays. Currently only eight of the system\u2019s 92 locations are open seven days a week; almost all others are open six days. As a comparison, Dr. Tisch pulled out a print out of programs at the Scarsdale Public Library, showing its long opening hours, including evenings Monday through Wednesday, and five hours on Sunday.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a genius to know, if the kids in Scarsdale need it, then the kids in the Bronx need it, too,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Trump in White House, Some Executives Ask, Why Not Me?", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseHaving reached the top of a major corporation and amassed a fortune, chief executives often wonder: What\u2019s next?After Donald J. Trump, the answer may well be a run for the White House.Mr. Trump had no political or military experience, the traditional routes to high political office. Virtually his only qualification was his business career, and a checkered one at that, considering his own brush with personal bankruptcy.\u201cThere is this sense that if Trump got it, why shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d said David Gergen, co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School and an adviser to four presidents. \u201cThey\u2019ve been more successful, they have more experience, and they\u2019ve run a public company, which is more equivalent to what a president does than a private company\u201d like the Trump Organization.Stu Loeser, once the press secretary for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who considered a presidential run last year, concurred. \u201cIf you run a company that has employed tens of thousands of people, and generated lots of profit and been undeniably successful, and you look at a sitting president who, to be honest, a lot of business people don\u2019t have much respect for, you think, why not me?\u201d he said.Mr. Loeser now runs his own strategic consulting firm, and told me he has clients who are business executives considering a run for high public office. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you their names, obviously,\u201d he said.Boldface corporate names widely discussed as contenders for the next Democratic presidential nomination include chief executives like Howard Schultz of Starbucks, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com, along with Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer, and Oprah Winfrey, chairwoman and chief executive of Harpo Inc., which owns half of the Oprah Winfrey Network.All deny they\u2019re running, or even seriously considering it. But everyone demurs so far ahead of the first primaries, as did Hillary Clinton four years ago, and it hasn\u2019t stopped anyone from speculating. That\u2019s especially the case for people who, appalled by the Trump administration, can hardly wait for the next campaign.\u201cI feel many of these chief executives are responding to a public longing for a strongman, or woman, a strong leader,\u201d Mr. Gergen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that\u2019s why Trump got elected. You\u2019re seeing the same thing in Europe, in Asia, in a long list of countries. People are dissatisfied with standard politicians. Military types and business people with a strong track record offer an attractive alternative.\u201dApart from proven business experience, they have widespread name recognition or identification with major consumer brands. And they have enough money to finance their own campaigns.I\u2019ve spoken this week to multiple people who have at least discussed the possibility of running for office with Mr. Schultz and Mr. Iger. (All declined to be named discussing what were private conversations.)Mr. Schultz, 63, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $3 billion, came close to making a bid last year, but backed out after concluding it would be very difficult to defeat Mrs. Clinton, who seemed to have the Democratic nomination all but locked up and at the time seemed likely to win the presidency.Those circumstances have obviously changed drastically. With Mr. Trump in office, the next Democratic race appears wide open, and many friends and potential donors are urging Mr. Schultz to run.Mr. Schultz seemed to pave the way in December, when he announced he\u2019d step down as Starbucks\u2019 chief executive this April. But he continues to be actively involved in the expansion of the company\u2019s high-end \u201croasteries\u201d as well as its social-impact initiatives.\u201cHoward Schultz is definitely being pursued,\u201d Mr. Gergen said. \u201cHe has a powerful social conscience. He comes from a very different place than the kind of chief executive with a big ego who wants the trappings of presidential power.\u201dMr. Schultz declined to comment.Last year Mr. Iger, 66, told The Hollywood Reporter that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office,\u201d and last week the entertainment publication fueled renewed speculation when it reported that Mr. Iger had discussed the possibility with Mr. Bloomberg.People who have discussed a possible presidential run with Mr. Iger told me that his discussion with Mr. Bloomberg, some years ago, focused more on a possible run for mayor of New York City, where Mr. Iger has an apartment. New York has long welcomed nonresident candidates like Mrs. Clinton, so Mr. Iger\u2019s California residency isn\u2019t seen as an obstacle.Both Mr. Iger and Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment.Whether any of those jobs, including the presidency, would actually be better than being chief executive of Disney remains an open question. After earlier announcing his retirement, Mr. Iger recently said he was willing to extend his contract, which would eliminate the need for any high-profile exit strategy, at least for the next few years.Campaign buttons emblazoned with \u201cVote for Benioff\u201d and \u201cMarc Benioff for President\u201d circulated two years ago at Salesforce\u2019s annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, which draws hundreds of thousands of participants and has been viewed by some as a likely launching pad for any Benioff campaign.Like Mr. Schultz, Mr. Benioff has pursued an ambitious social and philanthropic agenda. He started \u201cPledge 1%,\u201d the Salesforce model of donating 1 percent of their product, 1 percent of their equity and 1 percent of employees\u2019 time to help nonprofits achieve their missions \u2014 a practice that Salesforce says is now followed by 1,400 companies. Mr. Benioff was an outspoken defender of gay and lesbian rights and helped create a network of corporate leaders to oppose bills limiting L.G.B.T. rights in states like Indiana, Georgia and North Carolina.Mr. Benioff, 52, whose stake in Salesforce alone is worth over $3 billion and who has a net worth estimated by Forbes at over $4 billion, has also written three books, including the best-selling \u201cBehind the Cloud.\u201d Still, he\u2019s hardly a household name, and is best known in business and technology circles.Asked for comment, Mr. Benioff said, \u201cBusiness is the greatest platform for change.\u201dMs. Sandberg\u2019s coming nationwide tour to promote the new book she co-authored, \u201cOption B,\u201d which describes coming to terms with her husband\u2019s sudden death in 2015 and other stories of coping with adversity, has fueled speculation (and possible wishful thinking) that the book could be a springboard for a presidential campaign.As a billionaire ($1.47 billion, Forbes estimates) and a key executive of the hugely successful Facebook, Ms. Sandberg already has enormous name recognition. Her previous book, \u201cLean In,\u201d was a best-seller and inspired a rallying cry for women. She has worked in politics before, as an assistant to the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, and was a donor to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. She was considered a candidate for a top post in any Clinton administration.Ms. Sandberg has denied any immediate presidential ambitions, insisting that she loves her job at Facebook. At age 47, she\u2019s under no pressure to run this election cycle.(Widespread reports that the Facebook founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would run for president seem even more far-fetched. The speculation appears to have been set off by a Bloomberg News report that Mr. Zuckerberg would retain voting control of Facebook even if he sold his shares and served in a government position for up to two years. Mr. Zuckerberg has denied any interest in running.)Then there\u2019s Ms. Winfrey, 63, who for many Democrats might amount to the dream candidate: She has unrivaled star power, is an African-American woman, has run a successful business, and has a fortune estimated by Forbes at $3 billion.\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Ms. Winfrey replied. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh gee, I don\u2019t have the experience, I don\u2019t know enough.\u2019 And now I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Oh! Oh.\u2019\u201dBut when Mr. Rubenstein began to ask, \u201cAs you consider whether you are going to run for president of the United States or not. ..,\u201d she interjected, \u201cNo, that won\u2019t be happening.\u201dWhile some may disparage Mr. Trump\u2019s credentials for the presidency, he did bring to his campaign a level of recognition that will be hard for other executives to replicate, with the possible exception of Ms. Winfrey.\u201cTrump spent decades building his brand and his image as a successful businessman,\u201d Mr. Loeser said. \u201cHe was the star of one of the most-watched television shows in America. If you landed at La Guardia, you saw the Trump jet. If you went to Las Vegas, the tallest building in town has Trump\u2019s name emblazoned on it.\u201dMr. Gergen agreed. \u201cTrump has been a performer for years,\u201d he said. \u201cMost chief executives aren\u2019t performers.\u201dAnd chief executives \u201caren\u2019t prepared for the scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Gergen said. \u201cIt\u2019s especially tough to work with the press. They\u2019re used to having layers of people around them, but in politics you\u2019re out there dealing with reporters every day.\u201d\u201cLook at Rex Tillerson,\u201d he added, referring to the Exxon chief turned secretary of state. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely well regarded in corporate circles, but he\u2019s having trouble with the press.\u201dMr. Loeser said he was helping clients assess the kind of attacks they could expect in a hard-fought campaign.\u201cYou have to anticipate how they\u2019ll come after you, because they will,\u201d Mr. Loeser said. \u201cOprah is one of the most beloved people in America. But has anyone gone through every minute and every hour of every show she\u2019s ever done to see if there\u2019s anything controversial? Because someone will.\u201dMr. Gergen suggested that some chief executives might want to lower their sights. \u201cI think business chief executives tend to make better governors or mayors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be more pragmatic and less ideological. Some of the names you\u2019re hearing, I have trouble picturing them with the Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders wing of the party. I wouldn\u2019t call that a match made in heaven.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were all French, all French ma\u00eetre d\u2019s, all French wines, all French suppliers. France owned the city gastronomically until the moment when we started to do our own thing our own way.\u201dExactly whose idea it was to franchise Mr. Robuchon\u2019s restaurant is unclear. Loto Quebec declined to make anyone available for an interview. In a written statement, it said that \u201cdespite the unquestionably impressive culinary talent pool that exists in Quebec, we wished to set ourselves apart on the international scene in order to enhance our already exceptional Quebec offerings.\u201d\u201cQuebec has a lot of international-caliber chefs and creative newcomers,\u201d Mr. Laprise wrote in an email. \u201cAll of us would have welcomed an investment such as the one offered to the casino for our different endeavors.\u201dJust how much money is involved remains a mystery to the public. A figure of 11 million Canadian dollars for the renovations alone is often cited, although its source is unclear. In its statement, the lottery agency said only that the cost to build and outfit the restaurant \u201cis below what has been suggested.\u201d (Provincial information laws allow the lottery organization to keep contracts secret.)After four years in New York, he came to Quebec in 2000; when he was named to head the Robuchon restaurant, he was running the restaurants at the government\u2019s casino in the Mont Tremblant ski area.One recent afternoon, as his staff began setting places and preparing dishes for the evening service (the restaurant is open only for dinner, and is closed two days a week), Mr. Gonzalez praised the Quebec farmers who supply his lamb, cream and a small portion of his cheese. And his praise extended to several of Montreal\u2019s chefs, including Mr. Laprise.But Mr. Gonzalez was also adamant that the Robuchon franchise fills a void in Montreal\u2019s restaurant scene. \u201cI think Montreal now is more interesting because Mr. Robuchon has come into the city,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very huge endorsement. I think what they needed was the big name.\u201dWhen challenged by lawmakers, Mr. Leit\u00e3o repeatedly defended the decision by Loto Quebec to team up with a prominent, if French, chef. \u201cIs it a problem that a world-famous chef is promoting Quebec gastronomy elsewhere?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy God! If these are the kind of problems we have to deal with, Mr. Speaker, bring them on.\u201dAs irritated as Mr. McMillan is about what he sees as a government subsidy for Mr. Robuchon, he is equally adamant that neither he nor any of the other dissidents want to run the casino restaurant. If he had his way, the casino would have consulted all of the city\u2019s principal chefs and hired a young cook they recommended.\u201cI\u2019m just disappointed,\u201d Mr. McMillan said, pausing to ask an employee, whom he called \u201cbrother,\u201d to close a service door admitting a blast of cold air into Le Vin Papillon. \u201cThis was a great opportunity.

Constructed by the Roman emperor Constantine I in the fourth century, the shrine covers the cave in which, the faithful believe, Jesus was buried before his resurrection.The edifice, contained in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, is one of the faith\u2019s holiest sites. It was worn down by centuries of water damage, fire, candle smoke, humidity, bird droppings, human visitors and disputes among feuding denominations, which were previously unable to agree on plans to fix the shrine.\u201cFor the first time in over two centuries, this sacred edicule has been restored,\u201d the Greek Orthodox patriarch, Theophilos III of Jerusalem, said Wednesday, when the shrine reopened to the public. \u201cThis is not only a gift to our holy land, but to the whole world.\u201dThe Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations share custody of the church. The tomb was last restored in 1810 after a fire, but the religious custodians were compelled last year to make repairs after the Israeli authorities deemed the building unsafe.The restoration cost more than $3 million, financed mostly by a donation from the World Monuments Fund, an American nonprofit group. Other funding came from the three denominations and a personal donation from King Abdullah II of Jordan.The work, which began last May, was directed by Antonia Moropoulou, a professor at the National Technical University of Athens. The restorers removed the exterior stones from three sides of the edicule and created a special grout to \u201cbond the masonry to the rock that lies at the core of the structure,\u201d according to the World Monuments Fund.In October, the restoration team revealed and removed a stone slab covering a marble bench on which Jesus was buried, according to tradition. The team also created an opening in a wall in the tomb, through which visitors can peer at the underlying rock.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s at Stake in a Health Bill That Slashes the Safety Net", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhat do we lose when social insurance unravels?It is startling to realize just how much the social safety net expanded during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. In 2016, means-tested entitlements like Medicaid and food stamps absorbed 3.8 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, almost a full percentage point more than in 2008.Public social spending writ large \u2014 including health care, pensions, unemployment insurance, poverty alleviation and the like \u2014 reached 19.3 percent of G.D.P., the most in decades and almost three percentage points more than in the year before Mr. Obama took office.It didn\u2019t stick, though.And in the biggest step to shrink the social safety net since President Franklin D. Roosevelt started building it in the rubble of the Great Depression, Republicans in the House plan to vote this week to undo the Affordable Care Act. That law was Mr. Obama\u2019s singular contribution toward an American welfare state, the biggest expansion of the nation\u2019s safety net in half a century.Voters, pay attention. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, will try to sell his plan by leveraging Americans\u2019 atavistic fear of Big Government, offering people the freedom to choose whether to have health insurance. You may want to focus instead on what the United States stands to lose.Mr. Ryan\u2019s proposal, the American Health Care Act, doesn\u2019t merely undo the expansion of Medicaid to the near poor. It converts the entire program into a block grant to the states and gradually strangles it by increasing federal funding more slowly than projected spending growth. Not even the Clinton administration\u2019s welfare reform of 1996, the other notable revision of the American safety net, proposed such a redistribution.The American Health Care Act, by contrast, is decidedly about cutting people off. David M. Cutler, an expert on the economics of health care at Harvard University, put it like this: \u201cNo other Congress or administration has ever put forward a plan with the intention of having fewer people covered.\u201dAnd that is just the first pass.What will happen? Millions of Americans \u2014 poor ones, mainly \u2014 will use much less health care. They will make fewer outpatient visits, have fewer mammograms and cholesterol checks. Access to Medicaid in Oregon increased use of health care services by some 25 percent. Losing Medicaid is likely to reduce use by a similar amount.Among those who survive, more are likely to report themselves in poorer health. Their rates of depression are likely to rise. Critically, their finances will certainly suffer. This provides a direct glimpse into how cutting off health insurance won\u2019t just reduce access to health care among the poor. It will ricochet across society.The Ryan plan \u2014 caught between right-wing Republicans in the House who would like to cut health care subsidies further and centrists in the Senate who are loath to leave so many Americans uninsured \u2014 may not pass in its present form. The administration could short-circuit the Affordable Care Act by dragging its feet on enforcing the insurance mandate or simply not advertising plans on the exchanges. In any event, public health insurance will take a big hit.Might an uninsured mother become more reluctant to let her child play outdoors and risk an expensive broken arm? Might depression and mental health problems destabilize families, feeding down into the health, education and well-being of the next generation?Advertisement"}

The events included a memorabilia tour with vintage photos, game-worn jerseys and skates, as well as the lighting of the waterfront Ferris wheel, two skyscrapers and the Seahawks\u2019 CenturyLink Field in the Metropolitans\u2019 green and red.The Metropolitans were created in 1915 by the Canadian brothers Frank and Lester Patrick, for whom the N.H.L.\u2019s old Patrick Division was named. With money from their family\u2019s logging business, the Patricks had founded the Pacific Coast Hockey Association four years earlier.For the Seattle team, the Patricks poached the top players from the National Hockey Association, the precursor to the N.H.L., and the Toronto Hockey Club, and scooped up misbehaving stars booted from P.C.H.A. rivals like the Victoria Aristocrats.More important, the Patricks built one of the most modern hockey arenas in the world, with an artificially cooled ice surface and room for almost 4,000 spectators, comfortably seated in what local papers at the time referred to as \u201copera chairs.\u201dAccording to Craig Bowlsby, the Vancouver-based author of \u201cEmpire of Ice: The Rise and Fall of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, 1911\u20131926,\u201d Seattle\u2019s was a textbook expansion team.In those days, the champions of the N.H.A. and P.C.H.A. played for the Stanley Cup. In 1917, their second season, the Metropolitans won the P.C.H.A. and played a best-of-five series in Seattle against the N.H.A.-champion Montreal Canadiens, who in net had Georges Vezina (yes, the player whose name is now on the trophy given to the N.H.L.\u2019s best goalie every season).The hosts lost the first game 8-4, but swept the next three at the sold-out Ice Arena, capped with a 9-1 disassembly of the defending Stanley Cup champions, who had been so confident of a series win that they did not bother to bring the trophy to Washington State.Seattle earned a rematch with the Canadiens two years later, but the series ended tied at 2-2 because of an influenza epidemic, in which a Canadiens player died.Seattle lost its last Stanley Cup series to the Ottawa Senators in 1920 and folded in 1924 when the Ice Arena was sold and converted to a parking garage, partly for guests of the new Olympic Hotel.But the Metropolitans changed the DNA of the game forever.\u201cIt was Seattle\u2019s domination during these years that forced professional hockey to legalize the forward pass in the 1918 season,\u201d Bowlsby said. \u201cPrior to that, everyone except the P.C.H.A. made lateral passes, like rugby.\u201dJohn Dellapina, the N.H.L.\u2019s vice president for communications, said the league was \u201cfocused solely upon players\u2019 accomplishments in N.H.L. games or N.H.L.-organized events and moments that occurred since the founding of the league in November of 1917 and the playing of its first games in December of 1917.\u201dThe anniversary of the first American Stanley Cup would have probably passed unnoticed if not for the efforts of Paul Kim, a Seattleite who approached the sports commission in January with a plea to do something to mark the occasion.Kim became smitten with the lost franchise after immigrating to Seattle from South Korea as a child.\u201cI was in the fourth grade and just learning to read English when a teacher gave me a book about this old hockey team,\u201d he said.Kim, 26, went on to play junior hockey and work at pro shops around the city. The Metropolitans fascination remained. In 2015 he helped talk the Toronto-based Hockey Hall of Fame into bringing the Stanley Cup to Seattle, where it was brought to hockey tournaments and children\u2019s hospitals.Kim also obtained the trademark for the Metropolitans\u2019 name, logo, and red, white and green barber pole jersey designs.He has been selling Metropolitans gear to finance awareness of the team, but said he had secured the brand mostly for that fateful day when an N.H.L. team comes to Seattle.The N.H.L.-to-Seattle talk has escalated, but the N.H.L. has been adamant that the city would need to have a new arena before it could be considered for an expansion team or a relocated one. Two high-powered groups are proposing to develop sites at opposite ends of downtown that could accommodate N.H.L. and N.B.A. teams.Morton, of the Seattle Sports Commission, is confident an N.H.L. team will arrive within a decade.\u201cWhen it does, I can\u2019t wait for the rivalry with the Vancouver Canucks,\u201d he said.Seattle fans could easily bring the trash talk, having won the Stanley Cup more recently than the rival 140 miles or so up Interstate 5, despite not having a team for the past 90 years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearing U.S. Withdrawal, Europe Considers Its Own Nuclear Deterrent", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterBERLIN \u2014 An idea, once unthinkable, is gaining attention in European policy circles: a European Union nuclear weapons program.Under such a plan, France\u2019s arsenal would be repurposed to protect the rest of Europe and would be put under a common European command, funding plan, defense doctrine, or some combination of the three. It would be enacted only if the Continent could no longer count on American protection.Though no new countries would join the nuclear club under this scheme, it would amount to an unprecedented escalation in Europe\u2019s collective military power and a drastic break with American leadership.Analysts say that the talk, even if it never translates into action, demonstrates the growing sense in Europe that drastic steps may be necessary to protect the postwar order in the era of a Trump presidency, a resurgent Russia and the possibility of an alignment between the two.Even proponents, who remain a minority, acknowledge enormous hurdles. But discussion of a so-called \u201cEurodeterrent\u201d has entered the mainstream \u2014 particularly in Germany, a country that would be central to any plan but where antinuclear sentiment is widespread.Jana Puglierin of the German Council on Foreign Relations said that a handful of senior European officials had \u201cfor sure triggered a public debate about this, taking place in newspapers and journals, radio interviews and TV documentaries.\u201dShe added: \u201cThat in itself is remarkable. I am indeed very astonished that we discuss this at all.\u201dBut the most important support has come from Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker and foreign policy spokesman with Germany\u2019s ruling party, who gave the nuclear option increased credibility by raising it shortly after President Trump\u2019s election.In an interview in the German Bundestag, Mr. Kiesewetter, a former colonel who served in Afghanistan, calibrated his language carefully, providing just enough detail to demonstrate the option\u2019s seriousness without offering too much and risking an outcry from German voters or encouraging the American withdrawal he is hoping to avoid.\u201cMy idea is to build on the existing weapons in Great Britain and France,\u201d he said, but acknowledged that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union could preclude its participation.The United States bases dozens of nuclear warheads in Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands as both a quick-reaction force and a symbol of its guarantee to protect the Continent. Mr. Kiesewetter said his plan would provide a replacement or parallel program.This would require, he said, four ingredients: a French pledge to commit its weapons to a common European defense, German financing to demonstrate the program\u2019s collective nature, a joint command and a plan to place French warheads in other European countries.The number of warheads in Europe would not increase under this plan, and could even decrease if the United States withdraws.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of numbers,\u201d Mr. Kiesewetter said. \u201cThe reassurance and deterrence comes from the existence of the weapons and their deployability.\u201dHe envisioned a program designed to deter nuclear as well as conventional threats \u2014 a clear nod to Russia\u2019s military superiority.This would require a doctrine, he said, allowing Europe to introduce nuclear weapons to a non-nuclear conflict. He compared it to the Israeli program, which is believed to allow for a nuclear strike against an overwhelming conventional attack.\u201cThese are political weapons. Their use must be unpredictable,\u201d he said. Smaller nuclear powers often maintain vague doctrines to deter more powerful adversaries.The goal, he said, would be to maintain Europe\u2019s defense, seen as crucial for its internal unity, as well as its international diplomatic standing.German lawmakers across the political spectrum worry that Mr. Trump could strike a grand bargain with Russia that excludes Europe, a potential first step toward Washington and Moscow dictating Europe\u2019s future. Mr. Kiesewetter believes a European nuclear program would allow Europe to preserve its autonomy.Mostly, Mr. Kiesewetter said he hoped to spur Mr. Trump to end doubts over American security commitments to Europe, rendering unnecessary the nuclear \u201cPlan B.\u201dFor now, Mr. Kiesewetter\u2019s intention is merely to \u201ctrigger a debate\u201d over addressing \u201cthis silent, gigantic problem.\u201dMr. Kiesewetter said he had heard interest from officials in the Polish and Hungarian governments, at NATO headquarters in Brussels and within relevant German ministries, though he would not say which.But any European nuclear program would face enormous hurdles.\u201cThe public is totally opposed,\u201d Ms. Puglierin said, referring to German antinuclear sentiment, which has at times culminated in nationwide protests against the weapons.In practical terms, the plan would change the flag on Europe\u2019s nuclear deterrent from that of the United States to that of France. But this would risk making an American exit from Europe more permanent.The biggest challenge may be who controls the French arsenal and where it is based.The United States currently shares warheads with allies like Germany, whose militaries are equipped to deliver the weapons, granting the program credibility as a Pan-European defense.But France has shown no willingness to share its weapons, much less put them under a joint European command. If Paris maintains final say over their use, this might cause an adversary to doubt whether France would really initiate a nuclear conflict to protect, say, Estonia.These sorts of problems are why Bruno Tertrais of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris said, \u201cIn other times I would have told you don\u2019t bother, there\u2019s no story here.\u201dSimilar proposals have been floated before, including by the French government, and always rejected as politically risky and strategically unnecessary. But, he said, that calculus appears to have a potential to change with Mr. Trump.\u201cThere\u2019s already a bit more interest in Berlin and in Paris,\u201d Mr. Tertrais said, though he emphasized that this talk would become action only if there were \u201ca serious loss of trust in the U.S. umbrella.\u201dBut a joint European command or funding scheme would most likely be impossible, he warned. The French government would insist on maintaining \u201cthe final decision to use nuclear weapons.\u201dThat is also United States policy in Europe, which is why Mr. Tertrais believes a more workable plan would be for France to reproduce American-style practices of basing its warheads abroad, while keeping them under French control.While most French warheads are lodged on submarines, a few dozen are fitted to air-launched cruise missiles that could be housed in, for example, German airfields. These are smaller, shorter-range tactical weapons \u2014 exactly the American capability that Europe most fears losing.French policy already allows for, though does not require, using nuclear weapons in defense of an ally.With Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, \u201cthe French might feel they have a special responsibility\u201d as Europe\u2019s sole nuclear power.Vipin Narang, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who studies regional nuclear powers, was initially skeptical but came to see such a plan as both technically and politically feasible.For France, he said, \u201cit extends their frontier,\u201d making it likelier that a nuclear conflict would be fought far from French soil. For Germany and other European states, it would \u201cincrease the credibility of the forward deployment against Russian aggression.\u201dSome observers believe that official shows of support are intended only to pressure Mr. Trump into maintaining the status quo, which Mr. Kiesewetter emphasized is his preferred outcome.But Mr. Narang said that, regardless of intentions, there is a blurry line between mere signaling and actually pursuing a fallback nuclear option.Nuclear scholars call this \u201cinsurance hedging,\u201d in which a protectee comes to doubt its protector and responds by taking steps toward, but not actually completing, its own nuclear program. This is meant to goad the protector into staying, and to prepare in case it doesn\u2019t.Because Europe\u2019s primary challenges are political rather than technical \u2014 France already possesses the warheads \u2014 sparking public discussion and exploring options makes those challenges more surmountable and the option more real.\u201cIn order for it to be credible there has to be some sort of workable option,\u201d Mr. Narang said.Mr. Kiesewetter hopes the United States will come around. He puts particular faith in Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, whom he met in Afghanistan and Brussels while both were military officers.If Europeans grew more serious about a nuclear program, Mr. Tertrais said, \u201cyou would not necessarily see it.\u201d Negotiations would most likely remain secret for fear of giving Mr. Trump an excuse to withdraw \u2014 or of triggering a reaction from Russia.\u201cI never thought we would see this again. I never thought there would actually be this concern,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cYou can see where the debate is surfacing from. There is a logic to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prerequisite for Key White House Posts: Loyalty, Not Experience", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s point man on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is a longtime Trump Organization lawyer with no government or diplomatic experience. His liaison to African-American leaders is a former reality-TV villain with a penchant for r\u00e9sum\u00e9 inflation. And his Oval Office gatekeeper is a bullet-headed former New York City cop best known for smacking a protester on the head.Every president sweeps into office with a coterie of friends and hangers-on who sometimes have minimal experience in the arcana of the federal government. But few have arrived with a contingent more colorful and controversial than that of Mr. Trump, whose White House is peppered with assistants and advisers whose principal qualification is their long friendship with Mr. Trump and his family.There is Jason Greenblatt, the former Trump Organization lawyer, whose portfolio now includes peace in the West Bank, international trade deals and relations with Cuba. Omarosa Manigault, whose star turn on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d propelled the show\u2019s breakout first season, is now among about two dozen aides with the rank of assistant to the president \u2014 and one of the few with walk-in privileges for the Oval Office.Most other staff members must go through Keith Schiller, who rose from part-time security guard at the Trump Organization to its director of security. Mr. Schiller is now the director of Oval Office operations, controlling physical access to a president whose whims and frustrations routinely send aides throughout the building scurrying to deflect, defend and justify.The influence of longtime Trump friends and associates \u2014 some of them with vague portfolios \u2014 comes as a leadership void has been created by the Trump administration\u2019s slow pace in filling top jobs in many agencies. It has also added to the confusion of a West Wing already legendary for its power struggles, while bewildering Washington policy hands.\u201cTitles do matter,\u201d said Paul C. Light, a presidential scholar at New York University. \u201cYou don\u2019t say: \u2018You are my buddy; you are my friend; you were with me on my television show. I\u2019m going to give you a really great title.\u2019 These are not things to be handed out like candy.\u201dTo help him wrangle Silicon Valley chief executives and modernize United States government technology systems, Mr. Trump has hired Reed Cordish, the scion of a Baltimore real estate dynasty who is married to a close college friend of Ivanka Trump, who set them up. In a statement, Mr. Cordish said his real estate experience had taught him how to successfully meld public and private interests.The president also recently hired Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a Trump family friend, to work in the White House Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs. Mr. Giuliani, 31, who made headlines after he sued Duke University for kicking him off the college golf team, previously worked in sales and marketing at a small suburban New York financial firm.Personal relationships with the president often bestow a power exceeding official West Wing job titles. Valerie Jarrett, a businesswoman, former city official in Chicago and longtime friend of the Obamas, was renowned for her unmatched access to President Barack Obama and reach into policy matters far beyond her official portfolio.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House press spokeswoman, said Mr. Trump had recruited highly skilled advisers with refreshingly different backgrounds. \u201cEven though some of the staff doesn\u2019t have government experience it doesn\u2019t mean they are amateurs,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cPresident Trump has promised to change Washington and you can\u2019t do that by putting Washington bureaucrats in charge of everything.\u201dIf Mr. Trump appears more eager than past presidents to bring in longtime associates with limited Washington experience, friends said, it stems partly from his background of four decades at the helm of a closely held family business, with no experience in public service.He has had to assemble a White House team largely from scratch, tapping a party apparatus he believed had tried to deny him the nomination and a Republican policy elite that had largely opposed him. The bulk of his senior White House aides were unknown to him until two years ago.\u201cHe is figuring out who he can depend on.\u201dMr. Schiller, 58, a 6-foot-3 former narcotics detective, has protected Mr. Trump for 18 years. The head of a Praetorian Guard of private security detectives, Mr. Schiller occupied a Trump Tower office on the same floor as his boss and learned, he said, to anticipate his wishes.A fierce protector of Mr. Trump\u2019s image and interests, he physically removed a reporter from a 2015 news conference on the campaign trail after he repeatedly questioned Mr. Trump without being called on.No longer responsible for Mr. Trump\u2019s physical safety, he is now a combination gatekeeper, valet and security blanket \u2014 a familiar face for a president who detests solitude and whose wife and youngest son have remained at Trump Tower.But Mr. Schiller has not entirely shed his role as Mr. Trump\u2019s enforcer. During a briefing on health care legislation on Friday, he shouted at reporters to clear out of the Roosevelt Room after they tried to question Mr. Trump about continuing controversies.Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s ties to Mr. Trump have translated into more striking levels of power and prestige. A lawyer who helped Mr. Trump negotiate business deals for two decades, Mr. Greenblatt rose to become the Trump Organization\u2019s chief legal officer and executive vice president.Now, as special representative for international negotiations for the White House, Mr. Greenblatt, 49, is charged with negotiating trade agreements and overseeing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and United States-Cuban relations. Mr. Trump has called him \u201cbrilliant.\u201dBut experts say it is hard to imagine how anyone, no matter how intelligent, could handle three such sensitive and complex assignments without previous experience.\u201cNot to have experience or knowledge of the issues in dispute, nor any relationship with the Palestinians, will be a challenge,\u201d he said.In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Greenblatt suggested calling back later when \u201cI\u2019ll have something to actually say that\u2019s meaningful.\u201d Through the press office, he addressed the trade aspect of his portfolio, saying that working with Mr. Trump taught him how government can impede job creation.\u201cSo what would that leave for this guy?\u201d Mr. Bergsten asked. \u201cIt\u2019s very mysterious.\u201dA sign of Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s expansive role came last month, not long after he traveled to Capitol Hill with Peter Navarro \u2014 a Harvard-trained economist who is head of Mr. Trump\u2019s newly created National Trade Council \u2014 to discuss trade policy with staff aides of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Greenblatt missed a follow-up session with senators because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was visiting the White House that day.\u201cHe\u2019s got to negotiate Middle East peace,\u201d Mr. Navarro quipped to the senators, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cSo he can\u2019t be here today.\u201dMr. Greenblatt appears more independent of the State Department than at least some previous envoys; he has told others he reports not to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, but to the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, 36, one of the most senior White House advisers.\u201cThere\u2019s just a tremendous amount of literature out there, emails and all that, so I read all of those as often as I can,\u201d he said then.Still, Mr. Greenblatt seemed at that point somewhat taken aback that Mr. Trump had identified him to the news agency as his principal adviser on Israel, telling reporters that Mr. Greenblatt was so passionate that \u201cwhen he goes on vacation, he goes to Israel.\u201d\u201cI knew that he was relying on me for certain aspects of Israel, but I didn\u2019t know I was his top adviser,\u201d he said.Ms. Manigault, 43, has no policy experience, a spotty history in her previous federal positions and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that has cast her \u2014 inaccurately \u2014 as a university professor and a former top aide to Vice President Al Gore.In a statement from the White House press office, Ms. Manigault said that \u201cwhile some people try to tear me down,\u201d she was focused on giving women, minorities and other groups a voice in the White House.Nominally, Ms. Manigault directs the office of communications in the White House\u2019s public liaison office, a midlevel post. She is also a bridge to African-American groups, including the heads of more than 60 historically black colleges and universities who met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last month.In her White House post, she has already had a few run-ins reminiscent of her elbows-out reality-TV role on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d including a much publicized confrontation with a veteran White House reporter. (Mr. Trump also sponsored a short-lived dating show called \u201cThe Ultimate Merger\u201d in which she starred.)Ms. Manigault has told others that she earned her way to a White House position. She grew up on welfare in a housing project in Youngstown, Ohio, and lost her father to violence at age 7, but went on to earn a college degree and, at age 24, a job in the office of Vice President Al Gore.But while her ascent is impressive, it is not quite as she has described it. On a 2005 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 provided by a former employer, she described herself as Mr. Gore\u2019s \u201csenior scheduling and advance coordinator\u201d overseeing all aspects of his schedule. She continues to maintain that description is accurate and that she succeeded at the job.But numerous former staff members in that office said that she was pushed out of an entry-level, $25,000-a-year job replying to invitations to Mr. Gore after 13 months, leaving a pile of unanswered correspondence under her desk. \u201cShe was the worst hire we ever made,\u201d said Mary Margaret Overbey, Mr. Gore\u2019s former office administrator.Ms. Manigault transferred to a job as deputy associate director of presidential personnel, then eight months later moved to the Commerce Department. In her statement, she said she performed well in that job. But Cheryl Shavers, then the agency\u2019s under secretary for technology administration, disagreed, saying Ms. Manigault \u201cwas unqualified and disruptive,\u201d so \u201cI had her removed.\u201dMs. Manigault also maintains that the only requirement left for her to complete a doctorate at Howard is to defend her dissertation. But Carolyn M. Byerly, chairwoman of the university\u2019s communications department, said that according to the university\u2019s rules, the seven-year period for her to do that expired more than a decade ago.Ms. Manigault tweeted her support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2014, but when Mr. Trump decided to run for president she joined his campaign and defended him vigorously. At an election-night victory party in November, she gave a television interview during which she warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was keeping an \u201cenemies\u201d list.Her \u201cApprentice\u201d-style pugnacity notwithstanding, Mr. Trump insists there is a side of her that she keeps well hidden.Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush contributed reporting from Washington.

{"Headline": "Should Prosecutors Chastise Those They Don\u2019t Charge?", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byIn an extraordinary 10-page letter that it released publicly, the Manhattan district attorney's office essentially laid out what had been its case against Mr. de Blasio, saying that certain acts had appeared to be \u201ccontrary to the intent and spirit\u201d of campaign finance laws.The United States attorney\u2019s office issued a far more sparse statement, but still noted several instances where the mayor and others acting on his behalf had solicited donations from people who \u201csought official favors from the city, after which the mayor made or directed inquiries to relevant city agencies on behalf of those donors.\u201dThe two statements marked an apparent trend: Across the nation, prosecutors seem to have become more willing to speak publicly about the decision on their part not to file charges in high-profile cases.On occasion, the authorities have gone even further, calling conduct into question even when the actions were not prosecutable.Mr. Comey acknowledged that his statement was \u201cunusual\u201d and that he was including \u201cmore detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest.\u201dThe fact that prosecutors and investigators are speaking more freely has fueled debate among legal experts over whether the authorities, when closing their investigations without filing charges, should issue such comments.\u201cI think it is happening more often, and more prominently,\u201d said Rebecca Roiphe, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan who now teaches at New York Law School. \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely problematic.\u201dA prosecutor\u2019s decision to offer details of an investigation and explain why charges were not being brought would seem to be a model of transparency, especially in cases involving police shootings or other alleged civil rights violations, when families and communities may not trust the authorities to investigate fairly.At the same time, legal experts said, such statements could potentially allow a prosecutor to level criticisms without a filter, depriving the recipient of the ability to respond in kind.\u201cMy view is that a prosecutor has two choices: indict or shut up,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University.Daniel C. Richman, a law professor at Columbia and former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said he recently asked a law student, Kathleen Ann Marini, to conduct research into how frequently United States prosecutors had issued statements after declining to charge. A quick search turned up more than two dozen cases since 2010, the vast majority in the civil rights and public corruption area.\u201cThe pattern does not surprise me,\u201d Professor Richman said. \u201cThese are really hard questions, when you consider that all too often the failure to prosecute someone is taken incorrectly as his vindication.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a prosecutor,\u201d he added, \u201cthe safest move is always to never say anything and let the target twist in the wind.\u201dTo be sure, there have been instances in decades past when prosecutors have chosen to issue critical statements even when deciding not to bring charges. In 1993, the Litchfield County State\u2019s Attorney in Connecticut said that he had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to charge Woody Allen with sexually molesting his young daughter but then declined to file charges. Mr. Allen has vigorously and consistently denied any wrongdoing in the case.\u201cWe were always confident there was no illegality here, and we appreciate the U.S. attorney clarifying this for the public record,\u201d Mr. Cuomo\u2019s lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said then.\u201cMy feeling is that people deserve answers,\u201d Mr. Crump said.The officer\u2019s lawyer, Stuart London, said this week that the statement was helpful in clarifying the guidelines for prosecuting such cases.\u201cIt just spoke in terms of how high the bar is for a federal civil rights indictment,\u201d he said. His client has denied any wrongdoing.The office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., has issued statements in at least a half dozen prominent cases since 2012 in which it did not file charges.The cases involved public allegations against one or more people, Mr. Vance\u2019s spokeswoman, Joan Vollero, said, \u201cand there was an overwhelming public interest in having the ultimate conclusions disclosed.\u201dMr. Rubenstein\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said on Wednesday that he firmly believed that if an investigation had received widespread news coverage, \u201cit is not only appropriate, it is absolutely necessary for that person to be publicly cleared\u201d when the investigation is completed.Given those circumstances, Ms. Vollero said, \u201cwe concluded that fairness to those involved, coupled with the public\u2019s right to know, compelled us to be as transparent as possible in announcing our conclusions.\u201dMr. de Blasio thanked both offices for publishing their conclusions \u201cin a timely manner,\u201d and said the results confirmed that he and his staff had acted in a manner that was \u201clegal and appropriate and ethical throughout.\u201dThe legal experts had mixed reactions to the prosecutors\u2019 public comments.Bennett L. Gershman, a law professor at Pace University, criticized both statements for making \u201cinsinuations of misconduct\u201d which he said was \u201cimproper, totally beyond what a prosecutor should do.\u201dProfessor Gillers also questioned Mr. Vance\u2019s public letter, saying it \u201cgave the mayor\u2019s opponents, electoral and otherwise, a powerful sound bite to use against him.\u201dBut Professor Gillers said Mr. Kim\u2019s statement was the rare appropriate exception to his view that prosecutors at such times should remain silent.\u201cThe public had an interest in a brief explanation of the reasons for the decision, given the political context,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

There is a two-car garage and an attached carport that can shelter four additional vehicles.The four bedrooms are on the top floor. The en-suite master has a walk-in closet and a balcony offering city views in the distance. Two other bedrooms share a bathroom, while another has its own. All furnishings are available for purchase separately.\u201cThe social areas are great for entertaining,\u201d Ms. Murillo said, \u201cbut the bedroom area is very private.\u201dMARKET OVERVIEW\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more buyers and a lot of deals,\u201d Mr. Rasminsky said. \u201cPeople are also developing land again \u2014 there are new condos being built. There\u2019s more confidence in the market.\u201dPrices in Escaz\u00fa range from about $150,000 for a small house at a low elevation, Ms. Murillo said, to around $6 million for an estate high up in the hills. But prices are now flat, she added, with some of the more expensive houses lingering on the market.WHO BUYS IN COSTA RICAAmericans dominate the second-home market, thanks in part to an abundance of direct flights to Costa Rica from many major cities in the United States. There is also strong interest from Canadian and European buyers, agents say.The majority of foreign buyers prefer the country\u2019s numerous beach communities along the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. \u201cThey come here to vacation, fall in love and want to buy,\u201d said Rodolfo Herrera, a real estate lawyer and licensed notary based in San Isidro, San Jos\u00e9.Buyers in the province of San Jos\u00e9, and particularly in Escaz\u00fa \u2014 which Mr. Herrera likens to a cosmopolitan American city such as Miami \u2014 are mostly people who have business in the capital, along with retirees or people close to retiring who are looking to move to a temperate climate.\u201cThe people who buy in Escaz\u00fa want to have modern conveniences near the city,\u201d Mr. Rasminsky said. \u201cThey want to live in an area where the temperatures are cooler and where they have mountain views.\u201d BUYING BASICSInternational home buyers in Costa Rica face few restrictions, Mr. Herrera said, but local financing is harder to come by and at less attractive terms than in the United States. Nonresident buyers, he said, should be prepared to pay in cash or obtain loans elsewhere.Agents recommend hiring an experienced real estate lawyer who is also a notary. The notary handles the all-important transfer of the deed to the property. (In Costa Rica, all licensed notaries are lawyers, but not all lawyers are notaries.) A common practice among foreign buyers is to form a corporation to purchase property. Purchases can also be made through a retirement fund like an individual retirement account, or I.R.A.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; col\u00f3n ($1 = 560 col\u00f3n). The American dollar is widely accepted.TAXES AND FEESThe seller usually pays the brokerage commission, which ranges from around 5 to 8 percent of the purchase price. The buyer typically pays most of the closing costs, Mr. Herrera said, which amount to at least 4 percent of the purchase price; costs include notary fees, title transfer tax and government stamps.Property taxes in Costa Rica are generally very low, around 0.25 percent of the registered property value. The municipal taxes on this house are about $2,000 a year, Ms. Murillo said, in addition to an annual luxury tax of around $2,000.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Silvers, a Founding Editor of New York Review of Books, Dies at 87", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byRobert B. Silvers, a founder of The New York Review of Books, which under his editorship became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.Rea S. Hederman, the publisher of The Review, confirmed the death.The New York Review, founded in 1963, was born with a mission \u2014 to raise the standards of book reviewing and literary discussion in the United States and nurture a hybrid form of politico-cultural essay. Mr. Silvers brought to its pages a self-effacing, almost priestly sense of devotion that ultimately made him indistinguishable from the publication he edited, and it from him.\u201cI put my name on the paper, and the rest I don\u2019t care to be known,\u201d he told Philip Nobile, the author of \u201cIntellectual Skywriting: Literary Politics and The New York Review of Books\u201d (1974). In a 2008 interview for the online program Thoughtcast, Mr. Silvers said: \u201cThe editor is a middleman. The one thing he should avoid is taking credit. It\u2019s the writer that counts.\u201dHis myriad enthusiasms found their way into a publication that was edited for an audience of one. When asked to describe readers, he once said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know too much about them.\u201dHe was happiest surrounded by stacks of manuscripts by the writers he pursued with flattery and guile; in one typical instance, he drafted Jonathan Miller to write about John Updike\u2019s novel \u201cThe Centaur\u201d for the first issue of The Review by waylaying him after a performance of \u201cBeyond the Fringe\u201d on Broadway. He would inundate them with newspaper clippings, afterthoughts, helpful notes and suggestions for further reading as they toiled over their assignments.It was routine for him to hunt down contributors on their vacations. The Christmas-morning phone call was not unknown.Most writers regarded him with admiration verging on awe.\u201cHe was one of those rare editors who is also one\u2019s ideal reader,\u201d Ian Buruma, a marquee writer for The Review since 1985, said in a phone interview for this obituary in 2011. \u201cHe was not only sympathetic, but you knew that he would get it, and not try to rewrite because he really wanted to be a writer. He was unusual in being interested in so many things, in a profound way \u2014 a polymath who knew a tremendous amount about many subjects.\u201dRobert Benjamin Silvers was born on Dec. 31, 1929, in Mineola, N.Y., a village on Long Island. His father, James, was a businessman who left Manhattan to live the rural life. His mother, the former Rose Roden, was the music critic for the The New York Globe, long since disappeared. A precocious student, he left high school in Rockville Centre at 15 and enrolled in the University of Chicago. He pursued an accelerated two-year program, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1947.Mr. Silvers spent three semesters studying law, without enthusiasm, at Yale. In 1950, he entered the Army and was assigned to the intelligence library of NATO military headquarters in Paris. He studied at the Sorbonne and Sciences Po.After completing his military service, he remained in Paris, living on a houseboat on the Seine with the future bandleader Peter Duchin. He patched together a living as a representative of the publisher Noonday Press and an editor of a quarterly magazine published by the World Assembly of Youth; the magazine, probably unknown to him, was financed by the C.I.A.An introduction to George Plimpton led to a post as managing editor of the newly created Paris Review, a journal in some disarray and badly in need of an editorial guiding hand. \u201cIt seemed to me quite a natural thing,\u201d Mr. Silvers told The Guardian of his decision to take up editing as a vocation. \u201cIt was something I could do without even making a choice.\u201dInterviewed by Mr. Nobile for his book, Mr. Plimpton said of Mr. Silvers: \u201cHe was rather shy but formidable, and a strong voice amidst all this sturm und drang. He made The Paris Review what it was.\u201dJohn Fischer, the editor of Harper\u2019s, hired Mr. Silvers at the recommendation of Mr. Plimpton\u2019s father, Francis, a corporate lawyer, to oversee literary articles and book reviews at the magazine in 1958.For that issue, he commissioned Ms. Hardwick, a literary critic, to write an extended essay on the state of book reviewing in the United States. She dismissed the reviewing in American newspapers and magazines as tepid, perfunctory, shallow and, in a word, noncritical. Her main target was The New York Times Book Review.Three years later, a typographers\u2019 strike shut down nine major newspapers in New York.The timing was perfect.Jason Epstein, an editor at Random House, and his wife, Ms. Epstein, a freelance editor, had proposed the idea of a new publication in discussions with Ms. Hardwick and her husband, the poet Robert Lowell. They had in mind a literary review on the model of The Times Literary Supplement in London, or the literary section of the British magazine The New Statesman under V. S. Pritchett: a forum for writers to discuss ideas, books, ideas and politics at length, provocatively.When the newspaper strike deprived book publishers of their main advertising outlets, the pipe dream took on solid form, and Mr. Epstein immediately called Mr. Silvers, who had been thinking along similar lines, to engage him as an editor.Gathering in the offices of Harper\u2019s at night, Mr. Silvers and his co-conspirators worked their way through stacks of review books and compiled a list of ideal reviewers.When a trial issue of The Review was published in Feb. 1, 1963, many of those names were in its pages, writing free of charge: Mr. Kazin, Ms. McCarthy, Mr. Miller, Norman Mailer, Dwight Macdonald, Irving Howe, Gore Vidal, Susan Sontag, William Styron. The print run of 100,000 sold out.In an astonishingly short time, The Review had not only turned a profit, but also established itself as a rival to two other magazines, Partisan Review and Commentary, an American counterpart founded in 1945. But unlike them, it made its starting point the world of books and publishing.Mr. Silvers liked essays that both made an argument and settled it. \u201cWe like important questions to be dealt with by experts with strong views,\u201d he told Time magazine in 1967.He also liked to let writers roam, figuratively and literally, freed from the constraints imposed by most American publications.\u201cWhat we saw was that the book review is a form that is capable of being used to address nearly any kind of issue, and any kind of question, because there\u2019s always a book,\u201d Mr. Silvers said in an interview at the University of California, Berkeley, Graduate School of Journalism in 1999. \u201cBook reviewing can be a way of bringing critical perspectives to bear on the most intense political issues.\u201dOver the years, The Review became famous for wide-ranging essays that often dealt only glancingly with the multiple book titles, sometimes as many as a dozen, nominally under consideration.Mr. Silvers liked to match writers with unexpected subjects. After noticing that Mr. Mailer had left Ms. McCarthy out of the discussion when he assessed \u201cthe talent in the room\u201d in \u201cAdvertisements for Myself,\u201d he assigned Mr. Mailer to review Ms. McCarthy\u2019s novel \u201cThe Group.\u201d Applying the same logic to political writing, he sent Ms. McCarthy to Hanoi, Vietnam, and a reluctant V. S. Naipaul to the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas.When Joan Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, traveled to El Salvador in 1982, Mr. Silvers coaxed a series of long dispatches from her on the difficult situation of a country in the grip of a right-wing dictatorship. It later became a best-selling book, \u201cSalvador.\u201dThe editing process was a characteristic performance by Mr. Silvers.\u201cHow Bob edited \u2018Salvador\u2019 was by constantly nudging me toward updates on the situation and by pointing out weaker material,\u201d Ms. Didion told The Paris Review in 2006. \u201cWhen I gave him the text, for example, it had a very weak ending, which was about meeting an American evangelical student on the flight home. In other words, it was the travel piece carried to its logical and not very interesting conclusion.\u201cThe way Bob led me away from this was to suggest not that I cut it (it\u2019s still there), but that I follow it \u2014 and so ground it \u2014 with a return to the political situation.\u201dWith Ms. Epstein as his co-editor, and A. Whitney Ellsworth as publisher, Mr. Silvers kept The Review in the thick of literary and political debate in the 1960s. He published searching critiques of American policy in Southeast Asia throughout the 1960s, featuring the work of I. F. Stone and Noam Chomsky prominently.The journal flirted with the New Left and became a byword for radical chic. The issue of Aug. 24, 1967, epitomized its political stance. The left-wing journalist Andrew Kopkind wrote a scathing review of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s book \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here? Chaos or Community?,\u201d dismissing its author as hopelessly out of touch and accommodationist, while Tom Hayden contributed an analysis of the race riots in Newark that was accompanied by a diagram on how to make a Molotov cocktail.With the windup of the Vietnam War, Mr. Silvers opened up the pages of The Review to a host of British writers like Frank Kermode, A. Alvarez, Isaiah Berlin, A.J.P. Taylor and Christopher Ricks, who lent the magazine a more sedate literary tone, which made it seem less a successor to the brawling political journals that dominated New York intellectual life in the 1930s and 1940s than to majestic Victorian flagships like The Edinburgh Review.Politics never faded entirely from the picture. From the outset, Mr. Silvers made human rights and the need to check excessive state power his preoccupations, rising at times to the level of a crusade. Petitions and essays on behalf of political prisoners and victims of human rights violations were a constant feature.Mr. Silvers, despite the magician\u2019s aura and the seemingly sacred status of The Review, came in for his share of criticism. He seemed to have little interest in younger writers and, particularly in the 1970s, The Review seemed to suffer from an advanced case of Anglophilia.Despite its self-image as an arena of intellectual combat, it could be staid, even boring. The same writers showed up in issue after issue, and for a time, The Review was jokingly called The New York Review of Each Other\u2019s Books. Mr. Silvers could blow hot and cold on his writers, courting them assiduously, then dropping them without explanation or apology.After the election of President George W. Bush and the advent of a more interventionist American foreign policy culminating in the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Silvers recast The Review as a leading critical voice. Recapturing its militant spirit of the 1960s, he filled its pages with long, scathing critiques of the government\u2019s diplomacy, its conduct of the wars and its record on civil liberties.For Mr. Silvers, The Review had never changed, only the circumstances of the world around it. Its personality and its mission had remained constant since the days of the newspaper strike.Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap I.P.O. Value Difficult to Pin Down", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTo value Snapchat requires the whimsical sort of filters that the disappearing-photo app company has made famous. All the various tallies, even at a specified share price, call on investors to cover their eyes with heart-shaped, rose-tinted lenses.There has been plenty of hype around parent Snap\u2019s initial public offering, and new issues have been relatively scarce. During the company\u2019s brief road show over the past week or so, news reports have suggested excitement is building. That could mean Snap prices Wednesday evening above the indicated $14 to $16 a share. Even within that range, though, defining a headline valuation is tricky.Traditional methodology says the market capitalization is up to $18.5 billion. That\u2019s just the top of the price range multiplied by the number of shares to be outstanding after the I.P.O. \u2014 1.16 billion of them, excluding optional extra shares that could also be sold.Snap had, however, promised nearly 240 million shares to employees as of Dec. 31, including 37 million \u2014 worth nearly $600 million \u2014 as an I.P.O. bonus for the boss, Evan Spiegel. Include those in the calculation and, at $16 a share, new investors are buying into a valuation of $22.3 billion. That is more than 20 percent higher. Alternatively, seen from the investors\u2019 perspective, they are being diluted by that much.Excluding Snap\u2019s $2.3 billion of expected proceeds, the current \u201cpre-money\u201d value is up to $20 billion. This version of the value is comparable with previously reported private fund-raising. The company\u2019s Series F investment round, lasting into the first half of 2016, raised $1.8 billion, bringing the total implied value of Snapchat to $17.8 billion, according to Reuters.In that context, the I.P.O. represents a step up. But it is not as big a jump per share as it seems, because more stock has been earmarked for employees since then. Snap\u2019s prospectus suggests the Series F round was worth $15.36 a share.That means pre-I.P.O. investors can rest easy knowing that, near the top of the proposed price range or above, Snap\u2019s public market debut won\u2019t be a dreaded down round, in which a company\u2019s valuation is lower than the previous financing round. New buyers, however, shouldn\u2019t be so relaxed. Among the filters they can apply are a stretched valuation, slowing user growth and Snap\u2019s decision to sell stock that gives them no voting rights at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Today: Back Home, a Hidden Harvest and Water Worries", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byEach week, Canada Today mixes the Times\u2019s recent Canada-related coverage with back stories and analysis from our reporters along with opinions from our readers.Like many reporters, I sometimes need to find people whose personal stories can illustrate larger issues. But on some of those stories, finding even a handful of such people and then getting them to agree to interviews can be challenging.Basic economics, however, suggest that high prices cause people to cash out and inject more houses for sale into the market. Professor Haider offered one explanation for the Toronto paradox: the unusually high percentage of 20-somethings in the region who still live with their parents. With their nests still full, the parents aren\u2019t thinking about selling.But how to find such families? There are no organizations for parents with adult children in their homes. Nor have they formed any distinct online groups as far as I could tell. So I began foraging for such families.Nancy Worth, a geographer at the University of Waterloo who studies the adults who are back home with their parents in the Toronto area, circulated a request on my behalf to people she had interviewed. That prompted Nadia Nassar to get in touch. Nadia linked me to a friend, Victoria Sherman, who also provided useful thoughts about returning home.Ms. Fahey swiftly introduced me to Janet Barber. And late the next afternoon, Janet and her daughters, Jennifer and Sarah, met with me, showing great generosity with their time. Jennifer Barber, who no longer lives at home, even drove in from downtown Toronto for the interview and photographs.All four of the young women shattered the myth that adult children who live at home are listless parasites. They were dynamic, hard working and active contributors to family life.Here are some other articles from The Times over the last week, not necessarily related to Canada and perhaps overlooked, that I found interesting:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The East Europeans Do an About-Face", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe report of crackdowns on foreign-financed nongovernmental organizations by populist leaders across Central and Eastern Europe, which are often focused on those supported by George Soros, is both troubling and puzzling.The vilification of the N.G.O.s is in some ways an extension of the malaise that fostered the nationalist sentiments these populist leaders have exploited. In many of the countries, as in Russia, this discontent was was a product of the wrenching changes of the 1990s, followed by disappointment with the slowness of improvements in living standards, widespread corruption and the onslaught of globalization. The flood of refugees from Syria and elsewhere heightened a sense among many Central and Eastern Europeans that the European Union and other Western institutions were not helping them protect their national identities, which they had fought so hard to maintain under Soviet rule.It is worrying that many of the populists leading these campaigns have cited Mr. Trump\u2019s election as encouragement. But the nationalist swings across Central and Eastern Europe far predate his presidency. And the crackdown on N.G.O.s is not the whole story in a region in transition, where free elections and free debate still thrive. The European Union, NATO and nongovernmental organizations must not lose heart over what can be hoped is only a temporary reaction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can 3G Capital Keep Thriving on Acquisitions and Cost Cutting?", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe investment firm 3G Capital, the driving force behind Kraft Heinz and the company that owns the Burger King and Tim Hortons chains, seems to have found the secret sauce of deal-making.But could that sauce now be nearing its expiration date?Until recently, 3G looked unstoppable. Founded in 2004 by Jorge Paulo Lemann and four other Brazilian deal makers, the firm made its name by relentlessly crossing the globe to buy companies and ultimately form the world\u2019s biggest beer maker, Anheuser-Busch InBev. Since then, 3G has built up empires in food through bold and aggressive acquisitions.But last month, 3G\u2019s Kraft Heinz retreated on a $143 billion takeover offer for the British-Dutch conglomerate Unilever, the maker of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Lipton tea, as well as Dove soap and other personal products, after facing opposition from the target company and European politicians.Still, 3G is not likely to shut down its insatiable acquisition drive after being thwarted over Unilever. Its recent setback provides an opportunity to reflect on what makes this firm different.The 3G machine has two main profit drivers. First, there is the tried-and-true merger play of becoming more profitable through consolidation and expansion into new markets. Then, the scalpels come out and the combined company creates value by cutting costs.And, boy, does it cut. The firm has developed a laserlike focus on the expense side with something called zero-based budgeting.Each year, costs for every item at its portfolio companies are reassessed. Everything is on the table as the budget is recalculated annually.Printers are gotten rid of, trash collection reduced and overhead slashed in what has been referred to as \u201cbrutal\u201d cost-cutting.At the Tim Hortons chain, for example, the company was able to grow margins 6 percent by firing most senior executives and reducing capital expenditures by 75 percent.For every $1 on the menu at outlets of the parent company, Restaurant Brands, the company stands to reap a profit of 45 cents \u2014 a figure that is double the industry average.Acquisitions take the place of product development.At the companies that 3G controls, it puts into place young yet experienced managers who implement their cost-cutting agenda.Restaurant Brands is led by Daniel Schwartz, a 3G executive who at 35 is steeped in the company\u2019s ways.The chief executive of Kraft Heinz, Bernardo Hees, also is a partner in 3G and was promoted from his job successfully running Burger King. The firm is known for a focus on talent and also on awarding lots of incentive compensation.The 3G cost-cutting machine is such a legend that its recent announcement that it bought Popeye\u2019s Louisiana Fried Chicken resulted in Restaurant Brands\u2019 stock price increasing more than 7 percent.The reason was that investors were in essence betting that the 3G magic could produce that value through cuts and possibly foreign expansion for the largely domestic Popeye\u2019s.The chief executive of Popeye\u2019s, Cheryl A. Bachelder, has already announced that she will be leaving, no doubt to be replaced by a 3G Capital disciple.The company\u2019s obsessive efforts to cut back on costs can almost make other private equity firms look like spendthrifts in comparison.The success of 3G has been so great that one has to wonder why others don\u2019t simply copy it. After all, there is no complex secret formula in cutting printers and other costs.One way that 3G is different than other investment and private equity firms is its partnership with Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.Mr. Buffett backed the firm when it merged Heinz with Kraft, providing financing for a nice fat rate of interest on a preferred stock.The two have also joined forces to profit from the fast-food industry. 3G bought Burger King, then took the company public by merging it with an investment vehicle controlled by William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management.The renamed Restaurant Brands then bought Tim Hortons with $3 billion of capital put in by Berkshire Hathaway.And Restaurant Brands is about to get even bigger with an agreement to buy Popeye\u2019s and its 2,600 locations for $1.8 billion.But the larger question about 3G is whether it is possible to keep creating value by acquisition. At some point, you might think, the music stops playing.Were that to happen, it would become clear how much long-term value is actually being created, and how much of the gains are short-term lifts from acquisitions and cost cuts. Restaurant Brands, for example, has reduced costs but revenue has remained relatively flat. Last quarter, Kraft Heinz\u2019s revenue fell 3.7 percent.In other words, with flat revenue, income has to come from somewhere, and you can only slash so much.It\u2019s a model that private equity firms don\u2019t follow. To be sure, they also cut costs, but private equity also prides itself on revenue expansion and innovation. And the reason is simple: If the merger and acquisition pipeline dries up, so does the growth.Indeed, Anheuser-Busch InBev is hurting now that it is too big to acquire other companies of significant scale. Its profits fell last quarter. The solution it offered: more cost-cutting.The 3G deal makers have their supporters, of course. Mr. Buffett, who reaps great benefits financing their deals, has praised the 3G founders. \u201cJorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,\u201d Mr. Buffett has written.In similar ways, Pershing Square has profited greatly from its partnership with 3G and Mr. Ackman has praised its methods.These prominent investors will continue to do so, as long as the acquisition machine can continue.And the managers at 3G are certainly smart and have made many improvements to both companies.But one has to wonder if a firm can succeed simply by cutting. To be sure there will be some gains and value made from the cuts, but eventually part of running a business means actually building something.Like it or not, that will require spending on new products and the business itself, something 3G\u2019s managers appear to hate above all else, as opposed to simply acquiring more companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As E.C.B. Charts Economic Course, Politics Complicate the Picture", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Central bankers like to portray themselves as being aloof from the hurly-burly of politics, coolly assessing the economic data as they ponder whether to add a jolt of stimulus or take some away.But with populism on the rise in Europe and elsewhere, opinion polls have arguably become one of the European Central Bank\u2019s most important sources of data points.Faced with a series of national elections in which anti-euro candidates play prominent roles, Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, mounted a spirited counteroffensive on Thursday. He portrayed the currency as the key to European prosperity and even took an implicit jab at the protectionist rhetoric of President Trump.\u201cOpen trade has been the pillar of world prosperity for many, many years,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Although it made no major changes to monetary policy on Thursday, the bank is under increasing pressure to begin withdrawing the stimulus program that has prevailed for a decade. That task, delicate in the best of times, is even more difficult in the charged political atmosphere that permeates not only Europe but also the United States and the rest of the world.Some political candidates are questioning the whole idea of a united Europe and the European Central Bank\u2019s fundamental reason for being. The situation raises the stakes whenever the bank makes a decision.A wrong move by the European Central Bank could upset a fragile economic recovery and provide fodder for the populists.While insisting that the central bank\u2019s job is to keep inflation under control, Mr. Draghi was unusually direct on Thursday in rebutting opposition to European free trade and political unity.\u201cIf we go back to when the euro was created, there were always people who said it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s a mistake, it can\u2019t be done,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThey are saying the same today.\u201dEurozone members have made \u201cextraordinary shows of solidarity\u201d toward countries in crisis, Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThe euro is here to stay.\u201dNo matter what Mr. Draghi does, he will continue to draw strong reactions. As one of Europe\u2019s most powerful institutions, the central bank serves as an all-purpose pi\u00f1ata for nationalist politicians of all stripes.Frauke Petry, leader of the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, regularly accuses Mr. Draghi of endangering Germans\u2019 savings with ultralow interest rates.In Italy, where low interest rates have helped ease a severe credit crunch, sentiment runs the opposite direction. When the European Central Bank does begin gradually reducing its stimulus efforts, perhaps around the middle of the year, expect leaders of the populist Five Star Movement in Italy to accuse Mr. Draghi of selling out to the Germans.The prospect that Ms. Le Pen could become president of France has pushed up the government\u2019s borrowing costs. The higher rates feed through to the economy and work against central bank measures intended to make sure credit remains cheap.The political landscape in Washington is also a concern for the European Central Bank. The United States is the European Union\u2019s largest trading partner. If Mr. Trump erects trade barriers, as he has threatened to do, European exporters would suffer along with the region\u2019s economy.Mr. Draghi will have his first direct contact with the new American administration next week at a summit meeting in Germany of central bank governors and finance ministers. He declined to say on Thursday what message he planned to deliver.A further complication for the European Central Bank is that its policies are out of sync with those of the Federal Reserve. Fed officials have signaled that an interest-rate increase is likely next week. That could be a problem for the European Central Bank, if higher market interest rates in the United States spill over to the eurozone and undermine efforts to keep borrowing costs low.Analysts say they expect the European Central Bank to give a clearer view of its intentions around June, probably by signaling a reduction in purchases of government and corporate bonds, a way of pumping money into the economy.An increase in official interest rates may be years away. On Thursday, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rates unchanged, and it said it would continue the stimulus measure of buying government and corporate bonds through the end of the year, albeit at a reduced level starting in April.However, in a statement, the central bank was less alarmist about the eurozone outlook than in the past. Mr. Draghi said the bank would not extend an emergency lending program for commercial banks because there was no need. \u201cThere is no longer that urgency in taking further actions,\u201d he added.It will be nearly impossible to time the easing of the stimulus in a way that does not open the European bank to criticism. The economies of the eurozone are also badly out of step with one another. Unemployment in Italy, at 11.9 percent, is three times as high as Germany\u2019s.The European Central Bank has already been drawn into Italian politics. The central bank, which regulates commercial lenders in the eurozone, has endorsed a rescue plan for troubled Italian banks that critics in Germany say violates European rules.In Germany, by contrast, there are complaints that the European Central Bank\u2019s low interest rates penalize middle-class savers, who earn almost no return on their nest eggs. The resentment has grown recently because of an increase in inflation. Consumer prices in Germany rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in January, above the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just under 2 percent.The inflation rate for the eurozone as a whole was 2 percent in February. But the increase was almost entirely because of food and fuel prices, which frequently fluctuate. The European Central Bank will probably not react until there is evidence that prices in other categories, like services, are also rising.That may be too late for some in Germany.\u201cIt is time for the European Central Bank to start phasing out its expansionary monetary policy in Europe,\u201d Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an influential research organization in Munich, said on Thursday in a statement. \u201cIt should now take its foot off the gas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Living in poverty and surrounded by drug use, she battled hunger and depression.\u201cI\u2019d have to go days without eating because I couldn\u2019t afford to buy food,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I would get to work, and the first thing I would do is put some soup in a little cup, so it\u2019d look like it was coffee.\u201dMs. Montgomery, now 18, has set her sights on a bright future. She is one of 10 students chosen this year by the New York Times College Scholarship Program, which means she will get $15,000 in financial assistance for every year of college, as well as mentoring and internship opportunities with The New York Times Company.The program, which began in 1999 and is financeed by reader donations, has helped put hundreds of students through school, including many at top-tier institutions such as Harvard University, New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.On a recent trip to the New York Times building, Ms. Montgomery gathered with the nine other scholarship winners in a conference room with a bird\u2019s-eye view of Midtown Manhattan, where they posed for photographs, listened to advice about university life and shared their stories.Many said they had never known stability, describing childhoods bouncing between foster homes and homeless shelters. Some told how their families had struggled with mental illness, drug abuse or incarceration.But all of the students boasted noteworthy academic achievements, often in addition to work, internships and participation in after-school clubs.Faa Diallo, 17, is engaged in a good-natured battle with his best friend to see who will be crowned class valedictorian this year \u2014 a tall order for any student, let alone one whose life was upended by violence.Mr. Diallo, his mother and four siblings fled to a domestic violence shelter when he was 13. After that, he said, \u201cI started acting like I was the father figure,\u201d and got his first job in ninth grade.Whenever Mr. Diallo needed an escape, he turned to Greek mythology. His favorite character was Perseus, a demigod who was cast out to sea with his mother and dedicated himself to protecting her. \u201cThese fictional characters began to be my role models because they could do things that I couldn\u2019t do in the real world,\u201d he said.Another one of this year\u2019s winners, Chaim Fishman, 19, has already been accepted to the University of Pennsylvania. To him, the opportunity is precious. Growing up in a very conservative Hasidic community, Mr. Fishman read only religious texts and spoke nothing but Yiddish. He summoned up the courage to leave his yeshiva at age 15, defying the expectations of nearly all of his friends and family.Now he is excelling at a public school, fascinated by science \u2014 especially the big-picture questions, like how the mind works and the origins of the universe.\u201cAll those years when I wanted to learn, I wasn\u2019t able to,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the anticipation built up.\u201dDriven as they are to succeed, many of this year\u2019s winners also cited the importance of giving back \u2013 to family members, to friends and even to total strangers.\u201cI know I want to do something that will help people,\u201d said Shafqat Shadaab, 17. He moved to the United States from Bangladesh at the age of 9 with his mother, who had glaucoma. When he was 14, his uncle, a father figure, died of leukemia. So Mr. Shadaab devoted himself to his mother, taking on a caretaker role while earning sky-high marks in school.Bariki Innis, 18, said his life was turned upside down twice: first when he moved to the United States from Jamaica at 14 and lost touch with his father, and then again at 15, when his mother was struck by a car, leaving her disabled. Having watched his mother struggle with mobility, the star student now dreams of becoming an innovator in the field of driverless cars.In her scholarship application, Laura Chen, 18, wrote of a harrowing experience witnessing the onset of mental illness in a loved one. That challenge became a lesson in compassion, she said, leading her to start a club to raise awareness of child trafficking. \u201cOnce you undergo some type of struggle, you start you empathize with other people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an urge to help people.\u201dSome of the scholarship winners were hesitant to talk about their struggles, explaining how shame over their families\u2019 circumstances had blossomed into a sort of protective pride.John Park, 17, said that the older he got, the more admired his mother and father for teaching him the values of hard work and sacrifice. Vanessa Rodriguez, 17, spent her childhood bouncing between shelters, where she watched her mother fend off sleep to stand guard over her family\u2019s few possessions; none of it stopped her from studying or holding down jobs. Rieanna Duncan, 17, shrank into herself when she talked about the wrenching loss of her father when she was in fourth grade, but was expansive about her hobbies, which include poetry, wrestling and rock music.The winners said that they know the scholarship does not mean the end of their struggles. Many still do not have secure housing. Some are estranged from their families. All of them wonder how they will fit in at college, surrounded by peers from more privileged backgrounds.Leslieann Gomez, 17, said she would not let college distract her from her mother and sister. She is fiercely protective of her family, which has struggled to stay afloat for as long as she can remember.But Ms. Gomez\u2019s face lights up when she describes her own interests: robotics, Korean pop music and self-taught break dancing. The joy of mastering certain moves \u2013 the tut, the pop-and-lock \u2013 helped her survive a childhood tainted by abuse, hunger and poverty.\u201cThey seem like impossible moves, but if you keep practicing, it\u2019s really cool,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will be amazed by you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He passes by a few Havana landmarks like the lighthouse at the head of the Morro Castle and El Malecon, the oceanfront esplanade, all drenched in vivid colors as if the party started the moment he got out of the shower. Mr. Blanco said of his free-floating style, \u201cWe\u2019re a group that gets together because we like to draw animations, but we don\u2019t have structure, we don\u2019t have a company or a business bank account, because that\u2019s not allowed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One of his closest allies in the Senate is, too. The same goes for some of their bitter enemies in Congress, creating a widening sense of panic across Brazil\u2019s political establishment.Now, with new revelations into illegal campaign donations continuing to drop, lawmakers from across the ideological spectrum in Brazil have come up with a plan.They are scrambling to give themselves amnesty.Politicians who often spend their time jousting with one another are frantically trying to advance legislation this week to shield lawmakers from jail time.\u201cWe have a saying in Brazil: \u2018When the jungle is in flames, the beasts unite,\u2019 \u201d said Gil Castello Branco, the director of Contas Abertas, a watchdog group that tracks political corruption. \u201cWell, the fire has been lit, and all these politicians want to do is save their own skin.\u201dWith dozens of business moguls and politicians already going to jail for corruption, the nation still healing from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment and removal, and the economy trying to make a comeback, the amnesty is needed, they argue, to prevent further upheaval.\u201cNo, we need to salvage politics,\u201d the senator said.The political dread over such testimony is casting attention on a practice known in Brazil as \u201ccaixa dois,\u201d a so-called second cash register of financing that is undeclared to tax authorities. It can be used for political campaigns or receiving bribes, or as a slush fund encompassing a range of illicit activities.Brazilian law allows for fines and jail sentences of up to five years for illegal campaign financing, though in practice few politicians go to prison for such crimes. Even so, with the exception of leaders from relatively small parties, the push for amnesty is uniting influential figures from across the spectrum. (Amnesty is not under discussion for crimes like bribery, embezzlement or money laundering.)Still, others insist that existing campaign laws should remain intact and be fully enforced.\u201cI see what\u2019s going on.

{"Headline": "Making Solar Big Enough to Matter", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe widespread view that solar power is a hopelessly subsidized business is quickly growing outdated. In some particularly sunny spots, such as certain parts of the Middle East, solar power now is beating fossil-fueled electricity on price without subsidies.The market is concluding that solar makes sense. In part that\u2019s because of technological advances that have made solar cells more efficient in converting sunlight into power. In part it\u2019s the result of manufacturing scale, which has slashed the cost of solar-panel production. And, in places that tax greenhouse-gas emissions, it\u2019s in part because solar produces carbon-free power.But much more needs to be done. Ratcheting up solar to produce approximately 1 percent of global electricity has required a lot of technology and investment. Making solar big enough to matter environmentally would be an even more colossal undertaking. It would require plastering the ground and roofs with billions of solar panels. It would require significantly increasing energy storage, because solar panels crank out electricity only when the sun shines, which is why, today, solar often needs to be backed up by fossil fuels. And it would require adding more transmission lines, because often the places where the sun shines best aren\u2019t where most people live.In the mid-2000s, stimulated by hefty solar subsidies in Europe, a handful of entrepreneurs in China started producing inexpensive solar panels, much as had been done in China before with T-shirts and televisions. These entrepreneurs bought equipment from manufacturers in Europe and the United States, built big factories with government subsidies, and got down to business cranking out millions of solar panels for export.Today, China utterly dominates global solar-panel manufacturing. Last year, according to the consulting firm IHS Markit, China accounted for 70 percent of global capacity for manufacturing crystalline-silicon solar panels, the most common type. The United States share was 1 percent.But now, China\u2019s solar industry is changing in little-noticed ways that create both an imperative and an opportunity for the United States to up its game. The Chinese industry is innovating technologically \u2014 indeed, it\u2019s starting to score world-record solar-cell efficiencies \u2014 contrary to a long-held myth that all China can do is manufacture others\u2019 inventions cheaply. It\u2019s expanding its manufacturing footprint across the globe. And it\u2019s scrambling to import more efficient ways of financing solar power that have been pioneered in the West. The United States needs to take these shifts into account in defining an American solar strategy that minimizes the cost of solar power to the world while maximizing the long-term benefit to the American economy.A more-enlightened United States policy approach to solar would seek above all to continue slashing solar power\u2019s costs \u2014 not to prop up types of American solar manufacturing that can\u2019t compete globally. It would leverage, not aim to bury, China\u2019s manufacturing superiority, with closer cooperation on solar research and development. And it would focus American solar subsidies more on research and development and deployment than on manufacturing. As solar manufacturing continues to automate, reducing China\u2019s cheap-labor advantage, it is likely to make more sense in the United States, at least for certain sorts of solar products.The United States needs to play to its comparative advantages in the solar sector. That requires a sober assessment of what China does well. There are real tensions between China and the United States, including the tariff fight, doubts about the protection of intellectual property in China, and national-security concerns. But it\u2019s time to put those concerns into perspective, as investors, corporations and governments try to do every day.These proposed shifts in American solar policy will upset partisans across the political spectrum. They will offend liberals who have promised that solar-manufacturing subsidies would bring the United States huge numbers of green factory jobs. They will rankle conservatives who see China as the enemy. How will the Trump administration view them? That\u2019s unclear.Mr. Trump argued in his 2015 book, \u201cCrippled America\u201d (since retitled \u201cGreat Again\u201d), that solar panels didn\u2019t \u201cmake economic sense.\u201d But he also wrote that, when solar energy \u201cproves to be affordable and reliable in providing a substantial percent of our energy needs, then maybe it\u2019ll be worth discussing.\u201dThat time has arrived. A smarter solar policy \u2014 one with a more-nuanced view of China \u2014 is something the new president ought to like.Solar isn\u2019t just for the granola crowd anymore. It\u2019s a global industry, and it\u2019s poised to make a real environmental difference. Whether it delivers on that promise will depend on policy makers prodding it to become more economically efficient. That will require a shift both from those who have loved solar and from those who have laughed it off.Advertisement"}

But \u2014\u2014\u201dHer phone rang and she checked her caller ID. It was Goodell. He told her that the N.F.L. owners, fantastically wealthy men all, just had voted to commit grand theft franchise and plop the Oakland Raiders in a patch of desert just south of Las Vegas.Their conversation lasted a minute or two. No need for tears. Shaking down cities and sticking in the shiv is a patented move for the league. It\u2019s not personal; it\u2019s strictly business.\u201cI was not surprised, but I was entirely disappointed,\u201d Schaaf told me afterward. \u201cI do not regret that we stood firm on no public funding for stadium constructions.\u201dIn the N.F.L.\u2019s world, displays of principle and common economic sense are for chumps. Las Vegas and Nevada adopted the league\u2019s preferred stance: They rolled belly up. Politicians raised taxes to provide a historic $750 million public subsidy.It\u2019s a shame the school board did not build a football stadium, perhaps with a public school annex.One team owner, Stephen M. Ross of the Miami Dolphins, voted against the relocation. \u201cWe as owners and as a league owe it to the fans to do everything we can to stay in communities that have supported us,\u201d he said in a statement.That was so sweet of him; I hope he has put a few food tasters on his staff.The N.F.L. makes two demands of its owners: Build ever-grander stadiums with as many public dollars as you can find; and never, ever feel shame.Goodell had pressed Schaaf to evict the Oakland A\u2019s of M.L.B. \u2014 the football and baseball stadiums would have been neighbors under the proposed arrangement \u2014 and declare her loyalty to the financial well-being of the Raiders. She saw no reason to sever a relationship with a baseball team that also was entwined with her city\u2019s identity.\u201cAsking us to terminate their lease now,\u201d she wrote to the league this past weekend, \u201cis unnecessary and unreasonable.\u201dBuilding football stadiums with public dollars is in fact a mug\u2019s game. With eight regular-season games, pro football rarely if ever pays for itself, no matter how many fictional economic impact reports the league\u2019s captive economists and chamber-of-commerce sorts churn out.\u201cI\u2019ve studied the economic impact, and it doesn\u2019t warrant a public investment because it doesn\u2019t pay off,\u201d the mayor said of football.Baseball, with its 81 home games, can offer a better deal, although public officials remain advised to count their fingers after shaking hands with an owner of any sports franchise.Still, the mayor had taken a risk. For her to suggest that another sport merited equal footing with football smacked of foolish independence. The N.F.L. may preside over a game that destroys bodies and brains at a frightful rate, but its lords view themselves as the crown princes of sport. Every other professional league operates in its shadow.The other curiosity is the Las Vegas deal. Despite the enormous outlay of tax money, it is, in almost every way, not so great. The league is deserting the sixth-biggest television market in the United States, one of the nation\u2019s most pleasant climates and a city much on the upswing, for head-throbbing heat in a much smaller TV market in a city where there are fewer foreclosures than there used to be.So great is the blasted heat that Las Vegas officials had to guarantee that the new stadium would come with an expensive roof.Las Vegas also is synonymous with gambling, a sin Goodell and the N.F.L. profess to abhor. Myself, I would place a fair bet that Goodell discards his hair shirt for a high-roller\u2019s linen number in a few years. There\u2019s simply too much money at stake with gambling, and money is what the N.F.L. does very well.Theoretically, Schaaf and Goodell engaged in negotiations these past many months. She, however, refused to pour more public dollars after bad. (In 1995, an earlier generation of Oakland city officials had made a humiliating and ruinous agreement to build a new stadium for the Raiders in exchange for the team\u2019s return from a 13-year sojourn in Los Angeles.)Last Friday, Goodell wrote the mayor the league equivalent of a Dear Jane letter. \u201cI want to personally thank you for your leadership,\u201d he began. This was followed by lots of rambling that ended with \u201cno viable solution.\u201d\u201cIt is disappointing to me and our clubs to have come to that conclusion,\u201d he wrote.I asked the mayor if she found solace in having stood on principle. She had refused to hock her city\u2019s finances to make a $14 billion league happier.There was a long pause at the other end of the telephone. Then she spoke slowly.\u201cThis team was blue-collar and born and raised here, and the pride and passion that Oaklanders feel about this team is in our blood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt breaks my heart to lose this team.\u201dYou hope Goodell reads that as he drifts off to sleep tonight.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rare Move, Chinese Think Tank Criticizes Tepid Pace of Reform", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s ambitious plan to revamp its economy has bogged down. Flabby state conglomerates have thwarted attempts to whip them into commercial shape. Rules that treat millions of city-dwelling rural migrants like second-class citizens have barely budged.Such criticisms are common from skeptical foreign economists who have long argued that President Xi Jinping\u2019s efforts to remake China\u2019s economy and fix pernicious social problems have been too slow and tepid.But these withering findings on China\u2019s reforms come from a startling place: from within the government itself.It concludes: \u201cReform has to some extent fallen into stalemate.\u201dThe report comes ahead of a Communist Party leadership shake-up later this year that is likely to further solidify Mr. Xi\u2019s hold on power. While the report\u2019s few mentions of Mr. Xi are laudatory, it may add to arguments that he needs to move faster to fix economic problems.But critics argue that the policy changes have slowed or foundered. The report, together with recent comments from a couple of senior officials, indicates that some government insiders agree.\u201cThere must be more political courage and wisdom,\u201d the report said. Despite the vision laid out in 2013, it said, \u201cit\u2019s been quite difficult to reach consensus on specific reform measures, and there have even been policies at odds with this general direction.\u201dEfforts to redefine how different levels of government spend and tax have become mired in bureaucratic feuding. Local governments fear losing revenue from selling off land while they must pay for growing demands for services. Personal income and property tax changes have been discussed, \u201cbut ultimately it\u2019s brought loud thunder but little rain.\u201dRepeated attempts to make hospital care less expensive and more accessible have been frustrated by bureaucratic rivalries and a failure to take on monopolistic hospitals and train more doctors, the report said. The result, it said, is that \u201cseeing a doctor has become even more difficult.\u201dChina\u2019s hundreds of millions of migrant workers, who leave their farms and villages for jobs in the cities, usually don\u2019t qualify for urban benefits like health care or education for their children. Experts have called on China to ease up on the limits in order to help turn migrant workers into bigger consumers. But many cities have created point systems that still exclude them, the report said.State companies \u2014 many of which suffer from overcapacity and heavy debt, burdening the broader economy \u2014 have resisted plans to rein them in while rival agencies have bickered over the direction of change.\u201cOver all, progress in every reform of state-owned firms has been quite sluggish,\u201d it said.Above all, the report said, local officials have been besieged by conflicting demands to be both cautious and courageous, and have become allergic to taking risks that could end their careers or even land them in detention on charges of violating party discipline.\u201cIt\u2019s an inescapable objective fact that the enthusiasm of many local governments to get things done has fallen greatly,\u201d said the report. \u201cThe lack of vigor in implementing reform plans has become the most pressing difficulty in our country\u2019s efforts to comprehensively deepen reform across the board.\u201dBut the authors do not blame the sluggishness just on foot-dragging cadres and state executives, an impression sometimes left by state-run news media reports.Instead, they say that the \u201ctop-level design\u201d of promised reforms in state-owned business and other areas has been marred from inception by confusion, vagueness and unrealistic or conflicting demands.\u201cCurrently, a bigger reason why reforms in some of our country\u2019s key sectors have had difficulty moving forward may lie in the thinking behind the top-level design of these reforms,\u201d the report said.It added, \u201cthe source of the obstructions lies in the policy making.\u201dFor example, the report said, a rule that slashed the salaries of managers at state-owned companies backfired. \u201cThis undermined the enthusiasm of central state-owned enterprises, so they had even less vigor and dynamism,\u201d it said.Some senior officials have also been making the case for more urgency in overhauling the economy.\u201cThis has made people unwilling to endure the pain of reform,\u201d said Mr. Lou, who stepped down from the ministry in November and now runs the state agency that manages social security funds.But the researchers also urge the government to become more open and consultative in drawing up policy \u2014 something that may not come easily to Mr. Xi, who has centralized power and warned officials against bending orders.\u201cGive local officials more room to explore and experiment,\u201d the report said. \u201cDon\u2019t settle scores with them even if their efforts fail.\u201dAdam Wu in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}

To ensure the safety of products that often end up inside the human body, medical devices are strictly regulated and require lengthy approvals from the Food and Drug Administration and other inspectors.If the companies do keep major operations outside the country, new taxes on imports would most likely increase the cost of their products \u2014 a change that could jolt not only the devices industry in coming years, but also health care nationwide.Here in Tijuana the factories are bound to stay put for years, at least. During that time, health executives say, a border tax could fracture the industry\u2019s sophisticated global supply chain and force American hospitals to pay more for vital necessities \u2014 or worse.\u201cThe real danger is the supplies won\u2019t be available at all,\u201d said Dr. John Jay Shannon, chief executive of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System in Chicago.American hospitals rely on heaps of bandages and surgical gloves from China, suturing needles and artificial joints from Ireland, and defibrillators and catheters from Mexico. In all, the annual imports of medical devices more than tripled from 2001 to 2016, when it reached $43.9 billion, according to BMI Research, a unit of the Fitch Group.Mexico is the leading supplier, ahead of Ireland, Germany and China. And few places illustrate this changing landscape, or help explain the complexity of the industry, as well as Tijuana, 20 miles south of San Diego.The city houses the highest concentration of Mexico\u2019s medical device firms, 70 percent of which are American-owned, according to the local development group. Companies including Medtronic, CareFusion, DJO Global and Hill-Rom-Welch Allyn \u2014 some that have their headquarters just up the road in San Diego \u2014 have invested heavily in Tijuana, constructing long, low-slung factories tucked into the hilly terrain. Giant banners hanging from manufacturing plants plead for workers to join them.The high-tech operations emerged after Nafta helped transform Mexican border factories, known as maquiladoras, into industrial powerhouses. Now, instead of being garment sweatshops, many maquiladoras in Tijuana employ a new generation of Mexican engineers and skilled technicians to make orthopedic devices, surgical equipment and catheters.The factories have helped remake the city\u2019s reputation from a ribald party town to a locus of sophisticated industrial manufacturing. Roadside shanties made of corrugated metal and plastic abut new apartment complexes painted fuchsia and lime green; late-model S.U.V.s bounce along potholed roads. Workers pass through imposing security gates to begin shifts operating advanced machinery or delicately sewing pig tissue onto stents for heart valves, and trucks zip in a steady line across the border in preclearance, fast-track lanes into California.But the possibility of new protectionist trade policies is already looming over this buzz of activity. The question for many of the people here is whether it will upend the economic incentives that led American companies to invest in the city in the first place.Mr. Trump has argued that a border tax is needed to keep well-paying jobs in the United States and dissuade companies from relying on Mexican workers who earn a small fraction of American wages. Technicians at medical device factories in Tijuana earn about $14 an hour, compared with about $25 an hour for technicians at factories in the United States.Critics of Mexico\u2019s maquiladoras system contend that wages are kept unfairly low and that workers have been kept from organizing. For companies, though, the savings are clear \u2014 as much as 45 percent for labor-intensive products \u2014 and have helped fuel the wave of development here.Now, even the city\u2019s unflappable longtime entrepreneurs are unsettled by the shift in trade talk.American companies draft plans to build new plants \u2014 or expand existing ones \u2014 years in advance, said Miguel Felix Diaz, vice president of the Baja California Medical Device Cluster, an organization that represents 63 medical device manufacturing plants that employ 60,000 Mexican workers.\u201cFor that reason now,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know if you start some operation tomorrow how it\u2019s going to be affected.\u201dIf the United States does approve a border tax, Mr. Felix Diaz added, \u201cthe final customer is going to pay.\u201dThe final tally of just how much American customers \u2014 hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and doctors\u2019 offices \u2014 would pay is unclear. Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers have yet to release a detailed plan on trade tariffs or corporate tax reform.In addition, the final price on many medical devices is negotiated by group-purchasing organizations, which harness the purchasing power of hospitals and others and would try to mitigate any price increases.Mike Alkire, chief operating officer at Premier, which negotiates for some 3,750 American hospitals, said that while prices would initially spike if the Trump administration hit countries like Mexico or China with tariffs, \u201cwe\u2019ve got enough diversity in the way we source products, we think we can manage the costs.\u201d\u201cOver the long term,\u201d Mr. Alkire added, \u201cwe do think the market will stabilize and the most efficient place to produce products will occur.\u201dBut chief executives at some of the United States\u2019 largest hospitals are nervously watching the gathering legislative, economic and geopolitical storm. The executives say this concern on trade is based on simple math.In Chicago, Cook County\u2019s public clinics and hospitals spend $62 million a year on medical supplies, including 120,432 boxes of gloves, 44,434 boxes of syringes and 403,460 bags of fluids. Safety-net hospitals that care for poor patients would be unable to pass along price increases because the programs that insure those patients, Medicaid and Medicare, pay fixed rates for care.\u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of dominoes,\u201d said Doug Elwell, deputy chief executive for finance and strategy at the county hospital system. Private or for-profit hospitals, because they serve largely privately insured patients, \u201ccan pass along 10 percent in the bill,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t.\u201dA border tax, experts say, would ricochet back and forth across the United States-Mexico border \u2014 and around the world \u2014 in unintended ways.Mexico\u2019s medical device industry buys much of its raw materials and capital machinery from American suppliers. The American-owned Integer plant in Tijuana, for example, buys 90 percent of its raw materials, essentially duty-free, from the United States: stainless steel to be stamped into cups used for hip replacements and plastic to be molded into catheters. Then half of the factory\u2019s output is shipped back to the United States and much of the rest to American-owned companies in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Singapore.If Mexico imposes tariffs on raw materials from American suppliers, a likely response to any border tax imposed by the United States, production costs would spike for companies in Mexico or those companies would shift to suppliers in other countries eager to cut low-tariff deals like China. Imports from China contain around 4 percent of content from the United States, while imports from Mexico contain about 40 percent, and even more in products like medical devices.\u201cThe damage wouldn\u2019t just to be to the Mexico operation, it would be to U.S. suppliers,\u201d said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Companies would also face a regulatory thicket should they move or change suppliers.The Food and Drug Administration inspects and certifies hundreds of medical device manufacturers in China, Europe, Mexico and elsewhere, and even minor manufacturing changes must be certified, a process that can take many months.\u201cMedical devices is a very stringent process,\u201d said Jorge Hernandez, director of operations at Integer in Tijuana, an American-owned company that makes components for pacemakers and defibrillators, among other devices.The Integer plant in Tijuana that Mr. Hernandez oversees looks like a vast scientific laboratory. Behind glass windows, in so-called clean rooms, employees in blue hair caps and bootees tend to machines that process gold and platinum into tiny components for pacemakers. In one room, workers sit shoulder to shoulder, peering into microscopes as they expertly remove tiny debris from freshly made parts. Even the smallest change in these manufacturing protocols would require a new inspection.Integer\u2019s legacy company, Greatbatch Medical, opened the plant in 2005. Over the years, the company consolidated some of its manufacturing from Carson City, Nev., and Columbia, Md., to Tijuana, drawn by the lower wages and the pool of skilled technicians graduating from Mexican universities.The company, like many others here, is seamlessly integrated: Employees in Tijuana videoconference with research and development teams in the United States to fine-tune product designs. The border seems like a quaint historical footnote.\u201cPeople need to understand this relationship we have goes both ways,\u201d said David Mayagoitia, president of the board of the Tijuana Economic Development Corporation.Sitting inside an office in a modern glass and concrete building in downtown Tijuana, Mr. Felix Diaz said Mexicans and Americans had built strong relationships.\u201cWe are dealing daily, we are eating together, we drink a couple of tequilas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to start any commercial war.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Alas, President Trump took him literally, but not seriously.The administration plans a $54 billion increase in military spending, financed in part by a 37 percent cut in the budgets of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.That reflects a misunderstanding about the world \u2014 that security is assured only when we\u2019re blowing things up. It\u2019s sometimes true that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, as Chairman Mao said, but it also emerges from diplomacy, foreign aid and carefully cultivated good will.And we certainly can\u2019t bomb Ebola or climate change.Even before Trump\u2019s election, we underfunded diplomacy and aid. Consider that the New York City police alone employ more than twice as many uniformed officers as the State Department has Foreign Service officers.Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates used to lament that the military had more musicians in its marching bands than the State Department had diplomats. As I do the numbers, that statement is no longer true, but it does reflect the continuing reality that Congress feeds the Pentagon while starving the State Department.\u201cTwo brigades in the armed forces equal our entire diplomatic corps,\u201d noted Nicholas Burns, a former senior diplomat who now teaches at Harvard. Burns said that he agrees with Trump that the military should get more funding but emphasized that slashing diplomacy and foreign aid will make it more difficult to address crucial transnational challenges, from drugs to crime to immigration.\u201cIf you so dramatically underfund the State Department, you defeat the Trump agenda,\u201d he said.On balance, terrorists are probably less threatened by drones overhead than by girls with books. That\u2019s why extremists shot Malala, threw acid in the faces of Afghan schoolgirls and kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls. Terrorists understand what most threatens them, but I\u2019m not sure we do.One can\u2019t help wondering: If U.S. aid programs had invested in education in Yemen, might we have reduced today\u2019s terrorism and violence? One study found that a doubling of primary school enrollment in a poor country halves the risk of civil war.Education is no panacea, but it is a bargain: For the cost of deploying one soldier abroad for a year, we can start about 40 schools.Our security is advanced not just by being scary, but also by winning friends. President Trump will face a crisis \u2014 maybe with North Korea, maybe with China, maybe with some new pandemic \u2014 and he will need not just a robust military but also the cooperation of friendly nations.Tanks can\u2019t help when our president antagonizes Mexico, or hangs up on the Australian prime minister.

{"Headline": "Hungary Plan That Could Shutter Soros\u2019s University Is Called \u2018Political Vandalism\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 A law put forward by the Hungarian government would force a university founded by the Hungarian-American financier and philanthropist George Soros to shut its doors, the school\u2019s top official said on Wednesday.The move, according to observers, was the latest development in a crackdown on free expression and liberal values under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has embraced President Trump and vociferously denounced Mr. Soros, a billionaire who is a frequent target of attacks by the right-wing news media in both the United States and Europe.The school, the Central European University, opened in Mr. Soros\u2019s native Budapest in 1991, not long after the fall of communism and the start of Hungary\u2019s uneven transition to democracy. The school is known as a center for research in the social sciences, with programs led by internationally prominent educators.The university has also given a platform to dissident voices, particularly in the period since Mr. Orban, who helped popularize the term \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d came to power in 2010. Proponents of illiberal democracy place majority rule over civil liberties and minority rights, and they say that financiers like Mr. Soros are part of an elite capitalist class that puts cosmopolitan values over national interests.\u201cWe view it as discriminatory and we view it as a piece of political vandalism,\u201d Mr. Ignatieff said. \u201cWe feel that this isn\u2019t just about us; this is about Hungarian academic freedom in general.\u201dThe law would mandate that the university operate a campus in the United States, which it currently does not do \u2014 a requirement that Mr. Ignatieff said would be prohibitive financially.He said that the university, which operates as an American institution, was able to preserve its academic freedom because of that.The government\u2019s action raised concern within the European Commission and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as the American government.David J. Kostelancik, the temporary charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the United States Embassy in Budapest, praised the university as an \u201cimportant center for freedom of education in the region.\u201dMr. Soros, a Holocaust survivor, has financed many liberal causes and promoted democracy through his philanthropy, the Open Society Foundations. His right-wing critics assert that a good deal of Mr. Soros\u2019s wealth came from financial speculation and accuse him of having an undue influence on politics in the United States and Europe.Mr. Orban built his career as an opposition figure; as a young man, he was prominent in the activism that helped bring down communism in 1989. But he has shifted far to the right, particularly since taking power in 2010, after an earlier stint as prime minister.Over the last decade though, Fidesz adopted a different message, and now routinely accuses advocates for migrants, for example, of working on behalf of Mr. Soros and \u201cinternational capital.\u201dMr. Ignatieff said government officials had, in private conversations, criticized the university\u2019s choices of educators, among them opposition figures.The move against the university comes as civil society organizations that receive foreign funds, especially those affiliated with Mr. Soros, have come under increasing attack from governments in the region.The university says it has nearly 1,800 students from more than 100 countries and 370 faculty members.Hungarian officials on Wednesday rejected claims that the new legislation was created to target Mr. Soros\u2019s university.\u201cThis is not a move against any university of any foreign country but a clarification of the law,\u201d Laszlo Palkovics, a senior education official, said in a phone interview from Budapest. \u201cJust because a university is affiliated with Mr. Soros, that doesn\u2019t mean that Hungarian law does not equally apply to it.\u201dMr. Palkovics said he would speak with Mr. Ignatieff and also reach out to the United States Embassy.Mr. Kreko called the proposed law \u201can escalation\u201d of troubling trends. \u201cThe Hungarian government is taking ever tougher steps against civil society, higher education, the news media and other sectors,\u201d he said. The proposal was submitted to Parliament on Tuesday and could become law by summer.He warned it was not an isolated move, noting that Mr. Orban\u2019s illiberal democracy is seen by some as a model in the region. \u201cNobody should believe that what is going on in Poland is independent of what goes on in Hungary,\u201d he said.Mr. Ignatieff said that the embassy\u2019s statement was proof that Hungary\u2019s move did not go unnoticed.\u201cIf the government of Hungary was gambling that the Trump administration would say nothing about a flagrant discriminatory attack on an American institution, they judged wrong,\u201d Mr. Ignatieff said.\u201cIn an era of post-truth politics,\u201d he said, \u201cinstitutions that devote themselves to telling people that there is such a thing as knowledge, and it\u2019s the only reliable basis upon which to make public choice, that\u2019s pretty important.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Turkish Trump,\u2019 a Hotel Plan and a Tangle of Foreign Ties", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 Before taking office, Donald J. Trump pledged that his business empire would forgo new deals abroad while he was president. But as the Trump Organization unveils a new brand of hotels, that promise is not preventing the company from bringing foreign deals home.The company, now largely run by Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., has been pursuing a downtown Dallas hotel project with a real estate firm that has deep Turkish roots. The hotel, if built, would fall under the Trump Organization\u2019s Scion chain, a more affordable alternative to its five-star luxury line.An examination by The New York Times of records including corporation registrations, private emails and archived websites found that Alterra Worldwide, the real estate firm that would own the hotel and be partners with the Trumps, has business ties in Russia, Kazakhstan and at least two dozen other countries. Ordinarily, such international experience would be a selling point for the firm, but it is a complicating factor when dealing with Mr. Trump\u2019s company, where concerns already have been raised internally about some of Alterra\u2019s foreign connections.These revelations show that as the Trump Organization rolls out its new hotel line across the country \u2014 properties that the Trumps will manage and their partners will own \u2014 a partnership with Alterra may invite the foreign entanglements and potential conflicts of interest that the company said it sought to avoid in its international dealings.The potential partnership with Mr. Sarimsakci\u2019s firm has not yet cleared those ethical hurdles, and lawyers scrutinizing the deal have privately raised concerns about some of the foreign connections, including Yusuf\u2019s ties to Russia, according to a person briefed on the matter but who was not authorized to speak publicly about Trump Organization business.It is possible that the deal will proceed only if Mr. Sarimsakci agrees to restrictions on his partners and the funding of the deal. The vetting process is iterative, allowing the Trump Organization to restructure deals if the ethics officer raises concerns.\u201cThat particular owner got out ahead of his skis for whatever reason,\u201d said Mr. Danziger, who said that there were four potential Scion deals in the Dallas area, calling it \u201ca perfect market for us.\u201d He said that a potential Alterra partnership was still on the table and that foreign ties would not automatically disqualify it.In drafting his presidential ethics policy, Mr. Trump gave extra consideration to international dealings, given the emoluments clause of the Constitution banning federal employees from accepting gifts from foreign leaders or governments. He pledged that profits made from foreign governments at existing Trump hotels would be donated to the United States Treasury.Projects in the United States, even those funded with foreign money, arguably pose less of a reputational and ethical threat to the company and the president because they would be subject to local laws and regulations. Even so, once foreign money is involved, it can be difficult to trace its origins.Over the past month, Mr. Sarimsakci deferred numerous interview requests from The Times, canceled a dinner meeting and directed reporters to the Trump Organization. When presented with a publication deadline, he provided email responses to only some questions.Yusuf did not respond to messages seeking comment.Born and raised in Turkey, Mike and Yusuf Sarimsakci both attended college in the United States, studying civil engineering as undergraduates at Colorado State and earning master\u2019s degrees from Stanford.Mike Sarimsakci joined the construction firm Bechtel, where he worked on projects like Euro Disney and a theme park in Dubai in the 1990s, before helping to operate a chain of Black Sea Gallery furniture stores in California with his wife\u2019s family.Ultimately, the furniture stores fell on hard times as some customers complained that orders went undelivered for months. Some customers sued. And by 2008, court records show, the company had closed.In an email, Mr. Sarimsakci played down his role in Black Sea Gallery, which he said had \u201c45,000 satisfied clients with over 200,000 deliveries.\u201d\u201cAll the sold goods were delivered,\u201d he said, and \u201cno bankruptcy was declared, as it was an orderly shutdown.\u201dYet Mr. Sarimsakci left a trail of creditors, records show. There was a 2008 lawsuit for about $351,000 that The San Francisco Chronicle said he owed for unpaid advertising costs, which was settled, and tens of thousands of dollars in debt owed to Citibank and Capital One. (He says he does not currently owe them money.)Mr. Moscow, who reviewed the documents for The Times, said there was no indication that Yusuf or his associates were involved in any improper conduct, but added, \u201cYou have a whole bunch of documents that don\u2019t say what these companies do.\u201d\u201cThe use of these entities can be legitimate, or it can be mischievous,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t know and there\u2019s no one who is accountable.\u201dBy 2011, Mr. Sarimsakci, having reinvented himself as a globe-trotting real estate developer, showed up in Dallas.Over the next several years, he announced a series of deals \u2014 two of which took hold. Working with his brother and other partners, he soon took on the pair of redevelopment projects in the city\u2019s downtown, a long-underdeveloped area that has seen a surge of activity in recent years.\u201cHe brings with him a lot of foreign investment in order to get these jobs done,\u201d John Crawford, the vice chairman of Downtown Dallas Inc., a nonprofit focused on urban revitalization, said of Mr. Sarimsakci.While Mr. Sarimsakci has said that he hopes to work on Scion hotels in a number of cities, Dallas appears to be first.Officials in the city \u2014 a Democratic stronghold in a Republican state \u2014 are warming to the idea. It helps that he has not asked the city for financial support, and that the 220-room Scion development would blend into the downtown landscape, unlike a Trump-branded high-rise.\u201cHe is a real innovator,\u201d Dallas\u2019s mayor, Mike Rawlings, a Democrat, said in an interview. He recently met with Mr. Sarimsakci to discuss the Scion project.Alterra Worldwide has a contract to buy the land, currently a parking lot, that the Scion hotel would occupy from Larry Hamilton, a Dallas developer. Mr. Hamilton, while not disclosing the price of the deal, said the offer was too good to pass up.Mr. Hamilton, who said he has gotten to know Mr. Sarimsakci over dinners and met Yusuf in Dallas, did not know of the Trumps\u2019 involvement until after the agreement was in place.\u201cHe\u2019s a wheeler-dealer,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said of Mr. Sarimsakci. \u201cHe seems like a good guy to me.\u201dHe noted that some of the Dallas deals Mr. Sarimsakci pursued \u201cwere not layups.\u201d \u201cBless his soul\u201d for pulling them off, Mr. Hamilton said of Mr. Sarimsakci.Mr. Sarimsakci announced plans for his Scion hotel to local news media outlets in Dallas last month, suggesting that it was a done deal. And last spring he discussed the endeavor with the Turkish publication Hurriyet.\u201cWe know Trump,\u201d he told the publication, according to a translation. \u201cHe is a very good businessman and a very successful person.\u201d He added that the Trumps were considering four-star hotels. \u201cWe will make those together,\u201d he said.With foreign developments shelved, the Scion brand, announced in September, is an essential part of the company\u2019s expansion plans. In addition to Dallas, the Trump Organization is pursuing Scion locations in Austin, Tex., Cincinnati, Nashville and Charlotte, N.C., part of its strategy to open four-star hotels in secondary markets.But Mr. Danziger, the head of the Trump hotel business, warned that up to half the potential Scion deals may fall apart and that potential partners should not get ahead of themselves.\u201cMy experience is the spouting whale that gets harpooned.\u201dSteve Eder reported from Dallas, and Ben Protess from New York.

{"Headline": "Tax on Saudi Aramco Oil Profits Is Cut to Prepare for I.P.O.", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported bySaudi Arabia announced a sharp tax cut for its state oil company on Monday, part of an effort to make it more appealing to international investors in preparation for its promised initial public offering.The tax rate is a vital piece in a puzzle the Saudis need to work out with investment bankers to determine the value of Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s biggest producer of crude oil. Current valuation estimates, ranging from $400 billion to $2 trillion, depend on various calculations of the worth of operations, projections of commodity prices, and costs including taxes.The Saudis hope to offer 5 percent of the company to foreign investors late next year, which would raise as much as $100 billion in what could be the biggest initial public offering in history.The new tax rate for Saudi Aramco will amount to 50 percent, slashed from 85 percent, retroactive to Jan. 1, according to a royal order. The company also pays a 20 percent royalty on revenues.\u201cThe new tax rate will bring Saudi Aramco in line with international benchmarks,\u201d Saudi Aramco\u2019s chief executive officer, Amin H. Nasser, said in a statement.The tax cut was announced a couple of months after intensive discussions with international bankers in Riyadh about how the offering should be structured. Bankers and independent specialists said the cut would help increase the cash flow available for dividends to future investors and also suggested that various Saudi interest groups were reaching a consensus on how to proceed with the privatization.\u201cIt is very much a positive move,\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Seznec, a Middle East energy specialist at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center. \u201cIt means the various Saudi parties involved \u2014 the state, the public investment fund and the royal family \u2014 are negotiating with the idea of coming to a solution.\u201dUnder a privatization, some combination of the government, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, members of the royal family and individual Saudis would share 95 percent of profits and dividends. Dividing that pie is a delicate issue because the government depends on the company for most of its revenue and the company is involved in many social programs, like building hospitals and schools.The Saudi finance minister, Mohammed al-Jadaan, said in a statement that the new tax code for Saudi Aramco would have no impact on government services because any tax revenue lost would be \u201creplaced by stable dividend payments by government-owned companies and other sources of revenue, including profits resulting from investments.\u201dSaudi Aramco does not publicly release information about earnings or the taxes and royalties it pays the government and others. Specialists say commodity prices and sales will determine profits and payments to shareholders, including the government and the royal family, with dividends taking the place of the higher taxes. The Saudis hope that new investment through the share offering will result in a bit of growth that will increase profits.Saudi Aramco\u2019s ability to provide financing for the government has been sharply reduced in the last three years as world oil prices have collapsed. Even after cuts in subsidies and social programs, this year\u2019s government budget deficit is expected to be $53 billion. The Fitch Ratings agency this month downgraded the country\u2019s sovereign credit rating for the second time in a year, and foreign reserves are in worrisome decline.Nevertheless, the taxation announcement was another sign that the initial public offering, which has been slow to get off the ground, may be gaining momentum. King Salman recently completed a three-week tour of Asia in which he advanced Saudi Aramco\u2019s campaign to become a major refining and petrochemical power in China, Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia. Mounting joint investments with some of Saudi Aramco\u2019s biggest customers should increase the value of Saudi Aramco to investors in the future, energy specialists said.Saudi Aramco recently agreed to pay Royal Dutch Shell $2.2 billion in an arrangement splitting their United States refining and marketing business, Motiva Enterprises. That deal will put the refinery in Port Arthur, Tex. \u2014 the largest in the United States \u2014 totally under Saudi Aramco control. That should allow Saudi Arabia to expand, or at least stabilize, oil exports to the United States, which have been declining as American domestic production increases.Energy specialists warn that the offering still faces hurdles. Saudi Aramco will need to be far more transparent to meet Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and members of the royal family may resist having shareholders from Western countries.Failure to attract a large sum of capital for the offering would be deeply embarrassing to King Salman and his favorite son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is pushing the privatization as part of a sweeping reorganization of the national economy.Mr. Seznec said that when he recently visited Saudi Arabia to lecture young middle managers at Saudi Aramco, he noticed a broad confidence that the offering would ultimately succeed.\u201cThere is so much emphasis in the higher levels and lower levels within the kingdom that this I.P.O. will take place,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir vision is to make Saudi Aramco like Exxon Mobil, but much bigger.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the company that can perfect psychological targeting could offer far more potent tools: the ability to manipulate behavior by understanding how someone thinks and what he or she fears.A voter deemed neurotic might be shown a gun-rights commercial featuring burglars breaking into a home, rather than a defense of the Second Amendment; political ads warning of the dangers posed by the Islamic State could be targeted directly at voters prone to anxiety, rather than wasted on those identified as optimistic.\u201cYou can do things that you would not have dreamt of before,\u201d said Alexander Polonsky, chief data scientist at Bloom, a consulting firm that offers \u201cemotion analysis\u201d of social networks and has worked with the center-right Republican Party in France.\u201cIt goes beyond sharing information,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s sharing the thinking and the feeling behind this information, and that\u2019s extremely powerful.\u201dBoth conservatives and liberals are eager to harness that power. In Washington, some Democratic operatives are scrambling to develop personality-profiling capabilities of their own. But even as Cambridge seeks to expand its business among conservative groups, questions about its performance have soured many Republicans in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit.Cambridge is no longer in contention to work for Mr. Trump at the Republican National Committee, a company spokesman confirmed, nor is it working for America First Policies, a new nonprofit formed to help advance the president\u2019s agenda.But when asked to name a single race where the firm\u2019s flagship product had been critical to victory, Mr. Nix declined.\u201cWe bake a cake, it\u2019s got 10 ingredients in it. Psychographics is one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to isolate exactly what the impact of that ingredient is.\u201dCambridge\u2019s parent company, the London-based Strategic Communication Laboratories Group, has a long record of trying to understand and influence behavior. Founded in 1993 by a former British adman, the firm has worked for companies and candidates around the world, as well as for government and military clients. SCL has studied Pakistani jihadists for the British government and provided intelligence assessments for American defense contractors in Iran, Libya and Syria, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times.\u201cTheir approach was seen as serious and focused,\u201d said Mark Laity, chief of strategic communications at NATO\u2019s military headquarters in Europe, who has taken part in NATO-affiliated conferences where SCL has made presentations.In recent years, the company has moved to exploit the revolution in big data to predict human behavior more precisely, working with scientists from the Cambridge University Psychometrics Center. The United States represented a critical new market. Europe has strict privacy protections that limit the use of personal information, but America is more lightly regulated, allowing the sale of huge troves of consumer data to any company or candidate who can afford them.In 2013, Cambridge Analytica was created as SCL\u2019s American operation, and the two companies today share many of their roughly 200 employees, several top executives, and offices in New York and Washington.To develop its profiling system, Cambridge conducts detailed psychological surveys \u2014 by phone and online \u2014 of tens of thousands of people, differentiating them by five traits, a model widely used by behavioral researchers.Uniquely, the company claims to be able to extrapolate those findings to millions of other people it has not surveyed, assigning them one of 32 distinct personality types. Cambridge then blends those profiles with commercial data and voting histories, revealing \u201chidden voter trends and behavioral triggers,\u201d according to a 2016 company brochure.Those profiles, in turn, would allow campaigns to customize advertising, direct-mail slogans and door-knocking scripts, each calibrated to prod the targeted voter toward \u2014 or away from \u2014 a candidate.The promise of psychometrics appealed to Mr. Mercer, a computer scientist who made a fortune helping to lead Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island-based hedge fund. Mr. Mercer and his daughter Rebekah presided over a growing political empire that included millions of dollars in contributions to conservative groups and a stake in Breitbart, whose nationalist and racially antagonistic content prefigured Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Mr. Mercer became Cambridge\u2019s principal investor, according to two former employees. (Like several others interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements and the threat of lawsuits.) Mr. Bannon, the family\u2019s political guru, also advised the company and served as vice president of its board, according to Delaware public records.Mr. Mercer has never spoken publicly about his policy views in depth, but his giving is eclectic: He has financed anti-Clinton documentaries, right-wing media watchdogs, libertarian think tanks and both Senator Ted Cruz, a religious conservative, and Mr. Trump, a thrice-married nationalist.\u201cThe genius here is Bob, and the billionaire in this is Bob, and the person with the extreme views of how the world should be is Bob,\u201d said David Magerman, a Renaissance research scientist who was recently suspended after criticizing his boss\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.As the 2016 presidential campaign began, however, Cambridge landed a marquee political client: Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator. Mr. Mercer seeded a super PAC with $11 million to support him.Cambridge had a talented salesman in Mr. Nix, an Eton-educated SCL director chosen to lead the American effort. Among colleagues, his skills at cajoling clients are legendary. At an office party at a London dog track in the summer of 2015, one young employee offered an affectionate toast.\u201cHe is so smooth he\u2019ll rub shoulders with politicians and their campaigns,\u201d the employee joked, according to a video of the event posted on YouTube, \u201cand, in their face, tell them he\u2019s going to rip them off.\u201dBut Cambridge\u2019s psychographic models proved unreliable in the Cruz presidential campaign, according to Rick Tyler, a former Cruz aide, and another consultant involved in the campaign. In one early test, more than half the Oklahoma voters whom Cambridge had identified as Cruz supporters actually favored other candidates. The campaign stopped using Cambridge\u2019s data entirely after the South Carolina primary.\u201cWhen they were hired, from the outset it didn\u2019t strike me that they had a wide breadth of experience in the American political landscape,\u201d Mr. Tyler said.Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon were aggressive advocates for Cambridge. When the campaign disputed a $2.5 million invoice, they lit into Mr. Cruz\u2019s senior campaign team during a conference call, according to the consultant. Cambridge Analytica, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon claimed, was the only thing keeping Mr. Cruz afloat. (The company declined to comment on the exchange, as did a personal spokeswoman for Mr. Bannon and the Mercers.)After the Cruz campaign flamed out, Mr. Nix persuaded Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director, Brad Parscale, to try out the firm. Its data products were considered for Mr. Trump\u2019s critical get-out-the-vote operation. But tests showed Cambridge\u2019s data and models were slightly less effective than the existing Republican National Committee system, according to three former Trump campaign aides.Mr. Bannon at one point agreed to expand the company\u2019s role, according to the aides, authorizing Cambridge to oversee a $5 million purchase of television ads. But after some of them appeared on cable channels in Washington, D.C. \u2014 hardly an election battleground \u2014 Cambridge\u2019s involvement in television targeting ended.In postelection conversations with potential clients, Cambridge has promoted itself as the brains behind Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory. One brochure circulated to clients this year, which details Cambridge\u2019s expertise in behavioral targeting, also calls the company\u2019s \u201cpivotal role\u201d in electing Mr. Trump its \u201cbiggest success politically in the United States.\u201dTrump aides, though, said Cambridge had played a relatively modest role, providing personnel who worked alongside other analytics vendors on some early digital advertising and using conventional microtargeting techniques. Later in the campaign, Cambridge also helped set up Mr. Trump\u2019s polling operation and build turnout models used to guide the candidate\u2019s spending and travel schedule. None of those efforts involved psychographics.At a conference in Munich last month, Alexander Tayler, Cambridge\u2019s chief data officer, dodged a question about whether Cambridge would work with far-right parties in European elections this year. He also played down the role of psychological profiling in the company\u2019s work, much of which, Mr. Tayler suggested, is still based on traditional data analytics and marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s not about being sinister,\u201d Mr. Tayler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about tricking people into voting for a candidate who they wouldn\u2019t otherwise support. It\u2019s just about making marketing more efficient.\u201dEven before the election, according to one former employee, Cambridge employees attended sessions about soliciting government business in the United States \u2014 where Mr. Trump now oversees the federal bureaucracy and Mr. Bannon is arguably the White House\u2019s most powerful staff member. According to documents obtained by The Times, SCL is pursuing work for at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Commerce Department and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Mr. Bannon\u2019s spokeswoman said he stepped down from the Cambridge board in August, when he joined the Trump campaign, and \u201chas no financial involvement\u201d with the firm currently. She declined to say whether Mr. Bannon previously held equity in the firm.Late last month, SCL executives met with Pentagon officials who advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff on information warfare. A reference document submitted in advance of that meeting indicates that the company has worked as a subcontractor on roughly a dozen Pentagon projects, many of them \u201ccounter-radicalization\u201d assessments in Pakistan and Yemen.Such intelligence work is the bread and butter of SCL\u2019s government contracting in other countries. And the firm\u2019s experience in trying to influence Muslim sentiment abroad dovetails with Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon\u2019s focus on combating the Islamic State.At the moment, according to former employees, Cambridge has relatively few well-known corporate clients in the United States. Among them are ECI New York, a clothing company, and Goldline, which sells gold coins and markets heavily to listeners of conservative talk radio.A spokesman for MasterCard declined to say if it would do business with Cambridge. The Yankees did not sign on.But Mr. Nix appears to have bigger ambitions. \u201cI think were are on the cusp of something enormous,\u201d he said.Data science is about to reshape marketing, Mr. Nix maintained, and the big advertising conglomerates would survive only by developing their own targeting technology \u2014 or acquiring companies like Cambridge.\u201cThose agencies that don\u2019t adapt will die,\u201d Mr. Nix said.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

Stringer, the city comptroller, found that over 10 years, Mr. Hevesi\u2019s plan could cut the city\u2019s shelter population by 80 percent among families with children and 40 percent among single adults.\u201cThe de Blasio administration is doing the best they can, but they need help,\u201d Mr. Hevesi said. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep building shelters to get our way out of this.\u201dThere are concerns that increasing the subsidy could lead landlords to raise rents, dissuade those receiving public assistance from seeking inexpensive apartments, and put recipients at risk of becoming homeless if they lose their benefits while living in units they cannot otherwise afford.Under the settlement, the eviction-prevention subsidy, which has been limited to families with minor children being sued by a landlord, will rise to $1,515 a month from $850 for a family of three. Domestic violence victims, whether facing eviction proceedings or not, can now get the subsidy.Mr. Hevesi said in a statement this week that the settlement, which applied only to New York City residents, did not go far enough. In a separate interview, he said the savings his plan would generate made concerns about its cost misplaced.According to the mayor\u2019s most recent management report, it costs about $44,000 a year to shelter a homeless family. Mr. Hevesi estimates his plan\u2019s cost at about $11,000 a year for a family of three.The analysis by Mr. Stringer\u2019s office showed that the plan would yield future savings for the city, including about $316 million in the 10th year.Mr. Stringer said the analysis showed that the city could improve on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s goal with the state\u2019s help, though doing so would require subsidy recipients to find affordable units. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do more, you need to seek out partners,\u201d he said.At a forum sponsored by Crain\u2019s New York Business on Wednesday, Steven Banks, the city\u2019s social services commissioner, said that in preparing the plan it presented this week, the de Blasio administration examined movement in and out of the system, and the factors that drove it.In the last fiscal year, about 8,300 homeless families with children left the city\u2019s shelter system for permanent housing, the mayor\u2019s management report shows; 13,000 families moved into the system.Mr. Banks, a former attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society, said the city\u2019s plan did not account for Mr. Hevesi\u2019s proposal.\u201cWe welcome those ideas to the table,\u201d he said, adding that the mayor\u2019s plan was \u201ca realistic, concrete operational plan that says, with the resources that are available to us, this is what is achievable, and it is very bottom-line truth-telling about where we can get to. As I said, my bookshelf at Legal Aid was full of lots of plans that never got very far.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Years of Ethics Charges, but Star Cancer Researcher Gets a Pass", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byDr. Carlo Croce is among the most prolific scientists in an emerging area of cancer research involving what is sometimes called the \u201cdark matter\u201d of the human genome. A department chairman at Ohio State University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Croce has parlayed his decades-long pursuit of cancer remedies into a research empire: He has received more than $86 million in federal grants as a principal investigator and, by his own count, more than 60 awards.With that flamboyant success has come a quotient of controversy. Some scientists argue that Dr. Croce has overstated his expansive claims for the therapeutic promise of his work, and that his laboratory is focused more on churning out papers than on carefully assessing its experimental data.But a far less public scientific drama has been playing out in the Biomedical Research Tower that houses Dr. Croce\u2019s sprawling laboratory on Ohio State\u2019s campus in Columbus.Over the last several years, Dr. Croce has been fending off a tide of allegations of data falsification and other scientific misconduct, according to federal and state records, whistle-blower complaints and correspondence with scientific journals obtained by The New York Times.In 2013, an anonymous critic contacted Ohio State and the federal authorities with allegations of falsified data in more than 30 of Dr. Croce\u2019s papers. Since 2014, another critic, David A. Sanders, a virologist who teaches at Purdue University, has made claims of falsified data and plagiarism directly to scientific journals where more than 20 of Dr. Croce\u2019s papers have been published.\u201cIt\u2019s a reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d Dr. Sanders said in an interview.As a result of complaints by Dr. Sanders and others, journals have been posting notices of problems with Dr. Croce\u2019s papers at a quickening pace. From just a handful of notices before 2013 \u2014 known as corrections, retractions and editors\u2019 notices \u2014 the number has ballooned to at least 20, with at least three more on the way, according to journal editors. Many of the notices involve the improper manipulation of a humble but universal lab technique called western blotting, which measures gene function in a cell and often indicates whether an experiment has succeeded or failed.Dr. Croce\u2019s story is a case study of the complex and often countervailing forces at work as science seeks to police itself.Despite the lashing criticisms of his work, Dr. Croce has never been penalized for misconduct, either by federal oversight agencies or by Ohio State, which has cleared him in at least five cases involving his work or the grant money he receives.At Ohio State, officials said they were unaware of Dr. Sanders\u2019s charges against Dr. Croce until asked about them for this article. Now, in the wake of those and other questions from The Times, the university has decided to take a new look to determine whether it handled those cases properly. \u201cThe university is instituting an independent external review,\u201d a spokesman, Christopher Davey, said in a statement, adding that the review \u201cis not an indication that we have discovered any evidence of scientific misconduct or other issues raised in your inquiry.\u201dWhatever the outcome of that review, Mr. Davey said, decisions on research misconduct at Ohio State were based solely on \u201cthe facts and the merits of each individual case,\u201d not a researcher\u2019s grant money. Any other suggestion would be \u201cfalse and offensive,\u201d he said, adding that the university has \u201cspent significantly more to support his research program than he has brought in from outside sources.\u201dDuring an interview in October, and in a later statement, Dr. Croce, 72, denied any wrongdoing, said he had been singled out in some of the accusations simply because he was a prominent figure, and largely placed the blame for any problems with figures or text on junior researchers or collaborators at other labs. Academic papers often have multiple authors, with the scientists who perform the hands-on work listed at the beginning and the senior scientists in charge named at the end.\u201cIt is true that errors sometimes occur in the preparation of figures for publication,\u201d Dr. Croce said in the statement, issued through the Columbus law firm Kegler Brown Hill & Ritter. Any mistakes with figures were \u201chonest errors,\u201d he said, adding that he did not condone plagiarism but that he must rely on co-authors to provide proper attribution.Even before his arrival at Ohio State in 2004, Dr. Croce had stepped beyond the generally expected bounds of cancer research. In 1994, he joined the scientific advisory board of the Council for Tobacco Research, which the tobacco companies created to fight the public perception \u2014 supported by increasingly overwhelming scientific evidence \u2014 that smoking caused cancer. Dr. Croce said in the interview and the statement that he had always believed that smoking caused cancer.During the same period, Dr. Croce and a colleague faced federal allegations that they had submitted false claims for payment of grant money for science that was never carried out and that was to be overseen by a scientist who had, in fact, left the United States and gone to Italy. After the case was combined with a second fraud investigation, a civil settlement forced Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, where Dr. Croce worked at the time, to pay $2.6 million to the government. Neither Dr. Croce nor the other parties to the settlement admitted any wrongdoing in the case.In a world where most scientists are so wary of public conflict that they seem to apportion criticism with a pipette, the new doubts about Dr. Croce\u2019s work draw carefully measured opinions from some towering figures.Randy Schekman, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, said he had informally advised Dr. Sanders in 2015 on lodging a complaint about Dr. Croce\u2019s work with the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which he once edited and which has been the most common venue for Dr. Croce\u2019s work, according to the PubMed database. \u201cI am aware of the allegations, and I am aware of other concerns that have been raised about Croce\u2019s work outside of these specific allegations,\u201d Dr. Schekman said.Another Nobel Prize-winning biologist, Phillip Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who said he had been previously unaware of the misconduct allegations, offered qualified support.\u201cI would say Carlo has made some important contributions to the molecular causes of cancer,\u201d Dr. Sharp said. \u201cI can\u2019t condone the sloppiness he has in general. But if I look historically at what Carlo has done, if I delete Carlo from the scientific community, I think the scientific community is a little less, and that isn\u2019t true of everybody who publishes papers.\u201dDr. Croce is nothing if not confident. Wearing an untucked pink polo shirt and jeans, he expounded on his career last fall in the interview in his corner office, where a computer screen rose above mounds of papers blanketing a conference table.\u201cScientists are like cows,\u201d he said. \u201cThey like to follow something which has already been established.\u201dDr. Croce, who has a medical degree but no Ph.D., showed his own willingness to buck scientific consensus when he became an adviser to the Council for Tobacco Research. A federal court later found that the council was central to a conspiracy to deceive the public on the dangers of smoking. Dr. Croce stayed on until the council was disbanded in the industry\u2019s more than $100 billion settlement with tobacco plaintiffs in 1998.During the interview, Dr. Croce said he believed that smoking was the primary cause of lung cancer; that belief, he said in his later statement, dated from \u201clong before\u201d he joined the tobacco council.Still, some of the research Dr. Croce pioneered in those years was used by the tobacco industry to fight the assertion that smoking caused cancer.In 1996, Dr. Croce and co-workers made international news with their discovery of a gene called the fragile histidine triad \u2014 FHIT for short. His claims for its importance could hardly have been more sweeping: Damage to the gene, Dr. Croce told The Associated Press, was probably \u201cthe starting point of the most common human malignancies, including lung, esophagus and colon cancer.\u201dDr. Croce was careful to point out in his scientific papers that carcinogens in cigarette smoke could in fact be the agents that damaged the FHIT gene, and there is no evidence that he publicly defended the tobacco industry. \u201cNone of the work reflected in these papers suggested, stated or implied that cancer was caused by an inherited genetic condition,\u201d Dr. Croce said in his statement to The Times.Dr. Croce said he had been unaware at the time that his name was used to lend credibility to any assertion that smoking did not cause cancer or that the causality had not been proved. Any such use of his name, his statement said, \u201cwas false and fraudulent.\u201dAmong Dr. Croce\u2019s peers, there was skepticism of Dr. Croce\u2019s broad claims for the FHIT gene, and today some scientists say it seems more a marker of malignancy than the \u201cRosetta Stone\u201d of cancer research, as some news reports called it at the time.During the interview, Dr. Croce continued to promote the FHIT research but conceded that \u201cit\u2019s not fashionable anymore.\u201dDr. Croce, chairman of the department of cancer biology and genetics at Ohio State, has since moved on to one of the hottest areas of genomics and cancer research. He has looked beyond the small fraction of human DNA that actually encodes for proteins \u2014 less than 2 percent \u2014 to the rest of the DNA, once all but ignored as contributing little to the workings of a cell.Scientists came to realize that this DNA could make short molecules that influence how genes, and therefore living cells, operate. If genes are the notes on a keyboard, those molecules act as volume controls \u2014 regulators of gene expression.Some of those short molecules are called microRNAs. Dr. Croce\u2019s work has linked various cancers to a deficiency or overabundance of certain microRNAs. Those effects, he asserted in a 2009 article, contribute to \u201cmost, if not all, human malignancies.\u201d MicroRNAs, he posited, could lead to entirely new cancer therapies.Once again, the scope of Dr. Croce\u2019s claims has left colleagues wary. While few researchers dispute the role of microRNA as a cancer marker, there is skepticism that the case has been made for its therapeutic potential.\u201cYou\u2019ll find scientists who say it\u2019s hype,\u201d said Graham Brock, a cancer researcher who has studied the molecules. While Dr. Croce is not the only scientist who may be overselling the findings, he added, \u201che\u2019s probably the strongest advocate.\u201dThe email, sent on Nov. 1, 2007, came from an official at the National Institutes of Health, the federal grant-giving agency, and it could not have been more straightforward: Major sections of a grant proposal by Dr. Croce were essentially identical to one submitted four months earlier by a junior colleague at Ohio State.\u201cWe will be withdrawing the second application,\u201d the official wrote.At that point, documents show, two things happened that would become familiar in Dr. Croce\u2019s record. First, the university was obliged to open what it called a \u201creview of potential research misconduct,\u201d in this case involving potential plagiarism in a federal grant proposal. Second, the university cleared him, largely because the junior colleague provided a somewhat circuitous explanation. The two had worked together on a previous project, the colleague said, and Dr. Croce appeared to have reused some of that material. As a result, Caroline C. Whitacre, then the university\u2019s vice dean for research, concluded, \u201cThe incident does not indicate possible misconduct as defined by the university\u2019s policy.\u201dOver the next several years, there were other allegations, investigations and closed cases.A tipster alleged that over several years, an official at the Croce lab used Dr. Croce\u2019s grant money for personal trips abroad and improperly pressured lab members to include the official\u2019s name on research papers.In another series of allegations and subsequent appeals, a former research colleague accused Dr. Croce of scientific misconduct involving, among other things, using the researcher\u2019s work without credit on patents.Dr. Croce was cleared in both of those cases. But that was just the beginning.The new allegations came from a pseudonymous source both legendary and loathed in biomedical circles: a scientific gadfly known as Clare Francis. Whoever Clare Francis actually is, he or she has an uncanny knack for seeing improperly altered images, as well as smaller flaws that some editors are inclined to ignore.Clare Francis has a particular, high-strung style. \u201cYou misunderstand that Carlo Croce is a great scientist,\u201d Clare Francis wrote in a note copied to John Dahlberg, then the deputy director at the research integrity office. \u201cMy reply was that he has over a thousand papers. That is not the same thing. You simply misunderstand science. Please stop talking about reputations and look at the reality!\u201dMindful of the hurdles that an investigation would face at Ohio State, as well as federal constraints like a six-year statute of limitations, Dr. Dahlberg trimmed Clare Francis\u2019 initial list of allegations to the two he considered the most actionable. One paper was on the FHIT gene, another on microRNA research.Even then, Dr. Dahlberg knew that any investigation by Ohio State of what he called \u201ca rainmaker\u201d for the university would face serious obstacles. With the number of more junior researchers involved in the work, Dr. Dahlberg was also skeptical that Dr. Croce\u2019s knowledge of any falsifications could be obtained in a straightforward way \u2014 for example, from data and records on his own computer.\u201cMy sense was, Carlo Croce\u2019s too big to make findings of misconduct on,\u201d Dr. Dahlberg said in an interview. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201dWithin the realm of biomedical science, it falls to the Office of Research Integrity to issue formal findings of scientific misconduct, which can lead to suspension of federal financing and effectively end a research career. The office labors under an awkward constraint: It does not carry out its own investigations, but relies on accused researchers\u2019 own institutions to forward their findings.There are also dollars at stake. Of the $29.1 million Dr. Croce has received in federal funding as a principal investigator while at Ohio State, university records show, $8.7 million has gone directly to the university in overhead payments, a fairly standard cut for research institutions.The initial inquiry was compromised by relying on Dr. Elton\u2019s own assurances, Dr. Dahlberg said, adding, \u201cWhen somebody is accused of being dishonest, why do you believe everything he says?\u201dAs with the Elton case, and the university\u2019s earlier handling of complaints against Dr. Croce, documents suggest little appetite for taking the Clare Francis allegations seriously.In May 2013, the university\u2019s research integrity officer \u2014 ostensibly an impartial observer \u2014 wrote to Dr. Dahlberg largely to pass along disparaging information on Clare Francis, including the irritation that his or her persistence had caused for some journal editors. The officer, Jennifer Yucel, who had been involved in the initial inquiry into Dr. Elton, said the information had come from \u201cCarlo\u201d \u2014 Dr. Croce.Among the attachments was an earlier note from Dr. Croce to the editor of a British journal who had received complaints from Clare Francis. \u201cClearly we are dealing with a mentally deranged person who should be recovered in a mental institution,\u201d Dr. Croce wrote.With that preamble, what Ohio State called a \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d of possible misconduct went ahead. Two younger scientists working with Dr. Croce admitted that they had improperly duplicated, mishandled and mislabeled a number of western blot figures and other data in the papers, emails obtained by The Times show. The scientists called the problems unintentional.Ohio State took the scientists at their word. But in a July 2013 document marked \u201cconfidential and sensitive,\u201d the university told Dr. Croce to generate a plan detailing how he would \u201caddress the systemic deficiencies in data collection, handling and retention identified in this case.\u201d In addition, he was to assist his junior colleagues \u201cin correcting or retracting the two papers.\u201dIn the statement issued through his lawyers, Dr. Croce said he and a colleague \u201cprepared and carried out a written action plan.\u201d But the university apparently never ensured that its demands were met.There was a final twist: Ohio State referred to its findings as an \u201calternative resolution\u201d under the university\u2019s policy \u2014 meaning no formal finding of fraud or scientific misconduct. In fact, Ohio State decided not to convene a formal investigation committee, in part because \u201cthere is very little data for the committee to review\u201d \u2014 a reference to the failure of the scientists to locate almost any of their original data. Those decisions allowed the case to remain largely confidential. The integrity office accepted the result.In response to questions from The Times, Ohio State issued a statement on behalf of Dr. Whitacre and Dr. Yucel, saying they \u201cbelieve they followed all policies and procedures in their roles in responding to the matters involving Dr. Carlo Croce based on the facts that were available at the time.\u201dDr. Sanders, the Purdue virologist, tests his analysis of data falsification in Dr. Croce\u2019s papers in a particularly direct way: He teaches one of them to his sophomore biology students as an example of scientific misconduct. But instead of telling them what to look for, he simply flashes a series of western blots onto a screen and asks the students if they see anything amiss.\u201cThis is the one I start with because it\u2019s so obvious,\u201d Dr. Sanders said. \u201cThere\u2019s uncomfortable laughter. They say, \u2018Why would these people get away with that?\u2019\u201d When he adds that the journal declined to take action, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re very stunned that that sort of thing happens.\u201dIn response to questions from The Times, the journal said that two \u201csubject experts\u201d it consulted after Dr. Sanders challenged the paper in 2014 \u201cdisagreed on whether the images were duplicates.\u201d Therefore, the journal said, editors \u201ccould not conclusively determine\u201d whether to issue a notice.Dr. Sanders, 56, studies how modified versions of viruses, like Ebola, could be used to treat disease. He is also chairman of the faculty senate, a member of the city council and president of his synagogue. He ran several quixotic campaigns for Congress \u2014 as a Democrat in a deep-red Indiana district. He lost.After receiving several tips on Dr. Croce\u2019s work, Dr. Sanders said, he decided to undertake yet another moonlighting effort: as a \u201cfreelance ethicist.\u201d \u201cA lab that is engaging in violating scientific norms is being rewarded for that very effort,\u201d he said.Dr. Croce said in his statement that until he was contacted for this article, he had not been aware of Dr. Sanders \u201cor of his role in sending allegations to journals.\u201d As for the WWOX paper, Dr. Croce\u2019s response appears to have varied. Diane Sullenberger, executive editor of the Proceedings, said the journal had contacted Dr. Croce over the allegations of image manipulation in the paper.\u201cDr. Croce disagrees,\u201d Ms. Sullenberger said.But in his statement to The Times, Dr. Croce responded differently. \u201cIt is possible, but not certain, that an error was made,\u201d he said, adding that if there was an error, \u201cit affects nothing,\u201d because the results were confirmed in separate experiments.The Times showed the paper to four experts in the forensic analysis of images in research papers, and all agreed that the blots had almost certainly been duplicated by the authors.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to believe that they can\u2019t keep their images straight, but they can keep their science straight,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHow can I trust their results, their conclusions?\u201dConcerns about falsified data in the scientific literature run far deeper than Dr. Croce\u2019s papers.The Times provided an author of that study, Elisabeth Bik, then at Stanford, with a list of published corrections involving the blots in Dr. Croce\u2019s papers. \u201cYes, the image problems in most of these are very similar to the ones we encountered,\u201d she said.Because the study focused on a tiny slice of the literature that allowed researchers to see immediate problems \u2014 duplications of western blots \u2014 the potential implications are distressing, said another author, Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chairman of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s school of public health.\u201cScience is built on science,\u201d Dr. Casadevall said. \u201cNothing new stands alone.\u201d Incorrect or fraudulent papers, he said, \u201ccould be slowing the pace of everything.\u201dDr. Bik vouched for the difficulty of pushing journals to act on evidence of bad data. As of October, this was her box score after contacting journals about all of the papers with problematic images: 32 retractions; 111 corrections; 52 notices that the journals had decided to take no action; and nearly 600 cases with no reply, basic acknowledgment of the message or general statement that the journal would look into it.Another author of the study, Dr. Ferric Fang, a microbiology professor and journal editor at the University of Washington, said improper images began turning up in the 1990s. Then came a steep rise around 2003.Previously, to present their research, scientists had to take Polaroid pictures of their data to an outside production specialist. Without pinning blame on any specific software package, Dr. Fang pointed out that Adobe Creative Suite was released in 2003, allowing scientists to produce their own images on a laptop.\u201cThere was a burgeoning of software tools,\u201d he said, increasing the ease \u2014 and perhaps the temptation \u2014 to tweak or fabricate images.David E. Wright, a former director of the federal integrity office, said cases of fraud could reverberate through whole fields of research.\u201cWhen you find somebody who\u2019s a leading figure in a field like that, it\u2019s kind of a pail of cold water on that part of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t stop colleagues from following their own research, but it\u2019s pretty discouraging. It impugns the reputation of science in general and scientists in that field in particular.\u201dAs for Dr. Croce\u2019s work, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has reversed its stance.After being contacted by The Times, the journal\u2019s editor, Ms. Sullenberger, consulted with Dr. O\u2019Brien at Berkeley and other analysts. The expert who in 2014 thought the duplication was unlikely, she said, now \u201caccepts the new analyses because of their sophisticated nature.\u201dThe journal, Ms. Sullenberger said, is now planning to issue a notice to readers about concerns regarding the WWOX paper.Benedict Carey and Walt Bogdanich contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Rival Campaigns for N.J. Governor\u2019s Race Volley Accusations", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byAt the heart of the complaint, filed by the campaign of Jim Johnson, is an argument that Mr. Murphy\u2019s two organizations, New Start New Jersey and New Way New Jersey, were nonprofits in name only. Instead, the complaint says, they essentially act as a political campaign without the scrutiny and regulations that come with being a candidate and the freedom to accept and spend money without disclosure.\u201cFor me, this was a very clear indication that what\u2019s been undertaken by the Murphy campaign is precisely the sort of the-rules-don\u2019t-apply-to-us behavior that this state needs to change,\u201d Mr. Johnson, a former deputy under secretary of the Treasury, said in a call with reporters on Thursday.The Murphy campaign rejected the complaint, saying it would seek to have it dismissed.\u201cThere is absolutely no merit to his complaint but there is lots of merit to the notion that he is wasting taxpayers\u2019 money in forcing ELEC to look into allegations that he, as an attorney, knows don\u2019t pass the laugh test,\u201d said Julie Roginsky, a senior adviser to the Murphy campaign.But the actions taken by the Johnson campaign indicate that the Democratic primary for governor here, with 68 days to go, is entering a new phase, with attack ads, accusations and negative campaigning soon to come, despite Mr. Murphy\u2019s double-digit lead in early polling and winning a majority of the county endorsements.Indeed, mere hours after the Johnson complaint was released to reporters, the Murphy campaign responded with an allegation of its own, blasting a release to reporters trying to tie Mr. Johnson to the actions of his former law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, in representing the de Blasio administration. This kicked off a news release battle common in modern politics, where the ease of blasting out a message is as simple as pressing \u201csend.\u201dAnd before the evening news, the campaign of John Wisniewski, another Democratic candidate vying for the nomination, had formally joined the Johnson complaint.The complaint argues that New Start New Jersey, a group founded by Mr. Murphy to explore policy issues, did the policy polling and building for his eventual campaign, and therefore was \u201ctesting the waters\u201d and should be treated as a campaign committee.The complaint continues that New Way for New Jersey, a political nonprofit formed by Mr. Murphy and top Democratic operatives, was in essence Mr. Murphy\u2019s campaign, as they made numerous television ads featuring Mr. Murphy and his family speaking directly to the camera, hosted town halls for Mr. Murphy and employed nearly the entire staff that would eventually make up the Murphy campaign.If the commission were to find that either of Mr. Murphy\u2019s groups were performing campaign duties, his campaign could face a fine. However, political observers in New Jersey have noted that maintaining nonprofit and political groups before announcing for public office is a common tactic.\u201cThis is not an uncommon practice,\u201d said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. \u201cA lot of candidates or people who eventually become candidates start off by creating some kind of nonprofit. They get registered under different names that promote an agenda.\u201dThe Johnson campaign, in its complaint and accompanying news release, is framing the issue as not just foul play but of also Mr. Johnson\u2019s commitment to getting money out of politics.\u201cI have brought or have participated in many cases that have protected voting rights and I worked to rein in campaign spending,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThis step is completely consistent with that, it is an extension of what I have done now for more than a decade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bike Lanes Are for Immigrants? A Queens Official\u2019s View Draws Fire", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byThe latest meeting of a community board in Queens had barely begun when one member, Ann Pfoser Darby, stood up.Board officials held their breath and reporters held up video cameras poised to capture what might be her next controversial comment.She mentioned her support for naming a new library for Antonin Scalia, the conservative Supreme Court justice who died last year, not a popular motion at this meeting of the ethnically diverse Community Board 4 in Corona, Queens. She also assailed an initiative to help inexperienced voters, despite the sizable group of Spanish-speaking people on hand.At a previous meeting, Ms. Pfoser Darby denounced proposed bike lanes as a taxpayer-financed amenity for the undocumented immigrants she claims are their main users.In her decades of public service, Ms. Pfoser Darby, 82, has seen this pocket of Queens change from a largely white enclave to a neighborhood with a mostly foreign-born population of Hispanics and Asians \u2014 and where by 2015, the white population had dwindled to less than 7 percent.At a time of growing concern over intolerance and as American neighborhoods become more diverse, Ms. Pfoser Darby\u2019s story might serve as a lens into the fraught dynamics at play as immigrants change the complexion of many parts of the country.Her remarks about undocumented immigrants and bike lanes have elicited calls for her removal from the board. Among other things, Ms. Pfoser Darby has said that once President Trump deports the undocumented immigrants from Corona, there will be no need for bike lanes.A local city councilwoman, Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, said Ms. Pfoser Darby was promoting hatred and ignorance and did not deserve to remain a board member.Ms. Ferreras-Copeland secured financing in 2013 for the bike lane project and had criticized the community board for obstructing the proposal for three years. The board\u2019s approval is important, but not necessary to the project, and this week city officials announced that the plan would proceed. But Ms. Ferreras-Copeland said Ms. Pfoser Darby\u2019s comments raised \u201clegitimate concerns that this bigoted attitude\u201d had delayed the projectMs. Pfoser Darby called the councilwoman\u2019s remarks politically motivated, and described herself as \u201c100 percent not a racist.\u201d She called it absurd to be vilified for expecting deportation laws to be enforced.\u201cForeign people they love me,\u201d she said, referring to immigrants with legal status. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019ve gone out of my way to help foreign people.\u201dEven Ms. Pfoser Darby terminology makes fellow board members cringe. Besides using labels such as \u201cforeign people,\u2019\u2019 and \u201cillegals,\u2019\u2019 she refers to Asian-Americans as \u201cOrientals.\u201dMs. Pfoser Darby\u2019s willingness to openly share her opinions is not new, but her outspokenness on undocumented immigrants has reverberated with the election of President Trump, who she said is \u201cfinally doing something about the illegals.\u201dShe remained adamant about her position on the bike-lane proposal: \u201cI said the truth \u2014 the bike lanes are made specifically for the people who come into the country illegally.\u201dShe said she surmised cyclists using area bike lanes were undocumented immigrants by their lack of English and nervous mannerisms.When Ms. Pfoser Darby joined the board 30 years ago, its members were predominantly white. Hispanic members now make up the largest share, and white members make up about one-quarter.\u201cI go all the way back and I\u2019ve seen the whole thing transform,\u201d she said of the board\u2019s district, which covers several square miles of Corona and Elmhurst where Hispanics and Asians make up the overwhelming majority of the population.Mr. Trump, who grew up several miles away from the district, earned some of the lowest voting percentages in the country there \u2014 in the single digits at many polling sites.And just as Mr. Trump stirred emotions on a national level on illegal immigration, Ms. Darby, a longtime Republican, has done it on a hyper-local level.Some community board members regard Ms. Pfoser Darby as someone stuck in the past who is looking for a scapegoat for problems such as overcrowding and crime.Alirio Orduna, 68, a board member who immigrated from Colombia 50 years ago, said Ms. Pfoser Darby was fueled not by intolerance, but by frustration over conditions in parts of the district.\u201cRoosevelt Avenue looks like a third world country, and that\u2019s partly why she feels this way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once you become a public servant you have to watch what you say.\u201dShe taught English at Newtown High School in Queens in the 1960s where Ms. Pfoser Darby said she helped create and finance immigrant advocacy programs, including the \u201cOriental Culture Club\u201d for Asian students, which led to her becoming a godmother to two Chinese immigrant girls to whom she remains close.\u201cI\u2019ve been around immigrants my whole life \u2014 I was on the front lines of helping immigrants \u2014 but I have to draw the line between those who are legal and those who are not,\u201d said Ms. Pfoser Darby.Her political mentor was Martin J. Knorr, a Republican and Conservative state senator whom she assisted in opposing busing initiatives to achieve racial balance in city schools.She has spent sleepless nights, she said, wrestling with the proper Christian attitude toward undocumented immigrants.\u201cJesus would want me to do what is the law,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as compassion, what about the compassion to the taxpayers?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ross, a seminal theorist whose work over three decades reshaped the field of financial economics, died on March 3 at his home in Old Lyme, Conn. He was 73.The cause was sudden cardiac arrest, his wife, Carol Ross, said.The theory, which he developed in 1976, makes clear how powerful economic factors like inflation or spikes in interest rates can influence the price of an asset. At its core, the theory offers a framework for analyzing risks and returns in financial markets.Professor Ross also delved into the mysteries of the stock market and its inherent risks. He coined the term agency theory, which has been instrumental in finance and economics. Using the theory, he explored how companies, through governance, can align incentives for managers with those for rank-and-file workers.He is also credited with pioneering what is known as the binomial model for pricing stock options.Professor Ross relished marshaling complex theories honed in the academic world and applying them to Wall Street, where they could be used to address practical problems. His contributions to the finance industry earned him the Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics in 2015.J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, a co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank at the time, said in a statement that Professor Ross\u2019s work was the \u201cfoundation for all the risk-factor models we use today.\u201dAntoinette Schoar, a Sloan professor and the head of the school\u2019s finance department, said in a phone interview that \u201call of Steve\u2019s intellectually intricate finance theories were aimed at solving real-world problems.\u201dHis models, Professor Schoar added, \u201cwere both extremely elegant and extremely practical.\u201dThe binomial model alone, she noted, is ubiquitous on Wall Street.Professor Ross possessed an agile intellect and cared above all about getting his research right, even if doing so meant updating or changing his models to improve them, his colleagues said.His passion for accuracy was behind his arbitrage pricing theory. The mathematical model identified assets that were fundamentally mispriced, because they were trading at either too high or too low a price, and could be used to determine their true value.Professor Ross\u2019s work was applied across a range of fields, including asset pricing, investment management and corporate finance. And he helped launch many successful financial careers.He was also an adviser to government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Commerce Department and the Treasury. He was president of the American Finance Association in 1988 and at one point chairman of the American Express Advisory Panel.He wrote more than 100 articles about finance and economics and, as a co-author, \u201cCorporate Finance,\u201d a textbook used at business schools across the country.Stephen Alan Ross was born on Feb. 3, 1944, in Boston and raised in Brookline, Mass. He graduated from the California Institute of Technology, where he majored in physics. He went on to get a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. Before joining the M.I.T. faculty, he taught at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and at Yale University.His work has been recognized with numerous awards, including the 2007 Jean-Jacques Laffont Prize from the Toulouse School of Economics.In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Katherine, and a son, Jonathan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Inc. Plots a Future Beyond Its Heyday, as Suitors Line Up", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byOnstage at a recent industry conference with the longtime leaders of the country\u2019s biggest magazine publishers, Rich Battista, the new chief executive of Time Inc., did not seem the outsider. Tieless, with legs crossed, he ticked off his company\u2019s latest accomplishments \u2014 robust digital growth, updated advertising capabilities \u2014 with the swagger of a knowing publishing chieftain.\u201cThere\u2019s something really exciting happening at our company,\u201d he said, echoing what had become something of a rallying cry at Time Inc. \u201cWe\u2019re taking our brand to really exciting new places.\u201dA former television executive, Mr. Battista, 52, has been charged with revitalizing the most storied magazine publisher in the country. At the helm of the nearly century-old Time Inc. since September, he has quickly worked to transform the home of Time, People and Sports Illustrated into a multimedia, multipurpose company, with a strategy heavy on online video, television and entertainment \u2014 and noticeably lighter on magazine journalism. Among the ideas the company has floated: offering people paid services like a food-and-wine club and insurance for pets.Mr. Battista\u2019s zeal, however, may not be enough to save the Time empire, whose weekly publications helped propel the national conversation for decades but have struggled to maintain their relevance in the digital media environment.Time Inc.\u2019s revenue has fallen every year since 2011, and investors have punished its stock since the company was spun off from Time Warner nearly three years ago. Brutal cost cuts and relentless executive churn have roiled the company.Mr. Battista and Jen Wong, 42, Time Inc.\u2019s new chief operating officer, maintain that they are committed to advancing their plans for the company. During a recent interview at its new headquarters in downtown Manhattan, both insisted that Time was on solid footing despite its lackluster financial performance, and that it was done with any hand-wringing about what its strategy should be.\u201cThose things are behind us,\u201d said Ms. Wong, a former executive of the website PopSugar. \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on growth now.\u201dIn a note to employees several weeks ago, Mr. Battista introduced an \u201cinnovation challenge\u201d intended to \u201csurface ideas for new revenue-generating products and services to offer our consumers.\u201d The winning team will receive $10,000.\u201cThink of it,\u201d he said, \u201cas a Time Inc. \u2018Shark Tank.\u2019\u201dAlthough the print business still brings in roughly two-thirds of the company\u2019s $3 billion in annual revenue, focus has shifted toward other revenue opportunities, including short online videos and events. The magazines share resources, and editors work with the business side, an idea that for much of the company\u2019s history would have been anathema.More symbolically, Time Inc. recently moved from the iconic Time & Life building in Midtown to a nondescript skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.Like other print publishers that have experienced drastic declines in advertising and circulation, Time Inc. has slashed costs, closed bureaus and let talented but expensive journalists go. In the last year, it has replaced longtime editors at Real Simple and InStyle and laid off about 100 people across the company.While the occasional story in People still generates buzz and Time\u2019s covers sometimes draw attention (one from October featuring an illustration of President Trump won the American Society of Magazine Editors\u2019 Cover of the Year award), Time Inc.\u2019s magazines no longer set the agenda or break memorable stories the way they once did.But analysts and former employees also describe distinct challenges and missed opportunities that made it hard for the company to adapt to a shifting media landscape. Management disagreements and cost cuts in the 2000s led to high-profile departures that bled the company of talent and left it without a clear succession plan. Until the spinoff, Time Warner and its chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, took Time Inc.\u2019s earnings and invested them in higher-growth businesses like HBO, leaving Time Inc. itself with little money for reinvestment.\u201cHe saw that he had a stable full of horses, but he also saw that he had a garage full of cars,\u201d Josh Quittner, a former editor and digital editorial director at Time Inc., said about Mr. Bewkes. \u201cSo he was going to invest in the garage full of cars.\u201dA Time Warner spokesman said, \u201cTime Warner has always fully invested in all of our operations, including Time Inc. when we owned it.\u201dSitting on opposite sides of a table in a conference room near Time Inc.\u2019s boardroom \u2014 where a painting of Luce hangs \u2014 Mr. Battista and Ms. Wong lauded new services and products, including a platform for youth sports, called Sports Illustrated Play, and a streaming video channel from People and Entertainment Weekly.\u201cIt\u2019s very organic for us to write an article about a new show that\u2019s launching that we happen to be involved in,\u201d Mr. Battista said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great example of using our print assets to build new revenue streams.\u201dTime Inc. is also focusing more on advertising. The company recently purchased several ad technology and data companies, including Viant, the owner of Myspace. And it now has its own advertising studio in Brooklyn called the Foundry.Mr. Battista and Ms. Wong insisted that Time Inc.\u2019s magazines were still important to the company. And in early February, Mr. Battista and Alan Murray, Time Inc.\u2019s chief content officer, sent a note to employees praising recent developments at the company, including a bump in Time magazine\u2019s online audience.\u201cThese achievements are a testament to one of our key points of difference \u2014 Time Inc.\u2019s trusted, quality journalism,\u201d they wrote.But Mr. Battista and Ms. Wong also said the company was looking to leverage the company\u2019s well-known titles into other revenue opportunities.\u201cThe foundation of the company is, has been and will remain the power of these brands,\u201d Mr. Battista said. \u201cIt\u2019s about extending these brands and taking these brands far beyond, obviously, the printed word, which was the legacy of this company.\u201dTo some in the industry, Time Inc. seems to be on the right track even if its financial results suggest otherwise. And within the company, some have described a new sense of collaboration. Employees congregate in common areas, where there are bowls of fruit and free snacks. The company\u2019s new headquarters feature bright video studios and test kitchens, instead of the bar carts and palatial executive offices of yore. (Laura Brown, the new editor in chief of InStyle, coyly described the space as \u201chigh concept.\u201d)\u201cI think they\u2019re absolutely doing the right thing,\u201d said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital. But, he added, \u201cIt remains to be seen how they actually can monetize what they\u2019re doing.\u201dStill, the de-emphasis on traditional journalism has not gone unnoticed. One editorial employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering his employer, noted that whether the strategy worked or not, it was not going to lead to the kind of work that the company had historically prized.Time Inc. is now targeting $100 million in cost cuts this year, though it will not specify what parts of the company will be affected. The company expects revenue for this year to be roughly flat.Still, Mr. Battista and Ms. Wong are optimistic about Time Inc.\u2019s future. They project that digital advertising revenue will reach $600 million this year and $1 billion in the coming years, and are confident that the company will return to growth.And while some see value in Time Inc.\u2019s short-form videos, others involved in the magazine industry say the company\u2019s appeal may not be in all of its new bells and whistles. In the end, it may be in those venerable magazines that made it so prominent in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Those Who Have It All, Charitable Wedding Registries", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersChristopher and Deirdre Culver met four years ago in Newport, R.I., aboard his yacht, through mutual friends. Their courtship was rooted in their love of the sea and of sailing. One sign that they made a good couple was the experience they had sailing together on his yacht in a race.\u201cHe\u2019s very calm,\u201d Ms. Culver said. \u201cHe thinks of it as a team effort. We win as a team, we lose as a team.\u201dBoth in their 50s and successful in their own careers, the Culvers felt they needed nothing in the way of gifts when they married two years ago at the American Yacht Club in Rye, N.Y. He is the chief executive of the Health Media Network, a technology company. She is a vice president at Brookside Mezzanine Partners, which provides financing to small and medium-size companies.The Culvers\u2019 wedding ended up raising enough money to help the group build an endowment, with some money left over for general operating expenses.\u201cIt made a major, significant difference,\u201d said Paul Callahan, chief executive of Sail to Prevail. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a million-dollar budget and it helped seed that comfortably.\u201dTechnology has made it easier for couples, from millennials to older adults, to replace wedding gifts with charitable donations. Given the vast amount of money spent on weddings in the United States each year, this shift could move the charitable needle in a major way.Wedding planners and philanthropic advisers say the interest in including a charity on a wedding registry has paralleled the growth of internet registries. In essence, when guests can click online boxes for wine glasses, vases, china sets, silverware and silver picture frames, it is just as simple to add a link to a charity of the couple\u2019s choice.\u201cIt\u2019s easy for people who don\u2019t have the dream of a registry for gifts in the traditional way,\u201d said Anthony Taccetta, a wedding and event planner in New York.He said he recently worked with one couple who wanted donations to go to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center in New York and raised over $10,000. Another couple, who had their dog in their wedding, were able to raise more than $15,000 for the Humane Society of New York.Lindsay McKay, 37, and James Nero, 38, who are to be married in September in Santa Barbara, Calif., are making the rescue dog that brought them together a focus of their wedding. While they are registered at traditional places like Williams-Sonoma, they are also asking people to make donations to a no-kill animal shelter in Los Angeles.Ms. McKay credits the dog she adopted from the shelter with leading her to slow down in her life \u2014 she\u2019s a Hollywood costume designer \u2014 and making herself more open to a relationship.\u201cWhat is important to couples is they want to be able to thank people for those donations,\u201d said Ms. Helmstetter, who charges 10 percent of the donation for the service.Since it started last year, some 800 couples have used the platform to set up charitable gift registries, including 10 of her client couples, she said. She hopes to reach $500,000 in donations by next year.Of course, for many couples, wedding presents give them their start in life. Those sheets, plates and glasses are practical help in setting up their lives together as much as they are nice gifts.But more affluent couples who can afford to buy what they want or older couples who have already accumulated what they need often face the opposite problem: having two of everything. They may even be preparing to downsize.While it might be easy to dismiss these charitable options as just one more request of guests who may already be spending a lot of money traveling to a wedding, the registries have the potential to be effective and to have a positive impact.\u201cI think there\u2019s a growing awareness among millennials that what you do with your whole life should reflect your values,\u201d said Melissa A. Berman, chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. \u201cMillennials have really pushed this into the forefront.\u201dFor the charities themselves, being given prominent billing on a couple\u2019s wedding day, when their closest friends and family are there, can bring new donors to the cause.\u201cFrom where I sit, it\u2019s awfully thoughtful and generous,\u201d Mr. Callahan of Sail to Prevail said. \u201cWhen you do something so special as this at one of the two to three most important days of your life, it sends a message to the people who are close to you.\u201dMs. Culver said what made her happiest were the guests who were not sailors and did not know about Sail to Prevail ahead of time. \u201cWe got some great bites,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if someone gave $10 or $100.\u201dPutting a charity on a wedding registry is not without some risk. With some causes, there is the potential to alienate guests. Ms. Berman said making Planned Parenthood the recipient of wedding largess, for example, could risk alienating guests who are opposed to the organization\u2019s mission.\u201cGuests might feel like they\u2019re being told their values are wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people I know who are doing this always offer this as an option. Or they stick to charities everyone is O.K. with or say, \u2018some other organization of your choice.\u2019\u201dIf couples still want or need gifts, Mr. Taccetta said, they can incorporate a donation into the party favors. He said he had clients who totaled up what they would spend on party favors \u2014 generally $5 to $100 per person \u2014 and made a donation in that amount to their favorite charities.\u201cThey just leave a note saying a donation has been made in your name to an organization in lieu of a gift,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another way to bring a donation into a wedding.\u201dAnd it also saves guests from having to cart home a jar full of seashells or other cute but useless mementos.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fax-Wielding Witness Tries to Link Japan\u2019s Prime Minister to Scandal", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 He said he had in his hand a fax.It was not quite Joseph McCarthy and his list, but in the most dramatic moment during several hours of testimony on Thursday in Tokyo, the leader of an ultraconservative education group that has become entangled in a scandal with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe produced a two-page fax that he said showed that aides to Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie, had talked to government officials on the group\u2019s behalf.Japanese media breathlessly covered the testimony of Yasunori Kagoike, the administrator of Moritomo, waiting for a smoking gun that would link either Mr. or Mrs. Abe to a suspicious deal in which the school group bought public land at a steep discount to build a new school.If such links prove true, they could inflict political damage on Mr. Abe, who could soon become the longest serving prime minister since the end of World War II.Last month, he vowed in Parliament that he would resign as prime minister if he or his wife were found to have been involved in any wrongdoing related to the school, and Mrs. Abe stepped down as honorary principal of the new school last month as the furor over the scandal escalated.In his testimony, Mr. Kagoike noted that not long after this communication, the government agreed to sell the land to Moritomo Gakuen at a drastic discount below the assessed value of the property.\u201cI am not party to the details of this negotiation,\u201d said Mr. Kagoike, who said a lawyer for a construction company had negotiated a deal on the group\u2019s behalf. \u201cSo I would ask that you please ask for clarification from the Ministry of Finance.\u201dMr. Kagoike said he was \u201cangry\u201d that Mr. and Mrs. Abe had pulled their support from the school. At one point, Mr. Kagoike wanted to name the school after Mr. Abe, but he said Mrs. Abe asked him not to. He also reiterated a claim \u2014 this time under oath \u2014 that he made last week, in which he said Mrs. Abe gave him an envelope of cash as a donation from the prime minister two years ago.Mr. Abe has emphatically denied it, and after the testimony on Thursday, Yoshihide Suga, Mr. Abe\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, said that Mr. Kagoike\u2019s claim was \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201dRenho Murata, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called for Mrs. Abe to testify before Parliament. On her Facebook page, Mrs. Abe wrote on Thursday that she did not give any donation to Mr. Kagoike, and that she was not involved with the fax written by her aide.\u201cI remember that my secretary told me that she would reply to the inquiries he sent to her in a written document,\u201d Mrs. Abe wrote. \u201cI remember that was a reply declining his request.\u201dConnecting the dots any further may be difficult. In response to a reporter\u2019s question at a 100-minute news conference late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Kagoike said he did not believe Mr. Abe had \u201cdirect influence\u201d on the discounted land deal.He hinted at \u201cpowers at work behind the scenes\u201d and said that unidentified officials in the Ministry of Finance had helped facilitate the deal. \u201cI believe that perhaps Prime Minister Abe or his wife were reading between the lines,\u201d Mr. Kagoike said. \u201cThere was some sort of a mutual understanding between us.\u201dMr. Kagoike\u2019s extreme right-wing views have become contentious as more details of his group\u2019s existing kindergarten have emerged. It teaches elements of a patriotic prewar school curriculum and Mr. Kagoike has been accused of making derogatory statements about Chinese and Koreans.Asked about such statements during the news conference, Mr. Kagoike said he wanted the children to understand Japan\u2019s position in territorial disputes with both China and South Korea.In the case of China, he said he wanted students to learn that when Chinese boats entered waters around a string of islands in the East China Sea administered by Japan and known here as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu, it was analogous to \u201crobbers entering somebody\u2019s home.\u201dAnalysts said that the Japanese public is skeptical of Mr. Kagoike and that therefore the scandal was unlikely to have more legs. \u201cI don\u2019t think the majority of the public believes what he said completely,\u201d said Koji Murata, a professor of international relations at Doshisha University in Kyoto.\u201cGiven the international situation surrounding Japan such as the North Korean provocations and the U.S.-Japan relationship,\u201d he said, \u201cI would guess the general public is getting more and more tired of this issue without clear evidence of a crime or scandal.\u201dMakiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shadow Lending Threatens China\u2019s Economy, Officials Warn", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The chairman of China\u2019s biggest bank and a senior Chinese insurance regulator issued strong warnings on Saturday about the dangers of shadow banking to the Chinese economy, in the latest signs of growing top-level concern here about a rise in highly speculative, poorly regulated lending.Shadow banking, or lending that takes place outside official banking channels, plays a major role in the Chinese economy, where big government-controlled banks are often slow to lend to private businesses and entrepreneurs. But experts worry that untrammeled shadow lending could lead to ticking time bombs that could threaten the financial system of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Shadow banking \u201cis not subject to full regulation, or any regulation at all,\u201d Mr. Yi said. \u201cWe have to focus. If not, the real economy will suffer.\u201dChen Wenhui, the vice chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, said Chinese regulators were particularly trying to understand the swift expansion of internet lending platforms that are raising huge sums of money from the general public. Many of these lending platforms, which offer big returns and accept minimum contributions low enough to entice common workers, have disclosed fairly little about how they will invest the money they raise.The general public appears to be pouring large sums into new investment vehicles despite receiving scant disclosure, Mr. Chen said.\u201cThey just buy the investments,\u201d he added, \u201cThey have no idea what the product is.\u201dMr. Yi and Mr. Chen spoke at a panel on Chinese finance at the China Development Forum, an annual, three-day gathering that started here on Saturday and has mustered a long list of the world\u2019s most famous economists in addition to many top Chinese government and business leaders.Part of that borrowing went to pay for heavy investments in new infrastructure, like high-speed rail lines, and new factories for state-owned enterprises.But much of the lending appears to represent a speculative frenzy, often involving residential real estate, that has become of increasing concern to some Chinese officials, bankers and economists. Real estate prices in large and medium-size cities climbed 12 percent in the 12 months that ended in February, the National Bureau of Statistics said this week.Some kinds of shadow banking have seen spectacular growth, like entrusted loans. Entrusted loans are loans from one company to another, usually done through a bank to get around a ban on Chinese companies lending directly to each other. These loans \u2014 which are also kept off the books of banks \u2014 jumped 20 percent in the 12 months through the end of January, and now account for 9 percent of overall credit in China, according to a report last month from Natixis, a French-owned financial services firm.China\u2019s leaders insist that they understand the risks and contend that they will be able to control them. They say measures such as government and household debt as a percentage of economic output are not alarming by international standards, nor have bad loans as a percentage of overall bank loans reached a worrying level.\u201cWe are fully aware of potential risks and will take prompt and targeted action,\u201d Premier Li Keqiang said at his annual news conference on Wednesday.But as Mr. Yi\u2019s and Mr. Chen\u2019s comments underlined on Saturday, worries in China are focusing on how Chinese financial institutions raise the money that they lend \u2014 and what could happen if investors suddenly demand much of that money back.Mr. Yi\u2019s remarks to some extent represented an unusually blunt criticism of his bank\u2019s smaller competitors. I.C.B.C. is one of the so-called Big Four state-controlled banks that make up nearly half the country\u2019s banking system. Each of the four \u2014 the others are the China Construction Bank, the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China \u2014 has thousands of branches to collect deposits, a stable source of financing, although the banks also sell some wealth management products.Lacking that big deposit base, many smaller banks rely more heavily on the sale of wealth management products. Because banks usually keep those obligations off their books, they have greater flexibility to lend to more speculative projects and use the proceeds to pay higher interest to investors \u2014 provided that the more speculative borrowers repay their loans.Mr. Yi took aim at all risky forms of borrowing on Saturday. \u201cIf we do not deal correctly with shadow banking, the risks could be huge,\u201d he said, adding that the result had been \u201chigher leverage, too many derivatives and too many products with no transparency.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Run for Local Office", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byTip\u201cNever miss the ham breakfast or the chili supper,\u201d says Nicole Galloway, the state auditor of Missouri, a position she was appointed to after serving as treasurer of Boone County. Months before you file your candidacy with the local elections office, get out and meet as many voters, elected officials and party representatives as you can. Tell them about your vision, but don\u2019t just talk at them. \u201cSpend a lot of time listening,\u201d Galloway says.Ninety percent of the 500,000 or so elected offices in the United States are held by white people, and men occupy 71 percent of those seats. If you don\u2019t see someone who looks like you on your school board or City Council, it does not mean that you don\u2019t belong there or that you cannot win. Be bold, says Galloway, who at 34 is the youngest woman ever to serve in statewide office in Missouri. \u201cInstead of asking yourself, \u2018Can I do this?\u2019 ask, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u2009\u201dWhen deciding what seat to run for, be guided by your passion and skill set, but be calculating too. It is usually easier, and cheaper, to win an open seat than to challenge an incumbent. Even in a small town, running for office costs money. Find out through your secretary of state\u2019s website or from your county clerk how much the last person elected spent. Figure out how much things like yard signs and stickers cost, and put together a budget. Ask for money. Even a $5 donation is an investment in you and your ideas. Before raising a dime, look up your state\u2019s campaign-finance laws and follow them carefully.You will need to speak in public and should do so at every opportunity. Still, extroversion is not a requirement. \u201cShy people can run for office, too,\u201d Galloway says. Rehearse a speech until you can stand up and say something articulate, maybe even inspiring, at a moment\u2019s notice. Research your opponents, but dwell more on your own message. Don\u2019t be intimidated by journalists; think of them as conduits to your constituency. You might be considering elected office because you are angry with those in power. Indignation can be a motivator to run but not to govern. \u201cIf you win,\u201d Galloway says, \u201cyou\u2019ll need more than anger to keep you going.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Manhattan\u2019s Other Bus Terminal, Running Years Late", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byHidden behind a maze of wooden blockades and yellow tape, a neglected transportation hub in northern Manhattan is gearing up for a reopening \u2014 or so people have been led to believe.It also offers an anticipated completion date: \u201cWinter 2015.\u201dMany New Yorkers would be surprised to learn that another bus station even exists in Manhattan. But the terminal in Washington Heights is a critical link between Manhattan and northern New Jersey, even though its size pales in comparison to the Port Authority bus terminal, its big brother on the edge of Times Square.Both are operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey: About five million people use the George Washington Bridge station every year, while the Port Authority terminal sees 66 million travelers annually.A plan to renovate the half-century-old George Washington Bridge terminal was first approved by the Port Authority in 2008. The project\u2019s cost, estimated at $183.2 million, was divided between the Port Authority and a private development group, which hired Tutor Perini Building Corp. as a general contractor.While buses still pick up passengers on the top floor of the station, its main concourse remains closed. And that has become a sore point in Washington Heights.Howard Bloom, a dentist, began working in the terminal in 1984. He said he has borne witness to its ups and downs: when homeless people loitered in the station during the 1980s, when business picked up in the 1990s, and when security was tightened after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.He moved out of the terminal shortly after he learned, in 2008, that it would be shuttered for renovations. At the time, he said, the Port Authority extended an invitation for him to set up shop once construction was finished.\u201cBut it was at four times the rent, like they pay in Midtown Manhattan,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018We\u2019ll pass on that.\u2019\u201d (None of the businesses in the old concourse will reopen in the renovated space.)It\u2019s a decision Mr. Bloom doesn\u2019t regret.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said Jonathan Jacobo, 31. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete disaster.\u201dMr. Jacobo and his family run a small jewelry business, and he plans to open a location in the renovated terminal. He and other small businesses were lured by promises of high foot traffic when they signed leases in 2014.But Mr. Jacobo, whose family has three stores in Manhattan, said he has grown tired of waiting. \u201cWe don\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel yet,\u201d he said.Today, sidewalks on either side of the station are closed to pedestrians. A gray trailer, housing a single row of metal chairs, serves as a makeshift waiting room for the buses.It\u2019s not pretty. But for Maciel Perez, 34, who commutes from New Jersey to her job at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Washington Heights, it works. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit inconvenient, but then again, I\u2019m used to it already,\u201d she said.State Senator Marisol Alcantara, a Democrat whose district includes the terminal, said developers take that kind of patience for granted.\u201cIt\u2019s a lack of respect for people of color, for immigrants,\u201d she said of the delays. \u201cI\u2019m sure if this were somewhere else, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dJavier Gomez, a spokesman for the development venture, said construction was complicated by having to renovate a terminal \u201cover one of the busiest highways in the nation, connecting one of the world\u2019s largest bridges and highway networks, in an extremely busy and populated area \u2014 while still remaining fully operational\u201d as a bus station.Behind the ongoing construction, the building itself remains striking. Designed by Pier Luigi Nervi, an Italian engineer, it was hailed as an avant-garde piece of modernist architecture when it opened in 1963. The gray outer walls are crowned by panels of robin\u2019s egg blue \u2014 only slightly marred by creeping grime \u2014 and a butterfly roof that mirrors the soaring aesthetic of the adjacent George Washington Bridge.Today, it is hard to find people who would speak so kindly of the terminal. \u201cIt\u2019s become such an eyesore,\u201d said Shahabuddeen Ally, a lawyer who is the chairman of the neighborhood\u2019s community board.But the biggest problem, he said, has been a lack of communication about the project, leaving the neighborhood guessing about when construction might finally end.\u201cFrom a community point of view, the project has taken on a persona of having been cloaked in mystery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scaffolding, behind the walls.\u201dWhile larger stores are under construction at the terminal, building has not even begun in the spaces for small businesses.Victor Sidberry, 32, who owns a frozen yogurt shop in Manhattan called VS Berry, said he signed a lease for a shop in the terminal three years ago and invested in new machines. All he has to show so far are bills for storing the equipment.\u201cIt\u2019s also been hard to get financing, because they changed the dates as to when they\u2019re going to open so many times that no one really wants to finance you,\u201d he said.Luis Perez, 42, who is planning to sell juice and pastries in the terminal, said he and the other small-business owners were left hanging because they couldn\u2019t afford the construction contractors referred to them by the station\u2019s private developers.\u201cWe are all lost in a daze,\u201d he said. \u201cSo close to opening a location that\u2019s going to be successful, and so close to losing it all.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misattributed a prediction about when the main concourse of the George Washington Bridge Bus Station would reopen. It was the Port Authority\u2019s development partners who said the main concourse should reopen in April, not Port Authority.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Warily Circling, Trump and Angela Merkel Prepare to Meet", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump welcomes Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to the Oval Office on Tuesday, their meeting will take on a symbolism unlike any he has held so far: The great disrupter confronts the last defender of the liberal world order.Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel are poles apart on issues like immigration and trade; they have circled each other warily since the American presidential election. But both sides, officials said, are determined not to let this first meeting devolve into a clash of competing worldviews.Ms. Merkel has been studying Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches to get an insight into the new president\u2019s thinking. American officials said Mr. Trump would ask the chancellor for advice on how to deal with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom, after dozens of meetings over her 11 years in power, she knows better than any other leader in the West.The threat posed by Russia to Europe could give Ms. Merkel and Mr. Trump a sliver of common ground. The Trump administration is demanding that Germany and its other NATO allies increase their military budgets, a message the Germans appear to be taking to heart, even if their spending still falls well short of what the United States would like.\u201cYou might almost call it serendipity,\u201d said Josef Joffe, the publisher and editor of the German newspaper Die Zeit. \u201cJust as Trump is pushing the Europeans to shape up and pay up, the Germans have quite independently realized they are facing a strategic threat on their eastern border.\u201dBut if Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel find common cause on NATO, they risk new tensions over trade. Administration officials have railed against Germany\u2019s huge trade surplus with the United States. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic advisers, Peter Navarro, recently accused Germany of exploiting its trading partners by depressing the euro to boost its exports.Ms. Merkel plans to push back hard on what the Germans view as blatant protectionism. She is bringing a delegation of corporate chiefs from BMW, Siemens and other German companies with major American operations. They will talk about apprenticeship programs to train American workers.Few leaders have displayed Ms. Merkel\u2019s adroitness in handling swaggering, strongman leaders, whether it is Mr. Putin or Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. But in Mr. Trump, \u201cshe\u2019s up against a different kind of testosterone-driven guy,\u201d Mr. Joffe said. \u201cHere is a guy who talked in the campaign as if he was going to put the ax to the liberal international world order.\u201dIn an interview with a British newspaper in January, Mr. Trump said Ms. Merkel had made a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d mistake in letting tens of thousands of refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East enter Germany. \u201cI respect her and I like her, but I think it was a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople make mistakes, but I think it was a really big mistake.\u201dHe declined to say whether he would support Ms. Merkel in running for a fourth term as chancellor \u2014 a position repeated by a senior administration official who briefed reporters about her visit on Friday. It was a stark contrast to Ms. Merkel\u2019s relationship with President Barack Obama, one of his closest with any foreign leader.Ms. Merkel, however, also managed to have a productive relationship with President George W. Bush, even though he, like Mr. Trump, was deeply unpopular in Germany in the aftermath of the Iraq war. Some experts said that could be a blueprint for how she approached Mr. Trump.Ms. Merkel has studiously avoided a confrontation with Mr. Trump. She said she would judge him by his actions rather than his words. And she has dismissed as absurd the suggestion that she was the last bastion of a liberal world order \u2014 a label that would put her at odds with Mr. Trump.When Mr. Trump first announced his temporary travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries in January, Ms. Merkel patiently explained to him over the phone that the Geneva Conventions oblige countries to protect refugees of war on humanitarian grounds.In their briefing on Friday, White House officials said they expected a \u201crobust\u201d exchange between Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel on issues ranging from the European Union and the financing of NATO to trade and the campaign against the Islamic State. There has been an unusual degree of preparation for this meeting, given that it is not expected to produce any significant announcements on economic or security issues.For the Germans, however, the Trump White House remains something of a riddle. Hard-line ideological players, like Mr. Navarro and the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, vie with more conventional, realist ones, like Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser.Mr. Navarro, for example, complains that Germany uses unequal treatment of a tax rebate on its exports to disadvantage American exports. Mr. Bannon told a visiting German diplomat that the White House viewed the European Union as a \u201cflawed construct\u201d and preferred to negotiate with Germany and other European countries one on one.The problem is that Germany, as a member of the European Union, cannot legally negotiate its own trade agreements with the United States. On Friday, another senior administration official who did not want to be identified conceded that point, saying that any new trade deal with Germany would have to be negotiated with the European Union. But that official also said Mr. Trump would raise Germany\u2019s persistent trade surplus with Ms. Merkel.The chancellor is likely to make a fervent case for the European Union, not just as an economic bloc but also as a political project that has brought peace and prosperity to Europe. White House officials said Friday that Mr. Trump would not be shy about his views of Brussels, but that the United States wanted to keep a strong partnership with it.Perhaps the most delicate topic for the two leaders will be Russia. Questions about link between Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia continue to hang over him, while Ms. Merkel is preparing to run for re-election in a Germany that is fearful that the Russian government will meddle in its campaign like it did in the United States.German officials are encouraged that Mr. Trump has so far not radically tilted American policy toward Moscow. But they point nervously to Breitbart, the far-right website until recently run by Mr. Bannon, which is setting up an outpost in Germany and could seek to influence the vote. Russia, they note, can cause plenty of mischief, even without help from the United States.\u201cI think they\u2019ll skirt around the Russia issue,\u201d Mr. Janes of Johns Hopkins said. \u201cThey\u2019ll stay at 30,000 feet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, George Osborne, the former chancellor of the Exchequer, is set to be prominent in both spheres at once.Mr. Osborne, who was long mentioned as a potential successor to David Cameron as prime minister and who is thought to still have ambitions to lead Britain one day, was announced on Friday as the new editor of The Evening Standard, a London weekday newspaper that is among the country\u2019s most read.\u201cWe will judge what the government, London\u2019s politicians and the political parties do against this simple test: Is it good for our readers and good for London?\u201d he said.Mr. Osborne, a member of the governing Conservative Party, was replaced as chancellor after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in June. He had been a prominent supporter of the campaign to remain in the bloc and was not asked to join the new cabinet when Theresa May replaced Mr. Cameron as prime minister.His decision to remain in Parliament while editing The Evening Standard raises questions about how he will maintain the independence of the paper while representing his constituents.Others questioned how Mr. Osborne would manage his time.The former finance minister has dismissed those concerns, however, arguing that because The Evening Standard is edited in the morning and Parliament votes in the afternoon, there was no problem.The link between politics and journalism is a strong one in Britain.Evgeny Lebedev, who owns The Evening Standard, described Mr. Osborne as a person of \u201chuge political achievement, and economic and cultural authority.\u201dHe added that the politician\u2019s viewpoint \u2014 \u201cliberal on social issues and pragmatic on economic ones\u201d \u2014 closely matched that of The Evening Standard\u2019s readers.\u201cOnce he put himself forward for the position, he was the obvious choice,\u201d Mr. Lebedev added.Started in 1827 as a competitor to The Times of London, The Standard, as it was then known, started publishing an evening edition in 1859.Mr. Osborne will take up the post in May, replacing Sarah Sands, who will join BBC Radio 4 as the editor of its flagship morning news program, \u201cToday.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The hush of work not being done settles across the capital city, a silence of memos untyped, papers unpushed, file cabinets sealed shut. The machine of state is not in use. This is not Washington today; it is Petrograd, Russia, 100 years earlier, where after the Bolsheviks seized power in late October, the bureaucrats of the Russian state \u2014 tens of thousands of them \u2014 locked their desks and pocketed the keys on their way out the door. They declared themselves on strike, protesting what they viewed as the Bolsheviks\u2019 shocking and illegitimate violation of the public trust.Some held out a month, some lasted two, with the longest \u2014 the bankers in the former Ministry of Finance \u2014 standing firm until mid-March. In these five months, ordinary accountants, lawyers and administrators demonstrated great civic courage at significant personal cost. They either lived with the threat of arrest or were arrested, then handed over to the capricious Extraordinary Commission for the Battle to Combat Sabotage and Counterrevolution \u2014 known as the Cheka, forerunner to the K.G.B. \u2014 which shot people in basements and which was created in December 1917 with the express purpose of suppressing the \u201csabotage of government employees,\u201d as the new regime called the strike.Compared to the events the revolutionaries wanted to commemorate, the strike is mostly forgotten. This is in part because it ultimately had little effect, or rather, it had an effect profoundly contrary to what its participants intended. Truth be told, their intentions hardly mattered. But the decisions they faced and the choices they made are worth remembering today, as we approach the centenary of the October Revolution amid reports of a \u201cdeep state\u201d protest in the United States.The Russian bureaucrats\u2019 strike stood in contrast to their reaction to the revolution of February 1917, when the czar fell and Russia became a republic, which they greeted with enthusiasm and relief. The February Revolution held open a chance to live out the early 20th-century bureaucrat\u2019s dream: to serve as rational administrators of science, the market and the rule of law, rather than enactors of an incompetent monarch\u2019s will. Modern expertise would finally be allowed to triumph over autocratic politics. Some housecleaning would be required: Senior officials in the old regime were jailed and investigations into their crimes against the Russian people were opened. But with the exception of a handful of institutions, most notably the secret police, whose offices were torched, the Russian state continued to function as usual \u2014 which is to say, not very well.Then, in the early morning hours of Oct. 25, 1917, the Bolsheviks stormed Petrograd\u2019s Central Telegraph Station, improbably initiating 70 years of single-party rule devoted to building a communist society. The Bolsheviks\u2019 long-term goal, of course, was to superintend the withering away of the state. In the short term, they sought to put this state to work for them, confident, as one early employee put it, that \u201cthe tasks standing before them in administering the country were exceedingly simple and would not bring any difficulties.\u201dThe Bolsheviks trumpeted that under socialism, even the simplest cook could operate the state machine. This proved almost immediately untrue, not least because starting on Oct. 26, large portions of that state, outraged by the Bolshevik disregard for concepts of law and democracy, by the peace they promised the Germans, and the violence they embraced at home, walked off the job.We do not know precisely how many people went on strike. The Bolsheviks prevailed \u2014 and they never bothered to count. The Russian imperial state employed around 70,000 people in Petrograd on the eve of World War I, and archival records suggest that the great bulk of offices participated in the strike in some way.The strike was organized by unions of administrative professionals, paid out of strike funds until the money ran out. In some bureaus, employees showed up to the office but performed no work. Most employees, from diplomats to schoolteachers, simply stayed home, gathering periodically in one another\u2019s apartments to strategize. Before leaving their offices, many took important objects and documents with them, like keys to safes and bank account numbers, files and decoding ciphers. What could the Bolsheviks hope to accomplish without access to those two essential currencies of power \u2014 the state\u2019s money and its papers?Quite a lot, it turned out.The Bolsheviks were numerically tiny stacked up against the bureaucracy. After seizing power, they sent delegations of five or six revolutionaries to take over ministries with thousands of employees. These delegations were generally backed by armed men, but initially, it was inconceivable \u2014 even to the Bolsheviks \u2014 that the seizure of power would involve real acts of seizure. Lenin made the capture of the State Bank a priority, sending a group of revolutionary sailors to take control of the building the night the revolution began. The bank\u2019s workers immediately went on strike, joined the following day by the 7,000 members of the union for private bank employees. The Bolsheviks threatened all of them with arrest if they failed to reopen by Oct. 31; they opened for precisely one hour.A week into the revolution, the new regime still had no money. Three senior bank officials were dragged in to Bolshevik headquarters and ordered to fill out the proper forms giving the Bolsheviks\u2019 new executive, the Sovnarkom, access to the state\u2019s money. They refused. For a brief moment, the fate of the revolution seemed to hinge on accurate completion of a withdrawal slip. The bankers stood firm even when several days later, fed up with his comrades\u2019 delicacy, Leon Trotsky \u2014 accompanied by armed brigade and, in true Bolshevik fashion, an orchestra \u2014 turned up at the State Bank building and threatened to storm it, before losing his nerve.The Bolsheviks were nothing if not skilled bank robbers \u2014 they actually funded party activities before the war by robbing banks in the Caucasus \u2014 which makes their initial unwillingness to take the money, their lingering, likely unwilling respect for the bourgeois rules of business, that much more striking.They got over it.In the weeks and months that followed, agents of the Cheka ransacked apartments and arrested officials. They eventually acquired the keys to all eight safes in the State Bank, held in two copies each by different officials. At the same time, they began issuing their own scrip to cover their expenses. The first groups of employees dripped back to work at the offices of the Credit Chancellery, the most powerful office of the former Ministry of Finance, after a month \u2014 mostly junior people joining the couriers and janitors who had never left. Unskilled workers had not been included in the strike, and these workers, though frequently illiterate and utterly unschooled in statecraft, provided the Bolshevik delegations with much-needed information about the offices where they worked, such as the home addresses of their bosses.It wasn\u2019t just fear that brought people back. The Bolsheviks outlawed private transactions and declared entire branches of industry to be the possession of an as-yet nonexistent socialist state. By the summer of 1918, \u201cit became evident that banking, private industry, private commerce were played out,\u201d one striking official wrote. \u201cThere was no field of action for me except in the service of the state.\u201dAnother employee characterized the general sense among his peers as being that \u201csabotage did nothing.\u201d Ambitious newcomers \u2014 people from the provinces, junior officials angling for a promotion \u2014 filled out the staffs, which began growing by leaps and bounds. Like a dry sponge, the new regime absorbed them all.Even after most of the strikers had returned to work, the Bolsheviks never declared the sabotage over. The sabotage was never over. Searching out malfeasance among state employees \u2014 which, thanks to the nationalization programs, was practically everybody \u2014 fueled the Cheka, a brand-new \u201cstate within the state,\u201d as one employee sagely called it, for the next 70 years.Rather than obstructing the Bolshevik takeover, the strike ended up facilitating it, spurring the Bolsheviks to build parallel organs of governance dedicated to revolutionary goals. A prominent Cheka official crowed in 1920 that the strike had made his job easier. Officials of a Moscow bank branch later wondered if, without a strike, the Bolsheviks would have aimed only to \u201cadapt the upper ranks of the state apparatus to the needs of Soviet power,\u201d rather than embarking on \u201cthe total destruction and reconstruction of the entire banking apparatus from the bottom to the top\u201d that ultimately occurred.Having denounced the bureaucracy and all its paper instruments as bourgeois tools intended to suppress the working class, the Bolsheviks were far less vulnerable to the chaos they unleashed than a different set of revolutionaries might have been. At least for a time, the destruction was empowering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Titan\u2019s Surefire Bet Turns Into a $4 Billion Loss", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byA little over two years ago, William A. Ackman, one of Wall Street\u2019s brashest and most self-assured hedge fund managers, was on top of the world. A billionaire before he hit 50, he was generating double-digit gains for his investors and raking in hundreds of millions in fees for his firm and himself.If Mr. Ackman were a stock, that might have been his peak.Today, things are very different for him. His company\u2019s performance is way down, he is in the midst of an expensive divorce, and on March 13, he and investors in funds run by Pershing Square Capital Management swallowed a $4 billion loss on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a beleaguered drug company.As bad bets go, it was one for the record books. Valeant was a big Pershing Square holding. In May 2015, Mr. Ackman said Valeant\u2019s acquisition strategy made it \u201ca very early-stage Berkshire,\u201d referring to Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s investment vehicle. But only a few months later, Mr. Ackman and his investors began riding Valeant\u2019s shares all the way from $262 to $11, driven both by rival investors who had bet against Valeant\u2019s shares and former fans who dumped the stock as bad news emerged.As much as Mr. Ackman and investors in his $11 billion firm would like to close the book on Valeant, they cannot do so quite yet. That\u2019s because of a Valeant-related lawsuit in a federal court in California contending that he and his firm violated securities laws in 2014. According to the plaintiffs, Pershing Square secretly acquired a stake in the pharmaceutical giant Allergan based on nonpublic information from Valeant that it intended to mount a takeover bid.This is not just any lawsuit. Damages in the case may be $2 billion, as noted by the judge who certified the litigation as a class action Wednesday. Mr. Ackman\u2019s lawyers, who in court hearings have put potential damages at less than $1 billion, are vigorously contesting the case and contend there is no liability.Defendants in the matter, which has not received a lot of publicity recently, are Mr. Ackman, his funds, Valeant and J. Michael Pearson, the company\u2019s former chief executive.The case is entering a crucial stage. Court documents indicate that Mr. Ackman and Mr. Pearson have either been deposed by lawyers for the plaintiffs or will be questioned under oath soon. The documents also show that Mr. Ackman must set aside 12 hours to answer questions.Mr. Pearson was the architect of Valeant\u2019s business model, in which the company acquired drugmakers and jacked up prices on their products. Mr. Ackman, 50, is one of the country\u2019s best-known activist investors \u2014 taking large positions in companies and trying to use that weight to influence their direction and decision-making. Initially, Mr. Ackman praised Mr. Pearson\u2019s strategy of acquiring rivals rather than developing drugs internally.Mr. Ackman declined to comment on the mistakes he made in Valeant or the lessons he gleaned from the loss.In a statement, Pershing Square noted that the firm \u201chas generated billions of dollars of profits for its investors and double the stock market returns since the inception of the firm inclusive of our large loss on Valeant.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d it continued, \u201cwe cannot guarantee that every one of our investments will be successful. We regret the loss which occurred due to Valeant board and management decisions made prior to our active engagement with the company. Over the past year, as members of the new board of directors, we have taken important steps to stabilize the company, including replacing prior management, which positions the company for a better and more profitable future.\u201dThe stock market is a humbling place, where even astute investors make many mistakes. Mr. Ackman is by no means the only money manager to have erred in assessing a company\u2019s prospects.But as loosely regulated hedge funds have grown both in number and in power recently, a cult of personality has arisen. Unlike mutual funds, which employ ranks of portfolio managers, hedge funds like Pershing Square are dominated by the people who run them. Investors in Mr. Ackman\u2019s firm are essentially placing a bet on him, his acumen and his discipline.Some investment managers \u2014 Mr. Ackman\u2019s peers and rivals \u2014 say that his Valeant wager raises questions about his investment style. His failure to limit his losses on the trade and his unusual public comments as a Valeant director, in which he cheered the company\u2019s management and strategies even as its business was collapsing, are viewed as troubling.D. Ellen Shuman is the veteran manager of Edgehill Endowment Partners, which oversees $650 million in nonprofit money. She evaluates money managers for her clients and said she had avoided investing in Pershing Square.Why? \u201cIt is all about Bill Ackman,\u201d she said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cIt is not about his investors or the companies in which he is investing.\u201dAs confident a money manager as ever walked Wall Street, Mr. Ackman has acknowledged that his investment in Valeant represented a breakdown in his firm\u2019s due diligence \u2014 the research it does about the companies it backs. That concession came last spring when he was called to testify before a Senate committee on Valeant\u2019s drug pricing practices.In an email to The New York Times, Pershing Square said, \u201cValeant is an anomaly in an outstanding record over nearly 14 years.\u201dBut while his funds notched an exceptional 40 percent gain in 2014 \u2014 much of it attributable to the Allergan trade that has drawn the lawsuit \u2014 Mr. Ackman\u2019s funds lost 13.5 percent last year and 20.5 percent in 2015. Through March 15, Pershing Square is flat.Other hedge funds have turned in poor performances as well in recent years. And it is not clear whether or to what extent Mr. Ackman\u2019s investors have reacted to his firm\u2019s losses by fleeing. Pershing Square declined to disclose redemption figures.As is typical with hedge funds, Pershing Square has rules governing client redemptions. In many cases, clients can withdraw only 12.5 percent every quarter over two years; this prevents a run on the operation amid a mass of redemptions. And several years ago, Mr. Ackman astutely raised permanent capital with a stock offering in Europe, another cushion against a run on the firm.One reason so many on Wall Street have been riveted by Mr. Ackman\u2019s wrong-way Valeant bet is that it seems to confirm an age-old investing truth: Karma has everyone\u2019s address.For example, Mr. Ackman\u2019s $4 billion loss in Valeant more than wiped out the $2.2 billion he made in 2014 on Allergan.Mr. Ackman had never invested in the pharmaceutical industry when he put over $3 billion into Allergan. Pershing had avoided such companies, Mr. Ackman told investors in April 2014, because they don\u2019t generate predictable cash flows. Pershing preferred companies like Burger King and Kraft, whose strong brands protected them from competitors.After generating a quick $2.2 billion profit in Allergan, Mr. Ackman continued his new interest in pharma. In March 2015, Pershing began putting about $4 billion into Valeant.Initially, Mr. Ackman swooned over the company. At an investing conference in May 2015, he said, \u201cWe spent a year working with Valeant trying to take over Allergan, and one of the frustrations we had, as we got to see Valeant trading at $110 a share, was that we couldn\u2019t buy the stock.\u201dHe added: \u201cBut the moment we could, we bought it. You could say we\u2019re late to the party.\u201dMr. Ackman was more correct than he knew about coming late to his big Valeant purchase. His average cost was $190 per share.At first, the investment scored. On July 23, 2015, Valeant reported blowout financial results; by early August, the stock had topped $262 a share.Although few suspected it, that was the zenith for Valeant. By September the stock had fallen to around $160.On Oct. 30, Mr. Ackman battled back with a four-hour conference call defending Valeant. The company was sound, he said, and although its stock would recover slowly, he expected it to hit $400 within three years.Investors weren\u2019t convinced; the stock closed down 16 percent that day.\u201cWe held the call to respond to a large number of investor questions we received,\u201d Pershing Square said in an email last week to The Times. \u201cWe presented our point of view and analysis based on the facts that we had at the time. We continued to hold the stock at that time because we believed there continued to be substantial upside on our investment.\u201dFrom then on, Valeant was essentially in free fall. In late December 2015, Mr. Pearson took a medical leave. In March 2016, Mr. Ackman joined Valeant\u2019s board and the company announced it would replace Mr. Pearson. Hauled before congressional hearings about escalating drug prices in April, Mr. Ackman apologized for Valeant\u2019s mistakes, vowing to use his position on the board to change the company.As Valeant\u2019s business flagged, investors began focusing on its $30 billion debt, taken on to acquire companies. Clearly the company was going to have to sell assets to pay it down, but as analysts noted, Valeant had typically overpaid for acquisitions; selling those units might not generate gains.By this time, the stock had drifted down into the $20s. The company\u2019s business was faltering, and it was under investigation by regulators and the Justice Department, inquiries that had come about before Mr. Ackman joined the board and are continuing. For 2016, Valeant reported a $2.4 billion loss.Last Monday, Mr. Ackman had had enough. Pershing dumped its Valeant stake at roughly $11 a share.As this calamity played out, Mr. Ackman was also fighting the Allergan lawsuit in California. The plaintiffs were investors who had missed out on gains in Allergan stock in 2014 because they had sold shares without knowing about Valeant\u2019s impending bid, while Pershing Square, which did know about it, was buying Allergan shares. They contended that Valeant and Pershing Square violated securities laws, which prohibit fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative actions in connection with a tender offer.It would have been very costly for Valeant to finance a takeover of Allergan; instead it struck an agreement on Feb. 25, 2014, allowing Pershing Square to take a nearly 10 percent stake in Allergan to support Valeant\u2019s takeover efforts.If the bid succeeded, wonderful. But if another offer topped it, Valeant would receive 15 percent of any profits generated by Pershing Square when it sold its Allergan stock to the acquirer.Critics of the arrangement cried foul, contending that Pershing had profited from its knowledge of Valeant\u2019s impending bid, essentially front-running the deal, or trading on nonpublic information. And a month later, investors filed suit against Valeant and Pershing Square.Mr. Ackman and his lawyers have contended that Pershing Square did not violate any insider-trading laws. Still, the case continues to advance under Judge David O. Carter of the Federal Court for the Central District of California.But Judge Carter expressed skepticism. According to the transcript of a Feb. 13 hearing, he questioned why he should accept the S.E.C. order as a finding of fact in the Allergan case. Although he said he would consider the order, he told the lawyers, \u201cDon\u2019t hang your hat on it.\u201dOf course, cases like the one Mr. Ackman faces often settle for far less than the amount of estimated damages, and Pershing remains a very wealthy fund, with $11 billion in assets. Asked if any of its clients had expressed concern about the case, Pershing declined to comment.Still, Mr. Ackman recently persuaded Valeant to agree to pay 60 percent of any settlement that might arise in the case.Struggling Valeant, however, does not have a big cash cushion to contribute toward a money-losing legal case. And the settlement deal, described in a regulatory filing on Feb. 13, expires in November. It is unclear what will happen after that.Wall Street will definitely be watching as Mr. Ackman tries to recover from the Valeant investment. For now, the normally loquacious money manager has gone quiet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Dutch Election, Eurogroup Leader\u2019s Fate Looks in Doubt", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 They discussed Greece\u2019s bailout. They grappled with pension issues. They pored over draft budgets.But Monday\u2019s meeting of the Eurogroup, the 19 finance ministers from countries that share the euro, was most notable for what it did not address: the future of their president.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and current president of the Eurogroup, has been one of the public faces of austerity in Europe. He has been praised for helping lay the foundations for the region\u2019s economic recovery, but has been scorned for arguing in favor of fiscal restraint even as countries like Italy and Greece have struggled to overcome economic downturns.The fight to fill the impending vacancy is likely to kick off a wave of jockeying among member states. The head of the Eurogroup plays an intensely political role, setting the tone for a bloc of ministers that presses individual governments to shore up their finances and grants political approval for bailouts.Candidates are already being discussed, including Spain\u2019s center-right economy minister and a Socialist member of the Slovak government. But whatever minister prevails, Germany, the region\u2019s heavyweight economy, is still expected to dominate on issues like Greece\u2019s bailout and regional budgetary rigor.\u201cDijsselbloem has essentially been Germany\u2019s agent in the Eurogroup,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.Mr. Dijsselbloem had been his country\u2019s finance minister for a matter of months when he took over as head of the Eurogroup in early 2013, and his tenure had a rocky start.An expert in agricultural economics who studied in Ireland and lives in the Dutch countryside, he incited controversy by endorsing a bailout of Cyprus that forced losses on many ordinary depositors.Though Mr. Dijsselbloem conceded that he made mistakes, and the Cypriot government agreed to a revised deal that put a greater burden on richer depositors, the stage was set for even tenser negotiations with Greece.By early 2015, Greece had been subject to years of tough austerity, and an increasing number of people were fed up with the seemingly never-ending belt-tightening measures sought by creditors. Thousands flocked to exuberant rallies against the country\u2019s lenders.In January of that year, Greeks voted in Syriza, a far-left party that campaigned on a broad pledge to roll back years of austerity measures, restoring cuts to salaries and pensions and securing a write-off of the country\u2019s huge debt burden. At the center of that effort was Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s combative finance minister.At a joint news conference with Mr. Dijsselbloem in Athens, Mr. Varoufakis flatly rejected working with the so-called troika \u2014 the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank \u2014 which had jointly demanded spending cuts and tax increases in exchange for loans.Those comments prompted a stony-faced Mr. Dijsselbloem to admonish his Greek counterpart for effectively seeking to derail the talks.Then, after Mr. Varoufakis left a pivotal meeting in late June, the Eurogroup\u2019s finance ministers continued to confer. Mr. Dijsselbloem said the session would proceed \u201cwithout the Greek colleague,\u201d declining to even use his counterpart\u2019s name.Ultimately, the Eurogroup failed to reach a deal with Greece, and it fell to national leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Mark Rutte of Holland to negotiate an agreement. Athens was forced to create a 50 billion euro, or $53.6 billion, privatization fund to help pay down debt in exchange for an international bailout, its third since 2010.Mr. Dijsselbloem certainly presided over more than an unending series of crises.The eurozone has expanded under his watch, with Latvia and Lithuania joining in 2014 and 2015. Eurogroup meetings have also run far more smoothly than under his predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, the current president of the European Commission, according to finance ministers and European officials.And since the European Central Bank introduced an effective backstop in 2012, buying bonds from eurozone countries with distressed economies, the Eurogroup has also allowed countries like France and Italy significant fiscal leeway.\u201cDijsselbloem is widely perceived as a good chair of the Eurogroup who has exercised a steady hand,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a Brussels think tank.But Greece has loomed large over Mr. Dijsselbloem\u2019s tenure, and is likely to dominate his successor\u2019s priorities.The country\u2019s debt still stands at 180 percent of gross domestic product, and nearly a quarter of the population is unemployed. The prospects for economic recovery remain bleak. Fearful of the political uncertainty caused by seemingly unending bailout talks, foreign investors have been wary of putting money into Greece.More recently, Mr. Dijsselbloem has tried to forge a more equitable policy for the country, pushing for meaningful ways to ease its debt burden. Last year, he drafted a three-stage debt-relief plan that was eventually accepted, albeit only after it was watered down in the face of opposition from Germany.The Dutch politician was \u201cvery austere\u201d at the outset of talks with the newly elected Syriza government in 2015, said Georgios Kyrtsos, a conservative Greek member of the European Parliament. But he became \u201cmore constructive\u201d as time went on, and Mr. Kyrtsos described him as \u201cextremely capable.\u201dAs a result, views of him improved. Anger toward Ms. Merkel or Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, is much fiercer within Greece, and Mr. Dijsselbloem\u2019s relations with Mr. Tsakalotos are a world apart from his confrontations with Mr. Varoufakis.And while many in the country celebrated when his Dutch Labor Party suffered heavy losses at the polls, several Greeks were circumspect about who might replace him and whether such a swap would have any impact.Germany holds outsize influence within the European Union, and in the Eurogroup in particular. Changing the bloc\u2019s leader is unlikely to have much impact on decision-making in Berlin.\u201cHe\u2019s just a yes-man of Europe,\u201d said Yiannis Garoutsos, 52, an electrician in Athens. \u201cHe was just doing Germany\u2019s dirty work.\u201cThey\u2019ll find someone just as accommodating to replace him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "8 Parcel Bombs Are Found in Greece", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byThe devices were discovered on Monday during a search of the Hellenic Post\u2019s main sorting office, north of Athens, according to a police spokesman, Theodoros Chronopoulos. \u201cThe packages were destined for European countries,\u201d he said, calling them \u201csimilar\u201d to the ones sent to the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and to the I.M.F.\u2019s offices.European Union finance ministers meeting on Tuesday in Brussels to discuss issues including tax policy were made aware of the parcel bombs, but they did not interrupt their talks. \u201cCertainly, we are following these developments with concern,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission, said.According to the Greek news reports, the senders listed on the packages were two former Greek finance ministers, Gikas Hardouvelis and Yanis Varoufakis, who led bailout negotiations. It was unclear why their names were chosen, but the authorities say they do not believe either man had anything to do with the matter.The parcel bombs sent to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and to the I.M.F.\u2019s offices in Paris bore the names of two Greek opposition lawmakers who are broadly perceived in Greece as backing the bold economic changes being pushed by the country\u2019s creditors.The letter bomb sent to the I.M.F.\u2019s offices in Paris exploded on Thursday, slightly injuring the worker who opened it. A day earlier, staff members at the German Finance Ministry in Berlin intercepted a parcel bomb sent to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble. Each device contained small quantities of gunpowder, according to the authorities.A Greek extremist group called Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for the parcel addressed to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble but made no reference to the Paris attack or to any other possible targets. In a statement on an anarchist website, the group said it would issue a \u201cproclamation\u201d with more details, fueling speculation about further attacks and a resurgence of domestic terrorism in Greece, where bailout talks have dragged on and political and economic instability are rising.Mr. Chronopoulos said the new parcel bombs \u201cappear\u201d to be the work of the same group. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet but it seems so,\u201d he said.The Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent in 2010.One was addressed to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and intercepted at her office. Another was sent to Silvio Berlusconi, Italy\u2019s prime minister at the time, and was intercepted at the Bologna airport. (It exploded, but caused no injuries.) A third, meant for France\u2019s president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, was stopped in Athens, along with a package addressed to Eurojust, the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, in the Netherlands.Several more were sent to embassies in Athens. One, addressed to the Mexican Embassy, exploded in the hands of a courier, causing minor injuries.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Robert Moses Keeps Rising From an Unquiet Grave", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byThere he is again.Mr. Moses rose again from his unquiet grave this week.Mr. Cuomo said the expressway was one of Mr. Moses\u2019s mistakes.No governor would have dared talk that way when Mr. Moses was in his prime, holding as many as a dozen state and city offices simultaneously, impervious to every attempt to remove or bridle him.But that prime was long ago. Even his death, at age 92 in 1981, was long ago. Younger New Yorkers may wonder what\u2019s the big deal about Robert Moses, and why he keeps coming up in the conversation.\u201cBefore him, there was no Triborough Bridge, Jones Beach State Park, Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, West Side Highway or Long Island parkway system or Niagara and St. Lawrence power projects. He built all of these and more.\u201d\u201cBefore Mr. Moses, New York State had a modest amount of parkland; when he left his position as chief of the state park system, the state had 2,567,256 acres. He built 658 playgrounds in New York City, 416 miles of parkways and 13 bridges.\u201d\u201cBut he was more than just a builder. Although he disdained theories, he was a major theoretical influence on the shape of the American city, because the works he created in New York proved a model for the nation at large. His vision of a city of highways and towers \u2014 which in his later years came to be discredited by younger planners \u2014 influenced the planning of cities around the nation.\u201d\u201cHis guiding hand made New York, known as a city of mass transit, also the nation\u2019s first city for the automobile age.\u201dWhich brings us back to the Sheridan, called the Bronx River Expressway when it was conceived in the 1940s. It was to have run about two-and-a-half miles, part of it alongside Bronx Park.That presented no problem. The city\u2019s construction coordinator, Robert Moses, had merely to consult with the city\u2019s parks commissioner, Robert Moses.Yes. A highway from one highway to another highway. The archetypal Moses project.What was to be the Bronx River Expressway was renamed in his honor. Then it languished some more.In 1959, Mr. Caro wrote in \u201cThe Power Broker,\u201d the East Tremont Neighborhood Association was trying to develop a middle-income housing complex in the Bronx. It had been frustrated in its efforts to work with the chairman of the mayor\u2019s slum clearance committee, Robert Moses.You know who it was.Neighbors tried to persuade the authority to reroute the Sheridan slightly to leave room on the riverfront parcel for 200 units of housing. At least, they said, leave the route unchanged and allow us to build a more modest housing development.The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority said it was a matter for the Parks Department to decide, since that agency would be in charge of any land left over from the roadway work. The Parks Department sent the neighbors back to Triborough, since the expressway was the authority\u2019s project. Triborough bounced them back to the Parks Department. This went on for about a year.\u201cWhat happened at the end of the year, basically, was that the community gave up the fight,\u201d Mr. Caro wrote. Neighbors were already exhausted and demoralized by the even greater trauma of displacement and disruption caused by the Cross-Bronx Expressway, developed by Mr. Moses.The gantlet of environmental and community reviews that seems to slow progress today was created in part so there wouldn\u2019t be another Robert Moses, who demolished first and asked questions later, if he asked at all; who put shovels in the ground before worrying about where the money would come from, since he knew that even balky legislators could not allow a half-finished bridge to stay that way.Advertisement"}

But they are among the most straightforward and economical measures available.For construction in a floodplain, the general aim is to elevate occupied floors above the expected flood level and to keep lower floors fairly spartan, ensuring they can survive inundation with little or no permanent damage. This makes new buildings intrinsically flood-resistant.The panels are composed of laminated plywood, stainless steel and aluminum. They are hinged. When erected and braced, they form an L shape as deep as it is high. Vinyl webs run between the panels to keep water out.The horizontal footing of each panel would face the floodwaters, not the building. The weight of water bearing down on the footing, nearly a ton in the case of a single seven-foot-tall panel, is what keeps the wall from overturning.\u201cWe are definitely protecting it against the next Sandy or a greater storm,\u201d said Adam Goldberg, the director for business development at AquaFence USA. \u201cIf the spillover is brief, there are pumps inside the protection barrier that would account for that.\u201d There are also trench drains at the entrances that act as the third line of defense.Despite the layers of protection, deployable barriers do not always keep floodwaters out.During Sandy, there were a \u201clarge number of failures of these types of protection schemes,\u201d said Andrew Martin, the acting chief of the risk analysis branch in the regional office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In some cases, water rose higher than the walls. In others, it leaked through poorly maintained sections of walls.\u201cDesign and standards continue to improve,\u201d Mr. Martin said, \u201cbut it is worth noting that these approaches are not fail-safe.\u201dHe said his agency strongly recommended that property owners considering deployable flood barriers consult with local engineers and code-enforcement officials to fully understand the magnitude and nature of risk at a given site, the impact a barrier may have, how to maintain it and what the law requires.The developers of Empire Stores are not relying entirely on a wall to protect the complex. For instance, the building\u2019s Con Ed transformer vaults are on the seventh floor. And there is a 600-kilowatt, gas-powered standby generator.Standing at an arched window on the second floor, recalling how Sandy\u2019s floodwaters crested almost four and a half years ago, Mr. Murashige said, \u201cWe have a healthy respect for what we see happening.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a bridge in front of Empire Stores in Brooklyn.

{"Headline": "A Historic New Jersey Cemetery Sits Neglected and Blighted", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byNEWARK \u2014 Every Mother\u2019s Day, Ann Jeffress and her two sisters have come to Woodland Cemetery here to lay a rose at the grave of their mother, Lucy. The visits were never easy, but now they have become traumatic in ways they never imagined. When the women enter the cemetery, they walk hand in hand, clutching sticks to fend off dogs or potential attackers. They poke cautiously through mounds of rubble in search of the spot where their mother was laid to rest.A once illustrious cemetery where over 80,000 people have been buried, and with a history dating to Newark\u2019s heyday in the 19th century, Woodland has fallen into a bleak state of disrepair. These days, the cemetery is a blight on a neighborhood striving for renewal, a magnet for crime and garbage.Woodland\u2019s 37 sloping acres are choked with chest-high weeds. Its gatehouse is crumbling, much of its fence is broken and many headstones have been toppled or vandalized. Lucy Jeffress struggled to raise her family on a housekeeper\u2019s salary \u2014 now her gravestone lies cracked on the ground.Ann Jeffress said that she had called the cemetery\u2019s management repeatedly, but that her entreaties, like those of many other relatives of those buried there, had gone unanswered or unheeded.\u201cI feel like we were cheated,\u201d Ms. Jeffress, 73, said. \u201cWe put our mother there to rest in peace, but instead she was desecrated.\u201dThere have been many calls to revive Woodland, but they have all sputtered. The board that runs Woodland says the privately operated cemetery is grappling with unavoidable financial challenges. But many of those who have grown concerned about Woodland believe otherwise and have filed a formal complaint with a state agency accusing the board of financial mismanagement. They also argue that a board made up entirely of white people from out of town has fallen out of touch with the community it was meant to serve.Some elected officials blame the State of New Jersey, which, unlike many other states, does not provide financial help for decrepit graveyards.\u201cIt\u2019s not a direct city responsibility. It\u2019s not a direct county responsibility; it\u2019s not a direct state responsibility, so everyone lets themselves off the hook,\u201d said State Senator Ronald L. Rice, a Democrat whose district includes Woodland. \u201cAnd, meanwhile, the cemetery is a wreck that runs down the entire neighborhood.\u201dJudy Welshons, the executive director of the nonprofit New Jersey Cemetery Association, estimated that there were as many as 100 financially or physically distressed cemeteries in the state. \u201cBut none are quite as big or as legendary as Woodland,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a disturbing and unusual case.\u201dThe trajectory of Woodland largely mirrors the history of Newark itself. The city was in the midst of an industrial boom when the cemetery opened in 1855, drawing throngs of European immigrants. Woodland was designed as a garden-style cemetery with rolling hills, winding dirt pathways and a Gothic Revival gatehouse that made the cemetery an unofficial city landmark. In its early years, many of those buried were Germans; over time came immigrants from Ireland, Greece, Italy and Eastern Europe.African-Americans were also admitted to Woodland, but, as in many cemeteries, their interments were commonly held in a separate section until the 1960s. Woodland\u2019s broader integration coincided with a wave of white flight from Newark, and the cemetery soon catered predominantly to black residents.Among those buried there is Ike Abrams Quebec, a renowned African-American jazz saxophonist. Woodland also became the final resting place for hundreds of veterans of conflicts stretching from the War of 1812 through the Vietnam War.But as the social fabric of the city began to fray in the middle of the last century \u2014 a combination of deindustrialization, discriminatory lending and racial unrest that culminated in the 1967 riots \u2014 Woodland deteriorated as well.\u201cIt became a tough area, and the burials just started dwindling,\u201d said Mary Lish, 65, a retired court clerk who has studied the cemetery\u2019s history. \u201cSoon enough, everyone began to turn a blind eye to the place.\u201dBy the 1980s, Woodland had degenerated into squalor. Amid the fallen headstones and mounds of trash, drug dealers sold their wares, prostitutes solicited clients, homeless people set up camp and stray dogs ran wild.\u201cThis is supposed to be a sacred place, and instead it\u2019s one of the worst parts of the city,\u201d said John S. James, a member of the city council.Officials have long implored the city to help. As early as 1988, records show, the council described \u201cdeplorable conditions\u201d at Woodland and sought financing from the mayor, Sharpe James. When those appeals failed, they turned to the state, repeatedly asking the New Jersey Cemetery Board, which regulates cemeteries, to help Woodland.\u201cIt\u2019s in a crisis situation,\u201d Donald Bradley, the council president, wrote in 1997. In 2003, the council even urged the city to sue the state cemetery board for failure to maintain Woodland.A spokesman for the State Division of Consumer Affairs, which oversees the board, said that the board \u201ccannot comment on the reasons why Woodland has been in disrepair,\u201d and that it did not have the authority to provide aid to cemeteries.While many states require cemeteries to contribute to a fund for distressed or abandoned graveyards, New Jersey does not. Efforts to establish such a fund have languished in the State Senate.Without help, the Woodland board says it is trapped in a vicious financial cycle.\u201cWe\u2019re caught in a Catch-22,\u201d said Rosemary Hilbert, the board president. \u201cWe can\u2019t tend to the cemetery until we get more money, and we can\u2019t get more money until we tend to the cemetery.\u201dBut some critics claim that Woodland\u2019s problems are more insidious. Last year, Karima Jackson, a graduate student at Rutgers University and a lifelong Newark resident, filed a complaint against the cemetery\u2019s board with the Division of Consumer Affairs claiming financial mismanagement, regulatory violations and a lack of transparency.\u201cThe cemetery has been failing our community for decades, and no one has held them accountable,\u201d said Ms. Jackson, 38, whose great-grandfather is buried in Woodland.Ms. Hilbert denied Ms. Jackson\u2019s assertions, calling her \u201can agitator with an agenda.\u201d She said the cemetery was steadily moving forward with its own restoration plan.City officials say there is little they can do since Woodland is run privately.The board has not held an annual meeting, as required by the state, since January 2015, and Ms. Jackson said it had refused to consider new members since she and several other community activists submitted applications last year. (The board has scheduled a meeting for late April.)The activists, all of whom are black residents of Newark, also question why the current six-person Woodland board is made up of white people who do not live in the city. They see their stymied membership efforts as part of a longer history of black exclusion from the Woodland board.\u201cAny time a black person spoke out, we got the boot,\u201d said Keith Bush, a Newark resident who said he had been kicked off the board after filing a complaint against it. \u201cI hate the race card, but it is what it is.\u201dMs. Hilbert acknowledged that there used to be several black people on the board, but rejected any suggestion that there was a racial problem. She said the board intended to add African-American members soon.\u201cThe race card is the last card they play, but it\u2019s not an issue with us,\u201d she said.After Ms. Jackson submitted her complaint to the state, the situation became more heated, culminating in a fistfight in the cemetery between Warren Vincentz, a Woodland board member, and Horatio Joines, an Organize Change member and Ms. Jackson\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Ms. Hilbert stopped allowing the group into the cemetery, though Ms. Jackson has still managed to lead several cleanups.Though Ms. Jackson filed her initial complaint in February 2016, her claim remains unresolved. The spokesman for the Division of Consumer Affairs would not comment on the complaint.With no resolution in sight, the families of those buried at Woodland are left frustrated at how a problem they consider so egregious is allowed to fester.One afternoon last fall, Vera Jones, a bookkeeper from Newark, tried to visit the cemetery to lay flowers at her mother\u2019s grave. The sight of fractured headstones and overgrown weeds was so dismaying that she turned around and drove back home.\u201cThe city? The state?\u2019\u2019 asked Ms. Jones, 52. \u201cNo one can do anything?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey Area Rising Around Transit Hub Lacks One Thing: Its Hub", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byNORTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. \u2014 All the ingredients for a bustling downtown transit hub here are coming together: new townhouses, restaurants and big-box stores sit just off the busiest rail corridor in the country, as trains whiz by every 10 minutes or so. Bulldozers, backhoes and scattered mounds of dirt offer evidence of more to come. A large banner over a nearby highway with an illustration of a train declares: \u201cShop. Dine. Ride. Live.\u201dThere is just one piece missing from this rosy picture: any evidence of a train station.On the longest stretch of passenger rails in New Jersey without a stop, the proposed station would address a glaring need, providing public transit to a bustling area and easing congestion on chronically gridlocked highways. An elevated rail track that is part of the project could funnel more commuter trains to New York City.But after being unveiled with great fanfare four years ago, the project\u2019s future is unclear. New Jersey Transit, which operates the state\u2019s sprawling rail network, said recently that no funding was available so far for the plan.For those living in what has essentially become a train station desert, traveling is often an aggravating slog.\u201cRight now, it\u2019s an hour and a half minimum getting to New York from my home in North Brunswick,\u201d said Jaideep Desai, 50, who works as a project manager in New York City. He moved here from Jersey City after his daughter was born for more space and to keep his commute manageable. But without the new station, which promised a commute time of under an hour for the roughly 40-mile journey to the city, Mr. Desai must sit in traffic-clogged back streets as he wends his way to the closest train stop in New Brunswick.The station is part of a related project to build what the agency calls the Mid-Line Loop, an elevated track near the new station that would improve service between New York and New Jersey by allowing trains to turn around at North Brunswick rather than having to travel further south to Trenton. It would help relieve congestion along the crowded Northeast Corridor, which is shared by New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. No construction has started on this project, either.The building of the platforms was supposed to have begun this month and the station was to be completed by the end of next year.\u201cIf they\u2019ve not started by now, it\u2019s probably at least another five years before it gets opened, and that\u2019s frustrating, you know?\u201d said Chris Cohen, 28, a New Jersey Transit rider who lives in nearby Highland Park, as he sat at the bar at the newly opened Greene Turtle. A window offered a perfect view of a mound of dirt where the train station would be.Agency officials insist that they remain committed to building the station as well as the elevated tracks, but a spokeswoman, Lisa Torbic, said last month that \u201cneither project is included in our current capital program, nor do they have funding.\u201dThe delay is a result, in part, of the nature of public financing for infrastructure projects. Multiyear, multimillion-dollar projects can be upended by annual budget constraints, especially in a financially squeezed state like New Jersey. So even when an agreement is reached and money is set aside for initial work, like designs and engineering, a project can be stopped if financing dries up or needs to be directed to more pressing issues.\u201cIt is important to understand that capital plans adapt to current situations and to meet priority safety, state of good repair and operational needs,\u201d Ms. Torbic said in a statement.With the agency struggling simply to keep its existing transportation system in good working order, more ambitious projects like a new train station have been pushed to the side. In the meantime, however, construction continues to carve out a neighborhood that was meant to be transit-friendly.\u201cIt\u2019s probably the first question they ask: \u2018Hey, I heard you guys were building a train, what can you tell me about it?\u2019\u201d said Thomas Spiess, the general sales manager for the Northeast Corridor for Pulte Group, the company building and selling townhouses here.The development sits on a 212-acre site that was once occupied by Johnson & Johnson. It was bought in 2006 by North Brunswick T.O.D. Associates, a developer leading the effort to transform the aging commercial and industrial property into a new downtown in this town of 42,000 residents better known for its strip malls than its Main Street.Designed to be more sustainable than the suburban sprawl that spawned the subdivisions and behemoth concrete corporate campuses that lie along the state\u2019s highways, the North Brunswick downtown aims to concentrate more than 1,800 housing units, restaurants, a hotel and stores within a smaller footprint with short, walkable commutes to a rail station. So far, 158 townhouses are under construction and a sign at the leasing center trumpets \u201c25 new homeowners in the past 60 days.\u201dResidents have already moved into townhouses. Target and Costco have been open for months. The foundation has been laid for a new Courtyard Marriott. And the beer taps at the Greene Turtle, the area\u2019s first major restaurant, started flowing last month.While developers remain optimistic that a train station will one day stand here, the flurry of construction and the signs of an increasingly vibrant neighborhood aggravate frustrations over the absence of any progress.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting a long time,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Overstuffed Constitution: Voters Face a Window for Reforms", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byBookshelfCrammed with 56,326 words and more than 200 amendments, New York State\u2019s bloated Constitution is about seven times as long as the amended United States Constitution and well over twice the average length of the constitutions of the other 49 states.With Washington abdicating responsibilities to states and localities, the authors of two new books argue convincingly that New York\u2019s Constitution is so riddled with anachronisms and has been so circumvented by legislative exceptions that it finally needs to be overhauled. Next November, for the first time in two decades, voters will be empowered to do just that.This revised and updated version of \u201cThree Men\u201d concludes that because Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s efforts have been laudable, but not transformational, the only option is a constitutional convention, which New Yorkers can convene by referendum every 20 years.This is one of those years. Voters will decide in November whether to hold a convention. If they do, delegates would be selected next year. In 2019, they would draft a constitution and place it on the ballot.For example, the Constitution demands that all general obligation debt be subject to the voters\u2019 approval, but nearly 95 percent of what the state owes was borrowed without a referendum.In the last two opportunities, voters rejected a convention. Sixty years ago, they voted down a new constitution. But each time, the debate was clouded by a single issue: state aid to parochial schools, abortion or the death penalty. This time, so far, it is not.In a populist era, tinkering with a constitution can be risky. And what is the hope for fundamental reform when the permanent government, in this case, the Legislature, controls the delegate selection process? How else, though, to make voting easier, to fairly apportion legislative districts and the education budget, to impose campaign financing limits and higher ethics standards and to grant localities self-government?In the early 1990s, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo asked Peter C. Goldmark Jr., a former city and state official, to draft proposals for a constitutional convention, a reformer\u2019s dream that evaporated when Mr. Cuomo lost his re-election bid in 1994.What\u2019s left in Albany, Mr. Goldmark told Mr. Lachman, \u201cis an unholy confluence of leader tyranny, corrupt campaign financing, insidious gerrymandering and no real oversight on integrity, due process and transparency.\u201dIn one telling passage, the author Gay Talese explains why Mr. Cuomo decided against a presidential campaign: His family was from Calabria, a Southern Italian village of people who \u201clike to stay close to home and sleep in our own bed.\u201d Mr. Talese told Mr. O\u2019Shaughnessy: \u201cYou guys are Irish. Your people could be cops, firemen, and the wives could be nannies. You spoke the language. Italians had to dig ditches because we didn\u2019t speak the language. It makes Mario all the more amazing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As someone born in a women\u2019s prison, I long suffered trauma from broken attachments. Today, up to 13,000 women a year are pregnant at the time of sentencing.Prisons track recidivism, and they report that women who live with their babies in prison nurseries are less likely to recommit crimes, often with a recidivism rate of only 3 percent compared with the national average of 70 percent.States would be wise to step up resources for incarcerated pregnant women. Financing this is a bargain compared with the average $30,000 it costs per year per woman to keep her in prison.Change will come only when the public speaks loudly enough for legislators to hear.

No giant concepts. No reinventions.\u201dThe universe did as it was bade to do. The very next day, Mr. Ruffalo was offered the leading part in Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Price,\u201d after John Turturro dropped out.That his wish was answered by Arthur Miller seems particularly heaven-sent: In the almost 11 years since he last appeared on Broadway, in a revival of Clifford Odets\u2019s \u201cAwake and Sing!,\u201d Mr. Ruffalo has crammed an enormous amount of social activism into his busy career, which has garnered him three Oscar nominations (most recently for \u201cSpotlight,\u201d from 2015) and his family life (he and his wife, Sunrise, have three children, aged 15, 11 and 9). So the playwright\u2019s examinations of economic and class struggles resonate beyond the script for Mr. Ruffalo.\u201cThe Price,\u201d which opens March 16 and features Tony Shalhoub, Jessica Hecht and Danny DeVito (in his own Broadway debut), explores familial obligation and money in 1968 New York City. Mr. Ruffalo plays Victor Franz, a career cop who has been exiled to the police department\u2019s version of Siberia \u2014 out by the airports \u2014 because he doesn\u2019t participate in departmental politics and might rat out his colleagues who are on the take. When the play begins, he is in an abandoned old apartment cluttered with the vestiges of an elegant upper-middle-class family \u2014 beds imported from Europe, Biedermeier-style tables, and a large harp, draped against the dust. We learn shortly that it is Victor\u2019s family home, and he is here to sell the contents before the building is demolished to make way for something new and modern.Complicating the transaction is Victor\u2019s brother, Walter Franz (Mr. Shalhoub), a wealthy doctor from whom he has been estranged for 16 years. And Esther, Victor\u2019s wife (Ms. Hecht), is self-conscious about appearances; she considers her husband\u2019s uniform is too much of a tell-all about their social status. It is full of questions of honesty and corruption, class struggle and expectations, even access to a decent education.\u201cIt\u2019s about capitalism at its most tenacious, heartless and dehumanizing worst,\u201d Mr. Ruffalo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dialectic. We all have to choose between our humanity and survival, and it gives us a lot of hard choices to make.\u201dTerry Kinney, who is directing the show for the Roundabout Theater Company, explained that Miller wrote \u201cThe Price\u201d \u201cas a reaction to the avant-garde theater\u201d of the time, \u201cwhere characters didn\u2019t have a past; they were prototypes. But everything already happened before the play started. The characters are debating the past, and it has all of the catharsis of families.\u201d\u201cThe play talks about not being honest about the past,\u201d Mr. Ruffalo said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just like now: Who is telling the truth? Which version do you believe?\u201dMr. Kinney admitted that though Mr. Turturro was originally cast in the role, \u201cMark Ruffalo was always on my mind, believe me.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s younger \u2014 the exact same age as Victor. Mark\u2019s heart is so huge, but I wanted him to not be so transparent; Mark is deeply vulnerable. Victor stuffs so much inside.\u201dVictor is \u201ca blue-collar guy living a righteous life,\u201d Mr. Ruffalo said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be that when you\u2019re a priest or a teacher, but when you\u2019re a cop walking on the streets of New York in 1968, that\u2019s pretty rare.\u201dMr. Ruffalo is the eldest of four children in what he called a \u201ctrade-oriented\u201d family headed by a father in the construction business and a mother who was a hairdresser. \u201cMoney was an issue,\u201d he said.\u201cI was dyslexic, so I wasn\u2019t good at school,\u201d he added. \u201cHigher education wasn\u2019t really an option.\u201dAfter he graduated from high school, the family moved from Virginia to San Diego, and Mr. Ruffalo discovered acting through the Stella Adler school in Los Angeles. He formed a theater company with friends, working at menial jobs to keep him aloft.\u201cI was living hand-to-mouth but doing plays for $5,000 a pop; we did 30 plays in 14 years, and it was vibrant,\u201d Mr. Ruffalo said. \u201cI produced, acted, did fliers, costumes, lighting board, built our sets and really ran a theater.\u201d He added: \u201cI was so poor I would buy a burrito and cut it in half to eat it for lunch and dinner. We were all struggling together, but those were magical days.\u201dHe reads constantly, and prioritizes \u201cby what I\u2019m seeing happening. I don\u2019t like to put myself in the middle of things when I\u2019m not wanted or needed. If it\u2019s reaching people without me, I\u2019d rather not get involved.\u201dHis support of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s president campaign was a natural fit, given the overlap in their progressive interests.\u201cI see these historical moments, and I sense the historical significance of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t explain how I do that, but it feels game-changing.\u201d Speaking of the North Dakota community at Standing Rock, he said, \u201cThis is an important moment, and these people need a boost, and we bring a spotlight that draws eyes and attention.\u201dMr. Ruffalo\u2019s career is rich in independent movies and giant features in which he plays nuanced and often sensitive men. But a lot of this work is enabled through more commercial roles like the superhero the Hulk, to which he must return. \u201cI have to go back to work in April,\u201d he said, making it clear that what pays the bills feels like something entirely different from \u201cThe Price.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re doing \u2018Avengers\u2019 3 and 4.\u201dMr. Ruffalo says the hardest thing about his job are the absences from his family. \u201cI have a rule: I can\u2019t be away for more than two weeks at a time,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn two weeks\u2019 time, [the kids have] changed.

At Mr. Kislyak\u2019s request, Mr. Kushner later met with Sergey N. Gorkov, the chief of Vnesheconombank, which the United States placed on its sanctions list after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia annexed Crimea and began meddling in Ukraine.Members of presidential transition teams routinely meet with foreign officials, and there is nothing inherently improper about sitting down with the Russian ambassador. Part of Mr. Kushner\u2019s role during the campaign and the transition was to serve as a chief conduit to foreign governments and officials, and Ms. Hicks said he met with dozens of officials from a wide range of countries.She added that Mr. Kushner was willing to talk to Senate investigators about the meetings with Mr. Kislyak and the banker, saying, \u201cHe isn\u2019t trying to hide anything and wants to be transparent.\u201dStill, meetings between Trump associates and Russian officials or others linked to Mr. Putin are now of heightened interest as several congressional committees and F.B.I. investigators try to determine the scope of the Russian intervention in the election and links between Russians and anyone around Mr. Trump.The Senate panel\u2019s decision to question Mr. Kushner would make him the closest person to the president to be called upon in any of the investigations, and the only one currently serving in the White House. The officials who initially described that Senate inquiry to The New York Times did so on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly about Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law.The F.B.I. declined to comment. There are no indications that Mr. Kushner is a focus of its investigation, and Ms. Hicks said he had not been questioned by the bureau.The meetings Mr. Kushner arranged with Mr. Kislyak all took place in December, during the transition, Ms. Hicks said. Mr. Kushner attended the initial meeting with Mr. Kislyak to explore whether a channel could be set up between the Russian government and the incoming administration to improve relations between the United States and Russia, Ms. Hicks said. They also discussed how the United States and Russia could cooperate on issues in the Middle East, an area Mr. Kushner has been deputized to take the lead on, she said.Mr. Kislyak asked for a second meeting to \u201cdeliver a message,\u201d Ms. Hicks said. Mr. Kushner sent Avrahm Berkowitz, a White House aide and longtime associate. At that session, Mr. Kislyak told Mr. Berkowitz that he wanted Mr. Kushner to meet Mr. Gorkov, the Russian banker, Ms. Hicks said.Mr. Gorkov is a graduate of the academy of Federal Security Service of Russia, a training ground for Russian intelligence and security forces. And as the head of Vnesheconombank, Mr. Gorkov presides over a bank whose supervisory board is controlled by members of Mr. Putin\u2019s government, including Prime Minister Dimitri A. Medvedev. It has been used to bail out oligarchs favored by Mr. Putin, as well as to help fund pet projects like the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.Senate investigators plan to ask Mr. Kushner if he discussed ways to secure additional financing for the building during his meeting with the Russian banker, a government official said. Ms. Hicks said that no such business was discussed at the half-hour session, during which Mr. Gorkov expressed a desire for an open dialogue. Nor did the issue of the American sanctions against Russian entities like Vnesheconombank arise, she added. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t much of a conversation,\u201d she said.Mr. Gorkov, in the statement, went further. He said that bank managers, as part of a new strategy for the institution, met with international financial institutions in Europe, Asia and America to talk about promising trends and sectors. He also met with representatives of \u201cbusiness circles of the U.S., including with the head of Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner.\u201dAnd in an interview on the state-owned Rossiya 24 TV channel on Dec. 29, the same month that he met with Mr. Kushner, Mr. Gorkov said he hoped that the situation caused by Ukraine sanctions imposed by the Americans against Russian banks like his \u201cwould change for the better.\u201dThe Senate investigation is proceeding on a separate track from the F.B.I. investigation while drawing on some of the same material, like routine electronic surveillance of the Russian ambassador and his embassy cohort. The committee chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, has told the White House he plans to interview all Trump aides who had contact with Russian officials, according to White House officials. Depending on those interviews, some may be called upon to testify in closed-door sessions.Mr. Burr and Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and the committee\u2019s vice chairman, said in a statement: \u201cMr. Kushner has volunteered to be interviewed as part of the committee\u2019s investigation into the Russian activities surrounding the 2016 election.\u201d They added that their inquiry would \u201cfollow the intelligence wherever it leads.\u201dThe extent of Mr. Kushner\u2019s interactions with Mr. Kislyak caught some senior members of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House team off guard, in part because he did not mention them last month during a debate then consuming the White House: how to handle the disclosures about Mr. Flynn\u2019s interactions with the Russian ambassador.Ms. Hicks said that Mr. Trump had authorized Mr. Kushner to have meetings with foreign officials that he felt made sense, and to report back to him if those meetings produced anything of note. She said that because in Mr. Kushner\u2019s view the meetings were inconsequential, it did not occur to him to mention them to senior staff members earlier.\u201cThere was nothing to get out in front of on this,\u201d she said.Jo Becker and Maggie Haberman reported from New York, and Matthew Rosenberg from Washington. Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting from Washington, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Storey, Novelist and Playwright Lauded on Both Sides of Atlantic, Dies at 83", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 David Storey, a British writer who drew on his experiences as a miner\u2019s son, a farmworker, an art student, a professional rugby player and a teacher to create novels and plays that won acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic, died here on Sunday. He was 83.A niece, Samantha Storey, said the cause was Parkinson\u2019s disease and related dementia.Though Mr. Storey struggled for recognition at first, he went on to win Britain\u2019s premier fiction award, the Man Booker Prize, in 1976 for his novel \u201cSaville,\u201d in which a miner\u2019s son breaks away from his background. Two of his novels were shortlisted for the award. Three of his works were named best play by the New York Drama Critics\u2019 Circle, all within four years in the 1970s. He also earned two Tony nominations.It was as a playwright that Mr. Storey was probably best known; his plays have been performed in some 60 countries. Yet it was as a novelist that he first gained notice, with \u201cThis Sporting Life,\u201d published in 1960, which won the Somerset Maugham Fiction Award.A vividly told tale of a maverick miner turned rugby player, the novel was adapted for film in 1963, with a screenplay by Mr. Storey, and won Oscar nominations for its lead actors, Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts.\u201cThis Sporting Life\u201d was soon followed by two more novels notable for their bold characterization and narrative energy: \u201cThe Flight Into Camden,\u201d narrated by a miner\u2019s daughter who falls for a married teacher, and \u201cRadcliffe,\u201d about two unlikely childhood friends \u2014 one moody and intelligent, the other physically powerful \u2014 whose relationship takes a homosexual turn when they meet again as young men.\u201cRadcliffe\u201d was shortlisted for the Booker prize, as was Mr. Storey\u2019s novel \u201cPasmore,\u201d published in 1973, centered on a university lecturer whose comfortable life unravels.By 1966 Mr. Storey was established enough for the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh to stage his play \u201cThe Restoration of Arnold Middleton,\u201d which he had written in a single weekend six years earlier, at a time when he was despairing of his novel-writing career. The tale of a troubled schoolteacher, it transferred to London, where Mr. Storey, who had seldom gone to the theater, found himself acclaimed as a dramatist.\u201cThe sheer exhilaration of seeing it come alive onstage prompted me to write another five plays in no time at all,\u201d he said.Two he threw out, but the others were staged in 1969 and 1970 at the Royal Court Theater in London.The three plays \u2014 all directed by Lindsay Anderson, with whom Mr. Storey developed what he called \u201can almost mystical relationship\u201d \u2014 were \u201cIn Celebration,\u201d about the turbulent reunion of a miner\u2019s family scarred by the death of a son; \u201cThe Contractor,\u201d in which wrangling workmen were seen first raising and then lowering a tent for a wedding reception; and \u201cHome,\u201d in which John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson portrayed elderly men precariously surviving in a mental institution. Mr. Storey said he had written \u201cHome\u201d in three days.The play\u2019s deft characterizations and understated dialogue led some critics to compare it to Chekhov, and after it transferred to Broadway, in 1970, it drew Tony nominations for Mr. Storey, Mr. Gielgud, Mr. Richardson, Mr. Anderson and the actress Mona Washbourne.\u201cHome\u201d was different from most of Mr. Storey\u2019s best-known work in that it was not derived from his own experience, as \u201cThe Contractor\u201d and \u201cThe Farm\u201d were, both from 1973 and both drawing on his days as a laborer in his youth. Similarly, \u201cThe Changing Room\u201d (also 1973) was based on his rugby days, and \u201cLife Class\u201d (1974) drew on his time at the Slade School of Fine Art in London.In Mr. Storey\u2019s stage world, characters were misfits, at odds with their roots, their environment, their work, their relationships, their inner selves.\u201cAll my plays ask for a more whole, grander view of life,\u201d he once said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always sadness at their endings.\u201dDavid Malcolm Storey was born on July 13, 1933, in public housing in the Yorkshire town of Wakefield and grew up there with two brothers, a third having died as a toddler. Thanks to his father\u2019s determination that David not follow him into the coal mines, he was educated at a prestigious local grammar school and, it seemed, was destined to become a teacher.But he appalled his parents by deciding that a safe, secure profession was not for him. He attended the local art school rather than a university, and then won a place at Slade. A career as a painter seemed likely.But to pay for art school, Mr. Storey, an athletic 18-year-old, signed a contract with the Leeds Rugby League club, which meant commuting between Yorkshire, where fellow players disdained him as \u201cthis artist swanning in for matches,\u201d he said, and London, where fellow students thought him \u201ca bit of an oaf.\u201dHe was, he added, at home only on the train, and he used the journeys to write novels, if unsuccessfully at first. He had to wait until he was 26, married and working in assorted London schools as a teacher before \u201cThis Sporting Life,\u201d his seventh novel, found a publisher.Though Mr. Storey\u2019s plays often reflected Britain\u2019s class tensions, they resonated with audiences around the world and with people of all classes.Mr. Storey remembered Princess Margaret\u2019s coming backstage after a performance of \u201cIn Celebration,\u201d a tale of emotional ferment in mining country, telling him that she had left behind a friend sitting alone and weeping. As the princess told it, an usher had asked the friend if the play had upset her. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the royal family,\u201d she sobbed.As attested to by the three plays of his that were all produced in 1973, Mr. Storey would work simultaneously on several manuscripts of plays or novels, walking between them like a painter moving from easel to easel in a second-floor room in his house in the Camden district of London. His hope, he said was that they would \u201cdevelop their own organic life.\u201dMany remained unfinished, he said, after he decided that they were \u201cdreadful, turgid illustrations of some wonderful theme.\u201d And in recent years many of his finished novels failed to find a publisher or were unenthusiastically received. The same was true of his plays.\u201cStages,\u201d in which an aging artist looks back on his career, was presented at the National Theater in 2002. But Mr. Storey\u2019s last substantial theatrical success came in 1980 with \u201cEarly Days,\u201d in which Ralph Richardson played an elderly politician recalling achievements that he considered \u201cdust.\u201dThough he had his angry moments \u2014 he famously hit the critic Michael Billington in 1976 over a bad review \u2014 Mr. Storey was a mild, modest man who lived quietly in London with his wife, Barbara, whom he married in 1956.She died in 2015. He is survived by two daughters, Helen Storey, a professor of fashion science at the University of Arts/London College of Fashion, and Kate Storey, a biologist; two sons, Jake, a finance director, and Sean, who works in aerospace defense strategy; a brother, Anthony; and six grandchildren.Though he was prone to depression, and said that writing was a way of relieving his bleaker feelings, Mr. Storey had a wry sense of humor and enjoyed turning experience into anecdote.One involved the time he organized the Slade School\u2019s annual dinner. The painter Lucian Freud, instead of bringing his wife, came accompanied by a huge, slobbering dog, which took her place at the table and ate her chicken. Then students began to set fires and throw plates, one of which hit a girl and knocked her unconscious. After the pandemonium ended, the painter Stanley Spencer was found sitting alone, staring morosely at his hands.\u201cI can\u2019t come to another Slade dinner,\u201d he told Mr. Storey. \u201cI can\u2019t take the risk.\u201dMr. Storey, who once described much of his writing as disguised autobiography, never did turn that memory into a play.An obituary on Tuesday about the novelist and playwright David Storey misstated his place in his family\u2019s birth order. He was the second-youngest of four brothers, one of whom died as a toddler; he was not \u201cthe youngest of four sons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Internet Is Saving Culture, Not Killing It", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne secret to longevity as a pundit is to issue predictions that can\u2019t be easily checked. So here\u2019s one for the time capsule: Two hundred years from now, give or take, the robot-people of Earth will look back on the early years of the 21st century as the beginning of a remarkable renaissance in art and culture.That may sound unlikely to many of us in the present. In the past few decades, we\u2019ve seen how technology has threatened the old order in cultural businesses, including the decimation of the music industry, the death of the cable subscription, the annihilation of newspapers and the laying to waste of independent bookstores.But things are turning around; for people of the future, our time may be remembered as a period not of death, but of rejuvenation and rebirth.Part of the story is in the art itself. In just about every cultural medium, whether movies or music or books or the visual arts, digital technology is letting in new voices, creating new formats for exploration, and allowing fans and other creators to participate in a glorious remixing of the work. This isn\u2019t new; from blogs to podcasts to YouTube, the last 20 years have been marked by a succession of formats that have led to ever-lower barriers for new and off-the-wall creators.But now something surprising has happened.In the last few years, and with greater intensity in the last 12 months, people started paying for online content. They are doing so at an accelerating pace, and on a dependable, recurring schedule, often through subscriptions. And they\u2019re paying for everything.You\u2019ve already heard about the rise of subscription-based media platforms \u2014 things like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify and Apple Music. But people are also paying for smaller-audience and less-mainstream-friendly content. They are subscribing to podcasters, comedians, zany YouTube stars, novelists and comic book artists. They are even paying for news.It\u2019s difficult to overstate how big a deal this is. More than 20 years after it first caught mainstream attention and began to destroy everything about how we finance culture, the digital economy is finally beginning to coalesce around a sustainable way of supporting content. If subscriptions keep taking off, it won\u2019t just mean that some of your favorite creators will survive the internet. It could also make for a profound shift in the way we find and support new cultural talent. It could lead to a wider variety of artists and art, and forge closer connections between the people who make art and those who enjoy it.\u201cWhat we want to do is change the entire financing mechanism that drives the production of content online,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cWe want to change how things are paid for and how the web runs. For us, it\u2019s a very, very big problem.\u201d\u201cI do think something has changed culturally,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cThis new generation is more concerned with social impact. There\u2019s a desire to vote with your dollars and your time and attention.\u201dSome of that is happening in the news business, too. The New York Times and many other newspapers reported a surge in subscriptions after Donald J. Trump won the presidency last year.Huge content platforms have been criticized for the way they treat artists. Even if lots of people are paying for services like Spotify, critics say that it can be difficult for musicians, especially smaller and less-well-known ones, to make a sustainable living from the platform.Yet many artists are finding ways around these difficulties. Thanks to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, artists can now establish close relationships with their fans. They can sell merchandise and offer special fan-only promotions and content. And after finding an audience, they can use sites like Patreon to get a dependable paycheck from their most loyal followers.This sort of alternative arrangement isn\u2019t easy to pursue; it can take time, effort and skills in unusual dark arts (such as how social-media marketing works). But there are signs it is catching on: At the Grammys last year, the award for best new artist went to Chance the Rapper, who has famously, proudly rejected every offer to sign with a record label and even to sell any of his music.If there are difficulties in navigating the modern cultural business, there are upsides, too.\u201cI don\u2019t have to go out on the road and play in bars,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be a father and I can be a husband. This normalizes my career. It normalizes the career of being an artist, which has never been normalized.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Nuclear Deal Could Be Gateway for Terrorism Legal Claims", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byThose judgments provided symbolic justice but came with little realistic expectation that Iran \u2014 which did not bother to contest the evidence \u2014 would actually pay all it owed, aside from its limited assets frozen in the United States. But now, those cases are colliding with another major legal and national security event: the Iran nuclear deal.In the first case of its kind, a group of attack victims \u2014 including estates of people who were killed \u2014 who won one of the default judgments against Iran has gone to a European court to try to enforce it. A judge in Luxembourg has quietly put a freeze on $1.6 billion in assets belonging to Iran\u2019s central bank, according to people familiar with the case.The fight is part of increasing instances in which domestic civil lawsuits against foreign entities over terrorist attacks have raised diplomatic and national security complications.Diplomatic and security specialists said the litigation also has broader significance. The essence of the 2015 deal was that Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions so it could reintegrate into the world economy. That goal would be undermined if any Iranian-linked assets in places like Europe were vulnerable to seizure to pay off the default judgments handed down by American courts.\u201cA ruling like this would make Iranian assets vulnerable in Europe which, for Iranians, would violate the spirit of the agreement if not the letter of it,\u201d he said.Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, did not respond to an email request to speak with someone in the Trump administration about its thinking regarding the effort. President Trump was a fierce critic of the nuclear accord during the campaign, saying President Barack Obama had negotiated a bad deal. But he has since given no public indication that he intends to follow through on his vow to abrogate it.The embassy of Luxembourg in Washington also did not respond to a request for comment.Complicating matters, the lawsuit that resulted in the default judgment did not stem from one of the attacks by Shiite terrorists that specialists generally agree were sponsored by Iran. Instead, it was brought by victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by Al Qaeda, the Sunni terrorist group.That judgment stagnated for years because there was no obvious way to collect it. But then it came to light that the Clearstream system in Luxembourg, which facilitates international exchanges of securities, was holding $1.6 billion in Iranian central bank assets that had been blocked under sanctions.Last year, lawyers for the Sept. 11 victims persuaded a judge in Luxembourg to place a new freeze on those assets while they sued over whether they could execute the default judgment against those funds, the letter said. Both Clearstream and the Iranian central bank, Markazi, are now trying to get that freeze lifted.\u201cThe Iran nuclear deal does not include terrorism issues or resolve outstanding legal claims, so you can support that deal and also support the enforcement of lawful, final judgments entered by the federal courts wherever Iranian assets are found,\u201d Mr. Wolosky said. \u201cAnd that is exactly what we are aggressively pursuing.\u201dIran \u201cwill certainly try to get these assets unfrozen so they aren\u2019t put at risk, but I don\u2019t see them walking away from the deal, even though this is a very novel, very creative use of the legal system to try to get these judgments enforced,\u201d he said.The case joins the growing log of lawsuits that try to assign blame for terrorist ties.Advertisement"}

She has had weekly visits with her staff and has tried to carry on her Senate business, but she cannot vote on bills because she cannot be present on the Senate floor.She passes the time by reading. Her desk is stacked with paperback novels and books on politics. She takes walks in the courtyard, where there is a broken basketball hoop.And she cries.\u201cWhen I am about to sleep, that\u2019s the worst time for me,\u201d she said in an interview in her cell this week. \u201cThat\u2019s when emotions creep in. I think about my family. I think about my home. I think about my own bed in my comfortable room.\u201dAt dusk, after the visitors are shooed out, the staff is gone for the night and she is locked in her cell, her only company is a stray cat that wanders the compound.Still, she has no regrets, she says, \u201cbecause I have done nothing wrong.\u201dShe added, \u201cI am innocent, and this is political persecution, plain and simple.\u201dSince then, as chairwoman of the Senate Justice Committee, she has investigated Mr. Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign, in which thousands of suspects have been killed by the police and vigilantes.Mr. Duterte did not respond to the accusations but immediately assailed Ms. de Lima, accusing her of having an affair with her driver, of making a sex tape that he claimed to have watched, and of taking millions of dollars in cash from convicted drug traffickers to finance her senatorial campaign.The senator says her lawyers are arguing an appeal before the Supreme Court, and she hopes to be freed by April, in time to celebrate Easter with her family.Until then, this steaming cell is her home office.During the visit on Thursday, the senator, known for her sartorial taste and collection of colorful scarves, was trying to keep cool in a short-sleeved print blouse and black shorts.As she sat at her desk, a small fan whirring in the background, sweat formed on her brow.\u201cUnsatisfied with the fact that he was already able to imprison me,\u201d she wrote with a blue felt-tip across her Senate stationery, \u201che continues to destroy me before various audiences like a market fishwife and leaves no dignity whatsoever to the office he holds.

But it has been hard, especially for Vincent, who is a law student, she said without elaborating.Every week, her favorite among her 13 pet dogs is also brought in for a visit, a concession granted by her jailers.\u201cThese visits lift my spirits, because as you can see, I am isolated,\u201d she said.She is also afraid.\u201cThat can happen to me as well,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the realm of possibilities, that can happen.\u201d\u201cIf I die inside Duterte\u2019s prisons, it is not because I committed suicide,\u201d she said then, \u201cbut it is because the president has finally ordered me killed.

{"Headline": "Paul Farmer: Humans Aren\u2019t Winning the War on TB", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "For decades there were few developments in the fight against tuberculosis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least by humans. The bacteria that causes this airborne disease, in contrast, regularly boasts a number of deadly new upgrades, including mutations conferring resistance to almost all antibiotics developed to cure it. It has also made common cause with new allies (AIDS, weak health systems and budget cuts further sapping them) while maintaining its longstanding alliances with war, hunger, overcrowded and poorly ventilated housing, prisons, and workplaces.One of TB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lamentable champions is a common strain of\u00c2\u00a0public-health expertise, which has long lowballed what it takes to cure tuberculosis and halt transmission of increasingly resistant strains of it. A host of ill-conceived and unambitious policies have all but ignored TB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovations.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why humans aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t winning the war against TB, which last year killed 1.8 million people, regaining its old title as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading infectious killer of adults.Happy World TB Day.The arguments marshaled to explain why we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother treating tuberculosis were numerous: therapy was costly, toxic, involved painful daily injections, and people would never submit to it for two years. The first three of these observations were true. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like there was an effective alternative to such treatment, which is why the fourth one was not. In any case, it was the amateur math in fashion in the mid-90s that doomed many afflicted humans to an early death, even as they spread the disease to their families: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment was not, in the gravest of insults in the public-health lexicon, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccost-effective in resource-poor settings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These patients were, in other words, too poor to treat.Since these squabbles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even when registered in glittering conference centers in Paris, Geneva, or Cape Town \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were about the fates of the destitute sick, most humans, even those with medical training, never heard them. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to think that if they had, the broader community of humans would think such arguments foolish in the face of an airborne, deadly and treatable disease. If the army of drug-resistant bacilli could speak, its commanders would surely reassure foot soldiers and friends that the humans will continue to invest too little in fighting back as long as TB disproportionately affects the poor and marginalized. Its intelligence agency might even predict a microbial victory\u00c2\u00a0if U.S. contributions to the fight against tuberculosis, AIDS, and malaria are cut.Finally, however, we may be able to chalk one up for our species.

Although the humans have gained territory with new diagnostics that speed up the glacial pace of identifying mutant strains so that patients might benefit from the new drugs, these rapid tests are based on decades-old discoveries. As with the new drugs, their commercial development was delayed since the potential beneficiaries were too poor to treat.

{"Headline": "The Next Battle in the War Over Planned Parenthood", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byWomen TodayWASHINGTON \u2014 Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, was poring over a spiral notebook in her bare-bones office here when she was asked about President Trump\u2019s latest attempt to cut a deal on abortion.Days earlier, the Trump White House had floated a trial balloon: If Planned Parenthood would quit performing abortions, it could keep roughly $550 million in annual federal funding.Ms. Richards, 59, a savvy former political organizer (and a daughter of former Gov. Ann Richards, the tough-talking Texas Democrat) scowled, wondering aloud if the proposal was even serious. \u201cThat is just not going to happen,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cWe would never abandon the women who count on us in exchange for cash.\u201dBut while Ms. Richards stands at the forefront of efforts to protect access to abortion, another politically savvy woman, Marjorie Dannenfelser, who helped elect Mr. Trump and is a longtime ally of Vice President Mike Pence, is just as ardently on the other side, pushing hard to prevent Planned Parenthood from getting a single penny from taxpayers.This week, she had reason to celebrate: Mr. Pence cast the tiebreaking vote when the Senate rolled back an Obama administration rule barring states from denying family planning grants to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. The bill will now go to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk.Days after their January inaugural, Mr. Pence hosted a cheese-and-crackers reception for movement leaders in his ceremonial office \u2014 an event Ms. Dannenfelser described as a homecoming.\u201cCecile Richards was in the White House all the time during the Obama administration,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn.\u201dThese are challenging times for Planned Parenthood, the reproductive rights behemoth known to millions of American women as the place to turn for cancer screening, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control \u2014 and yes, abortion. A century after its founder, the pioneering sex educator Margaret Sanger, committed the radical act of opening a birth control clinic in Brooklyn \u2014 only to have it shut down by the police \u2014 Planned Parenthood had expected to mark its centennial with a big gala in May and Hillary Clinton in the White House.Instead, Mr. Trump\u2019s election has given new life to the abortion wars in Washington, and thrust Ms. Richards \u2014 and women, many of them poor, across America who rely on Planned Parenthood for basic health care \u2014 into a pitched battle with the president. Mr. Trump lost badly in the first round, when the Republican effort to replace the Affordable Care Act fell apart last month on Capitol Hill. The measure would have barred Medicaid dollars, for one year, from going to any family planning center that provides abortions.There is only one group that fits that description: Planned Parenthood.\u201cThe goal here is they want to end access to safe and legal abortion in America,\u201d Ms. Richards said, \u201cand the way they do that is by going after Planned Parenthood.\u201dThe health measure would have been far more damaging to Planned Parenthood than the one the Senate just passed and in the weeks leading up to the vote, Ms. Richards led a massive effort to defeat it.Planned Parenthood says its supporters made 122,000 phone calls to members of Congress and organized more than 1,000 events around the nation, including rallies, petitions, phone banks and marches, carefully targeted to Republican moderates. On the day of the vote, 75 supporters showed up at the Northern Virginia offices of Representative Barbara Comstock, a Virginia Republican. A half-hour later, she announced that she would oppose the health bill.Ms. Richards also traveled the country visiting clinics, including in Wisconsin, the home state of the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, the chief architect of the health measure. (There are three Planned Parenthood clinics in his district alone.) Hundreds of women, dressed in pink, turned out for a rally in Milwaukee, where Ms. Richards instructed them to deliver a pointed message to the speaker:\u201cYou need to let him know that people in Wisconsin deserve the same ability to choose their doctors as he and every member of Congress have.\u201dAbortions are only a small part of Planned Parenthood\u2019s business, and Medicaid does not pay for them. The federal Hyde Amendment bars tax dollars from financing abortions except in cases of incest, rape or when the health of the mother is at risk. But for Planned Parenthood, which receives roughly 43 percent of its $1.3 billion in annual revenue from the federal government, the loss of Medicaid dollars could be crippling. There is no question that clinics would be forced to close as a result.With more than 650 health centers around the country \u2014 in every state except North Dakota \u2014 Planned Parenthood sees about 2.5 million patients a year, roughly 1.6 million of them through Medicaid, according to Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, its chief medical officer. Screening for sexually transmitted infections is the No. 1 reason patients visit, and birth control is also high on the list.The anti-abortion movement has set its sights on Planned Parenthood for years \u2014 at least since 2007, when Mr. Pence, then an Indiana congressman, introduced the first measure to defund the organization. (\u201cWe are truly fellow travelers,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Dannenfelser said of the vice president.) His bill went nowhere, but the idea quickly gained traction inside the anti-abortion movement, said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, which organizes abortion opponents on college campuses.In 2012, Ms. Hawkins said, her group commissioned Kellyanne Conway, the pollster who is now a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, to research abortion opponents\u2019 attitudes toward Planned Parenthood. \u201cWe had all these people who said they were pro-life, who didn\u2019t know what Planned Parenthood was, and didn\u2019t know they committed abortions,\u201d she said.Ms. Hawkins set out to change that, and by 2013, her group was touring college campuses, carrying pink banners and 888 pink crosses to represent the number of abortions performed each day by Planned Parenthood. (The number is derived from Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual report; its clinics performed just under 324,000 abortions last year; abortions account for just 3 percent of the medical services the group provides.)Then, in 2015, undercover anti-abortion activists released a series of graphic videos purportedly showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal body parts \u2014 a move that spurred the Republican leadership in the Senate to push a defunding measure. (Last week, California prosecutors charged two of the undercover activists with 15 felonies, saying that they had invaded the privacy of medical providers while misrepresenting themselves as they sought to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood.)The videos were a turning point, said Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican and a staunch abortion opponent. He said constituents did not want their money going to any group that performs abortions.\u201cThere is a firm belief by many, myself included, that would say ending a life is not health care,\u2019\u2019 he said.The bill passed, but was vetoed by President Barack Obama. With Mr. Trump in the White House, \u201cthe threat is very real and there\u2019s no one to veto this,\u201d said Anita Dunn, Mr. Obama\u2019s former communications director, whose strategy firm now consults for Planned Parenthood.Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka is said to be a strong supporter of the organization, which is one reason the Trump White House may have floated the possible deal. Ms. Richards said no one from the White House approached her directly with the proposal, and there was never any serious debate about whether to accept it.Mr. Trump has his own statements to contend with. During the campaign, he broke with fellow Republicans in sounding supportive of Planned Parenthood.\u201cI would defund it because I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a debate on CNN in February 2016, \u201cbut millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.\u201dMs. Richards is soldiering on. She was asked what her mother, whose lacerating one-liners made her a feminist icon in her day, might say. \u201cI think the main thing she would say is, \u2018Quit whining and get back to work. This is not a time to wring your hands.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of abortions performed by Planned Parenthood clinics last year. It was 324,000 not 234,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reading, Math and Sushi: Cooking as a Health Lesson", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byOn a recent Tuesday, the airy rooftop greenhouse at P.S. 333 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan was a hive of purposeful activity as students massaged olive oil into kale and ground spices for a salad they were preparing to serve at lunch.\u201cCould we spread this out and make it look edible,\u201d Yadira Garcia urged, as the children drizzled balsamic dressing over a mass of spiralized zucchini and garnished the tray with cherry tomatoes plucked from a sprawling vine growing a few feet away.Ms. Garcia, a graduate of the Natural Gourmet Institute in Manhattan, is one of a growing number of professional chefs assigned to the city\u2019s schools. As part of a program called Wellness in the Schools (WITS), she is spending three years at P.S. 333, teaching cooking and nutrition classes to children and organizing educational events for their parents after school hours.The program, which aims to teach public school students about healthful eating and fitness, partners with chefs like Ms. Garcia and Bill Telepan of the restaurant Oceana to develop nutritious recipes children are excited about trying. It\u2019s a modern take on the home ec class. The goal is not to try to make kids eat food that they won\u2019t like but to make things they already like healthier, and to instill an interest in cooking fresh, healthy food that carries over to the way the children eat at home.\u201cSchools are examples for reading, writing and arithmetic, examples for how to behave,\u201d Ms. Easton said. \u201cThey need to become examples for healthy living.\u201dWITS, which is based in Harlem, prioritizes working in underprivileged neighborhoods. The program is financed through grants and private donations. Schools contribute part of the cost from their supplementary budget on a sliding scale calibrated to the income level of the students\u2019 families.Claire Lowenstein, the principal at P.S. 333, says the WITS program has been an excellent investment. \u201cMore of our students are eating the school lunch and fewer are bringing their food from home than ever before,\u201d she said.Gone is the usual kid-bait like fried mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers. In their place are a daily salad bar, wraps and main dishes like the Caribbean specialty chicken guisado and vegetarian dumplings, created whenever possible with unprocessed, seasonal and locally farmed ingredients.Judging from the children\u2019s plates in the lunchroom heaped with salad and bowls of vegetarian chili, the healthy new fare is a success.\u201cIt\u2019s insane how much they love salads,\u201d said Mr. Telepan, who was at the school recently to help with the meal for a wellness event. \u201cIt is a known fact that it takes kids between eight and 15 times of trying something before they like it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt can take adults 30 times.\u201dMr. Telepan, who joined the WITS team in 2008, recalled how students at a school in the Bronx took instantly to the celery root soup and baked rutabaga fries with cranberry relish he cooked for them, although none had ever tried these vegetables before.\u201cYou\u2019ll rarely find a kid who won\u2019t eat something that they themselves have made,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. \u201cThey turn into the best salespeople. They are like \u2018you\u2019ve got to try this,\u2019 with their friends. It\u2019s contagious!\u201d Kale chips were a recent hit, and so was the black bean brownie, in which beans, oats and honey stand in for flour and processed sugar. \u201cSounds kind of gross,\u201d one of the young salad makers said, but it turned out to be creamy and delicious.Like other WITS chefs, Ms. Garcia helps train the kitchen workers to prepare healthy food. That can be a challenge. Many school kitchens are lacking in even basic equipment, and cafeteria staff members are not accustomed to cooking from scratch with fresh ingredients. There are also financial constraints: Nutritious meals can be hard to create on food budgets that can be as low as a dollar a day per student served.Some argue that processed foods offers inexpensive calories, and that the fresh fruits and vegetables championed by WITS are beyond the budget of many low-income families. Ms. Garcia acknowledges that quality ingredients don\u2019t always come cheaply. But she points to initiatives like the city\u2019s Health Bucks program which helps home cooks stretch food stamp dollars by paying bonuses for healthy purchases.Ultimately, she said, \u201cwe either pay the farmer or the pharmacist.\u201d In the neighborhood of the South Bronx where Ms. Garcia grew up, there were high rates of preventable and reversible diseases like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes \u2014 all illnesses that research links to poor diet. Her own parents have cardiovascular conditions that she attributes to their diets.While adults like to talk about the health benefits of eating well, for the kids the reason is often simply that it tastes great.Ike Shaw, age 10, tried vegetable sushi for the first time in Ms. Garcia\u2019s food lab and became a big fan. He now makes it for his family at least twice a month.\u201cI was like, how can something be so healthy and so good at the same time,\u201d Ike said as he chopped carrots, cucumbers and orange bell peppers in his family kitchen together with his 11-year-old sister, Sai.She has introduced the family to new salad dressings and soups, which she also learned to make at the food lab. Their mother, Amy Shaw, a lawyer, says that whatever they try in Ms. Garcia\u2019s class, they insist on recreating at home \u2014 and she stays out of the kitchen.Ms. Shaw admits that she is not much of a cook, but says her children\u2019s enthusiasm has been infectious. Cooking is now a family affair that has brought them closer. \u201cI love that they are so passionate about it,\u201d Ms. Shaw said. \u201cSeeing how confident they are around cooking helps me relax around it too.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Fudgey Black Bean Browniesby Chef Yadira Garcia, adapted from Natural Gourmet InstituteIngredients1\u00bd cups black beans (1 15-oz. can, drained and rinsed very well)2 tablespoons cocoa powder\u00bd cup quick oats\u00bc teaspoon salt\u2153 cup pure maple syrup or honey\u00bd tablespoon stevia\u00bc cup coconut oil, at room temperature (liquid)2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\u00bd teaspoon baking powder\u00bd cup to \u2154 cup organic semisweet chocolate chips (more if desired)PreparationAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Czech Astronaut\u2019s Earthly Troubles Come Along for the Ride", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In December 1972, as Apollo 17 flew toward the moon, one of the astronauts (no one seems to remember who) picked up one of the mission\u2019s 70-millimeter Hasselblad cameras and took the first-ever complete photograph of the Earth. The so-called blue marble picture became possibly the most widely distributed image in history. It is credited with a profound shift in global environmental consciousness, the view of Earth against the absolute darkness of space giving a simple form to our sense of the planet\u2019s beauty and fragility, and our absolute dependence on its ecology.The same era, the golden age of manned spaceflight, also saw a cultural preoccupation with the extraordinary psychological situation of the astronaut. What did it feel like to find yourself outside Earth\u2019s life support system, far from the fellowship of other humans? The flip side of the profound loneliness of space is the tantalizing possibility that by transcending physical boundaries, spiritual forms of transcendence will follow. Figures like David Bowie\u2019s Major Tom, the spaceman who refuses to come back to Earth in the song \u201cSpace Oddity,\u201d and Bowman, the astronaut in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d who is pulled by the alien monolith across vast reaches of space and time, are only the most prominent representatives of a genre that, judging by the success of recent Hollywood movies like \u201cGravity\u201d and \u201cThe Martian,\u201d retains its enduring fascination. The lonely astronaut can be a modern Robinson Crusoe, a white-knuckled survivalist, an existential freak and seer. For J.G. Ballard, who used the morbid figure of a dead astronaut orbiting the Earth in several short stories, the corpses become monuments, Ozymandias-like ruins that condemn the spiritual and intellectual failure of the military-industrial space program.Jakub Prochazka, the Czech hero of Jaroslav Kalfar\u2019s zany first novel, \u201cSpaceman of Bohemia,\u201d is an astronaut who has left a lot of baggage back on Earth. He is the shining hope of an entire nation, the biggest celebrity in his home country, so excruciatingly aware that his endeavor \u201cwill carry the soul of the republic to the stars\u201d that he refuses water before liftoff lest he should inadvertently urinate and \u201cthe purity of my mission\u201d become \u201cstained by such an undignified gesture.\u201dThe reason the Czech Republic is launching a manned spacecraft is the arrival of a strange comet that has \u201cswept our solar system with a sandstorm of intergalactic cosmic dust.\u201d A cloud, named Chopra by its Indian discoverers, now floats between Earth and Venus, turning the night sky purple. Unmanned probes sent out to take samples have returned mysteriously empty. Likewise a German chimpanzee has returned to Earth with no information save the evidence that survival is possible. The Americans, the Russians and the Chinese show no sign of wishing to risk their citizens, so the Czechs have stepped up, with a rocket named for the Protestant reformer and national hero Jan Hus. At many points in the novel, Kalfar sketches key moments in Czech history, and the very premise of a Czech space mission is clearly a satire on the nationalist pretensions of a small post-Communist nation. Financed by local corporations whose branding is placed on his equipment, Jakub is the epitome of the scrappy underdog, grasping for fame by doing something too crazy or dangerous for the major players.Back on Earth he has left his wife, Lenka, and as the novel opens it is clear that their marriage is in trouble. Jakub feels guilty that on his last morning on Earth, he refused the breakfast she cooked; now he worries that this \u201cviolation of a ritual\u201d is at the root of the \u201clong silences and lack of humor\u201d that have begun to cloud his video chats with her.Thirteen weeks alone in space give Jakub plenty of time to think, and to fret about his mental health. He begins to hear scuttling noises on board the ship and fears that despite all other indications, he is losing his mind. In one of the most eyebrow-raising devices in a book not afraid of bold contrivances, he finds himself face to face with a spiderlike alien, a creature with many eyes, triple-jointed legs and \u201ca set of thick human lips, startlingly red, lipstick red, and .\u2008.\u2008. a set of yellowing teeth which resembled those of an average human smoker.\u201d The arachnid with the red lips has the ability to sift through Jakub\u2019s memories and speaks in the stilted, over-formal register that has long been traditional to aliens. A wife is a \u201cfemale partner,\u201d eggs are \u201cova of the avian kind.\u201d The creature has \u201cdiscovered from your fictional television programming about soap that your species does not always utilize sexual intercourse solely for breeding.\u201d As will be clear from these examples, this isn\u2019t science fiction like, say, Ted Chiang\u2019s \u201cStory of Your Life\u201d (the basis for the film \u201cArrival\u201d), in which the writer pays scrupulous attention to xenolinguistics or rocket propulsion or the other nuts and bolts of a hypothetical world. Instead, the space mission, the alien and all the rest of the book\u2019s extravagant conceptual furniture are merely metaphors for the human-scale issues that are its real concerns, in particular the collapse of Jakub\u2019s marriage to Lenka.That\u2019s not to say Kalfar hasn\u2019t done his research. There are lovingly detailed passages on the mechanics of going to the toilet and cleaning your teeth in orbit, the dangers of muscle wastage and other minutiae of life in zero gravity, but all the whizzy space business is harnessed to the basic question of what it means to leave and whether it\u2019s possible to come back. The alien acts as a Proustian trigger for Jakub\u2019s memories, \u201cbringing about thoughts without my consent.\u201d We discover there are things in the past he needs to repress. Jakub\u2019s father was a devoted Communist, who worked as a secret policeman and tortured dissidents for the state. In the post-Communist era the family are among the losers, and Jakub\u2019s mission is, among other things, atonement for his father\u2019s crimes. Kalfar\u2019s satire of Czech Communism treads familiar territory (Jakub\u2019s rocket takes off from a \u201cstate-owned potato field,\u201d while TV actresses are \u201creplete with the look of strong femininity and fierce dedication to the Party\u201d), which, being retrospective, lacks the urgency that this kind of writing used to have before the Velvet Revolution. But for all the strangeness of outer space, it is the writing about his home village, the place to which he longs to return and perhaps never can, that beats strongest in this wry, melancholy book.Hari Kunzru\u2019s new novel, \u201cWhite Tears,\u201d has just been published.Advertisement"}

Caesar is scheduled to go to the White House this week to urge President Trump\u2019s advisers to follow through on a pledge to establish safe zones in Syria and take other steps to assist the Syrian opposition.\u201cWe are hopeful that President Trump will do what President Obama refused to do,\u201d Sami said. \u201cI do not believe the time is too late.\u201dThe two defectors, who live in an undisclosed location abroad, made their case on Monday to small group of human rights experts and reporters in a private meeting at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and in a brief interview afterward. Neither photographs nor recordings of the session were allowed, to help protect their identity. They and their extended family are presumed to be at risk from the Syrian government and its agents.Caesar has supporters in Congress, but whether he will be able to make inroads with the Trump administration is far from clear. The defectors spoke Monday with Michael Ratney, who has served as the United States\u2019 envoy on the Syria crisis, and they are scheduled to meet this week with senior aides at the National Security Council.But no meeting has been set with Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, or with the top echelons of the State Department or Pentagon.In a retrospective moment, the two defectors said they did not regret taking enormous risks to spirit the photos out of Syria \u2014 even though they had discovered that the international community was better at expressing outrage than agreeing on measures to quell the fighting and to press for a more inclusive government that did not include Mr. Assad.For years, Caesar explained, his duties as a police photographer required him to document bodies that were often battered beyond recognition, a gruesome procedure mandated by the Syrian government. Determined to expose the torture and killing to the world, he smuggled thumb drives with the digital photos in his shoes and socks as he passed through government checkpoints.Nor was the government the only worry, he said. For a while, the opposition Free Syrian Army had controlled much of his neighborhood, and Caesar had been afraid that he would be in danger if the rebels found out he worked for the police. He handled that risk by making a fake civilian ID.By the end of 2013, he said, he had enough photos to document the murder and torture of more than 11,000 people and was ready to flee and make the evidence known. Caesar said his greatest worry was that the government would retaliate against his extended family.\u201cMy life is not more valuable than the many who are being killed inside the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI died a hundred times a day. Looking at those bodies broke my heart.\u201dNavigating American policy on Syria has not been easy for the two defectors. While Mr. Obama declared that the Assad regime had lost the legitimacy to lead the nation and authorized a covert program to assist Syrian rebels, he was reluctant to take more direct action to compel the Syrian president to hand over power.The Trump administration has neither spoken out forcefully on the Syria crisis nor promised fresh action, beyond a pledge to establish safe zones to try to stem the flow of Syrian refugees.Mr. Trump indicated during the campaign that he has little interest in confronting Mr. Assad and has flirted with the idea of partnering with Russia, one of the Syrian government\u2019s main backers, to press the military campaign against the Islamic State. At the same time, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to establish safe zones has given the defectors something of an opening.Establishing safe zones in the northern and southern parts of the country would do much to mitigate the suffering of the Syrians who oppose Mr. Assad, Sami said.American lawmakers, meanwhile, have been promoting legislation that would impose sanctions on anyone who provides financing or does business with the Assad government, which has also given the defectors a measure of hope. The legislation also calls for an assessment of how to set up safe zones or no-fly zones, and for an investigation of war crimes.\u201cThe United States does not need to send troops,\u201d Sami said. \u201cIt could sanction the Central Bank of Syria.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in recent months, an unexpected worry has emerged: the influence of American money.By American standards, the amount is a pittance. But to some Dutch, who are already fearful of possible Russian meddling in the election, the American involvement is an assault on national sovereignty.\u201cIt\u2019s foreign interference in our democracy,\u201d said Ronald van Raak, a senior member of Parliament in the opposition Socialist party, who has co-sponsored legislation to ban foreign donations. \u201cWe would not have thought that people from other countries would have been interested in our politics,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we underestimated ourselves.\u201dBut sympathy for Europe\u2019s far right is also coming from Americans who share similar views and are willing to contribute money to help the cause. Measuring this outside support is difficult, though, because many European countries have leaky, opaque accountability systems on campaign finance.France, Germany and the Netherlands have only published campaign finance data from as recently as 2014 or 2015. And only the Netherlands will update that information with more disclosures before Election Day. New campaign finance data is expected to be released on Wednesday.\u201cIt\u2019s illegal but basically done everywhere\u201d in Germany, said Christoph M\u00f6llers, a professor of public law and legal philosophy at Humboldt University of Berlin.While France bars contributions from businesses, loans are allowed. A Russian bank made headlines in recent years after lending millions of euros to the far-right National Front party of Marine Le Pen. After that bank failed last year, the party complained that it had been shunned by French banks and declared itself in the market for a new lender.If nothing else, European far-right parties are gaining newly emboldened allies.\u201cI expect the Trump administration to be more open to these parties than Obama, certainly,\u201d said Representative Steve King, an Iowa Republican who is an ally both of President Trump and the European far right, having met with various party leaders during a recent European trip.The State Department, in a statement, declined \u201cto comment on political parties in foreign elections.\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s the Paul Revere of Europe,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said in an interview. \u201cGeert Wilders is a hero, and I think he\u2019s a hero of the most important battle of our times, the battle to defend free speech,\u201d he added, calling the situation in Europe a \u201cnightmare.\u201dOrganized as a 501(c)(3) under American tax law, Mr. Horowitz\u2019s foundation is barred from making donations to political organizations. The donations went to the Friends of PVV, according to Dutch records, a foundation covered by political disclosure rules.Michael Finch, the president of Mr. Horowitz\u2019s foundation, said in an email that \u201cthe funds that were sent to Geert Wilders were to help him in his legal cases\u201d and \u201cwere not political donations.\u201dBut donations to foreign political entities are problematic, tax experts said.\u201cThe I.R.S. views foreign political organizations as the same as domestic political organizations \u2014 not appropriate for a charity to support,\u201d said Marcus S. Owens, a partner at Loeb & Loeb, and former director of the Exempt Organizations Division of the Internal Revenue Service, in an email. He added, \u201cThe I.R.S. also views a charity that is controlled by a political organization as transgressing federal tax rules.\u201dMr. Horowitz said he was not certain if the foundation had given additional funds to Mr. Wilders\u2019s party this year or last year.Mr. Wilders\u2019s backing of Israel, where he once lived, has set him apart from other far-right groups, and he has courted American Jews. Daniel Pipes, another conservative American activist and a Harvard-educated historian known for his controversial statements on Islam, said in an email exchange that he hoped \u201cthe rise of the insurgent parties leads not to their forming governments but their sending a strong message to the legacy parties to wake up and deal with the imperative issues they have so long ignored.\u201dLawmakers and academics say the European public has seen little need for tight campaign finance regulations because political campaigning in Europe has historically been far more restrained than in the United States.\u201cThe campaigns don\u2019t seem to be that relevant,\u201d Mr. Mollers said. \u201cYou see campaign finance is spent for posters, and no one believes that changes the game.\u201dNow, however, European political campaigns could become more expensive as parties turn to data-driven persuasion efforts similar to those used in the United States, even if they are limited by European data-protection laws. The Dutch Green Party, for instance, has licensed software from Blue State Digital, a prominent American data consultancy.\u201cThe idea of using data and technology has since then become more of a standard in today\u2019s European campaigns,\u201d he said in an email. He now consults for the campaign of Emmanuel Macron, a left-leaning politician who is one of the front-runners in the French presidential race, which takes place in two stages in April and May.Few dispute the stakes. Mr. Wilders and Ms. Le Pen, the French far-right leader, are running strong in polls, though both are considered long shots to win control of their governments. If either did win, it could be a devastating blow to the euro currency union, as well as the European Union itself, an outcome that many analysts regard as a foreign policy disaster.Mr. Horowitz disagrees, and portrays the European Union as the disaster.\u201cTo have this Parliament that represents nobody in Brussels making laws for everybody, it\u2019s very anti-democratic,\u201d said Mr. Horowitz. \u201cI always thought it was a bad idea.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the entity that David Horowitz referred to as a \u201csick death cult.\u201d He was referring to Hamas, the militant Palestinian organization, not Islam.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and Palko Karasz contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid \u2018Trump Effect\u2019 Fear, 40% of Colleges See Dip in Foreign Applicants", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byThe president of Portland State University, Wim Wiewel, met last week with 10 prospective students in Hyderabad, India. But what started as a get-acquainted visit quickly turned into more of a counseling session, as the students expressed fears about coming to the United States this fall.One student, who is Muslim, said his father was worried that America had an anti-Muslim attitude, Mr. Wiewel recounted. \u201cSeveral others said they were concerned about the \u2018Trump effect,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.\u201cI\u2019d say the rhetoric and actual executive orders are definitely having a chilling effect,\u201d Mr. Wiewel wrote, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban.Like many universities across the country, the Oregon university is getting fewer international applications.Many officials cited worries among prospective students about Trump administration immigration policies. \u201cInternational student recruitment professionals report a great deal of concern from students all over the globe,\u201d the study said.Graduate schools appear to be feeling the worst pinch, with nearly half reporting drops. \u201cOur deans describe it as a chilling effect,\u201d said Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools.Still, despite the steady increase, the movement of students from one country to another is sensitive to fluctuations tied to political and economic forces. So some officials cautioned that a \u201cTrump effect\u2019 is just one possible explanation for this year\u2019s application figures. Beyond that, many schools, including New York University, the University of Southern California and Northeastern University, reported that their international numbers are up. Purdue University reported a 1.2 percent decline in graduate school applications.For several graduate schools, the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, which initially affected seven predominantly Muslim countries, could not have been more poorly timed. It was announced in late January as deadlines loomed for applications to some graduate programs, and it came on the heels of Mr. Trump\u2019s virulently anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign.Slumping graduate school applications can now be seen at universities ranging from giant Big Ten public universities like Ohio State and Indiana University to regional programs such as Portland State, with just over 27,000 students, including more than 1,900 international students.At Indiana University, international applications for undergraduate programs increased 6 percent, but graduate applications for some programs are posting big drops, said David Zaret, vice president for international affairs.Mr. Zaret said international applications to the masters program in business were down 20 percent, and down 30 percent in both the master of law program and at the School of Informatics and Computing. The university will not have problems filling the programs, but the drop might affect the overall quality of the applicant pool, he said.Ohio State has also seen an increase in international undergraduate applications but a significant overall drop \u2014 8.4 percent \u2014 in international applicants to its graduate programs, a university spokesman, Chris Davey, said. The biggest decline was among students from China \u2014 a fact Mr. Davey said did not support the \u201cTrump effect\u201d theory. In 2016, he said, there were 2,412 graduate applications from China; this year the number was down to 1,952.\u201cWe\u2019re inclined to say that the overarching factors that might be influencing this are probably global economic factors and it would be premature to conclude that it\u2019s the travel ban,\u201d Mr. Davey said. \u201cBut it certainly could be.\u201dBecause application deadlines at several larger colleges had passed before Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban was announced, some universities are more worried about the \u201cyield\u201d \u2014 the number of students offered admission who end up enrolling, said Frances Leslie, vice provost for the graduate division at the University of California, Irvine.Applications at Irvine are not down, but students have expressed concerned about coming to the United States, Ms. Leslie said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from students, even beyond the seven countries, expressing concern,\u201d Ms. Leslie said, referring to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, which were singled out in the first travel ban. \u201cThis year, even when students are admitted, they may not be willing to accept the offers.\u201dThe university will not have those numbers until April 15, a national deadline for students to make a decision.At Portland State, where undergraduate international applications are up 4 percent but international graduate applications are down 15 percent, the vice provost for international affairs, Margaret Everett, said she had heard recently from a Chinese student who canceled his application, citing the political climate.\u201cObviously we\u2019re concerned about the climate and the rhetoric and the administration policies and travel ban,\u201d Ms. Everett said.Advertisement"}

The defenders of the train are getting the worst of it until an armed man arrives on the scene and fires a warning shot into the air, scattering the attackers.Tensions are rising along the border between Ukraine and the breakaway \u201crepublics\u201d in the eastern part of the country as Ukrainian nationalists from the western part seek to choke off all railroad traffic in what they are calling a blockade.The war in eastern Ukraine, now entering its third year, has been the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. Despite the continuing clashes, however, the lucrative cross-border coal trade has been peculiarly unaffected.The blockaders, as they call themselves, are a relatively new movement but are already becoming relevant to the delicate politics of peace in Ukraine, seemingly a focus of the Trump administration as it seeks to establish warmer ties with Russia. Their primary goal is to cut off the trains carrying coal from the east that powers industry in the west but also is a major source of income for the Russian-backed eastern republics.The idea, which has animated Ukrainian nationalist circles, is to force the financing of the breakaway regions and their three million or so inhabitants onto Russia\u2019s already weak economy by breaking ties with Ukraine\u2019s industrial base.\u201cPutin wants us to finance the war he started,\u201d Volodymyr Parasiuk, a member of Parliament and one of the movement\u2019s leaders, said in a telephone interview, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cHe wants the republics to finance themselves, by selling coal.\u201dThe government in Kiev says that the country \u2014 western as well as eastern parts \u2014 depends on the coal trade for hundreds of thousands of jobs, as well as heat and electrical power.Already the blockaders have forced a mine and a steel plant in the separatist region to shut down. And economists say half a million jobs and a total of $3.5 billion in revenue from steel exports depend on the coal trains. Some of that money ends up in the coffers of the breakaway regions.The blockaders say the club-wielding men in the video were thugs hired by the coal industry. Three people were wounded, including one man who suffered a broken leg. Ukrainian government police arrested 37 people, mostly the hired thugs.It is unclear how many people are involved in the blockade effort. The groups of mostly war veterans are not formally affiliated with any political parties or the government. For a month now, usually armed with hunting rifles and clubs, they have blocked railroad tracks that cross the de facto border into the pro-Russian areas, warming themselves by campfires and shooing away the police.In their camps along the railway tracks, they wear smudged camouflage and tattered winter coats, like hobos with a geopolitical agenda. At one spot, the men have welded the wheels of a coal train to the tracks, locking it in place and, naturally, preventing other trains from passing.In a remarkable example of big business emerging unscathed from the war, the companies of Rinat Akhmetov, a coal and steel tycoon who is Ukraine\u2019s richest man, have managed to move goods over the border in both directions, without interference from either army. Bloomberg recently estimated Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s net worth at $3.6 billion.A spokesman for Mr. Akhmetov emphasized the trade was legal and kept people on both sides employed. \u201cWe believe that private property is sovereign,\u201d Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s company, SCM Group, said in a statement Thursday.On Wednesday, the Ukrainian cabinet tried to defuse the crisis with a decree limiting trade with the enemy to food, medicine and other humanitarian goods, but also coal, recognizing that it is essential for Ukrainian industry.And the movement seems to be picking up political support in Kiev. Aliona I. Shkrum, a member of Parliament with the opposition Fatherland party, said the blockade does not violate international law, in contrast to sieges enforced by the Syrian government against rebel areas there, so long as food and medicine are allowed through, as they are now.Many of these activists already rue the compromises that the government of President Petro O. Poroshenko, who replaced Mr. Yanukovych, agreed to with Moscow in earlier peace deals, particularly what they see as a commitment to reintegrate the region politically and economically and stage elections before Russian troops leave.Any potential peace deal with the Trump administration seen as favoring Russia will only aggravate these tensions, inciting more rebellion among a hardened group of protesters.\u201cUkrainians have an idealistic idea of resistance,\u201d said Mr. Parasiuk, the member of Parliament who is supporting the blockaders.Advertisement"}

On Staten Island, voters sent Debi Rose to the City Council, making her the first African-American elected public official from that borough.Who could have guessed that a single City Council race would turn into an elephantine criminal inquiry that dragged on for years, at enormous cost, to absolutely no point whatsoever?Next week, the extraordinary prosecution of two men who worked on that campaign nearly eight years ago is likely to come to an end.A private lawyer, Roger Bennet Adler, who was appointed in 2012 by the Office of Court Administration to serve as a special prosecutor investigating the campaign, has announced his intention to dismiss all charges in the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d and because he doesn\u2019t have proof that the men, David G. Thomas and David Jones, did anything wrong.There will be no trial.Like a modern-day version of Inspector Javert from Victor Hugo\u2019s \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d the dogged Mr. Adler has spent the better part of five years trying to find evidence that two men stole money from the campaign \u2014 even though they made proper filings with the city campaign finance board.The amount of the purported larceny was $5,000.It has probably cost 200 times the value of the nonexistent theft for Mr. Adler to reach the conclusion that there is no crime to prosecute.During the investigation, Mr. Adler billed the city over $520,000 in fees, at $300 an hour, \u201cbelow the prevailing rate,\u201d he said on Tuesday. He has not yet submitted his final invoice.The tab for the special prosecutor is just a fraction of the public and private money involved.Grand jurors sat for months, hearing evidence; multiple judges, up to and including members of the state\u2019s highest court, reviewed and ruled on the case, whittling down the charges; defense lawyers, including, among others, Justine Harris, Florian Miedel and Sam Gregory \u2014 who worked at a discount, but not free \u2014 filed volumes of motions; the full machinery of the judicial system, including court officers, law clerks and stenographic reporters, was deployed every time there was a hearing.

Mr. Donovan\u2019s reasons for not having his own office look into the matter are sealed in court records.In the meantime, however, the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, began an investigation of the Working Families Party. A team that included eight federal prosecutors and investigators reviewed 36,000 pages of documents and concluded that there was no reason to bring charges.You might think that was enough \u2014 Mr. Bharara is not known for leaving any flesh on the bones for other prosecutors \u2014 but a deputy administrative judge appointed Mr. Adler to consider state charges. Mr. Adler had been the president of the Brooklyn Bar Association and had actually served as a special prosecutor in another election law case in 1992. That one was dismissed by a judge who had stern words for Mr. Adler\u2019s conduct in front of the grand jury.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t quarrel that some would take the view that after all this time and money,\u201d Mr. Adler said, \u201cthe result is disappointing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vision, Operator of Rent-to-Own Homes, Gets Legislative Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byAs a landlord, Vision Property Management has had a reputation of not responding promptly to tenant complaints about major problems with its rent-to-own homes. Vision, a national company, has also been accused of not being responsive to concerns raised by local property code officials.So it may not be surprising that the company, based in Columbia, S.C., has kept a congressman waiting as well.Vision is being represented by lawyers from Buckley Sandler in Washington, including a former Maryland attorney general, Douglas F. Gansler. Valerie L. Hletko, a partner at the firm, said in an email that Vision was cooperating with Mr. Cummings\u2019s inquiry.In Maryland, a state legislator introduced a measure to better regulate rent-to-own landlords to make sure they are renting habitable homes and not trying to pass off major repairs onto their tenants.The company, she added, \u201clooks forward to putting the matter behind it and returning its focus to providing affordable homeownership opportunities for customers who either do not want or do not qualify for a mortgage.\u201dLegislators and regulators are examining whether seller-financing firms are taking advantage of lower-income residents by selling them homes in need of major renovation and repairs in deals lacking basic consumer protections.Lead poisoning is a problem in older, poorly maintained homes that were built when lead paint was widely used.In recent years, seller-financed home sales have grown in popularity in poorer neighborhoods as lower-income Americans have had more difficulty obtaining mortgages from banks and as private investment firms have stepped in to offer alternative financing. New firms peddling such homes continue to crop up on online.Companies like Vision have collectively bought tens of thousands of formerly foreclosed homes, many sold cheaply by Fannie Mae, one of the two giant government-backed mortgage finance firms.Like many companies in this corner of the housing market, Vision markets its homes on a website, with most of the transactions taking place either over the phone or by email. Sometimes the photos of the properties are several years old and do not reflect what they actually look like.In February, a Maryland state delegate introduced a bill to require rent-to-own landlords to provide the Maryland attorney general\u2019s office with copies of all leases signed in the state and post a performance bond to guarantee that tenants do not incur losses making repairs on a home while it is being rented.The delegate, Samuel I. Rosenberg, a Democrat from Baltimore, said the measure was intended to prevent rent-to-own landlords from \u201cselling damaged goods\u201d and \u201ctaking advantage of people who have limited resources.\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said he introduced the measure after reading about Vision\u2019s business practices in Maryland in The Times.\u201cThe ceiling is falling down,\u201d Ms. Harrell, a Home Depot cashier, told the legislative committee. \u201cWater just runs right through the floor into the basement.\u201dLast week, that committee voted down the measure, even though the Maryland attorney general\u2019s office had submitted a letter in support of the proposal. Some legislators suggested that problems with landlords of rent-to-own homes could be addressed with stepped-up enforcement by local officials. Mr. Rosenberg said he intended to revise the bill and introduce it in the next legislative session.Still, Vision is drawing scrutiny elsewhere. The Wisconsin attorney general, for instance, opened an investigation into Vision after several investigative news stories by WFRV-TV in Green Bay, and complaints have been registered with the attorney general\u2019s office in Pennsylvania.In a contract for deed, the legal title to a home does not pass to the buyer until the final payment is made. The buyer is typically required to make all repairs, pay taxes and bring homes, which are often run-down, into compliance with local building codes. In many respects, contracts for deed and rent-to-own deals are similar.Vision continues to buy homes. Property records show the company bought several hundred homes last year alone \u2014 and renters continue to cycle into and out of its properties.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Breaks With Allies Over Trade Issues Amid Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 Vows", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byBADEN-BADEN, Germany \u2014 The United States broke with other large industrial nations over trade on Saturday as the Trump administration rejected concerns among allies about spreading protectionism and made clear that it would seek new approaches to managing global commerce.At a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging nations and the European Union, Steven Mnuchin, attending his first major international gathering as Treasury secretary, signaled that American policy would follow the campaign promises made by President Trump to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d and review existing trade agreements to seek better deals for the United States.As a result, the ministers\u2019 joint statement, normally a study in blandness, became an unlikely focus of controversy here. The representatives could agree only on a tortured compromise stating, in effect, that trade is a good thing. Adjectives like \u201copen\u201d were dropped, and the ministers omitted language used in previous communiqu\u00e9s that condemned protectionism, repudiating decades of free trade doctrine.For Asian and European officials, many of them meeting their Trump administration counterparts for the first time, it was a startling lesson in how Mr. Trump and his team are overturning long-held assumptions about international commerce.Mr. Mnuchin led off the ministers\u2019 meeting on Friday with a declaration that current trade rules were unfair to the United States, positioning the administration against virtually all the other participants, according to an official who attended the closed session and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.\u201cWe thought that it was very important for the communiqu\u00e9 to reflect what we discussed here,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a news conference on Saturday. \u201cThe historical language was not relevant.\u201dAt the insistence of the United States, the communiqu\u00e9 also dropped a pledge to observe the Paris accords on climate change. Mr. Mnuchin deflected questions on the issue, saying it was outside his purview.The American government\u2019s lack of reverence for existing norms and treaties is particularly unsettling to the change-averse Europeans, who are coping with weak economic growth and a surge in populism. The last thing they need is a disruption in commerce with their biggest trading partner.Some complained privately that the American delegation rode into this stately spa and casino town, where Romans once bathed in the mineral-rich waters, determined to shake up the existing order but without any clear idea of what should replace it.The disagreement over trade principles was a sharp contrast to the statement issued when the central bankers and finance ministers met in Chengdu, China, last July. \u201cWe underscore the role of open trade policies,\u201d the leaders said in the Chengdu communiqu\u00e9, which used the word \u201ctrade\u201d six times. They promised to \u201cresist all forms of protectionism.\u201dLess than a year ago, such a statement was not questioned. Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic still hoped for a trade pact between the United States and the European Union that would eliminate already low tariffs and harmonize regulations governing things like vehicle headlights.The best that the Group of 20 participants could come up with on Saturday was this: \u201cWe are working to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies.\u201dMr. Mnuchin argued that the news media\u2019s focus on the language of the communiqu\u00e9 was overblown and said that the discussions in Baden Baden had been congenial. \u201cWe were incredibly productive,\u201d he said.But he also made it clear that the Trump administration had a vastly different view than its recent predecessors. \u201cWe believe in free trade,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cWe want to re-examine certain agreements.\u201d\u201cBalanced trade has to be what\u2019s good for us and what\u2019s good for other people,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt has to be a win-win situation.\u201dThe communiqu\u00e9s issued at the end of Group of 20 summit meetings are meant to show that nations like Brazil, China, France and Japan can put aside competing interests and reach consensus, however vague, on major issues. The statements emerge from tortuous deliberations and are the opposite of impulsive.But even the usual boilerplate platitudes proved fraught at this summit meeting. For many European and Asian officials, meeting in a Belle \u00c9poch spa building with polished marble floors and chandeliers dangling from the ceiling, it was their first encounter with the Trump administration and its \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy.Some viewed the meetings as a chance to socialize with the new American representatives and to try to absorb them into the international order. Angel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and a participant in the meetings, said the chance to get to know Mr. Mnuchin was more important than any joint statement.\u201cWe want to make him feel comfortable; we want to make him feel at home,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda told reporters. \u201cThese meetings are not about the communiqu\u00e9.\u201dIn their public statements, European leaders played down the conflicts and said that the discussions had been amiable. The meetings in Baden-Baden came after Mr. Mnuchin visited Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, in Berlin.\u201cNaturally we have different points of view,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said at a news conference on Saturday in Baden-Baden. But he added, \u201cWe worked very hard for two days in a pleasant atmosphere.\u201dHe also denied that the American delegation was at odds with other participants. \u201cThe Americans were not isolated,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to impose punitive taxes on imported goods are a particular worry for Germany, whose economy is built around exports of automobiles and industrial machinery. The United States is the biggest purchaser of German goods, buying 107 billion euros, or $115 billion, worth last year. Germany imported goods from the United States worth 58 billion euros.The trade imbalance has made Germany a target for Trump administration officials, who have accused Germany of manipulating the value of the euro and have said they want to renegotiate trade terms directly with Berlin, even though that task is done at a European level by Brussels.\u201cWe are going to look to our counterparts to continue to trade, but to look to have more balanced trade,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThat means over time reducing our trade deficits. I think we can do that in a way that\u2019s good for the American worker, that\u2019s good for our companies and that\u2019s good for our counterparties.\u201dMelissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

My focus now is getting back to business.\u201dJoon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, issued a brief statement explaining the decision not to prosecute Mayor Bill de Blasio.Later in the day during a news conference at City Hall, Mr. de Blasio refused to discuss any of the donors whose contributions \u2014 and the mayor\u2019s efforts on their behalf \u2014 had prompted scrutiny, deflecting questions by saying \u201cthe issue has been exhaustively investigated.\u201d He defended the behavior described by the federal prosecutor, saying it was appropriate for him to approach city agencies on behalf of donors and said that he would not rule out doing so again in the future.\u201cI think it is normal for an elected official to receive concerns from people and pass them along for an agency to assess,\u201d he said, ignoring the distinction between donors who give him thousands of dollars and everyday constituents. \u201cThat\u2019s how we have done things, that\u2019s how we will continue to do things.\u201dThe disclosure that neither the mayor nor his administration or campaign aides will face charges is a victory for the mayor, though perhaps a tainted one for the first-term Democrat who has been dogged by a steady stream of media reports about the investigations, and who is gearing up to run for re-election in November.The decisions by the two offices that handled the inquiries were disclosed separately on Thursday morning, but the timing was coordinated. The United States attorney\u2019s office, along with the F.B.I., conducted the federal investigation and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office oversaw the state one, assisted by the F.B.I.The federal investigation examined at least a dozen different circumstances, mostly in which donors to his 2013 campaign, his nonprofit or both sought action from the mayor, including several in which they had direct conversations with Mr. de Blasio. At least one, Gina Argento, the operator of a Brooklyn soundstage company that depends on City Hall for film permits and a generous contributor to both the mayor\u2019s campaign and his nonprofit, said last year through her lawyer that she felt pressured to donate.Late in their inquiry, federal prosecutors obtained grants of immunity for three of the mayor\u2019s donors who they believed had received some special treatment from the mayor, several people with knowledge of the matter said.Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, wrote that after an extensive investigation, \"this office has determined that the parties involved cannot be appropriately prosecuted.\u201dIn his statement, Mr. Kim said investigators had examined several instances in which the mayor and \u201cothers acting on his behalf\u201d solicited donations from people who were seeking \u201cofficial favors from the city, after which the mayor made or directed inquiries to relevant city agencies on behalf of those donors.\u201d\u201cAlthough it is rare that we issue a public statement about the status of an investigation, we believe it appropriate in this case at this time, in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and mayoral election,\u201d the statement said.In his letter, Mr. Vance said the office\u2019s conclusion was \u201cnot an endorsement of the conduct at issue.\u201dThe letter said they could not prove each element of the crimes that they considered charging beyond a reasonable doubt, because the mayor and those involved in the effort had relied on the advice of their lawyers, a valid defense in a criminal case, and because of ambiguities in the way the election law statutes were written.\u201cThe transactions appear contrary to the intent and spirit of the laws that impose candidate contribution limits, laws which are meant to prevent \u2018corruption and the appearance of corruption\u2019 in the campaign financing process,\u201d he wrote.J. David Goodman and William Neuman contributed to this report.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Populists Appear to Fall Short in Dutch Election, Amid High Turnout", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byDutch ElectionRight now: European populism faced its first big electoral test since last year\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum and Donald J. Trump\u2019s election. Turnout was the highest in decades.\u2022 The far-right populist party of Geert Wilders gained seats, but did not perform as strongly as expected. Exit polls suggested that it was tied for second place with the conservative party Christian Democratic Appeal and the center-left pro-European party Democrats 66 \u2014 each with 19 seats. Also making a relatively strong showing were the left-leaning Greens, with 16 seats. The leftist, euroskeptic Socialist Party is projected to have 14 seats.\u2022 The big loser appeared to be the mainstream Labor party, which had governed with the mainstream conservatives led by Mr. Rutte. The exit poll put it in seventh place, with nine seats.\u2022 Turnout was 82 percent, the highest in decades.\u2022 All 150 seats in the lower (and more powerful) house of Parliament are up for grabs. It takes a simple majority, 76 seats, to govern. Coalitions are the norm. The landscape is highly fragmented, with 11 parties represented in the current Parliament and 13 parties expected to be in the next one.\u201cDemocracy is definitely alive,\u201d said Mark Bovens, a political scientist at Utrecht University, noting the high turnout. \u201cThe nationalist parties have won seats, compared to 2012 \u2014 Wilders\u2019s party has gained seats, as has a new party, the Forum for Democracy \u2014 but their electorate is stable; it has not grown. And some of the traditional parties have moved in a more nationalistic direction, taking a bit of wind out of his sails. You see the same strategy in Germany.\u201dIn a victory speech broadcast live on television, Mr. Rutte said, \u201cThe Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said no to the wrong kind of populism.\u201dHis nemesis, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, called the result in the Netherlands a \u201cvote for Europe, a vote against extremists.\u201dAt the Christian Democratic Appeal\u2019s party, which was held in a tram museum, the crowd cheered the party\u2019s projected second-place finish (in a three-way tie).\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m just happy that the P.V.V. is not as big as we feared,\u201d said Robbert-Jan van Duyn, a 29-year-old alderman from the city of Almere, referring to Mr. Wilders\u2019s party, the Party for Freedom.Guests in the refurbished red-brick depot credited the party\u2019s apparent success to its charismatic leader, Sybrand Buma, and the fact that the party was not part of government during the last four years, when painful cuts were introduced by the coalition of Mr. Rutte\u2019s party and the Labor Party.It is hard to imagine a place where it is easier to vote than in the Netherlands. If you\u2019re a commuter going to work in one of the larger Dutch cities, chances are there will be a voting tent set up in the train station where you board and where you get off.If you were taking high tea at the Hotel Des Indes in The Hague, there was a voting booth one flight up from the wood-paneled lobby.Shopping at a grocery store or going to a bar? Some have tables with makeshift voting booths.Playing football or working out? You can vote at sports complexes. You can also vote in community centers, mosques and churches, libraries, homes for the aged and concert halls.Voters don\u2019t have to live where they vote, so those vacationing on islands in the North Sea can walk into local polling places and cast their ballots. In the village of Schiermonnikoog on the island of the same name, 105 percent of the population had already voted as of 5 p.m. The extras were visitors to the island.In this country with 12.9 million eligible voters, there are 9,000 polling places, so the lines are relatively short and all voters need to show is their registration card anywhere in the municipality where they live. (Those voting outside their municipality need a special pass.)Most polling sites are open from 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., but one \u2014 a flower kiosk in the train station at Castricum, in the north \u2014 got a head start. It opened just after the stroke of midnight, and by 1 a.m., 97 people had cast ballots there.\u2014 ALISSA J. RUBIN and CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE As of 9 p.m., 82 percent of the electorate had voted, up from 75 percent in the 2012 parliamentary elections.Some polling stations were running out of ballot papers, according to the national broadcaster NOS.\u201cIt\u2019s already a record,\u201d Jan den Boer, 60, the administrator of a community center in The Hague that adjoins the city\u2019s largest supermarket, Albert Heijn, said in the afternoon.As he munched on a meat sandwich known as a broodje bal, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve already had 900 people vote, maybe more; people are coming in all day. Usually it\u2019s just the morning and evening after work.\u201d\u201cThey always say it\u2019s important to vote, and this year there\u2019s more of a difference between parties.\u201dAt a voting station the southern town of Sittard, a veteran election monitor who was distributing ballots said: \u201cI have never seen anything quite like this. Today people started early and they\u2019re still coming. It\u2019s been nonstop.\u201d\u2014 ALISSA J. RUBIN and MARLISE SIMONS Brendan Groeneveld, 30, who works in tech support in the city of Almere, east of Amsterdam, said he was supporting Mr. Wilders\u2019s Party for Freedom primarily because of his hobby: Airsoft, a gladiator-like pastime similar to paintball, but that uses toys nearly indistinguishable from real firearms, he said.\u201cIt is legal, but uncertainties in Dutch law are giving the players a lot of headaches, in regards to some peripheral items,\u201d he said. The Party for Freedom supports expanding the legal use of firearms, he said, \u201cand they\u2019ll at least give more transparency and clarity in regards to what\u2019s allowed and what\u2019s not.\u201d (Mr. Groeneveld added that he would also like to be able to have real firearms for hunting.)Mr. Groeneveld said that his mother was Canadian and his wife was American, but expressed worries about Islam. \u201cA lot of Dutch culture is giving way to other cultures, and Islam is the most in-your-face, an obnoxious one,\u201d he said.On the other end of the spectrum from Mr. Wilders is a new figure: Jesse Klaver, 30, the leader of the Greens. The party holds just four seats in Parliament but seems poised to make big gains.Younger, more energetic and more openly urban and cosmopolitan than many of his rivals, Mr. Klaver has made an unabashed appeal to voters in larger cities and their suburbs, emphasizing the country\u2019s international image as a place that welcomes refugees, protects the environment and has a dynamic postindustrial economy.The son of a Moroccan father (whom Mr. Klaver says he did not know) and an Indonesian-Dutch mother, Mr. Klaver was raised as a Catholic \u2014 a minority in this largely secular nation \u2014 and started his career with the National Coalition of Christian Trade Unions.With looks that remind many people of a younger Justin Trudeau and an American style of campaigning that included a big final rally that was styled as a \u201cmeet-up\u201d with drinks, he is a charismatic newcomer.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Henk Janssen, a hotel manager in Valkenburg, in the south of the country, said he was voting for the party of Mr. Rutte, the prime minister.\u201cI vote for stability, for the people in government now,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf the world seems to be on fire. People are undermining each other, insulting, lying, creating conflict. Not only in our country but around the world.\u201dHe said he believed that a voter uprising or even a violent confrontation over immigration was possible, because \u201cthe mood is harsher everywhere. People are becoming more extreme, more willing to fight when they disagree.\u201dWith the elections over, he hopes a new government \u201ccan calm things down. The political climate right now is unhealthy.\u201d He noted the threat of Islamist extremism and tensions with Russia and Turkey.When Mr. Wilders briefly campaigned in the town of Valkenburg, \u201cit was really abnormal, police everywhere, a helicopter flying circles over the center,\u201d said Anna van Meersen, a shop attendant in the town. \u201cHow could a man like that govern us?\u201dBrit Maanen, 20, a receptionist at a wellness center in Heerlen, said she and her friends were not voting. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand enough of what goes on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear a lot of talk among politicians, but we don't hear much difference. We see a lot of people who want some power, or a lot of power.\u201dMs. Maanen said she had grown up in a multicultural society where she was used to seeing immigrants. In her hometown, Heerlen, she said she was pleased to see \u201cfewer women who are totally veiled.\u201d\u201cMany wear headscarves. But not many are now covering up their faces. I feel better about that, not so uneasy.\u201dWhat does she want from the new government? \u201cIn this country we have freedom of religion, freedom of expression. We want to keep it that way.\u201d\u2014 MARLISE SIMONSPaul van\u2019t Veer, 44, a D.J. and music programmer who also works in a record store, grew up attending antinuclear rallies in the city of Zwolle in the central-eastern Netherlands.On Wednesday, he planned to vote for the Party for the Animals. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the only parties that really cares about how the world will be in 15 or 20 years,\u201d he said at a cafe in Zwolle. \u201cThe environment is one of the main issues that hasn\u2019t been talked about much before these elections. It\u2019s a bigger fear for me than terrorism is.\u201dBut Mr. Veer\u2019s father has moved in a different direction. He plans to vote for Mr. Wilders\u2019s Party for Freedom.\u201cI\u2019m very sad about that,\u201d the son said. \u201cNowadays I\u2019m kind of ashamed of Holland because there seems to be far more hate and racism and intolerance than ever came to the surface before.\u201dOther voters in Zwolle said they hoped to stem the populist tide.Iris Groenendyk, 27, a child protection worker, said she had voted for the centrist party Democrats 66, based on its positions on education and health care. \u201cI\u2019m a bit scared, because of the fact that there are a lot of people who are interested by Wilders\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d she said.Theo van Uden, 66, a human resources manager at a provincial Dutch court, said he was voting for the opposition Socialist Party, because income inequality was his main concern.After nearly three decades of using voting machines, the Dutch reverted in 2009 to paper ballots marked with red pencils. For this election, the government has tightened security further, after reports that Russian-associated hackers were trying to gain access to government computers late last year.In what the Dutch are calling the \u201cfour-eyes principle,\u201d each vote will be counted and verified by two people at the polling station. Tallies will then be recorded by hand and initially sent by text message to the municipality. The ballots and tally sheets will then be physically delivered to municipal voting centers so that the counts can be double-checked and verified.There are 12.9 million eligible voters, out of a population of 17 million. Women have had the vote since 1922. The minimum age is 18; about 850,000 citizens will be old enough to vote for the first time.Voting is by proportional representation. Voters choose one party\u2019s list \u2014 there are 28 parties competing \u2014 and candidates from the list make it into Parliament based on their party\u2019s share of the total vote.There is no minimum threshold in the Netherlands. A party that gets 1/150th of the votes cast is guaranteed one of the 150 seats.In the picturesque heart of Mr. Wilders\u2019s hometown, Venlo, just across the border from northwest Germany, there did not appear to be a strong swell of support for him.\u201cI share some opinions with him, but he shouldn\u2019t be so radical,\u201d said Paula Vanhegen, 64. \u201cOtherwise we get a second Hitler and we don\u2019t want that.\u201dMany younger and middle-aged residents seemed convinced that Mr. Wilders\u2019s party wouldn\u2019t even make it into second place. Stan Koolen, 19, an agribusiness student, said he was convinced Mr. Rutte\u2019s party would win.For three working mothers sipping coffee in the old town square, TV and social media played a big part in helping them decide.\u201cLife in the Netherlands is good,\u201d said one of them, Miriam Swaghoven, 43, adding that Mr. Rutte had represented the country well for eight years.Mr. Wilders is unique in that he has taken advantage of a loophole that allows him to lead a party with seats in Parliament even though, as a technical and legal matter, his \u201cparty\u201d is an association, and is not covered by some of the Dutch and European Union law that pertains to political parties.For legal purposes, Mr. Wilders is the sole member of his Party for Freedom. Everyone else is part of the party\u2019s association \u2014 the Dutch word \u201cvereniging\u201d \u2014 and they are not required to pay dues.There is no requirement in the Netherlands that candidates on the party lists for which citizens cast votes need to be party members. But every other party in the Dutch Parliament is organized along traditional lines, with members paying dues.By having an association rather than a party, experts say, Mr. Wilders retains control over the party\u2019s platforms and is able to keep much of his financing secret, because under Dutch law, the head of the party must report all income and expenditures to party members, and he is the only one. (Only larger sums \u2014 expenditures over 4,500 euros, or about $4,780, and debts over 25,000 euros, or about $26,500 \u2014 need to be disclosed to the government.)An earlier version of this article included an outdated account of the process for asking the leader of the largest party in Parliament to try to form a governing coalition. Parliament invites the leader to do so, not the monarch.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the hobby that Geert Wilders engages in. It is Airsoft, not Airsport.Reporting was contributed by Alissa J. Rubin, Milan Schreuer and Christopher F.

{"Headline": "The Bronx Is Building", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported by13 PhotosOn parking lots, rubbly plots and the occasional community garden, the Bronx seems awash in new apartments.New market-rate housing is still pretty scarce, and most of what is rising are apartments priced as affordable housing, aimed at those who can\u2019t pay market rates. Across the South Bronx, in a miniboom, several thousand affordable rental apartments are under construction or planned, according to developers, brokers and city officials.Fueled by a growing population, new government policies and relatively cheap land, they add, these developments seem far more sophisticated than many that came before. Like their free-market counterparts, they\u2019re arriving with shops and restaurants, rooftop farms and concert halls, and, their supporters say, are taking the revival of once down-and-out areas to another level.\u201cThere\u2019s very little abandonment left, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d said Ms. Lamberg, 77, who is at work on \u201cHardly a Failure,\u201d a book about some of her developments. \u201cI always thought the Bronx had such wonderful potential.\u201dThat potential isn\u2019t lost on some of the city\u2019s brand-name developers, which despite having been in the Bronx for decades in some cases, are these days tackling larger and showier projects.Market forces, naturally, are driving the shift. City-owned sites, once the lifeblood of affordable housing development, have become practically nonexistent in much of Manhattan and Brooklyn, according to developers. And outside of the Bronx, market-rate land can be prohibitively priced.Also, they add, stricter financing rules since the last recession have meant that large developers, usually for-profit companies, are being tapped to team up with local nonprofits, which need the developers\u2019 deep pockets to get deals done.More immediately, as condo prices dip in more affluent areas, the city\u2019s major developers can seem to be casting about, looking for things to build, said Jeff Levine, the chairman of Douglaston Development, which has been active in the Bronx since 1987 but whose latest project, the 425-unit Crossroads Plaza, is by far its largest. Douglaston has also built high-rise towers in Manhattan and along the waterfront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\u201cAffordable housing may have relatively modest rewards, but it also has modest risks,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a good place to be sometimes.\u201dIf apartments are sprouting in unlikely places, none may be more striking than the corner of Spofford Avenue and Tiffany Street in the Hunts Point neighborhood, home for years to the Spofford Juvenile Center, a detention complex that was shut down in 2011 over concerns about inmate fights, rats and a lack of air-conditioning.After the white-brick facility is razed, it will be replaced by the Peninsula: five buildings with 740 units of affordable housing as well as a film studio, a bakery, a brewery and 21,000 square feet of stores tucked around more than an acre of public space.\u201cI felt so good when I heard, so good,\u201d said Leon Cox, 34, who was once incarcerated at Spofford for throwing rocks at trucks on the nearby Bruckner Expressway. \u201cThe place was like a revolving door for kids.\u201dIf the Peninsula can change the vibe of Hunts Point, which has suffered from crime and rumbles with truck traffic, Mr. Cox strongly supports it, he said, adding that he would like to someday relocate into one of the Peninsula\u2019s apartments with his wife and two children.The $300 million project, which is being developed by Gilbane Development Company, Hudson Companies and Mutual Housing Association of New York and was designed by WXY Studio and Body Lawson Associates, can\u2019t break ground until the site receives rezoning approval.As excited as she is to improve Hunts Point, where three parks have opened in recent years and a Metro-North Railroad stop is planned as well, she is also wary of big-ticket investment, echoing a sentiment from other long-term residents. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Catch-22,\u201d Ms. Torres said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited all these changes are happening. But with them will come a lot of people who will take advantage.\u201dProviding shelter for current residents may be important, but the Bronx is also grappling with growth. In 2015, it had 1.46 million residents, according to census figures, up from 1.39 million in 2010 and 1.2 million in 1990.And despite a reputation for grittiness, the South Bronx is filling up, too. From 2000 to 2010, the population increased in 19 of the 22 census tracts in Bronx Community Board 1, with some neighborhoods seeing double-digit spikes.At the same time, the Bronx remains New York\u2019s poorest borough. In 2013, according to census records, about 27 percent of the population in the Bronx was living below the poverty level, which that year was about $24,000 for a family of four, versus about 20 percent in Brooklyn, which was next on the list.Looked at another way, more than half of renters in the Bronx spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, an unsustainable level, Ms. Lamberg said.To encourage developers to build affordable housing and defray construction costs, the city has practically given away land in certain parts of the city, suspended property taxes for decades at a time and offered public money in the form of tax-exempt bonds and low-interest loans.When a project\u2019s status as affordable housing expires decades down the road, some units could be converted to market-rate housing, though the city is increasingly mandating that apartments stay affordable for longer periods of time.Whatever the motivation, the competition for sites in the South Bronx, where land prices have climbed after years of stagnation, is fierce, developers say.Featuring a 50,000-square-foot Y.M.C.A. that will be only the second one in the Bronx, La Central will also have a rooftop telescope for a local school, a rooftop farm and a skate park, along with 45,000 square feet of new stores, including a sit-down restaurant in an area where there are few.Approved in the fall, the $450 million project, which is still hammering out its public financing package, is expected to open its first phase in 2019.\u201cProposals have gotten so much more interesting,\u201d said Aaron Koffman, a principal at Hudson Companies, which is developing the site with the BRP Companies, ELH-TKC, Breaking Ground and Comunilife. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just housing with retail on the ground floor and a community partner.\u201d Hudson also has projects in Brooklyn neighborhoods including Brooklyn Heights, Gowanus and Prospect Lefferts Gardens.Mayor Bill de Blasio has made reducing housing costs a priority, and his mandatory inclusionary housing program, started last year, forces developers that benefit from a zoning change to make some housing permanently affordable.All of the apartments at La Central, which sits on land rezoned last fall, will start out as affordable, before being potentially deregulated. But 35 percent of the units in one of the buildings, and 30 percent in three other buildings, will rent at below-market rates indefinitely, said Mr. Koffman, who was able to pay just $5 for almost four and a half acres of New York City property. If he breaks the rules, he must pay the city the appraised value of the land, which brokers estimate to be more than $12 million.The current crop of new buildings depart stylistically from the public housing complexes built in the mid-20th century and the modest two-family rowhouses that went up in the South Bronx in the 1980s.Elton Crossing, a 199-unit project rising at 432 East 162nd Street, at Elton Avenue in Melrose, on the site of a former factory, features a gently curved facade and solar panels on the roof to power hallway lights.Its units, studios to three-bedrooms, will also feature green elements like low-flow toilets, LED light fixtures and nontoxic paints, said James Riso, a member of the Briarwood Organization, which is developing the project with Phipps Houses and CPC Resources. The building will have 8,600 square feet of stores.The building, which is being developed by BFC Partners and the Women\u2019s Housing and Economic Development Corporation, or Whedco, over abandoned railroad tracks, is also offering amenities that the public can enjoy, including the Bronx Music Hall, a 300-seat performance space.Open space can be another benefit for those who live nearby.In the Soundview section, for example, Nelson Management Group and L & M Development are at work on a pair of red-brick affordable towers at 1520 and 1530 Story Avenue with 435 apartments. Rising from former parking lots for the adjacent Lafayette Boynton rent-stabilized rental complex, the $183 million rental development will offer studios to three-bedrooms, all with dishwashers, as well as nearly two acres of greenery, when the landscaped grounds are completed in 2019.Robert. S. Nelson, president of Nelson Management, said he believes that all tenants, rich or poor, should have decent living conditions. \u201cWe like to provide a building environment that people are proud to call home,\u201d he said.In Mott Haven, Douglaston Development is building Crossroads Plaza, a three-building, 425-unit complex on the site of a popular community garden, and will also create a landscaped 20,000-square-foot public plaza on Union Street, between East 149th Street and Southern Boulevard.A $157 million project undertaken in phases, Crossroads opened its first 126-unit building at 535 Union Street in 2015. A second building, with 135 units at 501 Southern Boulevard, is to open this month, according to Mr. Levine, Douglaston\u2019s chairman, and a third, at 828 East 149th Street, by the end of the year.As with much affordable housing, eligibility uses the area\u2019s median income, which was $90,600 for a family of four in 2016. At 828 East 149th Street, for example, apartments are reserved for those who earn between 50 percent and 100 percent of the median, or $45,300 to $90,600. Rents for studios will start at $788 a month, one-bedrooms, $847 a month, and two-bedrooms, $1,025 a month.Though an income limit of 100 percent of the median was once considered unusually high, it is increasingly common in the South Bronx, which Mr. Levine said is a sign that the area is turning more middle-class. \u201cThese are the green shoots of how the Bronx will become more market-rate,\u201d he said.Of course, what\u2019s good for landlords is not always good for renters, and some in the Bronx say they are already feeling squeezed. They include Janice Lynch, 68, who was evicted in 2015 after missing some rent payments and then essentially became homeless, staying on relatives\u2019 couches.All the housing she looked at, despite being listed as affordable, was more than her $900-a-month budget, she said.The apartment costs $550 a month after a city subsidy and offers views as far as the Whitestone Bridge, and also of buildings popping up around Ms. Lynch, for better or worse. \u201cWe have an explosion of people who are homeless or just can\u2019t afford the rent where they\u2019re living,\u201d she said. \u201cBuildings like mine are needed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Immigration System, Lauded by Trump, Is More Complex Than Advertised", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byTORONTO \u2014 Canada\u2019s merit-based immigration system received a loving mention by President Trump this week in his speech to Congress. Mr. Trump, who has railed against illegal immigration and talked tough about tightening borders, said adopting that kind of system would cost American taxpayers less and help increase wages for poor workers.But in Canada, immigration is not just about selecting newcomers based on their skills. It is part of a system that promotes both the economy and the country\u2019s multicultural society, which has arguably become as much a part of Canadian identity as hockey. And it is largely seen as a way to increase immigration, not reduce it.\u201cCanadians are more likely than citizens of any other industrial country to think immigration is essential to the economy and the future of the country,\u201d said Jeffrey Reitz, a professor of ethnic and immigration studies at the University of Toronto.Part of that enthusiasm is the country\u2019s recognition that, with an aging population, immigration is essential to economic growth. Add to that Canada\u2019s geography \u2014 a long border with the prosperous United States to the south and the Arctic to the north \u2014 and illegal immigration is less of an issue.And finally, Canadians have a wholehearted belief in the merit-based immigration system, which creates a positive feedback loop.\u201cThe advantage of our system is the people who come in \u2014 everyone agrees they\u2019ve passed some sort of merit system,\u201d said Ravi Pendakur, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa. \u201cThe Canadian population in particular is more willing to buy into immigration. They can see it\u2019s managed, and that\u2019s an advantage.\u201dThe program does have its drawbacks. It has become enormously complex, ever-morphing and a source of huge backlogs.Created in 1967, the merit-based system was seen as a way to select immigrants based on their \u201chuman capital\u201d and not simply their country of origin, as had been the tradition. The idea was to bring in immigrants, regardless of where they were born, with vetted qualities that would make them the most successful at integrating into the Canadian economy.Candidates received points for their level of education, ability to speak one or both of the country\u2019s official languages, work experience, age, a job offer and what immigration officials called adaptability, which meant they came with family or had family here.Two years ago, the country revamped the entire system, increasing the possible points to 1,200 and valuing a job offer at 600.Other applications were put in a job bank for employers to select. Successful applicants were promised a six-month approval, but unsuccessful ones had to reapply.Add separate point systems drafted by the country\u2019s provinces and territories based on their job markets, and the system grows even more head-scratching. Saskatchewan, for instance, is recruiting long-haul truck drivers and hospitality workers, while Alberta wants food and beverage processors.\u201cI teach this stuff and I find it confusing,\u201d said Prof. Audrey Macklin, director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Center for Criminology and Sociolegal Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently confusing, plus it keeps changing.\u201dStill, the principle remains: The immigrants coming in under this system are well educated, literate in the local language and have great credentials.\u201cIf America changes toward our system, the Apples and Microsofts and Googles will be very happy,\u201d said Robert Vineberg, a retired regional director general of immigration. \u201cBut the vegetable growers in California will not be so happy.\u201dMr. Vineberg offered government immigration statistics from 2015 as an example. That year, Canada identified 66,360 newcomers as economic immigrants for their occupational skills.Around 36,300 were categorized in the top two classes, meaning they were fluent in one national language and had a college degree. Most would have been recruited for a specific job, Mr. Vineberg said: for instance, vice president of a company or administrator of a hospital. Another 22,700 were picked for a job in skilled trades, like an industrial electrician. They needed the language skills to read a blueprint and follow complicated directions, and at least some postsecondary training and certification in their trade.Only 2,177 were brought in as laborers, and even they would have been chosen for specific positions, most likely in a hard-to-fill job or a remote location \u2014 for instance, a Japanese-speaking hotel receptionist in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Mr. Vineberg said.His example, however, illuminates the contradiction at the center of the immigration system.In 2015, almost 272,000 people were granted entry, and only a quarter were picked for their merit. Most of those counted in the economic class were family members, chosen not for their human capital \u2014 although many might also be educated and intend to work \u2014 but their blood ties.\u201cThe statistics convey the impression that Canada chooses most people based on economic criteria, and perhaps policy makers think this reassures Canadians that immigration serves Canada\u2019s economic interests,\u201d Professor Macklin said. \u201cIn reality, most people still enter on the basis of kinship. The idea that this can be easily or significantly altered is a bit of a fantasy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to be relaxed about immigration when your only land border is a huge wall with the United States,\u201d Professor Reitz said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The (Mostly) Safe Golf Cart", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byMr. Sykes and his neighbors, like a growing number of people in retirement communities across the country, are driving golf carts not only to play golf but also to hit the road for short trips to the supermarket, doctors\u2019 appointments and dinner out. The carts are convenient, energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, cheaper to buy and maintain than cars, and a handy alternative in areas with limited public transit. Plus, drivers say, they are fun and easy to drive.While the overall safety record of golf carts is not tracked nationally, some people, including Mr. Sykes, are concerned about how they are used.Golf carts, which are partly enclosed, are often perceived as being safer than they are, said Jana Lynott, senior policy adviser for transportation issues at AARP. People who use them on the roads \u201care as vulnerable as bicyclists and pedestrians,\u201d Ms. Lynott said, \u201cand older adults are at increased risk for injuries in a crash, as they\u2019re more vulnerable as they age.\u201dIn 2016, The Villages had 94 rescue and emergency medical service incidents involving golf carts, with 70 involving injuries, said Edmund Cain, fire chief for The Villages\u2019 Public Safety Department. The department says it does not track fatalities and could not provide data on the nature of the injuries.The 40-square-mile district has a population of about 120,000. Most residents use carts on the 42 miles of paths that are shared with bicyclists and pedestrians, but carts also are driven in public areas shared with traffic, he said. Among the causes of crashes, he said, are drivers\u2019 losing control or handing the wheel to underage and unlicensed grandchildren.The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles did not respond to numerous requests for data.Golf carts are designed to travel at less than 20 miles per hour and are not required to meet any federal safety standards, including the installation of seatbelts. Regulation comes at the state level.Still, said Fred L. Somers Jr., general counsel for the International Light Transportation Vehicle Association, a trade group that represents manufacturers: \u201cOver all, serious injuries and deaths pale in comparison to bicycle or motorcycle crashes. In my judgment, it\u2019s way overblown.\u201dSome law enforcement officers have a similar view.Harris Blackwood, director of the Georgia Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety, said the Atlanta suburb of Peachtree City had a long and positive history with golf carts. \u201cIt\u2019s a city built on golf carts,\u201d he said of the planned community with a significant retired population, where the carts have been used as a major means of transportation for more than 50 years. He said the state made a concerted effort in recent years to improve safety standards. \u201cAt one time, your 9-year-old could take a golf cart to the store,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we saw a trend in the number of injuries or number of fatalities, we would certainly take a position, but we\u2019ve not seen that come to pass.\u201dLt. Matt Myers of the Peachtree City Police Department said the carts could be safe and an asset if guidelines, education and enforcement are carried out, and if well-designed roads and infrastructure are provided.\u201cIn the last 15 years since I\u2019ve been doing this, there has only been one death,\u201d he said. Most serious collisions are caused by teenagers who drive too fast or turn too quickly; older adults generally don\u2019t do that, he said. \u201cI think it is a misrepresentation to say it is a major safety problem for retirement communities,\u201d he added.Today, 24 states have statutes that allow localities to regulate golf cart use on public streets, said Amanda Essex, a policy specialist in transportation for the National Conference of State Legislatures. And in five other states, legislation has been introduced to regulate their use.Legislation typically includes prohibiting golf carts on state and federal highways, and on roads with speed limits above 25 to 35 miles per hour. In some cases, their use is restricted to daytime, requiring signage to indicate use and specifying driver age and licensure.At least 375 municipalities have ordinances that permit golf carts (sometimes called golf cars) on public roads, Mr. Somers said. The growth is fairly recent, with dozens of municipalities enacting legislation every year, according to Mr. Somers.\u201cWe know that these vehicles were originally not designed for street use,\u201d Mr. Somers said. \u201cThere is very little crash resistance.\u201d He added that \u201cmost municipalities are legitimately concerned with safety.\u201dMany accidents occur because of driver negligence, like distraction or intoxication, Mr. Somers said. \u201cProblems arise if people don\u2019t follow the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cA 90-year-old, who is blind with no license, shouldn\u2019t be allowed to drive a golf cart.\u201dKristopher J. Seluga, a partner at Technology Associates, a forensic engineering consulting firm, said the numbers might actually be higher because of underreporting. \u201cMany fatality victims don\u2019t survive long enough to make it to the emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen that happens, they don\u2019t end up in the C.P.S.C. data.\u201d He estimates that because of increased use, the number of accidents has increased steadily in recent years while the number of injuries has roughly tripled since 1991.\u201cFor the retirement community, a big safety issue is people falling out,\u201d said Mr. Seluga, who added that when drivers make a sharp left turn, passengers are often caught off-guard and are thrown. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have seatbelts and a door, it is difficult to stay in the cart,\u201d he said.He said he typically received several news alerts each week about serious golf cart accidents; one is usually about a death. \u201cMany articles refer to the incidents as \u2018freak accidents,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it happens all the time, it is not a \u2018freak accident.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Basing Life on What You Can Afford", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byEvery one of us makes money\u00a0trade-offs\u00a0nearly every day, whether we realize it or not. Residence over retirement. Later over now. Needs over wants. Faith over financial facts. The people you\u2019ll encounter here\u00a0have been sorting it out for themselves for some time now. Their household income is at or close to the median in their area \u2014 from Arkansas to Michigan, Indiana to California.Meeting the most basic of needs is usually not a problem for these people, but it\u2019s a challenge to figure out how often to allow themselves things they want and\u00a0to\u00a0weigh those desires against\u00a0longstanding\u00a0debt or the contributions they probably ought to make to their futures.Below are some of the most common trade-offs that they \u2014 and all of us \u2014 face.  Bryant, Ark.Sometimes Tanya Brashers can almost forget about the financial situation her family is in.Tanya and her husband, Chris, are military veterans \u2014 Tanya is a former member of the U.S. Navy and Chris of the Marines \u2014 living in this bedroom community southwest of the state capital.In mid-February, Tanya, 41, lost her $37,000-a-year job with a nonprofit veterans group in North Little Rock when grant funding dried up. In early April, the couple and their teenage son from a previous marriage must vacate the house they have been renting for $1,200 a month because their landlord plans to sell it. The couple has about $50,000 in student loan debt.\u201cThe more I talk about our situation, the more grim it seems,\u201d she said. \u201cWe prioritize everything: our rent and utilities and our food comes first \u2026 It\u2019s a huge splurge if we go out to dinner or something, but we feel like it\u2019s important to do that every so often. And I do feel guilty for it.\u201dThe couple has decided to move to Fairhope, Ala., on the Gulf Coast, hoping it will bring new opportunities.Tanya\u2019s Arkansas social worker license is valid in Alabama. Chris, who has a degree in engineering but is trying to build a business as a freelance photographer, researched the area and thinks there are more freelance jobs there. They will also be near several military bases, an employment option if they cannot find full-time work, she said.Money worries are not new to Tanya, who grew up in poverty in Yazoo City, Miss., in the Mississippi Delta. She remembers moving often as a child because her parents could not pay the rent. The water and electricity were frequently cut off.Tanya said that growing up in poverty and seeing poverty every day had a significant influence on her political choices.\u201cGiven that there are a lot of economic issues right now, social welfare programs are essential and help people from being homeless to keeping people from having their health become detrimental,\u201d she said.Money was also scarce during her five years in the Navy. \u201cSo you kind of get used to living very basic,\u201d she said.The first time in her life that she thought she had enough money was after she was discharged and moved to Reno, Nev. \u201cI started to make good money in the civilian world \u2026 and I lived a little more lavishly, maybe too lavishly, and ended up in bankruptcy,\u201d she said, and \u201cthen, of course, I reverted back to the basics again.\u201dChris, 46, grew up in Arkansas; he also filed for bankruptcy after leaving the military because he lived beyond his means.While Tanya no longer has a paycheck she can count on, she receives disability compensation of nearly $2,000 a month for a back injury she sustained during a training exercise in the Navy.Chris, who served during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was also receiving $2,000 a month in disability compensation for a number of physical and emotional issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder. But in December, that payment was halted for six months after a paperwork error resulted in his being overpaid.The couple has health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs; Tanya\u2019s ex-husband covers their son\u2019s insurance.While they drive newer vehicles, they shop for things marked down to the lowest price and closely monitor their utility costs.Chris said he is hopeful about their situation, and he likes a lot of what President Trump is doing. \u201cLike wanting to renovate the V.A. system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would really impact us, but how is he going to do it?\u201dTanya said she is not sure of their future. \u201cWe are happy with living simply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried to find the least extravagant house in the neighborhood.\u201cI\u2019m at peace with the fact that I don\u2019t have to have a lot of money to be happy.\u201dRob Moritz lives in North Little Rock. He has spent more than 30 years covering politics, state and local government and crime news for newspapers in Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas.Colorado SpringsAvalon Manly is proud of who she is and what she represents as a feminist, bisexual, social activist, writer, artist and teacher living in the famously conservative stronghold of Colorado Springs.And defying what she sees as an unfair image of her fellow millennials as \u201clazy and entitled,\u201d Avalon, 27, works hard. She teaches at a Colorado Springs middle school. She also does \u201cpart-time pittance work\u201d to bridge the gap between her $44,000 teaching salary, in an area with a median income of about $54,000, and her bills. She calls them \u201cside hustles.\u201d\u201cEvery millennial I know has a side hustle or two,\u201d said Avalon, who does freelance design work, editing work and writing. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who has one job and makes a living at it.\u201dShe scrambles because she is digging out of a financial hole she created when she lost her job in 2014 and turned to credit cards to fill the gaps in her monthly budget. It\u2019s a choice that taught her a particularly painful lesson in personal finance.\u201cThere were months during the great season of unemployment where I would send out 15 job applications and then I would sit on the couch and have panic attacks,\u201d she said.\u201cI was really dumb,\u201d she said, explaining how she took temporary and part-time jobs to generate income and negotiated with her bank and credit companies for relief.\u201cWe live in this system that correlates wealth with character,\u201d Avalon said. \u201cIf you are doing well financially, you must be a good person. And if you are doing poorly, you must be a bad person. What an unjust narrative that is.\u201dShe might have recovered from her financial woes more quickly, but chose a lower-paying teaching job in a neighborhood with one of the lowest per-capita incomes and highest crime rates in the region, turning down more lucrative offers.\u201cMy friends and I tend to be very activist, very passionate about people and passionate about doing meaningful work,\u201d she said.She admits she would fit in better in more progressive Colorado communities like Boulder or Denver, but she is committed to staying here. \u201cMy family is here,\u201d she said, and she likes to be near them.Avalon moved back after a three-year stint in New Orleans, where she taught in a poor public school as a member of Teach for America. And she is making no compromises as she plants roots here.Instead, she wants the community to adjust. \u201cThere are more of us here than people realize,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe are working to change Colorado Springs.\u201dShe is tempted to take higher-paying jobs, but says her work is too important to leave. She points to a seminar she led for new Teach for America corps members.\u201cWe had a very real conversation about supporting queer kids,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard to watch all the new teachers\u2019 faces when we talked about the need to support queer kids in states that legislate against them.\u201dBill Vogrin has worked as a reporter, editor and columnist for 35 years, primarily for The Associated Press and The Colorado Springs Gazette. He has lived in Colorado Springs since 1994.Grand Rapids, Mich.Money has been a burden for Kate Elenbaas for much of her life, a constant reminder of how her family struggled financially, and then how her addiction to alcohol nearly killed her.\u201cFrom the time I was a little kid, money has somehow or another woven itself in and out of my life in a negative way,\u201d said Kate, 53. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I made bad decisions, did desperate things.\u201dNow, 15 years sober on Feb. 1, Kate still does not have a nest egg, or even her own home. Yet she lacks for nothing and makes a point to donate to organizations that help people who are homeless and addicted.She is a therapist at Thriveworks Counseling and Life Coaching, and she made $57,000 in 2015, just above the median income for this area. She rents a small two-bedroom home on the northwest side of this city, and the only luxuries she allows herself are a 2008 Jeep Commander and a 60-inch 4D television with a stereo sound system.She owes more than $70,000 in student loans, some from attending college in her 20s and the rest from earning a master\u2019s degree in social work in 2010.\u201cSobriety has taught me I could be so much worse off, and I tell myself that daily.\u201dHer parents divorced when she was 7, and Kate said her mother remained acrimonious toward her father about child support. That bitterness extended to Kate.\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for her, but it would be one thing if my mother would have instilled in us the idea that, \u2018Look, we may not have much money, but we have enough,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut every week and every day there was an argument about money. My mother would berate me \u2014 tell me I was ungrateful.\u201dWhile Kate\u2019s family was considered middle class, most of Kate\u2019s friends were in the upper income range. It made her feel insecure, she said, and she became the life of the party, the class clown.\u201cI found friendships through humor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut inside, I was insecure. I realized my alcoholic behavior \u2014 what I thought and how I felt about myself \u2014 started in childhood.\u201dThat behavior escalated in her adult life. A fifth of vodka would temporarily cure the physical toll the disease was taking on her. She suffered from the shakes, retching, hair loss and nosebleeds, and she was desperate for money to pay for liquor and cigarettes. She pocketed money from the till while working at a fast-food restaurant. She stole quarters from her nephew\u2019s piggy bank.\u201cYou feel horrible, but when you are in the throes of addiction \u2026 \u201d she said. \u201cI was at the point where I had to drink all the time. I existed on a fifth of vodka and a pack of cigarettes.\u201dKate finally reached her \u201cbottom\u201d in 2002, when her sister rushed her to a treatment center.\u201cThe doctor took a look at me and said, \u2018She won\u2019t make it through the weekend,\u2019\u201d Kate said.She remembers waking up in a hospital intensive care unit three weeks later. She weighed 106 pounds. She had suffered from alcohol encephalitis and cirrhosis of the liver. Her body had begun to shut down.\u201cObviously I lived, but it was a very long and tenuous recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cA liver specialist told me I\u2019d aged my body by 10 years. I went through menopause at 40. I still feel chronic pain and arthritis. Everything has been accelerated.\u201cBut by God\u2019s grace, here I am, and I realize what\u2019s important. I have a good life.\u201dMary Ullmer has been an associate editor for espnW.com since 2011. She is a Michigan native who worked in the newspaper industry for nearly three decades. She returned to her home state in 1999.New Albany, Ind.Wesley Shears thought he\u2019d arrived. Still in his 30s, he was on the fast track at work, owned his first home \u2014 a small three-bedroom in Lexington, Ky. \u2014 and with his wife had a combined income in excess of $100,000.But his degree in architecture could not protect him when building projects dried up after the country\u2019s financial crisis in 2008.\u201cI survived many rounds of layoffs,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, there was nobody else to lay off.\u201d The house went soon after, lost in a bankruptcy.In what should have been his prime earning years as an architectural designer, Wesley scrambled to continue his livelihood, finding only a string of hourly wage jobs.\u201cIt just looked like everything was stepping up and then boom, boom,\u201d said Wesley, now 44, from the small living room in the duplex he rents for $800 a month in New Albany, Ind., just across the river from Louisville, Ky. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me. I think it\u2019s this whole generation that I\u2019m a part of. Because there\u2019s a lot of people that I went to college with that I connect with on Facebook \u2026 they\u2019re just kind of in the same boat.\u201dTo make ends meet, he managed an office, directed projects for a cabinetmaker and was a substitute teacher in the New Albany school system. \u201cThere\u2019s one school right down the road in a bad neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had me on speed dial.\u201dA year ago, Wesley separated from his second wife, Kristin. He now lives frugally with his 11-year-old son, Hank, a fifth grader at Hazelwood Middle School, along with two cats and two Jack Russell terriers. The family recently stopped using the upstairs bathroom, he said, because the leaky pipes send water through the downstairs ceiling. An older son, Cowen, 18, is a freshman at Butler University, and he also lives with them.\u201cMoney was the end-all, be-all growing up,\u201d Wesley said. \u201cIt seemed what you would strive for. Now what makes me happy is just everything\u2019s taken care of, everything\u2019s paid for. The lights are on. There\u2019s food. Stuff like that.\u201dWhen Hank needs new sneakers, Wesley buys a high-end brand, so they last longer. His own shoes, he said, come refurbished. Occasional trips to Goodwill and the Salvation Army augment his wardrobe. Entertainment comes courtesy of one of the few remaining neighborhood video stores \u2014 where kids\u2019 movies are free. Cable TV is a splurge. Internet, he said, is a necessity.\u201cWhen stuff is really, really, really needed, I can make it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI take it to the very last point. If I can\u2019t make it then, I reach out. I don\u2019t want to, but I do.\u201dHe also helps others, serving food at a soup kitchen, as a volunteer coach at his son\u2019s school, and at his church. What he has lost in bank accounts, he has gained in relationships, including a new love interest.Wesley said he is confident that his current struggle will be a catalyst for his sons\u2019 future success.\u201cI do have dreams and I have no plans of letting them go,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus on myself and my two boys is clearer, and with my current job I will be a homeowner again and move ahead financially in life.\u201dJohn Mura is director of communications for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. He worked for 36 years as a reporter and senior editor at newspapers in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Kentucky.Los AngelesNatalie Davis was married with a 5-year-old and three months pregnant with her second child when her husband died. She was 31.\u201cNobody expected him to die at 45,\u201d said Natalie, now 36. \u201cHe literally just dropped. Metaphorically speaking, that can happen to anything. It was a wake-up call.\u201dIn the years after his death, Natalie relied heavily on her credit cards and accrued lots of debt.\u201cGoing through high school and college, I always had some sort of a credit-card debt,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019d worked hard to get out of debt,\u201d and she had finally established good credit. But as she struggled to deal with the loss of her husband, she ran up credit card bills again.\u201cNow I find myself digging out of another debt hole,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be careful about where I put my money, where I spend it. I hate packing my lunches for work, but I do it.\u201dWhile she is considering where to cut corners, and what she can allow herself, her philosophy on money is relatively simple.Natalie does not have any savings, which she says makes her a little more cautious but is not a source of great anxiety.The biggest trade-off she has made was leaving a full-time executive position to spend more time with her 10-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. \u201cI\u2019m the only parent they have,\u201d she said, \u201cand they\u2019re young.\u201dShe is now a freelancer working with clients in fashion merchandising and product development. The flexibility is important to her, but her salary can swing by as much as $20,000 a year, without ever quite amounting to six figures. She said her number of clients had grown, but she was not completely removed from the financial struggle.But the change was worth it to get time with her children. \u201cI see their development getting so much better,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially my son.\u201dNatalie said she was getting over the guilt she felt about not being able to give her children everything, especially in the absence of their father.\u201cThis is what we have, and this is what we\u2019re going to work with,\u201d is her mantra, of sorts. \u201cI\u2019m definitely less hard on myself about not being able to provide in all aspects. I just cut myself a little more slack, because I used to physically lose hair over it.\u201dThis mom has also carved out two small luxuries for herself that she says have made her life much better, even if she can feel it in her wallet.\u201cI\u2019m going out tonight,\u201d she says, on one of the evenings she sets aside to spend with other mothers. Only in the last year has she felt comfortable enough with \u201cbiting the bullet, and hiring a babysitter because it was needed.\u201dThe other little thing she says she will not bend on is having a housekeeper come once a month to help out.\u201cIt chops off an entire day for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s time I can now take my kids out and do things with them. I don\u2019t feel so guilty about that anymore, but I used to.\u201dJarrett Hill is a freelance journalist in Los Angeles. He hosts Back2Reality, a politics and pop culture podcast for NBCBLK.Florissant, Mo.Alonzo Adams doesn\u2019t know if the old saying will hold true for him.\u201cBlack preachers don\u2019t retire, they die,\u201d said Alonzo, a 42-year-old pastor and father of four. Particularly at smaller, modest churches like his, he said, pastors\u2019 families often divert their own money to fill the church\u2019s coffers, leaving little for retirement savings.It\u2019s a cycle Alonzo is hoping to break. In addition to tending to New Jerusalem\u2019s flock, he works a full-time job at the Department of Agriculture and runs a small janitorial business that cleans offices overnight. His wife, Ronica, 40, home-schools three of their four children and runs a cake-baking business out of their home.\u201cMy wife was diagnosed with lupus two years ago. Kneading all the fondant, and all of these things to make these cakes and put all this stuff together, it hurts her,\u201d Alonzo said from his home in Florissant, Mo. Ronica has to work, he said, even though he puts in 75 to 80 hours a week. \u201cThis is the world that we live in,\u201d he said.Even with the extra jobs, the Adams family brings in a maximum of $76,000 each year, just about the median income in their ZIP code. They have trouble saving, he said, and have no retirement nest egg.The financial pressure of raising four kids is apparent and frustrating. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re not buying as many groceries as we normally would,\u201d Alonzo said.But it is not the hustle that bothers him. It is the feeling that no matter how hard he works, no matter the choices and sacrifices he makes, he barely keeps his head above water \u2014 after a lifetime of watching white classmates, friends and co-workers excel, seemingly with ease.\u201cI\u2019m educated. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m ignorant. I try to speak intelligently. I try to carry myself, and even I get to the point where I just get frustrated and want to lash out,\u201d Alonzo said. \u201cThen I look at my cousins, my friends, people who I went to school with, people who I just see on the street on a daily basis. And I just see how they respond, how angry they get, and how they lash out.\u201dIt is the weight of an economic stagnation and anxiety that North St. Louis County\u2019s residents have carried over the years, and one of the factors that fueled the unrest following the police killing of the teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014.\u201cI can\u2019t condone it,\u201d Alonzo said of the disturbances, \u201cbut oh my God, I have to tell you how much I understand it.\u201dHe has done his best to get ahead. He served in the Navy, graduated from the University of Missouri, read up on I.R.A.s and 401(k)\u2019s \u2014 all the while remembering his grandfather, also a preacher, who spent his life picking cotton in Mississippi.What Alonzo knows about finances, he taught himself.Today, he is helping his son, who is his oldest child and an aspiring engineer, go to college locally. He and his wife spend more on rent than they can easily afford, but want their kids to grow up in a safe neighborhood.He may spend the rest of his life working, but at least he will have tried to set up his son and daughters for a life easier than his.\u201cThey are a product of their environment,\u201d Alonzo said, sitting at his dining room table over a cake his wife had baked. \u201cSo what environment am I willing to pay for now to ensure that they can have a better later?\u201dRyan Schuessler is a freelance journalist who grew up in St. Louis. He has lived in Chicago since 2015.Oakland, Calif.Christina Chung, 39, still remembers being one of just a few children in her middle school who lined up in the cafeteria for the free lunch program. It didn\u2019t make her feel bad, exactly, but she was aware that she came from one of the poorer families in her upper-middle-class Orange County, Calif., neighborhood. \u201cI was around a lot of people feeling that I didn\u2019t have what they had,\u201d she said.Now, as a mother of one with a second child on the way, she packs a lot of lunches and realizes food is an easy way to spend and to save. \u201cSo we cook at home a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe rarely do takeout or delivery.\u201dChristina is Korean-American. Her parents met in Southern California and \u201cwere all about assimilation and the American dream,\u201d she said. When Christina was little, her father worked as a computer scientist and the family bought a small home, but he had flashy tastes, \u201clike buying a new Acura.\u201d Her mom was more practical and \u201cwould immediately return it.\u201dChristina\u2019s father struggled with mental illness, and life got harder as he got older. He owned a gas station for a while, then couldn\u2019t hold down a job or be an effective parent; he died when she was 13.Her mother went from being a stay-at-home mom for Christina and her younger sister to working multiple jobs as a translator, a thrift store manager and an office assistant for a car repair shop.Christina worked, too, babysitting, then at various jobs throughout high school. \u201cIf we wanted to buy a CD, we had to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no asking Mom for that.\u201dChristina took out student loans to attend the California Institute of the Arts, then went into education. She chose a career that offers modest financial rewards in order to focus on service. \u201cWork for me was about finding meaning,\u201d she said of her job as a curriculum developer. \u201cThe money was secondary.\u201dShe is cleareyed about the consequences and benefits of her choices. She loves the creative life she has built with her husband, an administrator in an independent school, and their 4-year-old daughter in an apartment in the Temescal district with stable, under-market-rate rent. They both D.J. on the side and have a rich community of friends \u2014 she works a 30-hour week to have more time with their daughter.But, she says, she sometimes wonders if she is \u201clike super-insane to have so little money.\u201dThe couple only started using credit cards a couple of years ago and have no debt, but little savings. The bulk of what Christina earns goes toward rent and child care. They cannot save enough for a down payment on an apartment or house of their own.\u201cI have always had expensive taste, but I won\u2019t go into debt,\u201d she said. \u201cLike this couch. It\u2019s falling apart but it\u2019s Room & Board. I always try to find the things I like but used, like on Craigslist.\u201dChristina feels a deep allegiance to her diverse Oakland neighborhood. But as it gentrifies she realizes they are, in some ways, trapped. Skyrocketing rents mean \u201cwe couldn\u2019t even afford to rent another house on this block right now.\u201dMeanwhile, as real estate values escalate, the local elementary school still ranks poorly. \u201cWhy would we send our kids to that school when no one else I know would ever put it in their top five?\u201dNow Christina is expecting their second child. The couple waited to conceive until their first daughter would be entering kindergarten so they could avoid double day care costs.They\u2019re committed to sending their children to public school, but quality concerns have driven Christina to at least consider private options if she can find a place that costs around what they already pay for preschool. The change, however, would place a serious squeeze on the family budget.What about college? Christina said her children will be expected to attend college \u2014 just as she and her sister were \u2014 and to pay for it. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting a free ride from us,\u201d she said with a laugh.Jeanne Carstensen is a writer in San Francisco. She is the former managing editor of The Bay Citizen and Salon.com.Duquesne, Pa.In Tara Thompson\u2019s weekly calculations on how to scrape by on $20,000 a year, her daughters are always at the heart of the equation.Kayla, 18, is a busy high school senior planning for college. Kaiya, a 15-year-old sophomore, is training to be a nurse at a vocational school where she spends half her days. Tara tries to make sure they have clothes, food and field trips, which is no easy task when you are a single parent earning less than half the county\u2019s median income.\u201cAs long as my kids have everything they need,\u201d she said, \u201cwhatever I can do that week, I do. Whatever I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dShe said she knows that money shapes the way people think about you. \u201cThe way you dress and look and the way you eat: Everything is based on what you can afford to do, and people judge you on that,\u201d she said.Tara, 39, works as a home aide in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh, earning $12 an hour caring for people in their 90s. She is paid only if she shows up \u2014 if her clients are sick, or if she is, less money comes in that day. \u201cMy last paycheck was lower than normal because my daughter had the flu and was in the hospital for three days,\u201d she said, \u201cso I missed work.\u201dShe would be more than willing to get a second job, but her daughters\u2019 school district does not have any activity buses, and so she needs to drive them around in the afternoons.That is especially challenging because the city where the Thompsons live, Duquesne, Pa., became so poor five years ago that it could no longer afford to maintain a high school, and its students were divided between two nearby districts.Duquesne was once part of a bustling, economically vibrant stretch of steel mill cities along the Monongahela River, which flows into Pittsburgh. Most of the mills shut down more than 30 years ago, and today, Duquesne is mostly African-American, with a median household income that is about the same as Tara\u2019s.To make ends meet, Tara and her daughters live in the home of her sister, who is a nurse. Also sharing the five-bedroom house is their mother and her sister\u2019s son.\u201cI have looked at a couple of other places to live, but they need a $1,500 deposit or the first and last month\u2019s rent,\u201d Tara said. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t want to move my kids into the projects because of the alcohol and drug addictions and the danger.\u201dBeside her earnings, Tara gets about $3,400 a year in child support from Kayla\u2019s father, and she relies heavily on her earned-income tax credit each year, which ranges from $6,000 to $7,000.\u201cWhen I get my income tax check,\u201d she said, \u201cI pay off whatever bills I have and then it\u2019s gone.\u201dA big part of what sustains her is her church, First Presbyterian Church of Duquesne, where she is an ordained elder.\u201cI grew up afraid of God,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I said or did something someone didn\u2019t like, I was told I was going to burn in hell. When I started going to this church 14 years ago, I saw for the first time what God really wanted for me.\u201cI still struggle a lot, but the difference now is, I know that God is with me.\u201dMark Roth is a freelance writer who was an editor and reporter at The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for 33 years, retiring in 2015. He also teaches science writing at Carnegie Mellon University.Scottsdale, Ariz.Somehow, over more than three decades in the Phoenix area, David and Laura Demson, husband-and-wife haircutters, have hopscotched through 10 or so hair-salon locations and raised three children.What goes around comes around, and now their business, Salon Rock, is only 13 doors away from the Scottsdale bar where they first met in 1984 when it was called Cowgirls.David, 54, looks like David Lee Roth, the rock singer, and Laura, 57, looks like Nancy Wilson, the blond guitarist from Heart.Despite their rock star looks, they say they rarely drink, they don\u2019t do drugs, and they regularly attend Grace Chapel, a local evangelical charismatic church.Faith and music, secular and nonsecular, are big parts of their lives.The $100 white guitar that Laura threw out the window after a fight with David hangs on the wall of Salon Rock. The drums from one of David\u2019s first bands, Foreplay, sit next to the cashier\u2019s desk; their daughter, Rain, 21, plays them when they hold a concert in the salon.They have been together for 32 years, and their banter can sometimes turn contentious. Their son, River Jordan Demson, 22, leaves when they start to raise their voices.\u201cI am more of a realist, he\u2019s a dreamer totally,\u201d Laura said of David.What do they argue about? Money. \u201cWhen you have no money, there\u2019s a lot of stress,\u201d Laura said.In their lush periods, mostly in the 1990s (when they were able to charge as much as $150 for a haircut and coloring), they made as much as $100,000 a year. Now they are lucky to make $48,000 a year, slightly below the local median household income of $50,000.A mishandling (by David) of payroll taxes brought large tax penalties from the Internal Revenue Service in 1988 and ruined their credit rating.The 2008 recession hit them especially hard. They had to scrimp and were not able to save. Laura has no savings account. David has the minimum $5 in his. \u201cWe are flying by the seat of our pants,\u201d David said.Money was so tight, the Demsons used food stamps and food banks to get by. David, a diabetic, gets insulin and other treatments under the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the state\u2019s Medicaid agency for low-income people.Recently, the Demsons and two of their children moved in with David\u2019s mother. She has a nearby 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house, fully paid for. \u201cHow do we get by?\u201d David said. \u201cWe live rent-free.\u201dDavid\u2019s mother, Peggy, 84, allowed him to take out a $50,000 second mortgage \u2014 $30,000 to remodel Salon Rock and $20,000 for surgery to reset River\u2019s jaw, flawed since infancy.The couple has given up going to the movies, eating out and vacationing in San Diego. Laura misses makeup and mostly uses the free samples from stores\u2019 bonus programs.\u201cLooking back, I wish our parents, who knew about money, taught us more about money,\u201d said Laura, who was one of eight children. Her father was a General Motors executive, and her mother was a jazz singer.\u201cFor our own kids,\u201d David said, \u201cwe\u2019re teaching by example.\u201dAnthony Ramirez is a former reporter for The New York Times. He has lived in Scottsdale for four years.Tacoma, Wash.Jordan Hightower took her American-history students from the Tacoma School of the Arts to Washington, D.C., in January to witness President Trump\u2019s swearing-in. By the time she and her students traveled back home, Mr. Trump had issued a flurry of executive orders and she was even more assured of the trip\u2019s success.\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting,\u201d said Jordan, 31, a graduate of Washington State University. \u201cI\u2019ve been instructing them that there are limits to the presidency.\u201dJordan, a Democrat, was dismayed to hear that one of the president\u2019s first acts was to suspend a planned cut in housing-loan insurance rates. While the Tacoma housing market is not quite as hot as Seattle\u2019s, prices are escalating. It\u2019s another challenge for millennials trying to buy into the American dream.\u201cAny move on those loan insurance rates can make the difference of $50 or $100 a month,\u201d said Jordan, who has just a small amount of savings.For now, buying a house is on the back burner. When it comes to decisions about money, she factors in an unusually painful but important chapter of personal history.In January 2010, her younger sister was killed in the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti. Molly Hightower had traveled to Port-au-Prince to volunteer with Friends of the Orphans and was working with children when the building they were in collapsed.Her sister\u2019s death made Jordan rethink most things in her life. \u201cOne of the biggest things was my \u2018one day\u2019 mentality,\u201d she said. \u201cI was stockpiling away money, waiting for \u2014 I don\u2019t know: a partner, a better job, more money \u2014 unclear. But I was waiting to do the things I always wanted to do.\u201dWhen her sister died, Jordan was 24. Molly was 22. \u201cI realized that waiting to experience life was stupid because hers had been taken so suddenly and I could be next,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI began living.\u201dFor Jordan, who has two brothers and whose father is a general manager of a steel mill in the Puget Sound area, that meant travel. Over the last seven years, she has visited 23 countries, backpacking for weeks at a time during breaks from her teaching job in Tacoma.\u201cI have run marathons, bought a car, seen hundreds of events and shows \u2014 including musicals, plays, concerts, sporting events \u2014 and have gone to a dozen bachelorette parties around the nation, celebrated friends in a variety of ways and fallen in love,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of those things are worth the small number in my bank account to me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a huge savings,\u201d she said, adding that if something were to happen, she would have support from her parents, Mike and Mary, until she got back on her feet.And now Jordan has another big-ticket financial item on the horizon. When she returned from Washington, D.C., Michael surprised her by proposing. He took her to the pier on the Tacoma harbor, and friends, family members and a photographer were there.\u201cThese weddings are such a burden we put on each other,\u201d Jordan said, referring to herself and her friends. \u201cBut now that I\u2019m getting married, it\u2019s my turn to get back some of the money I\u2019ve spent the past few years!\u201dLaura Vecsey is a freelance writer specializing in real estate news. Previously, she was a sports and political columnist in Harrisburg, Pa.; Baltimore; Seattle; and Albany.Tampa, Fla.\u201cIt\u2019s my passion and it\u2019s my lifestyle,\u201d said Martin, 25, a Mexican-American who is among the first generation of his family to be born in the United States. \u201cIt makes me happy and keeps me sane. I see myself being very successful. At the same time, right now, I have a family to take care of.\u201dAnd that is his priority.Martin and his wife, Raquel, have two daughters, Maria, 6, and Emily, 3. Raquel once worked as a personal banker, but now stays home to raise the children.\u201cIt\u2019s a financial sacrifice, but we don\u2019t want to just drop them at day care and miss out on so much time,\u201d Raquel said. \u201cYou never get that time back. Time is more important than money.\u201dHe has two to three fights a year, and he is paid by performance, plus funds from sponsors and a percentage of the ticket sales. But right now, that doesn\u2019t account for much of his income.Things are looking up. There\u2019s stability, no debt and a rental home for his family that was secured through one of his clients.\u201cEverybody wants a nice house, but I don\u2019t want a mansion, not even a huge house,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI just want comfort for my family. We don\u2019t need a lot of material things. Maybe I\u2019d like to take them on a nice family vacation, something like that.\u201cPeople say they\u2019d like to win the lottery. I don\u2019t think I do. Money can\u2019t buy you happiness. That mind-set starts young. When you come from nothing or very little, you tend to appreciate everything you have. I\u2019m more grateful for that than almost anything.\u201dMartin\u2019s parents, Ignacio and Gloria, immigrated from Mexico and raised five children, mostly in New Jersey before moving to Florida. His father was a truck driver, and Martin sometimes accompanied him on long trips as he hauled cargo. His mother was a delivery person who had regular work throughout New York\u2019s office buildings, including the Twin Towers.\u201cI can\u2019t say we were comfortable because it was a constant financial struggle,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut my parents did their best. Compared to where they came from, our life was luxurious,\u201d even when the family living space was about 800 square feet shared by seven people, a small home attached to the Mexican restaurant they operated.Martin first met Raquel when they were in high school, working at competing fragrance kiosks at the mall. At first, she was suspicious of her business rival, but was soon won over by his kindhearted personality and ambition.It has not always been easy and fun. In one of their first apartments, they could not pay the electric bill, so they ate Chick-fil-A by candlelight, telling their oldest daughter that it was a camping party.\u201cMoney is not going to determine our happiness,\u201d Raquel said. \u201cI believe in Martin. We\u2019re going to be just fine.\u201dMartin said that his parents opened his eyes and taught him \u201cthere\u2019s a very big world out there. We have a lot of opportunity in this country.\u201cI feel I can do anything. I just happen to be a fighter. That\u2019s what I know. We\u2019re so much better off than most people. I\u2019m young and have a beautiful family. I am living the dream.\u201dJoey Johnston was a sportswriter at The Tampa Tribune and St. Petersburg Times for 36 years until 2016. A lifelong resident of Tampa, he is now president of Johnston Communications.DallasAnna Hill exudes confidence. She founded a community group and routinely faces down City Hall officials over conditions in Dolphin Heights, her lower-income neighborhood in southeast Dallas.Behind her self-assurance, however, the 76-year-old worries about being able to pay her mortgage.In 1990, after renting for much of their lives, Anna and her husband, Daniel, bought a 936-square-foot two-bedroom house, built in 1923, for $17,500. In 1992, they decided to buy life insurance so they could pay off the house if one of them died. But Daniel died the day before they were supposed to sign the papers.\u201cThat was kind of a hard time,\u201d Anna said. She was making good money, she said, as a home health care contractor. But her mother fell and she needed to take care of her full time. Now Anna is the sole caregiver for her mother, who is 98. An 88-year-old friend also lives with them.For her live-in friend, who has glaucoma, out-of-pocket medical expenses in the first five weeks of 2017 reached $1,000.\u201cI hear people at the pharmacy counter say, \u2018Just put that back because I\u2019ve got to buy food,\u2019\u201d Anna said. Unexpected medical bills are a big worry. \u201cTo be honest, that keeps me awake.\u201dShe dislikes credit. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in what you need, you get,\u201d she said. She saved for two and a half years to pay cash for a five-burner gas range. \u201cWe don\u2019t really eat out,\u201d she said. \u201cI do all the cooking.\u201dSometimes Anna has had to borrow: to buy the house; to replace the heating and air-conditioning, for which she still owes $500; and for new windows to reduce utility bills. The hardest lesson she\u2019s learned about money: \u201cBudget.\u201dShe has her indulgences: She tends the community garden next door and drinks the occasional glass of white wine.\u201cMy biggest luxury is Sunday school and church,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I miss, I get grumpy.\u201dShe traces her feelings about money to her grandmother, who raised her and her brother until Anna was 12. They lived in servants\u2019 quarters in a white neighborhood near downtown Dallas.Her grandmother supported them by taking in laundry from detectives, police officers and businessmen, washing their white shirts in a black three-legged pot and hanging them on a line. \u201cWe never went without anything,\u201d Anna said. \u201cKnowing what I know now, I know it was hard.\u201d\u201cWe grew up happy,\u201d she added. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201dShe voted for Hillary Clinton because she objected to President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall and his characterizations of immigrants. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I would have voted for her just because of the economy,\u201d Anna said.But her friends see hardened attitudes \u2014 reinforced since the election \u2014 toward the poor. \u201cSome of them are scared,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them are worried that they\u2019ll wind up back on the street.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t think that four years from now, when she is 80, economic conditions for people in her situation will be great. But \u201cI\u2019ll be O.K.,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I know how to do without.\u201dRandy Lee Loftis is a freelance journalist focusing on environment, science and history.

{"Headline": "More Campaign Money Hasn\u2019t Stopped Political Stumbles for Paul Massey", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byWith Mayor Bill de Blasio freed from the weight of possible criminal charges connected to fund-raising practices, his path to re-election appears cleared of all but one notable challenger: Paul J. Massey Jr., a real estate sales executive and first-time candidate.But after several months in the running, Mr. Massey, a Republican, is still on a steep learning curve.Despite a robust and well-paid staff, Mr. Massey has not articulated positions on many key city issues; failed to notice the timing of the City Council speaker\u2019s state of the city speech before scheduling his first news conference at the same hour (his staff rescheduled it after being alerted to the conflict by a reporter); and misspoke about the mayor and town halls at a Republican debate, saying the mayor never held such events, when at that moment the mayor was in fact holding one.Of all the challenges, the spending has been the most apparent. Absent loans to himself, which have reached about $2 million, Mr. Massey has spent more money on campaign staff, consultants and fund-raising than he has taken in, according to campaign filings.Mr. Massey\u2019s campaign disputed the notion of any early stumbles and said he was sticking to a strategy and pointed to poll numbers \u2014 a 59-to-25 deficit in a head-to-head race with the mayor \u2014 as an indication that the hitherto unknown executive was gathering momentum.\u201cWhen one in four New Yorkers support Paul Massey\u2019s candidacy even before the campaign is in full swing, you should probably be giving us credit for doing a lot right,\u201d said Mollie Fullington, a campaign spokeswoman.E. O\u2019Brien Murray, a Republican political operative who managed the campaign of former Representative Bob Turner of Queens, offered his own assessment. \u201cFrom the beginning there has always been a question of the number of consultants he is hiring without having the appropriate leadership in place to run a campaign,\u201d said Mr. Murray, who also advised Joseph J. Lhota\u2019s 2013 mayoral campaign.Mr. Murray said Mr. Massey had so far been taken advantage of by consultants and had \u201cnothing to show\u201d for all its spending.Mr. Massey, who earned millions as a real estate sales executive and until recently lived in Westchester, still has months to go before the Republican primary, should there be one, to hone his message, meet New Yorkers and increase his name recognition.In an interview on Monday, Mr. Massey pointed to the latest fund-raising figures \u2014 about $860,000 over two months \u2014 as a sign that his campaign was resonating with New Yorkers. \u201cThere\u2019s a groundswell of support for my candidacy; I\u2019m feeling that,\u201d he said.He said he had no problem with the level of spending \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m all about bringing the best team to the table\u201d \u2014 and said that the campaign so far had been successful.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would I do differently? The simple answer is nothing.\u201dThe most recent filings showed that 95 donors gave Mr. Massey the maximum allowable contribution of $4,950, amounting to more than half his total for the two-month filing period. The forms also showed that a few additions to his stable of Republican consultants, including Harold E. Doley III, the campaign\u2019s top African-American aide (paid $15,000), and Michael Fragin, an Orthodox Jewish aide (paid $5,000), both assigned to community outreach.Mr. Massey also got a boost on Monday: Eric Ulrich, a young and charismatic city councilman who had been considering running for the Republican nomination, bowed out of the race.Mr. Massey still has a long way to go, though. When he attended the St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, he could not walk behind a banner, since they are not permitted for candidates or elected officials. Staff members had to rush ahead to tell the crowd who the businessman was as he stepped up to shake hands.Mr. Massey has not always been comfortable with the harsh light of a campaign or the sort of get-to-know-you questions asked of a candidate.

{"Headline": "Matters of Public Record: Rich Resource for Reporters", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byBack from Jerusalem, where he served as interim bureau chief from April to July of last year, the Times investigative reporter James Glanz was interested in doing a \u201ccool story about cancer.\u201dDr. Carlo Croce, a prolific cancer research scientist, came to his attention \u2014 along with allegations that Dr. Croce had falsified data in research he financed with more than $86 million in federal grants. Mr. Glanz\u2019s interest led to the front-page story about Dr. Croce and his employer, Ohio State University, which reaped millions of dollars from the grants. The story raises questions about science and who is in the best position to police scientific endeavors.It is also, as Mr. Glanz says, a story about open records and their value to an investigative reporter, and the public.\u201cOhio is paradise for open documents,\u201d Mr. Glanz said, meaning that all state records, from the Buckeye State\u2019s courthouses as well as its university system, are open to anyone who wants to look. And Ohio State, which said it had spent more money supporting Dr. Croce\u2019s research than it had received in grants, was nonetheless responsive to requests for records about Dr. Croce and his work.Beginning in December, documents appeared in Mr. Glanz\u2019s email inbox, in what Agustin Armendariz, who worked with Mr. Glanz, calls three big dumps.Mr. Glanz and Mr. Armendariz have both worked on assignments that involved document requests that went exactly nowhere; but here, as Mr. Armendariz says, \u201cthe documents arrived, and lights just started shooting out of the box.\u201dSurveying the documents, Mr. Glanz saw that there had been more investigations into Dr. Croce\u2019s work than the reporters knew. And that the university had investigated Dr. Croce and repeatedly cleared him of wrongdoing. Ohio State also confirmed that Dr. Croce had received $852,759 in total compensation from the university in 2015 \u2014 a number they found online.\u201cThat struck us as a big number,\u201d said Mr. Armendariz, who added that \u201c$852,759 would likely go a long way in Columbus, Ohio.\u201d Mr. Armendariz said the figure supplied another indication of Dr. Croce\u2019s value to the university. A far fuller story than the reporters had imagined now lay before them.\u201cIt almost never happens that you get confirmation like we did here,\u201d said Mr. Glanz, \u201cand it\u2019s very exciting when it does.\u201dIn a campus interview and a statement issued by his legal team, Dr. Croce denied that he \u2014 or anyone in the lab he oversaw \u2014 intentionally falsified data or otherwise breached rules of scientific conduct. Questions, however, remained: How exactly, for example, given its financial connection with Dr. Croce\u2019s work, could Ohio State conduct a disinterested investigation into Dr. Croce?Mr. Glanz\u2019s reporting led to another trove of useful public documents: the Tobacco Control Archives, records on tobacco industry practices maintained by the University of California, San Francisco, which are open to the public. Those records revealed Dr. Croce\u2019s association with the Council for Tobacco Research, an organization that, a federal court found, played a central role in a conspiracy to deceive the public about the dangers of smoking. Mr. Glanz noted that Dr. Croce\u2019s name had been used to support tobacco company witnesses who questioned the connection between smoking and cancer. (Dr. Croce has said that long before he joined the council he believed that smoking caused cancer, and that he did not know his name had been used in this way.)Familiar now with the new information and allegations about Dr. Croce\u2019s work, Mr. Glanz went to Ohio State and inquired about scientific practices there and about who was in the best position to police scientific standards. In response, the university decided to have a fresh look at allegations made against one of its biggest rainmakers, and it has organized an independent, external review.Rarely do reporters encounter as few obstacles as they did in this case. \u201cHere, everything just kept adding up,\u201d Mr. Armendariz said. The story, he added, is a reminder of the importance of keeping public information where it belongs, open and accessible to the public.Advertisement"}

But one evening late last month, the Harvard Club in Midtown was as good a place as any to go looking for the intellectual future of conservatism.Not that the words \u201cDonald Trump\u201d came up during the presentation, though Julius Krein, the journal\u2019s 31-year-old founder and editor, did pay the man sideways tribute with a quotation from the French critic Roland Barthes\u2019s classic 1957 essay \u201cThe World of Wrestling.\u201d\u201cOur politics, like Barthes\u2019s wrestling, has become a spectacle of excess, which has no sense of time, and no logic of the future,\u201d Mr. Krein said, drawing a chuckle from the crowd of more than 100. He then turned to a dead-serious matter: rethinking the entire post-Cold War policy consensus.\u201cWe in America no longer have any idea what the future should be, much less how to build it together,\u201d he said.\u201cA lot of people on the right are looking back and seeing an agenda that is a complete failure, presided over by a bunch of nonentities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201dMr. Krein says the point is exactly the opposite. \u201cTrump is not like them, and that\u2019s what makes him attractive \u2014 at least on a policy basis,\u201d he said.He continued: \u201cThere has to be a sense of a distinct political community. I don\u2019t think it has to be ethnic or racial, but there has to be a distinct American citizenship that matters.\u201dMr. Krein grew up in Eureka, S.D., and studied political philosophy at Harvard with the noted conservative scholar Harvey C. Mansfield before going into finance, working at Bank of America, the Blackstone Group and smaller firms. (He now works full-time on the journal.)He\u2019s also a skilled connector, as the crowd at the Harvard Club attested. The main event was a discussion of globalization between Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and Trump supporter, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, the president and chief executive of the left-leaning think tank New America. (Mr. Krein said he met Mr. Thiel several years ago though a reading group dedicated to the philosopher Leo Strauss.)William Kristol of The Weekly Standard, a staunch Never-Trumper, summed up the crowd as \u201ca mix of normal people who come to conservative events, some interesting people who are distinctively Trumpian and a few lunatics.\u201dAnd himself? \u201cI\u2019m representing the deep state,\u201d Mr. Kristol joked.The journalist Michael Lind, a member of the magazine\u2019s advisory board (and a former conservative turned advocate of \u201cliberal nationalism\u201d), credited Mr. Krein with \u201ctrying to scramble the categories of left, right and center.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a partisan realignment,\u201d Mr. Lind said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re now seeing is an intellectual realignment, as both parties\u2019 intellectuals try to catch up with their bases.\u201dThe first issue of American Affairs is similarly eclectic, if more squarely in the policy journal tradition. Mr. Anton wrote a critique of \u201cthe liberal international order,\u201d and the economist David P. Goldman, better known for his columns under the pen name Spengler, contributed a chart-heavy essay on technology and the United States. Mr. Krein\u2019s essay on James Burnham\u2019s critique of the \u201cmanagerial elite\u201d takes whacks at both parties.The second issue, Mr. Krein said, will include more surprises, mixing newcomers with some prominent names one wouldn\u2019t expect to see there. As for the biggest name in American politics, Mr. Krein said the magazine took no \u201cintellectual cues\u201d from President Trump.\u201cThese are our ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope there\u2019s some overlap, but we aren\u2019t going to sit around cheerleading the administration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "General Motors: A Brand Is a Terrible Thing to Waste", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBut any benefit of the $2.9 billion sale is worrisomely short-term, an unwelcome skid away from the passenger-car technology. Any gain for G.M. in selling off the divisions known for building some of its most sophisticated small- and medium-sized passenger cars is outweighed by the real hazard to the corporation\u2019s longer-term health as well as that of the world\u2019s population, who most clearly don\u2019t benefit from greater emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants associated with larger, less fuel efficient cars. Along with G.M.\u2019s decision to join other car companies that have pleaded for a rollback of pending fuel economy regulations, the sale raises the question of how much G.M. learned from previous energy crises and its 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout.But if anything seems shortsighted about the sale, it is the self-inflicted loss of passenger- and small-car engineering smarts that Opel represents. With the Trump administration\u2019s avowed intention of rolling back Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards and frontal assaults on the Environmental Protection Agency and other air-quality regulators, G.M. has seemingly forgotten all the earnest statements it made back in 2009 when it was seeking a federal bailout. Back then, it just couldn\u2019t wait to get the Chevy Volt into production, and it promised it was going to be a responsible partner in cleaning up the environment it helped pollute. Now it wants to sell more gas-guzzling Chevy Suburbans, which are so much cheaper to make and more profitable to sell than ordinary-size Chevy Cruzes and Buick Regals that, well, they just can\u2019t help themselves.The last time gas prices soared, G.M.\u2019s lack of competitive passenger cars helped, along with a failing economy, push it into bankruptcy. And giving up on Opel (whose models are rebadged as Vauxhalls for the British market) is a big step in the direction of not having competitive passenger cars. Opel is a key center of G.M. excellence, competing with high credibility in the tough German market, where cars with superior safety, economy and driving dynamics are expected, unlike in the United States and China. In Opel therefore one finds what is arguably G.M.\u2019s finest assemblage of experience, knowledge and smarts in the world of passenger and small car design. Many of today\u2019s most dynamic G.M. passenger-car offerings \u2014 its best Buick sedans, for instance \u2014 are rebadged Opels. Moreover, the loss figures claimed for Opel and Vauxhall in Europe don\u2019t account for the revenue generated by these vehicle designs worldwide when sold under G.M. nameplates.Walking out on Europe and its European workers may be a recipe for short-term profit, but in the long term it could sting. The nativist impulse to quit the world\u2019s third-largest car market may suit the mood in Washington. But as G.M. ought to know by now, it\u2019s easier fixing a brand than starting a new one.Jamie Lincoln Kitman, a lawyer, is the New York bureau chief for Automobile Magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Gorsuch the Clerk Met Kennedy the Justice: A Tale of Luck", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a stroke of luck that landed Neil M. Gorsuch in the chambers of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on a summer day nearly a quarter-century ago.Then 25 and fresh off a year at Oxford, Judge Gorsuch had been hired by Justice Byron R. White for the most coveted apprenticeship in American law \u2014 a Supreme Court clerkship. But because Justice White had retired, Judge Gorsuch was also assigned, by happenstance, to Justice Kennedy, the longtime center of power at the Supreme Court.It also produced something else: a lasting bond between an ambitious, already staunchly conservative clerk and a justice, three decades his senior, whose style and temperament appear to have rubbed off on him, even if the justice\u2019s more moderate views did not.While Judge Gorsuch learned a great deal in Justice Kennedy\u2019s chambers, the lessons seem to have been more personal than political.Where Trump\u2019s nominee falls on the court\u2019s ideological spectrum.Judge Gorsuch\u2019s critics say his own mild and courteous manner masks a fierce commitment to a right-wing agenda, and political scientists say he is likely to vote with the court\u2019s most conservative justices rather than with Justice Kennedy. In closely divided cases, Justice Kennedy often holds the crucial vote, and he generally leans right. He wrote the majority opinion, for instance, in the Citizens United campaign finance case.But in recent years, Justice Kennedy has joined the court\u2019s four-member liberal wing in major cases establishing a right to same-sex marriage, protecting abortion rights and upholding affirmative action.On the federal appeals court in Denver for more than a decade, Judge Gorsuch has cited Justice Kennedy by name from time to time. But he has been much more likely to cite Justice Scalia.To his fellow law clerks, Judge Gorsuch was neither particularly dogmatic nor calculating. Instead, interviews with more than a dozen clerks and a review of papers housed at the Library of Congress paint a picture of someone with a dogged work ethic, an understated but appealing presence and a sense of fairness tempered by cautious judgment.Justice Kennedy taught his law clerks by example, Judge Kavanaugh said, instilling in them an independent frame of mind and a \u201cgentlemanly tone.\u201d\u201cA lot of us have tried to emulate that in our careers,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh said. \u201cNeil has exemplified that better than anybody.\u201dThough he worked in the chambers of Justice Kennedy as a \u201cstep clerk,\u201d as well as for Justice White (retired justices remain entitled to a clerk), idiosyncratic hiring practices may have helped him.\u201cJustice White probably would have seen echoes of himself in a way in Neil,\u201d said Mr. Meyer, who is now the dean of Tulane University Law School.\u201cHe did not serve as an editor on The Harvard Law Review,\u201d Professor Peppers said. \u201cMoreover, he \u2018only\u2019 graduated cum laude \u2014 which suggests that his grades might not have been as high as the typical Supreme Court law clerk.\u201dJudge Gorsuch cut an impressive, if not particularly ideological, figure. Surrounded by a class of elite law graduates that included a handful of future federal judges and acclaimed academics, his \u201cquiet intelligence\u201d was notable, said Louis Feldman, who clerked for Justice Scalia that year.\u201cSome people just have that aura around them,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cYou know this is someone who has the ability and the personality to go far in the legal world.\u201dMostly, Judge Gorsuch was affable and unflappable. He was not, by several former colleagues\u2019 accounts, a member of the regular pickup basketball games in the Supreme Court\u2019s fifth-floor gym, known around the building as the \u201chighest court in the land.\u201d But he was a regular at clerk social events and occasional lunches hosted by each of the justices.Justice Kennedy, like most justices then and now, assigned his law clerks to a shared labor pool that streamlined the work of reviewing incoming cases to make recommendations about which petitions should be granted.Judge Gorsuch\u2019s memorandums, which are available in the papers of Justice Harry A. Blackmun, were thorough and fair-minded.In one, there are glimmers of the light touch that would characterize his later writing. In summarizing a petition from a civil servant fired by the Army, Judge Gorsuch seemed to suppress a smile. \u201cPetitioner discusses at length General William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019s decision to march through Georgia,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand then turns to describe in detail the technology of modern attack helicopters.\u201d\u201cWe had a wide range of views, but we all really got along well,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh said of the five clerks that term, who were chosen in part to represent different points on the political spectrum.When in 2006 Judge Gorsuch joined the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Justice Kennedy administered the oath to him in Denver and delivered a reminder of that principle.Peter Baker contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Obamacare Took Months to Craft; Repeal May Be Much Swifter", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In June 2009, House Democratic leaders unveiled the first draft of legislation that would ultimately become the Affordable Care Act. A month later, three House committees began formally drafting the bill ahead of a House vote that came well into the fall, after the summer heat had dissipated and the leaves had begun to change.On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee will formally mark up legislation to repeal and replace the act \u2014 less than 48 hours after Republicans unveiled the bill to the public. If all goes according to plan, the House will vote within a few weeks, and the Senate will take up the legislation before its spring recess begins on April 7.Republicans excoriated Democrats for rushing passage of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark health law \u2014 blasting \u201cback-room deals\u201d and cheering on the nascent Tea Party movement, with its hostile chant \u201cRead the bill, read the bill.\u201d But Republicans have adopted a much more aggressive timetable for repealing the law and remaking Medicaid, the health program for more than 70 million low-income people.\u201cThe difference between 2009 and 2017 is like black and white,\u201d said former Senator Max Baucus of Montana, one of the chief architects of the Affordable Care Act, who spent countless hours in hearings and negotiations on the legislation as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a chasm. There\u2019s no comparison.\u201dSpeaker Paul D. Ryan said the House would pass the repeal bill within a few weeks, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said that if the House kept to that timetable, the legislation \u201cwill be on the agenda here in the Senate\u201d before the spring recess.In comparison with the pace of work on the Affordable Care Act, that is lightning fast.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much it will cost, and we don\u2019t know if this bill will make health care more affordable for Americans,\u201d Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is exactly the type of back-room dealing and rushed process that we criticized Democrats for.\u201dRepresentative Jim Jordan, a conservative Republican from Ohio who objects to major provisions of the bill devised by House Republican leaders, said, \u201cThe American people don\u2019t want us to rush this thing.\u201dIn June and July 2009, with Democrats in charge, the Senate health committee spent nearly 60 hours over 13 days marking up the bill that became the Affordable Care Act. That September and October, the Senate Finance Committee worked on the legislation for eight days \u2014 its longest markup in two decades. It considered more than 130 amendments and held 79 roll-call votes.The full Senate debated the health care bill for 25 straight days before passing it on Dec. 24, 2009.\u201cAfter years of howling at the moon about Democrats rushing through the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, Republicans are now racing to pass the repeal bill because \u201cthey don\u2019t want anyone to know what\u2019s in the bill.\u201dDemocrats complained that the Republicans were rushing to approve a repeal bill without hearing from consumers, health care providers, insurance companies or state officials \u2014 and without having estimates of the cost or the impact on coverage from the Congressional Budget Office.Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, denied that Republicans were cutting corners to speed approval of their repeal bill.\u201cIn fact,\u201d he said on Tuesday, \u201cthe bill went online live for the entire American people, all of you, all of us to read, all of our colleagues to read, at 6 o\u2019clock last night. It\u2019s not that much to get through. It\u2019s pretty well understood.\u201dThe Republicans\u2019 bill is indeed much shorter than the Affordable Care Act. With one paragraph of their bill, they can obliterate 10 or 20 pages of the law. One of their chief goals is to eliminate detailed federal standards, like those that define the permissible value of insurance plans \u2014 bronze, silver, gold and platinum.Another previous complaint by Republicans seems to apply now. For years, Republicans have reminded voters that the Affordable Care Act passed without any Republican votes. If they now repeal it, they are unlikely to have a single Democrat with them.In 2009, Democratic senators negotiated with Republicans for months in hopes of finding common ground, but Republicans now do not expect any help from Democrats.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do this with Democrats,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican.In remarks prepared for the Ways and Means Committee meeting on Wednesday, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said: \u201cBad process makes for bad policy. And the process we are using today is not only bad; it\u2019s reckless. Almost no time to review the bill, no hearings on the bill, no C.B.O. estimate of the cost or coverage impact \u2014 this is legislative malpractice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So, she took jobs as a health aide in an assisted living facility.Now, thanks to an unusual program that is training immigrants to become emergency medical technicians, she is preparing to make better use of her medical background and, she hopes, work her way up to becoming a physician assistant if not, someday, a doctor.\u201cI want to do what I was trained to do,\u201d Ms. Ntirumenyerwa, 37, said the other day as she took a break from her E.M.T. class, being conducted in a cavernous ambulance bay at Southern Maine Community College. \u201cI put in a lot of years training to be a physician, and I don\u2019t want to throw them away.\u201dBut the program goes beyond helping Ms. Ntirumenyerwa (pronounced t-roo-may-YAY-rwa) achieve her personal career goals. It is also helping to address some serious problems in Maine.Economists regard Maine\u2019s rapidly aging population as a demographic tsunami that has severe implications for the state\u2019s labor pool, health care system and overall socioeconomic well-being. But the state can grow, they say, with more international immigration \u2014 though that may become more difficult under the Trump administration.This is where the E.M.T. program comes in.\u201cThis program is a win-win-win,\u201d said David Zahn, chairman of the global languages department at the community college, which started the program.He said he basically put two and two together. Surveys showed that employers, especially municipal and private ambulance services, needed more E.M.T.s; other surveys showed that many immigrants in the Portland area are underemployed and have medical backgrounds.When the E.M.T. course for immigrants was announced, three times as many people applied as could be accommodated.The first class is small, with 13 participants. But to Dana Connors, the president of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, the program is a big step in the right direction. \u201cIt may be a small number, but it looms large in message and significance,\u201d Mr. Connors said. The program, he said, illustrates what opportunities exist \u201cwhen we recognize immigrants as part of our solution.\u201dMany of those opportunities are in health care. As residents live longer, the need for health care workers \u2014 and E.M.T.s \u2014 is only increasing.The E.M.T. shortage stems in part from the low pay \u2014 $10.50 an hour for an entry-level job, a result of low federal reimbursement rates, said Robert Russell, the chief executive of North East Mobile Health Services, a private medical transport company in nearby Scarborough. In addition, he said, training involves a major commitment of time. This course requires eight hours a week for 16 weeks.Mr. Russell said his company would interview the immigrants who successfully completed the course. He said he was grateful to have an expanded pool of applicants, especially people who are multilingual (Ms. Ntirumenyerwa, for example, speaks French, Lingala and Swahili, in addition to English) and who can bridge cultural divides. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge added benefit,\u201d he said, when employees reflect the customers they are serving.Paul Froman, the course instructor, said that he did not vary the program for the immigrants, and that they must pass the same tests and meet the same requirements for licensing as American-born participants. But because of their medical backgrounds, he said, the immigrants \u201care informed, and you can get a lot deeper.\u201dDavid Ngandu, 33, who was also a doctor in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is taking the E.M.T. course, said that in some ways, it was easier to treat patients here than in Africa because of the availability of equipment and supplies.\u201cFor example,\u201d he said, \u201coxygen is very expensive in the Congo. I knew what needed to be done, but I didn\u2019t always have the equipment.\u201dWhile many work force development programs help immigrants learn English, Mr. Zahn said, this is the first of which he is aware that teaches English in the context of E.M.T. training, with participants learning high-level terminology and a higher level of English than those in, say, the food services industry.\u201cBecause of their extensive medical backgrounds, we\u2019ll have people on ambulances who have a higher level of skill\u201d than some other newly minted E.M.T.s, Mr. Zahn said.And, he added, the program might help restore an underemployed immigrant\u2019s sense of dignity.\u201cThey are doctors,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re cleaning toilets? We\u2019re taking advantage of their skills and getting them back into their own arena.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen of France Meets With Vladimir Putin in Moscow", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Marine Le Pen, the French far right\u2019s presidential candidate, has never hidden her admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and on Friday she met with him in the Kremlin.Russian television broadcast images of Ms. Le Pen, gesticulating energetically across the table from a disengaged-looking Mr. Putin. Earlier, she called for \u201cdeveloping relations\u201d with Russia and \u201ccooperation\u201d in antiterrorism. Both were nods to her presidential campaign platform, which advocates closer ties with Mr. Putin, friendliness toward President Trump and rejection of the European Union.The Trump administration has shown itself sympathetic to Moscow, to the extent that pre-election contacts between the two sides are being investigated in the United States. In a crucial election year in Europe, campaigns are now peppered with parties and candidates that could sharply redirect ties with Moscow.Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s election-year challengers in Germany, on the left and the far right, tilt more easily toward Russia. The Five Star Movement in Italy, which presents a rising challenge to the political establishment if elections are held there this year, does as well.Then there is Ms. Le Pen, who Russian television reported had met earlier with parliamentary deputies in Moscow, while calling for the lifting of sanctions against Russia for its land grab in Ukraine.Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia has long been a source of aid for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front. In 2014, her party received a $9.7 million loan from a Russian bank; Ms. Le Pen said French banks were shunning her party. The loan nonetheless drew condemnation from the governing Socialists as an unsavory example of foreign financing for a French political party.Denying any quid pro quo, the National Front was the only French party to approve of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, and its officials have regularly called for the lifting of Western sanctions against Russia. National Front officials regularly visit Russia. From its earliest origins, the party has not been reticent about displaying an affinity for authoritarian leaders.\u201cI won\u2019t hide that, in a certain sense, I admire Vladimir Putin,\u201d Ms. Le Pen was quoted as saying in the Russian paper Kommersant in 2011. \u201cHe makes mistakes, but who doesn\u2019t? The situation in Russia is not easy.\u201dHer foreign policy positions in the 2017 campaign \u2014 Ms. Le Pen is favored to win in a first round of voting on April 23 but lose in the second round two weeks later \u2014 have a clear pro-Russian tilt. Aides have praised Ms. Le Pen\u2019s ideological closeness to both Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, saying she is well placed to form alliances with both.\u201cShe\u2019s the only one who can speak with both Putin and Trump,\u201d one of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s top lieutenants, Jean-Lin Lacapelle, said in an interview here two weeks ago.\u201cShe\u2019s got a privileged relationship with Putin,\u201d said Mr. Lacapelle, a longtime friend of Ms. Le Pen. \u201cYou can\u2019t be isolated when you\u2019ve got both Putin and Trump on your side.\u201dAsked whether the Le Pen campaign was in touch with Trump officials, Mr. Lacapelle would say only, \u201cThere are lots of things going on.\u201dIn a fiercely nationalist speech to diplomats in Paris last month, Ms. Le Pen criticized the European Union, which she wants France to leave, for having \u201cmistreated\u201d Russia, calling Russia an \u201cindispensable interlocutor\u201d in the Middle East.Ms. Le Pen spoke of wanting to \u201canchor\u201d Russia to Europe, even as she heaped scorn on the European Union, which she said was \u201cfacing contrariwise to the rest of the world.\u201d\u201cEverywhere, globalization is in retreat,\u201d Ms. Le Pen told a group of bemused diplomats in a gilded hall in the fashionable 16th Arrondissement. \u201cThe Europe of peoples will be constructed against globalist dissolution,\u201d she said. \u201cI celebrate the renaissance of the European peoples.\u201dShe \u201csaluted\u201d what she called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201crealism\u201d and his \u201cdesire for change,\u201d while quoting approvingly Charles de Gaulle\u2019s dictum that states have \u201cno friends, but only interests.\u201dShe insisted that the \u201csingularity of the world\u2019s populations is not soluble merely in the market,\u201d while denouncing the \u201clies of globalization and liberalism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What I continue to wait for is a work for stage or screen that does for the art world what a film like \u201cThe Big Short\u201d did for finance: rooting real drama and real character study within the shenanigans of art sales rather than getting distracted by the dollar signs.

{"Headline": "New Chairman at Paramount Pictures Faces an Arduous Task", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Viacom has turned to one of Hollywood\u2019s most seasoned and respected executives, James N. Gianopulos, to revive its faded Paramount Pictures operation.But some analysts worry that Paramount is already too far gone.Mr. Gianopulos, who turns 65 in April, will take over as chairman of Paramount on April 3, Viacom said on Monday. Mr. Gianopulos, the consummate Hollywood insider who is treasurer of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, previously ran 20th Century Fox.But any turnaround at Paramount is years away under the best of circumstances.Moreover, the few series that Paramount has are weakening. The last \u201cTransformers\u201d movie, released in 2014, took in 30 percent less in North America than its predecessor. (The next chapter, \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight,\u201d arrives in June.) Paramount\u2019s aging \u201cStar Trek\u201d film series hit a similar snag last year. Its \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise is anchored by Tom Cruise, and how long he can remain an action star is an open question.\u201cWe don\u2019t think Paramount has enough top-tier intellectual property to successfully dig its way out of the profitability hole it finds itself in,\u201d Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a recent report.Mr. Gianopulos worked at Paramount before. In the mid-1980s, he was the studio\u2019s senior vice president for business affairs and international operations. It was a boom time. In 1986, Paramount had five of the year\u2019s 10 top-selling films at the domestic box office, including \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d and \u201cCrocodile Dundee.\u201dBut the movie business has changed substantially. With streaming services like Amazon and Netflix as new competitors for leisure time and movie attendance in the United States flat, studios have veered toward extravagant, effects-driven films that can play on a global stage. Mr. Creutz estimated that 30 movies with budgets of $100 million or more will be released this year, seven more than in 2015.He added that Mr. Gianopulos would have \u201ca running start\u201d because of Paramount teams \u201cwho are right now exploring new ways to strengthen the studio and position it for success.\u201d A spokeswoman declined to make Mr. Bakish or Mr. Gianopulos available for interviews.Despite its challenges, Paramount retains signs of life. The studio\u2019s marketing and publicity departments are considered strong. Mr. Grey started a fledgling television production business that could grow into a profit center. And several coming movies could be hits, including \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d a science-fiction action drama set for release on Friday; and \u201cBaywatch,\u201d a raunchy adaptation of the lifeguard television series.In some ways, Mr. Gianopulos may take comfort in Paramount\u2019s long-term history: The studio has battled its way back from the brink before.In the early 1960s, hobbled by cost-cutting and the release of contract players after the forced sale of its theater chain, Paramount was nearly shuttered and sold for the real estate value of its lot. Instead, a new corporate boss, having little to lose, brought in a brash, untested producer \u2014 Robert Evans \u2014 to run the place. The result was a creative rebirth that led to seminal hits like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cChinatown.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump vs. Congress: Now What?", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "FeatureAfter the president suffered his first defeat on Capitol Hill, can the White House still make good on its legislative promises?Supported byIt was hoped that the dinner could also establish some sort of common ground between Ryan and Bannon, the two figures who would arguably wield the greatest influence over how Trump\u2019s campaign promises became law \u2014 or didn\u2019t. Ryan was a fixture among establishment Republicans even before joining Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential ticket in 2012, his previous labors on the House Budget Committee cementing his reputation as the charts-and-graphs wizard of fiscal conservatism. Bannon, by contrast, was a renegade autodidact who read Plato and had seemingly materialized from nowhere to become the intellectual architect of Trump\u2019s campaign and, later, administration.Up to this point, Ryan had epitomized to Bannon everything that was wrong with the Republican Party. Discussing the two parties\u2019 shortcomings, Bannon later told me, \u201cWhat\u2019s that Dostoyevsky line: Happy families are all the same, but unhappy families are unhappy in their own unique ways?\u201d (He meant Tolstoy.) \u201cI think the Democrats are fundamentally afflicted with the inability to discuss and have an adult conversation about economics and jobs, because they\u2019re too consumed by identity politics. And then the Republicans, it\u2019s all this theoretical Cato Institute, Austrian economics, limited government \u2014 which just doesn\u2019t have any depth to it. They\u2019re not living in the real world.\u201dBreitbart News, the far-right media outlet Bannon ran before becoming the chief executive of the Trump campaign in August, had described Ryan, referring to his position on immigration, as \u201carguably the most pro-amnesty G.O.P. lawmaker in Congress\u201d \u2014 an apostasy of nearly impeachable proportions from Bannon\u2019s perspective. Worst of all, Ryan all but abandoned Trump during the 2016 campaign. After the leak in October of the damaging \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, Ryan told fellow Republican House members on a conference call, \u201cI am not going to defend Donald Trump \u2014 not now, not in the future.\u201d A Republican lawmaker on the call told Trump what Ryan had said, yet another reason for Bannon to regard himself as Ryan\u2019s worst enemy.But as the dinner progressed, it became clear that Bannon and Ryan actually had some ideas in common. Over memorably bad chicken Parmesan, Ryan described his vision for a \u201cborder-adjustment tax,\u201d which would levy taxes on imports while offering exemptions for exports. His tax package would include \u201cimmediate expensing,\u201d he explained, in which capital expenditures would be written off against profits in the first year rather than over time. It also would abolish the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax.These were ideas Ryan had been pushing since 2008. Now they had Bannon\u2019s attention. Taken together with a drastic reduction in corporate taxes, Bannon believed, Ryan\u2019s scheme would spur a renaissance of a manufacturing-based export economy, producing high-income labor in keeping with Trump\u2019s populism. \u201cI would actually say,\u201d Bannon remembers observing admiringly, \u201cthat this tax reform comes as close to a first step of economic nationalism as there is.\u201d\u201cI would call it \u2018responsible nationalism,\u2019\u2009\u201d Ryan said, according to Bannon.Bannon laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of folks in the Senate say this is breathtakingly radical.\u201dHe meant it as a compliment. To Bannon, the entire world order \u2014 from the two political parties to the Wall Street reliance on leveraging to multiculturalism \u2014 was undergoing an extraordinary realignment, one made manifest in the 2016 election. According to Bannon\u2019s vision, economic nationalism would reorient priorities to the working class\u2019s benefit. Trade deals, jobs programs, tax incentives, immigration restrictions, environmental deregulation and even foreign policy would ultimately serve to restore the primacy of those Trump called \u201cthe forgotten Americans.\u201dIn March, when I spoke to Trump by phone, I asked him what the term \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d meant to him. Compared with Bannon\u2019s revolutionary fervor, his reply was surprisingly cautious. \u201cWell, \u2018nationalism\u2019 \u2014 I define it as people who love the country and want it to do good,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see \u2018nationalism\u2019 as a bad word. I see it as a very positive word. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t trade with other countries.\u201dFirst, Obamacare would be repealed and replaced. Next, an austere budget would be passed, with emergency funds allotted for the construction of a wall along the Southern border. Then would come a tax-reform plan, presumably of the type Ryan and Bannon discussed. And finally, a bipartisan coalition would deliver a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Trump\u2019s desk. If all this came to pass by the end of 2017, it would lend some credence to Trump\u2019s pledge that this would be \u201cthe busiest Congress we\u2019ve had in decades.\u201d But by March, this timetable was looking like a formidable \u201cif.\u201dTrump wanted to make sure that he was given adequate credit for his achievements, even in his administration\u2019s infancy. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been here for a tiny speck of time,\u201d he said, \u201cand what I\u2019ve done with regulations, moving jobs back into the country, what I\u2019ve done with airplane pricing and buying is amazing. We\u2019ve done a lot. I think we\u2019ve done more than anybody for this short period of time.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson would take exception to this claim. And Trump\u2019s significant actions to date have consisted entirely of executive orders. What he has not yet demonstrated is his ability to actually shepherd a bill into law.But like Kushner, Bannon has never worked in government or at a policy-making institute and has no meaningful experience when it comes to getting legislation passed. On the Hill, he has a few random associations \u2014 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative John Culberson of Texas among them. Otherwise, he remains a looming but indistinct presence to the lawmakers who will be needed to pass most of Trump\u2019s agenda.Bannon\u2019s interest in this agenda predated his association with Trump. One evening in January 2013, two guests showed up for dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that Bannon liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. One was the man Bannon would later describe to me as his \u201cmentor\u201d: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. The other was Sessions\u2019s top aide and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a jittery 27-year-old named Stephen Miller.Two months earlier, Obama decisively defeated Mitt Romney in the presidential election, prompting Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to commission an analysis of the state of the party and its future, known colloquially in Washington as the \u201cautopsy,\u201d which would be delivered that spring. The only certainty was that the report would urge Republicans to court the growing Latino electorate \u2014 which had voted for Obama by a 44-point margin that November \u2014 by championing comprehensive immigration reform. The three men at the dinner table that night were among the few Republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion.These votes were gettable, Bannon believed. As he would later tell me: \u201cThe working class, and in particular the lower middle class, understands something that\u2019s so obvious \u2014 which is that they\u2019ve basically underwritten the rise of China. Their jobs, their raises, their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built China. Because China\u2019s really built on investments and exports, right? People are smart enough to know that they\u2019re getting played by both political parties. The two may be different on social issues, but when it comes to fundamental economics, they\u2019re both the same. That\u2019s why the American working class is interested in trade. It\u2019s linked to their lives.\u201dSessions shared Bannon\u2019s belief that the Republican Party needed to emphasize immigration reduction, border security and the preservation of working-class jobs through trade policy rather than courting Latino voters with a bill he regarded as \u201camnesty.\u201d As Sessions would write in a memorandum to his Republican colleagues six months later, \u201cThis humble and honest populism \u2014 in contrast to the administration\u2019s cheap demagoguery \u2014 would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party.\u201dAt some point during the five-hour dinner, Bannon recalls blurting out to Sessions, \u201cWe have to run you for president.\u201d Just two years earlier, in 2011, he made a similar pitch to Sarah Palin, after completing a documentary about her called \u201cThe Undefeated.\u201d Palin demurred. She was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth, she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by Bannon\u2019s warning that she stood little chance of defeating Obama.Now he delivered a similar message to Sessions. \u201cLook, you\u2019re not going to win,\u201d he recalls saying. \u201cBut you can get the Republican nomination. And once you control the apparatus, you can make fundamental changes. Trade is No.100 on the party\u2019s list. You can make it No.1. Immigration is No.10. We can make it No.2.\u201d Acknowledging that the drawling Alabama senator lacked Palin\u2019s charisma, Bannon said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the anti-candidate.\u201d But Sessions told Bannon he did not see himself running for president. \u201cIt was pretty obvious by the end of the night,\u201d Bannon recalled, \u201cthat another candidate would have to do it.\u201dTwo months later, on March 15, 2013, Bannon happened to be attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when Trump took the stage. Trump had been a marginal figure at most in politics up to that point, entertaining a Reform Party run in the 2000 election \u2014 when he speculated that he would probably take more votes from the Democratic candidate than the Republican one \u2014 and leading a conspiratorial crusade in 2011 to force Obama to release his birth certificate. The possibility that he might be a suitable host body for Bannon\u2019s worldview had not occurred to Bannon before Trump spoke.But Trump\u2019s grousing references to China\u2019s economic superiority, to 11 million \u201cillegals\u201d and to the erosion of America\u2019s manufacturing sector were right out of Bannon\u2019s playbook. From his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building, Stephen Miller, too, watched Trump\u2019s speech. By 2014, Miller was sending emails to friends expressing the hope that Trump would run for president. By the time Trump announced his candidacy, in June 2015, Sessions was officially uncommitted but privately of the view that Trump was best suited to tap into the movement that he, Miller and Bannon discussed over dinner more than two years earlier.Chaffetz and other House conservatives freely acknowledge that Trump is not cut from their cloth, but they say they could not care less as long as he gives them what they want. Selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia was \u201cthe best thing the president did in his first 50 days,\u201d Chaffetz told me. He and his conservative colleagues have been cheered by Trump\u2019s recruitment of former House colleagues and conservative stalwarts like Vice President Mike Pence; Tom Price, the health and human services secretary; and Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director.When Chaffetz and I spoke in March, he had met with the president twice so far \u2014 access he considered \u201csuch a huge sea change\u201d from the stony silence Republicans say they encountered from the Obama White House. Most important, the Trump agenda\u2019s first three projected legislative moves \u2014 the Obamacare repeal and replacement, an austere budget and tax reform \u2014 were intended to keep conservatives happily in Trump\u2019s camp. In turn, when the agenda moved on to less conservative items like infrastructure and trade agreements, Trump and Bannon would fully expect Republicans, including Ryan, to remember whose message resonated most with working-class voters last year.Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, is Trump\u2019s chief point of contact on the Hill. When McCarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in Bakersfield, Calif., in the late 1980s, his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, Judy, gave him an autographed copy of Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cI thought it was great,\u201d he told me. In McCarthy\u2019s view, Trump is a master of today\u2019s media, much as Lincoln and Kennedy were in their own times. \u201cHe\u2019s mastered instantaneous Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like owning newspapers.\u201dTrump has found a kindred spirit in McCarthy, a coastal extrovert of ambiguous ideological portfolio who (unlike Ryan) would far rather talk about personalities than the tax code. And as the former minority leader in the California Legislature during the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger, McCarthy is experienced in the care and feeding of celebrity egos. Since Trump\u2019s nomination, the two have spoken frequently by phone \u2014 to date, Trump has never been known to directly email or text anyone \u2014 about the cast of 535 characters with whom the president must now deal.But in the end, what Trump needs from the majority leader is not gossip but votes \u2014 216 of them, to be exact, in the House. And McCarthy\u2019s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest. In his previous capacity as House whip, he was thwarted by members of his own party when it came to subjects as diverse as reauthorizing a Patriot Act they deemed too intrusive, a farm bill they considered too expensive and a border-security bill they regarded as too lenient. His most reliable obstacles have been the three dozen or so House conservatives known as the Freedom Caucus, a two-year-old group of fiscal hard-liners. Early this year, McCarthy predicted to me that the new president would quickly subjugate the Freedom Caucus. \u201cTrump is strong in their districts,\u201d McCarthy told me. \u201cThere\u2019s not a place for them to survive in this world.\u201dWhen we spoke on the morning of March 7, Trump assured me that he would not bully the Obamacare-replacement bill\u2019s loudest Republican critics, like the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, on Twitter: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to,\u201d he said. \u201cMark Meadows is a great guy and a friend of mine. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever disappoint me, or the party. I think he\u2019s great. No, I would never call him out on Twitter. Some of the others, too. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need to. Now, they\u2019re fighting for their turf, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be obstructionists. I spoke to Mark. He\u2019s got some ideas. I think they\u2019re very positive.\u201dBut on March 21, in a meeting with the Freedom Caucus about the bill, Trump called out Meadows by name, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to come after you, but I know I won\u2019t have to, because I know you\u2019ll vote \u2018yes.\u2019\u2009\u201d Meadows remained a \u201cno\u201d on the bill, and among conservatives, he was far from alone. One of the Freedom Caucus\u2019s most outspoken members, Representative Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho, believes that the Trump White House was led astray by Ryan\u2019s confidence that he knew what conservatives wanted when drafting the bill. \u201cThe legislation has to go through the body, not the top,\u201d Labrador told me. \u201cAnd if our leadership thinks now that we\u2019re a unified body, that they can do things while ignoring us, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dLabrador is an affable but decidedly stubborn 49-year-old Mormon and former immigration lawyer who moved as a child with his single mother from Puerto Rico to Las Vegas. He was interviewed by the president-elect for the post of interior secretary at Trump Tower last December \u2014 though Trump selected Labrador\u2019s House colleague Ryan Zinke for the post a few days later.For now, Labrador and other Freedom Caucus members have been willing to blame House leaders like Ryan and McCarthy for drafting a health care bill that was not to conservatives\u2019 liking. They aspire to remain philosophical whenever Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka persuades her father to propose initiatives like paid family leave, as he did during his joint-session speech. \u201cI didn\u2019t stand up when he said that,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only part of the speech where I thought, That\u2019s not even close to what my party stands for.\u201dTo House conservatives like Labrador, the Republican Party stands for limited government. To Trump and Bannon, big-ticket items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking America\u2019s debt. As Chaffetz admitted to me, \u201cOn the spending front, things could slip away really quickly.\u201dLabrador says he would defend Trump\u2019s cuts but doubts that many of his colleagues would. \u201cWhat he\u2019s going to learn is that members of Congress are unwilling to take the tough votes,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen he learns that, what\u2019s going to be the next step?\u201d In Labrador\u2019s view, Trump\u2019s only sane recourse will be to accept the need for entitlement reform. \u201cAt some point, the reality of the budget is going to have to hit him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have this economic nationalism \u2014 Bannon is very smart, he clearly helped him with his messaging, it was so successful \u2014 but at some point, that theory is going to hit reality.\u201dWhen I spoke with Trump, I ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn\u2019t hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. Trump\u2019s reply was immediate. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. In fact, Trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. \u201cWe\u2019re also going to prime the pump,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I mean by \u2018prime the pump\u2019? In order to get this\u201d \u2014 the economy \u2014 \u201cgoing, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that\u2019ll be going, we\u2019re going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that\u2019ll happen.\u201d A clearer elucidation of Keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by Obama.The one clear point of agreement between the Trump economic nationalists and the House conservatives is the one Ryan and Bannon identified over dinner in January: tax reform. But in so doing, they will be picking a fight that may prove perilous to Republicans. The border-adjustment-tax proposal that Ryan floated to Bannon has never been able to get past K Street lobbyists and wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers.When I asked Trump if he was a fan of the border-adjustment tax, he replied: \u201cI am. I\u2019m the king of that.\u201d Almost no other country grafts an import tax onto a corporate tax, and it\u2019s possible that enacting a border-adjustment tax might well be in violation of the World Trade Organization\u2019s agreements. Of course, Bannon has openly advocated abandoning the W.T.O. anyway, because of China\u2019s membership in it. Still, the specter of new taxes on American corporations, higher prices for consumers and a jump in the dollar\u2019s value may compel an unusual confederacy against the tax-reform plan.Perhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon\u2019s economic nationalism is Washington\u2019s military hawks. John McCain is among those not mollified by Trump\u2019s pledge of enacting \u201cone of the largest increases in national-defense spending in American history.\u201d McCain scoffed when I brought this up to him. \u201cOf course that\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at 1981 and Reagan\u2019s commitment to rebuilding the military, there\u2019s no comparison to this 3 percent increase. It\u2019s a shell game, my friend.\u201dDespite his obvious differences with Trump, McCain was willing to work with him \u2014 but Bannon\u2019s presence seemed to confound such prospects. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting,\u201d McCain said, \u201cbecause I have decades of experience with Kelly, with Mattis, with Dan Coats, McMaster,\u201d referring to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly; Defense Secretary James Mattis; Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence; and H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. \u201cWe discuss issues all the time. I think this is probably the finest national-security team that I\u2019ve ever observed. It\u2019s almost schizophrenic, in that I obviously don\u2019t have conversations with Steve Bannon, but I do with Reince Priebus \u2014 he was my Republican chair in Wisconsin in my 2008 presidential campaign. So it\u2019s almost a schizophrenic \u2014 that\u2019s not the right word. A very divided kind of relationship. Paradoxical.\u201dEarly in the afternoon of Feb. 9, several Democratic senators met with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss the Gorsuch nomination and other matters. Among them were Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. All four are moderates who are up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump carried in 2016 by titanic margins \u2014 the least of which, in Donnelly\u2019s state, was nearly 20 points. If Democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the Senate majority, they will need to hold these four seats.But if Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin and Tester need to be seen back home as willing to work with Trump, the president needs them as well. Republicans enjoy a precarious 52-to-48 advantage in the Senate. On matters like the Supreme Court, Trump can count on all 52. On votes requiring a simple majority, any two of those Republicans could fall away, and Pence could preserve the win with a tiebreaking vote. But a trio of fiscal hard-liners (like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Mike Lee), military hawks (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio) or social moderates (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito) could deny Trump a majority, unless he could swing at least one Democrat to his side.The words were scarcely out of Donnelly\u2019s mouth before Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent for that, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to help get it passed.\u201d He then asked Pence, who was in the room, \u201cWhat do you think, Mike?\u201d Trump was apparently unaware that Pence, as the governor of Donnelly\u2019s state, had refused to back the senator\u2019s initiative, claiming instead that burdensome federal regulations were to blame for outsourcing. According to Donnelly, Pence gamely replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s like what Joe describes, I\u2019ll do everything I can to help.\u201dDonnelly, a thick-handed Irish Catholic with a barroom guffaw, had met Trump once before. In January 2011, he was among the so-called Blue Dog Coalition, composed of conservative House Democrats \u2014 what remained of them, anyway, after the previous November\u2019s disastrous midterms \u2014 who traveled to New York for their annual retreat. At a hotel conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the 20 or so Blue Dogs received a procession of guests, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton. Only one of their scheduled appointments required that they go to their guest \u2014 and so they did, by bus, to Trump Tower.Trump greeted them in his boardroom, with its commanding view of Central Park. He was charming but also brash. \u201cRemember, at that point he wasn\u2019t really talking about running for office,\u201d recalls one attendee, former Representative Dan Boren of Oklahoma. \u201cBut what strikes me was how he talked about the same issues \u2014 the wall, China \u2014 that became his stump speech years later.\u201dIt was evident to the Blue Dogs that Trump was no Clinton or Bloomberg when it came to the issues. Says former Representative Ben Chandler of Kentucky, who was also in attendance: \u201cThe difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark. Trump just made bald assertions, really.\u201d Particularly memorable to Chandler was Trump\u2019s insistence \u201cthat one of the best things the country could do was slap a massive tariff on the Chinese.\u201d Chandler continued: \u201cHe seemed not to understand that this would probably cause the entire world economy to melt down by causing a huge trade war. What I remember more than anything else was our general reaction afterward. And it was one of disbelief.\u201dToday Donnelly remains offended by what he calls Trump\u2019s \u201ccrazy stuff,\u201d as well as the alternative to Obamacare that Trump supported. But he does not begrudge Trump his showmanship. \u201cHe came to the Carrier plant,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on that issue since Day 1. I was begging people in the Obama administration to come out and talk to our workers. Donald Trump came out there. And Donald Trump talked to our workers. You can tell people you care. But it matters if you show up.\u201dThe Senate Democrat who, to outward appearances, seems closest to Trump is Joe Manchin, who met face to face with the president-elect in Trump Tower in December. Before the meeting, Bannon took the West Virginia senator aside. \u201cThe thing you need to know about Trump,\u201d Bannon said, \u201cis he doesn\u2019t care about the Republican Party and he doesn\u2019t care about the Democratic Party. He just wants to put some wins on the board for the country.\u201d In the meeting, Trump asked Manchin what could be done for coal miners. Manchin replied that he should support his Miners Protection Act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. According to Manchin, Trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure.Later that month, Manchin went on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d \u2014 the one show on MSNBC that Trump has been known to watch \u2014 to discuss, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Newtown school massacre, the need to expand background checks on gun purchases. Within an hour after Manchin was offscreen, his cellphone rang. It was Trump. Manchin was not completely forthcoming about the conversation, but he did tell me that he envisioned \u201ca complete opportunity\u201d for new gun-safety legislation. Unlike with Obama, he said, \u201cno one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights.\u201dIn his conversations with Manchin and Donnelly, Trump was essentially throwing his support behind a Democratic initiative without first checking with the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to ask what he thought of those proposals. Had he done so, the answer in each case would have been: not much. (Though on the coal miners\u2019 legislation, Manchin said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing Mitch McConnell go from a \u2018No, no and hell no\u2019 to now dropping his own bill. Which is fine, so long as we get it.\u201d) Still, Trump may have little choice but to indulge Democrats on some of their pet issues, given that he will need their votes on two of the most critical pieces of his agenda: infrastructure and trade deals.Until now, Trump has divulged few details about this trillion-dollar infrastructure venture. On the campaign trail, he frequently cited America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges. He bemoaned the potholes defiling the runways at La Guardia Airport, where he parked his two planes. During Donnelly\u2019s visit with Trump in the Roosevelt Room, the president \u201ctalked about the Queens-Midtown Tunnel with the tiles falling off, which he would see on his way to La Guardia,\u201d Donnelly recalled. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel.)When I asked Trump for more specifics, he gingerly offered a few morsels: \u201cThis is something that\u2019s going to be a real infrastructure bill, where real work is going to be done on bridges and roads and airports and things that we\u2019re supposed to be doing. So it\u2019s not just a political piece of paper. We\u2019re going to do infrastructure, and it\u2019s going to be a very big thing.\u201dTrump\u2019s description struck me as uncharacteristically modest. Bannon had evoked a more gleaming vision when he told me: \u201cLook, economic nationalism is predicated on a state-of-the-art infrastructure for the country, right? Broadband as good as Korea. Airports as good as China. Roads as good as Germany. A rail system as good as France. If you\u2019re going to be a world-class power, you\u2019ve got to have a world-class infrastructure.\u201dWhen I asked the president if his initiative might include such features, he replied: \u201cYes. It could, it could. You look at Japan and China, where they have the fast trains, and we don\u2019t have any. You look at other countries where we used to be the leader, and now we\u2019re the laggard. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore.\u201dWhat also may not happen is House Republicans\u2019 supporting a trillion-dollar bill that is at least somewhat reminiscent of the stimulus bill they unanimously opposed eight years ago. It\u2019s also possible that even moderate Democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to Trump\u2019s rescue. After all, the president remains intensely unpopular among Democrats, who continue to nurture hopes that Trump is one Russia connection away from impeachment. As a senior White House official told me of Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court: \u201cThe comment we often get from Democrats is, \u2018That\u2019s a great nominee.\u2019 Oh, so you\u2019re voting for him? \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 Why not? \u2018My base would go crazy, and I\u2019d be primaried.\u2019 That environment has to change before we can have any of these conversations.\u201dTrump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors. The press pool was then ushered out before the Democrats could say anything in front of the cameras. When Neal was given a chance to speak, he informed Trump, Pence, Bannon, Kushner and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that America had in fact prospered as a result of past trade deals. Neal emphasized the crucial role that the Panama Canal played in the economic vitality of the Eastern Seaboard. Other than Ross, no one on Trump\u2019s team seemed aware of this. \u201cThey were a bit surprised,\u201d Neal later told me. He was also struck by the White House\u2019s abhorrence of multilateral pacts, which seemed to him to be na\u00efve. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to negotiate 148 bilateral agreements with W.T.O. members does not seem realistic,\u201d Neal said. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re all of a sudden going to have a free-trade agreement with Great Britain, that\u2019s going to take years to do.\u201d Later, Neal said, Ross privately assured him that the Trump administration \u201cwould not give up on multilateral deals.\u201dNeal\u2019s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of Trump and Bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric. Of all the legislative lifts, none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements, which require a simple majority approval by both the Senate and the House. Scrounging up 15 Democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 Republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue. But just as Democrats like Neal in the Northeast would fight for a trade deal that benefits their region, so will Republican lawmakers along the Southern border rebel at an effort to repeal Nafta. As McCain told me, \u201cIf you negated Nafta, it would send my state into a severe recession.\u201d He assured me that Trump\u2019s nationalist posture would not provoke only regional opposition. He conjured up another Republican era \u2014 not Reagan\u2019s, not Bush\u2019s, but instead that of Herbert Hoover, when two Republican lawmakers joined with a Republican president to design a protectionist initiative that ultimately caused American exports to plummet during the Great Depression. \u201cSomewhere,\u201d McCain said with a dark chuckle, \u201cMr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley are smiling.\u201dWith customary bravado, Trump told the conservative members that he didn\u2019t want to squeak by with just a one-vote victory. \u201cI want all 237 of you,\u201d he said, according to Duncan, referring to the entire House Republican conference. That included the more moderate members, who had told Trump they felt that the White House wasn\u2019t paying sufficient attention to their concerns. Later in the day, Trump hosted another meeting with the moderates, where Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania informed Trump that he remained a \u201cno.\u201d According to an attendee, Trump angrily informed Dent that he was \u201cdestroying the Republican Party\u201d and \u201cwas going to take down tax reform \u2014 and I\u2019m going to blame you.\u201dUntil that day, Duncan had been an unyielding \u201cno\u201d on the bill. The previous week, he delivered an impassioned speech to the vice president and other Republicans, insisting that this vote constituted \u201cour generation\u2019s rendezvous with destiny \u2014 a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal Obamacare.\u201d In a text to me, Duncan pointed to history: \u201c39 men in a hot room in 1787 had the courage to break from the norm and empower a nation.\u201dBut now the four-term congressman was, for the first time in his life, sitting across the table from a president who was personally appealing for his support. The White House was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing. Duncan left the meeting and spent a few hours pondering, as he would later put it, \u201cthe greater opportunity we as Republicans have.\u201d By that evening, Trump had won Jeff Duncan\u2019s vote.\u201cYou get about nine months to do the big things,\u201d Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, told me at the beginning of the year. Nine months seemed like a long time then, the calendar spacious and the legislative deal-making possibilities plentiful. But more than two of those months are gone already \u2014 and the path to future wins, as Trump foresaw in his meeting with the Freedom Caucus, is now more complicated. When he took office, Trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the White House. By the time I spoke with him in early March, however, he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers. He still saw himself as the closer in chief \u2014 but then that was \u201ctypical, I would think, of a president,\u201d he mused. \u201cSome more than others.\u201dAn article on April 2 about President Trump and Congress described incorrectly the legislative process of renegotiating trade agreements. A simple majority approval by both the Senate and the House \u2014 not two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 is needed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lester Tenney, 96, Dies; Faced Japan\u2019s Brutality and Won Its Apologies", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byLester Tenney survived the Bataan Death March, followed by three and a half years of slave labor as a prisoner of the Japanese in World War II. When he was released at the war\u2019s end, he learned that his wife had remarried, believing he was dead. He suffered from what came to be known as post-traumatic stress, but he married again and built a life in the academic and business worlds.He eventually forgave the Japanese people for the atrocities visited upon him and thousands of other prisoners. But he never forgot. He waged a relentless and ultimately successful quest to win apologies from Japanese leaders for their nation\u2019s brutality.He died on Feb. 24 in Carlsbad, Calif., his son, Glenn, confirmed. He was 96.An Army sergeant and tank commander, Mr. Tenney was among thousands of American and Filipino soldiers who had retreated to the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines after Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor and its invasion of the Philippines.In April 1942, the Americans on Bataan, virtually out of ammunition, medical supplies and food, were ordered by their commander to surrender. In May, the besieged American troops on the island of Corregidor, off Bataan, surrendered as well.The American captives on Bataan were ordered to walk 60 miles or more, the distance varying according to where they were captured, for transfer to a prison camp in the Philippines and then to captivity in Japan.\u201cIf you stopped walking, you died,\u201d Mr. Tenney told the Atomic Heritage Foundation in 2013. \u201cEither they cut your head off, they shot you or they bayoneted you.\u201cWe had no food or water. The temperature was about 106, 108 degrees. We all had malaria, dysentery.\u201dMr. Tenney spent the rest of the war at a prison camp in Japan and shoveling coal at a nearby mine owned by the Japanese conglomerate Mitsui. The prisoners dug 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, surviving on three small bowls of rice and a bit of water daily. They were often beaten by Japanese guards or employees of the mine company.Mr. Tenney was released when Japan surrendered in August 1945, days after America dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and on Nagasaki, a city across the bay from the prison camp where he was held.He obtained a doctorate in finance from the University of Southern California, taught at San Diego State and Arizona State Universities and founded a company providing financial advice to corporations.Mr. Tenney recounted his wartime experiences in a memoir, \u201cMy Hitch in Hell,\u201d published in 1995.In 1999, he joined with a group of former P.O.W.s in a lawsuit seeking reparations from the Japanese companies that had subjected them to slave labor. The suit was dismissed in federal court on the grounds that the 1951 peace treaty between the United States and Japan had precluded private claims for compensation.Mr. Tenney became national commander of the veterans\u2019 organization American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor, which invited Japan\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Ichiro Fujisaki, to its 2009 convention.In an address to some 70 veterans from the dwindling ranks of Bataan survivors, the ambassador said, \u201cWe extend a heartfelt apology for our country having caused tremendous damage and suffering to many people, including prisoners of war, those who have undergone tragic experiences in the Bataan peninsula, the Corregidor island, Philippines and other places.\u201dMr. Tenney was invited to Japan the next year and received an apology from Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada.In April 2015, Mr. Tenney attended a joint session of Congress addressed by Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who expressed \u201cdeep repentance\u201d for American losses. Mr. Tenney told The San Diego Union-Tribune that Mr. Abe personally apologized to him later that day.In Mr. Tenney\u2019s final years, the Japanese company Mitsubishi issued an apology over its treatment of wartime captives.Lester Irwin Tenney was born in Chicago on July 1, 1920, and went to war as a member of the Illinois National Guard.While in his mid-80s, he paid tribute to latter-day American troops by creating Care Packages From Home, which sent gifts, phone cards and personal letters to men and women serving in Afghanistan and Iraq.In addition to his son, from his second marriage, which ended in divorce, Mr. Tenney is survived by his third wife, Betty; his stepsons, Edward and Donald Levi, from their marriage; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.Glenn Tenney accompanied his father on trips to Japan, including a visit to the site of the coal mine where he had been enslaved. They found only a field, but mines still operated nearby.The younger Mr. Tenney recalled in an interview on Friday that his father \u201cwas in tears\u201d when he picked up a stray piece of coal. It \u201cbrought back all the memories,\u201d the son said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eric Garcetti Makes His Case as Mayor of Los Angeles", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Mayor Eric M. Garcetti, a Democrat, is up for re-election on March 7, with a runoff, if necessary, on May 16. He is facing 10 challengers, but he seems almost assured of a second term in City Hall.Mr. Garcetti has lucked out in running Los Angeles during three relatively easy years: no earthquakes, riots or major crime waves. \u201cHe\u2019s smart; he\u2019s articulate; he does his homework,\u201d said Mel Levine, a former member of Congress whom Mr. Garcetti appointed as a commissioner to the Department of Water and Power. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that he has not drawn stiff opposition.\u201dMr. Garcetti also helped persuade voters to approve taxes to finance a multibillion-dollar mass transit building plan and construction of housing for the homeless. He persuaded the City Council to enact long-delayed legislation requiring building owners to strengthen buildings to withstand an earthquake.\u201cHe\u2019s a very collaborative leader \u2014 and he has gotten quite a bit done,\u201d said Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs.\u201cHe speaks well \u2014 even though he doesn\u2019t accomplish well,\u201d said Richard Riordan, a Republican, who was mayor of Los Angeles from 1993 to 2001. \u201cHe has no courage to take chances.

Looking back over the past three years, are there things that you haven\u2019t gotten done that you wish you had? Traffic is still bad. Homelessness on the streets has grown.

If the measure is do big things and do important things that will last for decades, I\u2019m really satisfied with what we\u2019ve done in the last three and a half years. But every time I see a single tent, I wish we had gotten that person into housing. And it\u2019s not enough to pass historically high bonds and initiatives. The problem is still there the day after the election.Why has the problem of homelessness been so persistent? It seems worse than ever in Los Angeles.Homelessness on the streets is definitely worse. Part of that is criminal justice reforms have pushed a lot of people out on the street. The cheap price of drugs has really made addiction soar to a level that we haven\u2019t seen in a long time. Coupled with the housing crisis. The last piece is mental health issues. There is a huge increase in mental instability and a lack of mental health care.President Trump just held a 90-minute press conference [on Feb. 17]. Did you catch it? And what do you hear about the new president as you travel around the city?I just heard what happened at the press conference. No change of tone? That\u2019s the perfect metaphor for his entire approach. Turn it up to 11. It only goes up to 10. Do 11. I keep telling people \u2014 we can\u2019t lose our heads. We can\u2019t lose our values. One is from the heart, one is from the head. But I think a lot of people are losing their minds like every single day right now. So what about the criticism of you, which I hear often, that you really haven\u2019t done that much, that you are cautious, timid, a bit bureaucratic bland?I think it\u2019s just become its own meme. I don\u2019t know where it originated. But I don\u2019t get that caught up on it; it has no resonance with me. I mean, how many decades have we talked about bringing the film industry back? How many decades have we talked about getting public transportation to the airport? No infrastructure initiative has ever been this big in this country. [He is referring to a Los Angeles transit bond issue passed in November.] I could walk away today and it would be the biggest physical change to the city since water came here. Drop the mike and walk away. That would be enough. I think people mistake bloody noses for big accomplishments. Maybe because I don\u2019t draw blood, but we actually work well with people, that that is seen as cautious. I would disagree. That\u2019s not cautious. It\u2019s effective.It\u2019s funny. I mean early on, it was, \u201cHe\u2019s the break-dancing guy, playing with Moby\u201d \u2014 like my dynamism was everything. \u201cOh, is he all extrovert.\u201d And all of a sudden I\u2019m cautious and I\u2019m this. (Sighs.) I\u2019m just \u2014 I don\u2019t know. If they think I\u2019m politically cautious, they want theatrics over results. I think a mayor first and foremost is a chief executive who needs to manage a city and produce results.And the other annoying question \u2014 I assume you are not going to pledge to \u2026I never make those pledges. And I\u2019ll be really straight up. If I can serve the people of Los Angeles in a different role and people want you to, you don\u2019t close that door. But I am running to be mayor. I am not running to jump to other positions.Oh, yeah. Bill Clinton once said the best two jobs in politics are president of the United States and mayor of a big city. It\u2019s accountable work, but if I build a park I get to go there with my daughter. It\u2019s what politics is supposed to be about: tangibly improving the life of the community where you live. If I were to have to do that from afar I would definitely miss this.Advertisement"}

Traditional media, in a hypercompetitive 24-7 news environment, can rush to report fresh details.

{"Headline": "President Trump\u2019s Blinkered Fiscal Vision", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byEditorialWorse yet, some Republicans may call for limiting Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed reductions by cutting instead from Social Security and Medicare, which Mr. Trump has pledged to protect. That would be needlessly tightfisted. A rich nation with a resilient economy can afford to care for both the poor and the elderly. Besides, support for the elderly is already becoming stingier as a result of changes instituted years ago, including an increase in the Social Security retirement age from 65 in 2002 to 67 by 2027.That is not to imply that all spending cuts are off limits. But it\u2019s sensible to mix them with tax increases. The approach of Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans would deeply cut taxes even as spending is slashed.Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers say tax cuts spread prosperity by generating economic growth and thus increasing federal revenue \u2014 a thoroughly debunked claim. Experience shows that large tax cuts either deepen the nation\u2019s debt or necessitate spending cuts. Forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that if tax revenue is not increased in the coming decade, spending cuts of $3 trillion \u2014 or about 25 percent outside of Social Security and Medicare \u2014 will be required to keep the debt at its current level of 77.5 percent of the economy. Clearly, if defense spending rises in the coming decade, as Mr. Trump has called for, while tax revenue declines, either the debt will rise or spending cuts will need to be even deeper.Both outcomes can be avoided by abandoning deep tax cuts. It would be wise to take on new debt for stimulus during economic downturns or for infrastructure investments, but not to finance tax cuts during a military buildup. Economic activity could be encouraged by bolstering wages, including federal overtime protections. Tax revenue could be raised in constructive ways, including a carbon tax.Giving the wealthy never-ending tax cuts while gutting programs for the middle class would create more of the resentment and inequality Mr. Trump has promised to address.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Address Affordable Housing Shortage, Restoring 19th-Century Homes", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported bySquare Feet8 PhotosThe tiny city of Apalachicola, Fla., is well known in preservationist circles for its abundance of restored 19th-century buildings, but when it comes to affordable housing, the Gulf Coast community comes up short.\u201cTwenty-eight percent of the population in Franklin County pays 40 percent of its income for housing,\u201d said Jeffrey Sharkey, a political consultant from Tallahassee, Fla.Mr. Sharkey is one of the investors in Denton Cove, a proposed multifamily housing development that has divided the community and prompted a discussion about whether the city\u2019s housing problem should be solved with new homes or the historic ones that are its legacy.Denton Cove would be a 52-unit cluster of town homes built on the site of a decommissioned high school and paid for through the sale of Housing and Urban Development low-income tax credits.\u201cIt would have been the only $10 million residential development in the city in the previous 30 years,\u201d Mr. Sharkey said.But residents of Apalachicola, population 2,340, challenged the plan at meetings of the city\u2019s planning and zoning commission. They \u201cdidn\u2019t want \u2018those people\u2019 living there,\u201d Mr. Sharkey said.But this is no \u201cnot-in-my-backyard-story,\u201d according to Willoughby Marshall, an architect who lives with his wife in his childhood home.\u201cMostly, we\u2019re interested in history here,\u201d Mr. Marshall said. \u201cWe\u2019re not so interested in development because that\u2019s not in keeping with the nature of the town.\u201dThe Marshalls and others are endorsing a local plan to train job-seeking residents in home construction through the rehabilitation of abandoned, working-class cottages known as shotgun homes. There are dozens of them in an Apalachicola district called the Hill, where black fishermen and mill workers have lived for more than a century.The shotguns are historically significant because they are among the first examples of African architecture in the United States.\u201cThe original affordable housing here was the shotgun,\u201d said Creighton Brown, a recent transplant from New York who devised the plan.Mr. Brown, a contractor specializing in historic structures, worked with a nonprofit housing developer in New Orleans to survey and map abandoned shotguns that could be restored to habitability.Bernard Simmons, a lifelong Hill resident who is a musician, lives in a shotgun that has been in his family for generations.\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt speaks of my history, my ancestors. I feel their spirits in this house.\u201dWhile Mr. Simmons\u2019s home is a comfortable balance of old and new, others in the neighborhood are not as well tended.The Denton Cove plan, by contrast, was outlined in thick contracts and bank documents as required by law. The town homes would have energy efficient appliances, a pool and a fitness center. But the development was not for people with moderate incomes, as some residents had originally been told. The county\u2019s depressed earnings meant only the poorest would qualify to live there.Concentrating the poor in one project was not a modern approach, said Bonnie Davis, a retired lawyer who moved to Apalachicola from Tallahassee. She and others embraced the idea that Apalachicola\u2019s architectural past might guide the future as it had in cities like Louisville, Ky., and New Orleans, where shotgun restoration programs have been underway for years.\u201cWhen all this brouhaha came up, I, the Browns, many people said, \u2018We have to be about more than no,\u2019\u201d Ms. Davis said.In addition to training the local labor force in construction, Mr. Brown\u2019s plan had a financing component. Because 33 of the lots have more than one home on them, the purchaser would buy one home to live in and a second income-producing rental unit to help pay the mortgage. But speed was important.The tiny-house movement, combined with relatively low real estate prices on the Hill, has already caught the attention of people like Pete Olson of Connecticut. He is finishing up work on a 450-square-foot one-bedroom shotgun where he plans to live with his wife.Twenty years ago, Anthony Pierce, 57, a lifelong Apalachicola resident, bought four shotguns to restore and rent. Just preventing further deterioration by shoring up the foundation was a big effort, and after taking a job in Tallahassee, Mr. Pierce said he ran out of energy.What neither he nor Mr. Brown realized about restoring the shotguns was that a 1970s-era zoning change had imposed larger lot requirements on Hill homes if they became unoccupied for longer than six months.\u201cThe zoning effectively made the revitalization of this neighborhood impossible\u201d for anyone who could not pay cash, said Carey Shea, the executive director at Home by Hand in New Orleans, the nonprofit housing developer, who had worked with Mr. Brown. If the program\u2019s beneficiaries could not get mortgages, Ms. Shea said, her company would have withdrawn from the project, despite her feeling that it has benefits over Denton Cove\u2019s more traditional plan.Ms. Shea said the job-training and home-ownership components would result in \u201ca revitalized neighborhood, affordable housing and job creation.\u201dMr. Brown says he is lobbying to modify the zoning restrictions that impede the shotgun project.\u201cThere are 100 historic houses that are empty,\u201d waiting for low- and moderate-income Apalachicolans to live in them, he said.The homes have been researched and mapped by Pam Richardson, one of several residents working on a monthlong art festival and tour of the shotguns in April. The festival should show that \u201crestoring them is a much better prospect than concentrating poverty in one spot,\u201d Mr. Brown said.This was the argument against the Denton Cove project. But Mr. Sharkey sees the residents\u2019 resistance as perpetuating racial segregation in a city where century-and-a-half-old opulent homes can be found on tree-shaded streets on the south side, while the north side\u2019s historic homes are deteriorating.In December, Denton Cove L.L.C. settled a lawsuit it had filed against Apalachicola claiming fair housing violations and reneging on the sale of the high school property. The inauguration of President Trump dampened the market for the sale of tax credits on which the project is reliant, so investors have not decided whether it is profitable to continue the multifamily project.\u201cIf somebody wants to come along and build single-family homes,\u201d Mr. Sharkey said of the Brown proposal, \u201cGod bless them.\u201dAn article on the Square Feet page on Wednesday about resolving a lack of affordable housing in Apalachicola, Fla., misidentified the nonprofit housing organization for which Carey Shea is executive director. It is Home by Hand in New Orleans \u2014 not Project Home Again, where she was previously executive director.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chinese-Backed Dam Project Leaves Myanmar in a Bind", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byAUNG MYIN THA, Myanmar \u2014 For six years, Daw Kaw Bu has waited to return to the village she was forced to leave to make way for a dam that has yet to be built.\u201cI pray to God to let me work on my own land again,\u201d she said on a recent afternoon, sitting outside the wood-shingled home in Aung Myin Tha, where she was resettled in early 2011.She may get her answer soon, when a government-appointed commission makes a recommendation on the fate of the $3.6 billion, Chinese-financed Myitsone Dam.The decision is a daunting test for Myanmar\u2019s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who risks angering China, the region\u2019s economic powerhouse, if she cancels the project, or the public if she lets it go forward.Analysts say the commission\u2019s report would provide her the political cover to kill an unpopular white elephant that she inherited from Myanmar\u2019s former military government.But getting out of the deal would be difficult. If her government cancels the project outright, it could have to repay some $800 million that the state-owned Chinese developer says it has already spent on the project.If Myanmar offers China other dam projects in return, a compromise her government has floated, they are likely to impinge on disputed ethnic areas where they could threaten the peace talks she has championed since her political party came to power last year.The Myitsone Dam is among the largest of many Chinese-financed energy and mining projects approved by the military junta that ruled Myanmar until 2011. It is especially contentious because it would be the first dam to cross the Irrawaddy River, the mythic cradle of civilization for Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Burman majority.But perhaps the most incendiary objection was that under the deal struck by the ruling generals, 90 percent of the dam\u2019s electricity could go to China. As protests spread to Myanmar\u2019s cities, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s revered pro-democracy leader at the time, spoke out against the dam.The decision, widely seen as a victory for the forces of democracy, shocked Chinese officials and businessmen. Many remain incredulous that the dam was delayed at all in a country that needs more electricity to power its fast-growing economy.Although the contract has never been publicly disclosed, details have leaked out over the years. A person who supports the dam and is familiar with the contract, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Myanmar was guaranteed 10 percent of the dam\u2019s electricity at no cost and could buy more on request.The government\u2019s 15 percent stake in the dam would earn it about $18 billion over a 50-year concession period, analysts and local news reports said.The Chinese developer owns the remaining 80 percent.One reason for that, experts say, is that there is no grid connecting the dam to Myanmar\u2019s major towns and cities.\u201cDoes Myanmar need electricity? Yes, for sure,\u201d said David Dapice, an economist at Harvard who has studied Myanmar\u2019s hydropower sector. \u201cDoes it need Myitsone? No. There are many other hydro sites that could be developed. And in the country\u2019s south, gas generation would be cheaper than transmitting hydro over long distances.\u201dCanceling the dam, however, would upset relations with China, Myanmar\u2019s biggest trading partner.Recognition is growing among Chinese officials and experts, analysts said, that the diplomatic and business strategies that worked well when Myanmar was ruled by generals are no longer viable.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned our lesson from focusing too much on the elites, and now we know that deals and agreements are not solid if they are not based on people-to-people relations,\u201d said Fan Hongwei, a Myanmar specialist at Xiamen University in China.Executives at the company declined a request for an interview. But in a written statement, Wang Qiyue, the project\u2019s general manager, said that the company would \u201clisten carefully and offer our practical advice\u201d to any new proposals from Myanmar officials.The dam would provide Myanmar \u201cits own cheap, renewable energy,\u201d he said, a better option than importing power or using more expensive or nonrenewable energy sources.Officials close to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi have said that negotiations were underway for Myanmar to pay China, or apply the money to other projects, if the dam is not built.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, U Zaw Htay, said last year that as a compromise for not building the Myitsone Dam, she was prepared to offer the Chinese a series of smaller hydropower projects that are less of a threat to the environment.But Myanmar\u2019s best potential hydropower sites are all in conflict areas, said Tom Kramer, a researcher in Yangon at the Transnational Institute, a Dutch organization that studies ethnic issues in Myanmar. Approving new projects there, he said, could set off renewed fighting among the very armed groups that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is struggling to bring to the negotiating table as part of a fragile national peace dialogue.But whether the money is used to repay China or build alternative dams, it is not clear where Myanmar would come up with $800 million, a sum greater than its roughly $600 million health budget.On a recent afternoon near the site of the Myitsone Dam, there was no sign of Chinese workers or dam-building equipment. From the bank of the Irrawaddy, the only movement visible near the unfinished dam site was a slender fishing skiff that drifted lazily on the current.Residents of Aung Myin Tha, a nearby village where about 300 families were resettled, said it had some advantages, like the 16-bed hospital and roads built by the dam developer. But most families now have less farmland and diminished access to the Irrawaddy and traditional hunting grounds, and opposition to the dam remains strong.\u201cIf the Lady lets it happen, Kachin people will protest,\u201d said one villager, Daw Ja Khawn, using the popular moniker for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the whole country behind us, which will be easy because the whole country is already against it.\u201dDozens of families have taken matters into their own hands, moving back to their old villages, even though electricity was cut off there.\u201cI built my house to challenge the Chinese,\u201d said one, Daw Lu Ra, who was eating a freshly caught fish by candlelight at a restaurant overlooking the headwaters. \u201cEven if they told me to move again, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201dWai Moe contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.

Edison Jackson, the president of Bethune-Cookman, said of Arizona Summit, \u201cTogether, we aim to be a leading force in disrupting a legacy of exclusion that has persisted into the 21st century.\u201d Officials from both schools claim that their goal is to increase \u201cdiversity\u201d in legal education.But encouraging African-American students to attend Arizona Summit will not help them achieve their goals. It will hobble them. Going to a law school that doesn\u2019t prepare most of its students to pass the bar is not an \u201copportunity,\u201d unless \u201copportunity\u201d means being saddled with debt that you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life trying to pay back.For-profit schools like Arizona Summit prey on students with high aspirations but little knowledge about how the postgraduate system really works. Many black students aren\u2019t just the first people in their families to go to graduate school \u2014 they are the only people they know in the game. Information passed down from family, friends or mentors is hard to get when you don\u2019t have people in your life who have been there. Too many aspiring black students are trying to piece together education plans based on career fairs and Google searches.I was the first person in my family to go to law school, but I went to Harvard for undergrad. Harvard teaches you how to play the game.In other words, long before I sat down for my first LSAT prep session, I knew precisely the LSAT score I needed to get in order to go to the schools I wanted. Do you realize how powerful this information was?Getting into professional schools like law and medicine is not art \u2014 it\u2019s math. Here\u2019s a formula: G.P.A. x Test Score / Demographics = Admission Decision. That formula is not bulletproof; it\u2019s possible to quirk one\u2019s way into a particular school. But in broad strokes, the grids reveal exactly what numbers each student needs to get into the law schools he or she desires.When I applied, I didn\u2019t randomly send out applications and hope for the best. I was studying for a specific score, to get into specific schools, following the specific plan of action I mapped out with my pre-law advisers.Is Bethune-Cookman compiling the grids and disseminating that information to pre-law students?I\u2019m forced to conclude that this deal isn\u2019t about diversity in legal education, for either institution. Arizona Summit wants legitimacy, and Bethune-Cookman needs to expand its geographic footprint.Arizona Summit is owned by the InfiLaw company, which owns three law schools, including one in Florida. Bethune-Cookman didn\u2019t go with the local for-profit diploma mill because it\u2019s trying to market itself to students who live west of the Mississippi. It shouldn\u2019t be aligning itself with an out-of-state law school purely for marketing purposes.The best thing any historically black college could do to \u201cdisrupt\u201d exclusionary legacies in legal education would be to arm its students with the very information from which they have been excluded, information that would help them get into good schools \u2014 or at least keep them out of predatory ones.

One of the people said the valuation could be as high as $7 billion.The fund-raising may bolster Lyft competitively, given that Uber has been caught up in an escalating series of internal problems.Uber has also wrestled with concerns about its workplace culture over the past few weeks, after a former employee published an account of her year at the company, which included allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.This week, Mr. Kalanick apologized for his behavior toward an Uber driver after a video of him losing his temper with the driver surfaced.Yet Lyft\u2019s brand has recently looked comparatively attractive.

By claiming losses, Mr. Trump apparently saved millions of dollars in taxes that he would otherwise have owed.The White House responded without even waiting for the show to air, issuing a statement that seemed to confirm the authenticity of the forms even as it defended Mr. Trump and assailed MSNBC for publicizing them. \u201cBefore being elected president, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world, with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,\u201d the statement said.The White House described the business losses as a \u201clarge-scale depreciation for construction,\u201d but did not elaborate.

Nor did they provide much information about his businesses that was not previously known. But they showed that the vast bulk of the federal income taxes he paid in 2005, $31 million, was paid under the alternative minimum tax, which Mr. Trump wants to abolish.That tax serves as a backstop to the ordinary income tax and is intended to prevent wealthy Americans from paying no income tax at all. Without it, Mr. Trump would have paid about $5 million in regular taxes, plus nearly $2 million in self-employment taxes, on $153 million in income in 2005.\u201cTrump\u2019s return shows that he\u2019s pushing tax changes that benefit multimillionaire heirs like him, not the middle class,\u201d said Lily Batchelder, a tax law professor at New York University and former majority chief tax counsel for the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cHis proposal to repeal the A.M.T. would have slashed his own tax burden by $31 million, and his income tax rate would be lower than the average rate paid by families earning $75,000 to $100,000.\u201dA portion of President Trump's 2005 tax return, released by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Tuesday, shows that Mr. Trump paid $38 million in federal income taxes on reported income of $150 million.Edward Kleinbard, a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California, said, \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that he is pushing to eliminate the only tax that really bit him in that year.\u201dThe White House castigated MSNBC for reporting on Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes. \u201cYou know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThe dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the president will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.\u201dThe president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. suggested that the disclosure only demonstrated his father\u2019s business acumen. \u201cThank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realdonaldtrump is & that he paid $40mm in taxes!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Democrats pounced on Tuesday night\u2019s report, arguing that the White House\u2019s decision to release details of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 taxes before Ms. Maddow\u2019s show undercut his past refusal to release any such information.\u201cIf they can release some of the information, they can release all of the information,\u201d Zac Petkanas, a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThe only reason not to release his returns is to hide what\u2019s in them, such as financial connections with Russian oligarchs and the Kremlin.\u201dThe forms showed that Mr. Trump made $67 million in real estate royalties, $42 million in business income, $32 million in capital gains, $9 million in taxable interest and $998,599 in salary in 2005, for a total of nearly $153 million. After writing off $103 million, he reported adjusted gross income of nearly $49 million. In the end, he had to write a check for $2,450,597, including penalties and interest for late payment.The 1995 deduction was derived from the financial wreckage of some of the companies Mr. Trump drove into bankruptcy years ago, including his Atlantic City casinos, and would have allowed him to cancel out taxable income for an 18-year period. A tax code provision benefiting real estate developers, which took effect in 1993, permitted businesses like Mr. Trump\u2019s to take tax deductions for losing other people\u2019s money.However, it was unclear how much of a deduction Mr. Trump actually took. The I.R.S. has challenged such deductions, known as conservation easements, saying that taxpayers overstated the value of their transactions.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump initially promised he would release his tax returns. \u201cI have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful, and we\u2019ll be working that over in the next period of time,\u201d he said in a January 2016 television interview. He then backpedaled, saying he would wait until the I.R.S. had completed its audit. In May 2016, tax lawyers for Mr. Trump released a letter saying that his personal returns had been \u201cunder continuous examination\u201d by the I.R.S. since 2002, and that examinations of his returns from 2009 on were continuing.The I.R.S. has not confirmed that Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes are, in fact, under audit.Few people outside Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle have seen his tax returns. One person who has is Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, another former Times reporter, whom Mr. Trump sued for libel after Mr. O\u2019Brien published a book that argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s net worth was $150 million to $250 million, rather than several billion dollars, as Mr. Trump had claimed. The suit was ultimately dismissed.Limited information about Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns from other years has surfaced in court and regulatory records. A 1981 report by New Jersey regulators assessing his fitness for a casino license stated that he had paid more than $71,000 in federal income taxes on about $218,000 of taxable income earned from 1975 to 1977.But in the next two years, 1978 and 1979, Mr. Trump paid no federal income taxes. The New Jersey report explained that, by taking advantage of deductions available to real estate developers and claiming losses from partnerships, he was able to report a \u201cnegative income\u201d of $406,379 in 1978 and $3.4 million in 1979 \u2014 thus avoiding any tax liability for those two years, a time when he claimed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Tax court records indicate that Mr. Trump also avoided paying federal income taxes in 1984. In 1991 and 1993, when his Atlantic City casinos were in deep financial trouble, casino commission reports show he claimed losses that would have allowed him to avoid paying income taxes in those years, too. Mr. Trump may have been able to use those losses to reduce or eliminate his federal tax bill for years to come.During the presidential debate, Hillary Clinton suggested that Mr. Trump was refusing to release his tax returns to hide the fact that he did not pay federal income taxes. \u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d Mr. Trump retorted during one debate.In response to The Times\u2019s disclosure that Mr. Trump could have used a $916 million tax loss to avoid paying years of federal income taxes, Mr. Trump and his surrogates said the revelation merely proved his \u201cgenius\u201d at legally avoiding that burden.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Jesse Drucker from New York.

{"Headline": "Court Awards $1 Million for Victims of Congolese Warlord", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The International Criminal Court on Friday found a former militia leader liable for $1 million in reparations to his victims and their relatives in a village in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It ordered that payments be made in small amounts of cash to individuals and used for projects benefiting the wider community.Noting that the militia leader, Germain Katanga, is imprisoned and penniless, the judges requested that the awards be paid out by the court\u2019s Trust Fund for Victims, which was created for this purpose.Unlike international tribunals that adjudicate war crimes and crimes against humanity, the International Criminal Court, based in The Hague, stands apart because its mandate specifies that reparations to victims must be part of international justice.In the court\u2019s estimate, \u201cthe physical, material and psychological harm suffered by the victims\u201d of Bogoro amounted to more than $3.7 million, but the judges set Mr. Katanga\u2019s liability at $1 million.The ruling awarded 297 victims payments of $250 each, an amount described as \u201csymbolic\u201d and not intended to compensate \u201cfor the entirety of the harm.\u201d It also called for collective reparations to go toward projects covering housing, education, psychological support and activities to generate income in and around Bogoro in the Ituri region of the country. About 800 people lived in Bogoro at the time of the attack; today there are about 2,000.Pieter de Baan, the director of the Trust Fund for Victims, said he visited Bogoro last month to work with community leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s important that any award money, who gets it, how it is spent in the community is well understood and accepted,\u201d Mr. de Baan said.Some victims fled after the violence, he said, and some of the attackers have moved in.The cash payments, though small, are significant in the impoverished and still insecure region, he said.The court has asked the fund to come up with a detailed plan for the projects to be financed with the reparations.Mr. de Baan said that during his visit, residents of Bogoro insisted on the need for education for their children and vocational training for themselves.Housing projects may not be needed because people have rebuilt since the attacks, he said. He said they might want to use the money for microloans to start businesses, like shops, hairdressers or tailors, or for buying cattle or tools to work the land.The fund, though linked to the court, is separately managed. Financing has come from governments, corporations and individuals.Although it has earmarked $5 million for reparations for victims, it has financed other activities in countries where the court is handling cases.Mr. de Baan said such projects included vocational training for former child soldiers in central Africa and hundreds of reconstructive surgeries in Uganda, where brutal gangs have cut off the ears, noses or lips of their victims.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City to Get Less Federal Aid for Housing", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byPresident Donald J. Trump has yet to put his mark on the federal budget, but in a possible harbinger of leaner times to come, officials in New York City are already contending with declines in federal financing for programs that assist some of the city\u2019s poorest residents.Two city agencies that provide subsidized housing were told in letters sent last month that they would receive less from the federal government. In all, the funding shortfalls at the two agencies, the New York City Housing Authority and the Housing Preservation and Development agency, could total more than $58 million by the end of the year.Mayor Bill de Blasio has for weeks insisted that the city would not make pre-emptive adjustments to its budget to account for what could amount to major cuts to federal funding for city programs. New York City received about 10 percent of its budget, or about $8.8 billion, from the federal government in the 2017 fiscal year.\u201cWe also are not going to say to folks in Washington, go ahead and cut us because we have so much money to put in \u2014 we don\u2019t,\u201d the mayor said Wednesday during an unrelated news conference about the city\u2019s coming ferry service. \u201cOur reserves could be eaten up very, very quickly if the magnitude of budget cuts that\u2019s possible here was to play out.\u201dThe decline in funding to the housing agencies does not affect only New York and was not initiated by the Trump administration. Nor does it represent a budget cut in the usual sense: a new federal budget has yet to be introduced in Congress. The federal government and all its programs are currently operating on the basis of a continuing resolution, which keeps the funding levels flat. That translates in some cases into a de facto decline because of rising costs.But rather than a simple cut, the decline in funding received by New York City was the result of a new formula adopted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington in anticipation of what is likely to be a dramatic change in the federal budget from a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.A spokesman for the federal Housing Department declined to comment on the changes, citing the fluid nature of the budget process in Washington that could adversely affect the federal agency.The impact was not felt everywhere equally. In Los Angeles, for example, the changes to the funding were small enough that they did not affect the city\u2019s public housing budget, according to officials there.\u201cThe City of L.A. has not felt the same financial challenges that N.Y.C.H.A. has experienced,\u201d said George Kivork, a spokesman for Mayor Eric M. Garcetti, a Democrat. He added that the city was nevertheless preparing for possible cuts. \"Los Angeles will push forward with local policies to fill any potential funding gaps,\u201d he said.In New York City, home to the nation\u2019s largest public housing program, the new formula resulted in real losses.The changes were described in the letters, laden with bureaucratic acronyms and funding formulas, that were sent to cities late last month. They translate to about $23 million less for New York City\u2019s housing department for the federal Section 8 program, which subsidizes private apartment rentals, if the same funding level holds through the end of the year.The city\u2019s department of Housing Preservation and Development \u201cis deeply concerned about the impact that future budget cuts would have on low-income New Yorkers,\u201d said Elizabeth Rohlfing, a spokeswoman for the agency. \u201cOur Section 8 program serves as an essential lifeline to struggling families across the City, and we will continue to advocate for the funding we need to sustain it.\u201dAt the public housing authority, the decline in funding is about $3 million a month, or $35 million if the changes hold in place through the end of the year, a scenario that city officials said was far from likely. The Wall Street Journal first reported the decline in funding to the city\u2019s Housing Authority.Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said that the city had not seen changes in other federal funding formulas and that no other agencies have adjusted their budgets in anticipation of cuts.But even as Mr. de Blasio was projecting steadfast resistance to any alteration in the city\u2019s approach in the face of uncertainty in Washington, officials at the city\u2019s Housing Authority were already quietly calibrating their budget to anticipate declines before receiving the February letters.Karen Caldwell, the agency\u2019s chief financial officer, said that she had braced for a decline in funding from the federal government as she prepared her agency\u2019s $3.2 billion budget for the coming year \u2014 just not down to the levels seen in the letters.She said anticipated getting about 87 cents on the dollar in federal reimbursement for the expense of running its apartments, down from about 90 cents last year; instead, she said, the federal Housing Department\u2019s new calculation gave the agency about 85 cents on the dollar.The new formula from the federal Housing Department does not apply to the whole year \u2014 new adjustments may come in subsequent months \u2014 but, Mr. Caldwell said, she was forced to begin planning for the entire year based on the changes.\u201cI can\u2019t manage this place on a month-to-month basis,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe more troubling issue is waiting for the second shoe to fall,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is just a precursor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nuclear Plant\u2019s Closing Raises New Fears for Jobs and Taxes", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 For years, many Westchester County residents and elected officials clamored for the Indian Point nuclear power plant to be shut down, citing what they said was the untenable risk it posed in an area as populated as greater New York City.Mostly, officials tried to placate legislators by citing the planned four-year schedule for closing the plant, while noting that some plants around the country had closed in as little as four months.\u201cThe benefit of the agreement is that it gives us a number of years to look at a whole range of issues,\u201d said Richard L. Kauffman, the state\u2019s so-called energy czar.As the hearing began, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office announced the creation of a task force to help the village, town and school district, which rely heavily on Indian Point tax revenue, with the transition.The task force, which includes representatives of 11 state agencies and state and local elected officials, will also be responsible for ensuring that Entergy, which owns the plant, complies with the terms of a shutdown agreement it reached with state.The announcement\u2019s timing could have been meant to blunt the criticisms of lawmakers asking questions at the hearing and some of the witnesses, including local officials, providing testimony.In a statement, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said, \u201cThe creation of this new task force will help ensure potential impacts on the local community will be minimized and that an open dialogue is maintained throughout this transition process.\u201dThe agreement calls for one of Indian Point\u2019s two reactors to permanently cease operating by April 2020; the other is to close a year later. The closing has been a chief goal for Mr. Cuomo, who had fought Entergy\u2019s efforts for a new federal license. The plant has grappled with 40 safety and operational events and unit shutdowns in the past five years.Indian Point, which is on the Hudson River in Buchanan, N.Y., supplies a good deal of inexpensive power to the New York area. It can generate more than 2,000 megawatts, about one-fourth of the energy consumed in New York City and Westchester.State officials on Tuesday asserted that almost half the lost energy could be made up through efficiency programs and improved transmission. The other half, the officials said, would come from the private sector, with the state encouraging renewable, nonpolluting energy sources like wind, solar and hydropower. Last year, the state unveiled a clean energy standard that requires half of New York\u2019s electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2030.\u201cNew York has had a really good history of power plants being built in response to demand,\u201d said Audrey Zibelman, chairwoman of the state\u2019s Public Service Commission. \u201cThe markets provide the economic signal that allow investors to invest. A number of generators said if there is a scarcity of supply, they\u2019d move in. I\u2019m not concerned about replacement power.\u201dLocal legislators expressed the strongest concerns about the closing\u2019s potential impact.State Senator Terrence Murphy, a Republican whose district includes Indian Point, asked Entergy officials pointed questions about the company\u2019s commitment to help the plant\u2019s 1,000 workers find new jobs.T. Michael Twomey, Entergy\u2019s vice president of external affairs, said the company would seek to move workers to several other nuclear plants it owns, mostly in the South, or retrain them for other utility jobs in New York.Mr. Murphy also said he resented how the shutdown had been negotiated without local input.\u201cThe optics of that are horrific,\u201d he said while questioning Mr. Twomey. \u201cI understand the reasons why you did that, but coming out with the devastating news in the newspaper, I believe it could have been rolled out differently.\u201dMr. Kaufmann had explained earlier that the talks were kept confidential because they were meant to settle litigation brought against Entergy by the state and the environmental group Riverkeeper.Others homed in on the issue of putting highly radioactive spent fuel into dry-cask storage on the plant\u2019s site. But Bruce A. Watson, chief of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s reactor decommissioning branch, said of such storage that \u201cmoving nuclear fuel is a routine operation at these plants.\u201dLate in the day, testimony turned personal, as local officials talked about their fears.Theresa Knickerbocker, the mayor of Buchanan, said village residents worried that property taxes would skyrocket after the plant closed, forcing them to sell their homes. Nearly half of Buchanan\u2019s operating budget is financed by revenue from the plant.\u201cIt\u2019s important to put a face on this problem,\u201d said Ms. Knickerbocker, a fourth-generation Buchanan native.Linda Puglisi, supervisor of the town of Cortlandt, which includes the plant, argued against the idea that the schedule for closing was generous.\u201cThree years goes by quickly \u2014 trust me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a long time.

{"Headline": "Signet Jewelers\u2019 Balance Sheet Gets Extra Sparkle", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byFair GameIn the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see a cockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.Beyond the sex discrimination case, what else might Signet shareholders worry about? Let\u2019s just say some of the company\u2019s accounting choices make its operations look rosier than they probably are.But Signet is not just a jewelry retailer \u2014 it is also a finance company. When a customer shops for an engagement ring at a Jared or Kay outlet, the company offers to finance the purchase in-house.Offering in-house credit is unusual in retailing. And it sets up a conflict for management: Does the company maintain strict credit decisions to protect its balance sheet, or loosen them to generate sales and executive bonuses?\u201cCompanies in every economic cycle cross a threshold where they go from prudent financing to overstimulating their sales with easy credit,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than trying to meet expectations and bonuses.\u201dMr. Ryan said he thought Signet started to cross that line in fiscal 2015. For fiscal year 2014, credit participation at its Sterling division was 57.7 percent; in the most recent full year, it was 61.5 percent.By contrast, credit participation at Zales, which has traditionally outsourced its financing, is around 40 percent.Asked whether it was relaxing its credit standards to lift revenues, David A. Bouffard, a company spokesman said, \u201cNo, the company\u2019s risk tolerance level has not changed.\u201dThe recent increase in credit sales is significant. Every 1 percent of sales supported by the in-house financing program contributes about 4 percent of the company\u2019s pretax profits, Mr. Ryan told clients in a note last fall. This makes the company \u201chighly susceptible to changes in credit trends and underwriting standards.\u201dHere\u2019s another potential problem: When a company provides internal credit to customers, it is eager to book the revenues associated with those transactions. But when customers fall behind on their payments, company management may be loath to recognize losses. This can result in a mismatch between the recognition of revenues and losses.Sterling\u2019s net credit portfolio stood at $1.7 billion in the most recent quarter. For the most recent nine months, the company\u2019s charge-off rates increased 8.1 percent, while reserve levels increased by only 0.1 percent.\u201cThere is a \u2018zombie\u2019 component of the portfolio that should be written off,\u201d Mr. Ryan wrote in a recent note. \u201cAny write-off would represent profits that were previously recognized that should not have been.\u201dSignet\u2019s shareholders may not be fully aware of the risks in its in-house credit portfolio. That\u2019s because it uses an unusual \u2014 and lenient \u2014 accounting method that minimizes delinquencies and makes a loan portfolio appear to be performing better than it would under a stricter approach.When assessing delinquencies among its in-house loans and setting up loan loss provisions, Signet uses the so-called recency accounting method. This approach computes delinquencies based on the date of the last full contractual payment on a loan.Under Signet\u2019s system, if a customer has made one full scheduled payment over a 90-day period, that loan is considered current.But under contractual accounting, which is far more common, that loan would be considered delinquent. That\u2019s because contractual accounting looks at the amounts past due in accordance with a loan\u2019s original payment terms.Even using the relaxed method, Signet\u2019s delinquency rates are high: It reported a 22.9 percent rate in its most recent quarter, up from 22.3 percent a year earlier.But those numbers become downright alarming given that recency accounting tends to understate delinquencies by approximately 50 percent, analysts say.Signet\u2019s use of recency accounting versus the more conservative method came up last fall in a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission.Asked to explain its use of recency accounting, Signet defended the approach, stating that it believes it \u201cprovides a more accurate reflection of its customers\u2019 performance relative to the ultimate collectability of the customer account.\u201d Further, it said its loan loss allowances took into account not just the age of the debt, but also \u201cfacts and circumstances specific to each of our account holders, macroeconomic trends and information, and other qualitative factors.\u201dMr. Ryan disputed this argument, flatly noting in a recent report that Signet\u2019s use of the recency method \u201cdoes not give an accurate portrayal of the credit quality of the portfolio.\u201dI asked Mr. Bouffard, Signet\u2019s spokesman, why the company doesn\u2019t tell its shareholders how different its delinquency calculations would be under the stricter approach. He pointed me to Signet\u2019s letter responding to the S.E.C., in which the company said recasting bad debt expense would be neither a relevant nor a meaningful disclosure for shareholders.Disclosures by another finance company that uses recency accounting do not support this stance, however.World Acceptance Corporation, a consumer finance company in South Carolina, uses recency accounting. But it also discloses results under the contractual method. In its most recent annual report, for example, World Acceptance noted that accounts past due by 60 days or more stood at 4.7 percent on a recency basis. Computed on a contractual basis, they were 7.1 percent.That\u2019s a pretty wide gulf.Given the beating that Signet shareholders have taken recently, you\u2019d think the company would be interested in giving them more information, not less.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patience Gone, Koch-Backed Groups Will Pressure G.O.P. on Health Repeal", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Saying their patience is at an end, conservative activist groups backed by the billionaire Koch brothers and other powerful interests on the right are mobilizing to pressure Republicans to fulfill their promise to swiftly repeal the Affordable Care Act.Their message is blunt and unforgiving, with the goal of reawakening some of the most extensive conservative grass-roots networks in the country. It is a reminder that even as Republicans control both the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade, the party\u2019s activist wing remains restless and will not go along passively for the sake of party unity.With angry constituents storming town hall-style meetings across the country and demanding that Congress not repeal the law, these new campaigns are a sign of a growing concern on the right that lawmakers might buckle to the pressure.\u201cWe\u2019ve been patient this year, but it is past time to act and to act decisively,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, which is coordinating the push with other groups across the Kochs\u2019 political network. \u201cOur network has spent more money, more time and more years fighting Obamacare than anything else. And now with the finish line in sight, we cannot allow some folks to pull up and give up.\u201dThe new mantra could be summed up as repeal, replace or revolt. Beyond the Koch network, other well-financed conservative groups like the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks are also increasing the pressure. All together, the new campaigns will involve advertising, rallies, phone calls to the Capitol switchboard and efforts to confront lawmakers in their offices with documentation of their own words about the need for repeal.The Koch groups are calling their campaign \u201cYou Promised,\u201d and are prepared to spend heavily, they said.The initial phase, which will cost in the low six figures, will include a nationwide digital advertising campaign featuring testimonials from people who say they were harmed by the Affordable Care Act. On Tuesday, the groups will kick off the effort with a rally near the Capitol, from which they will dispatch activists to congressional offices. Beyond that, Americans for Prosperity said it was prepared to bring \u201csignificant resources\u201d to bear as needed.FreedomWorks, which is planning a rally in Washington on March 15 to inaugurate its \u201cmonth of action\u201d on the Affordable Care Act, is sending its activists to Capitol Hill armed with sheafs of paper with quotes from Republicans who have called for repeal. The plan is to track down those Republicans and make them face their own words.\u201cI think that the only way we get members of Congress to stay the course on this is with constituent pressure,\u201d said Noah Wall, the national director of campaigns for FreedomWorks. If that does not work at first, he added, \u201cI\u2019m going to fill their offices with really angry constituents, and they\u2019re going to listen.\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019m going to go back into their district and fill their district offices with angry constituents. And we\u2019ll do this again and again.\u201dThe sudden caution of the Republican Party leadership, as it grapples with the enormously complicated challenge of replacing the Affordable Care Act, has baffled conservatives who have been fighting the health law for years. In the House, Republicans have voted dozens of times to dismantle the law, and it has been a primary issue in congressional races since 2010. Repealing the law, many conservative lawmakers believe, is the one clear mandate they have from voters.\u201cThe reality is, this is existential for Republicans,\u201d said David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, which has been sending emails regularly to its 100,000 members warning that Republicans could be stalling the repeal indefinitely. The group plans to directly target party leaders like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, in a new phase of the campaign.\u201cIf they don\u2019t repeal Obamacare and replace it,\u201d Mr. McIntosh added, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll stay in the majority in the next election.\u201dImplicit in the repeal push is a threat that conservative groups have always wielded over the party when they feel it is not being true to its convictions: primary challenges.And this early rift between the party\u2019s activist wing and its leadership in Washington could be a taste of what Republicans can expect now that they control the government entirely and are no longer able to blame Democrats for blocking their agenda. After making bold promises over the past few years on issues like overhauling expensive government programs, rewriting the tax code and defunding Planned Parenthood, Republicans face voter demands to follow through.Democrats, who have been cramming town hall-style meetings to implore Republican lawmakers not to take apart the health law, seem content to let their opponents fight it out in the hope that the divisions will lead to an impasse.\u201cTheir rhetoric that has enabled them to stir up the far right is in collision with the truth,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.The repeal effort by the conservative groups is intended to sway members of Congress who may be hesitating because of public pressure back home. That pressure, conservatives said, is no reason to renege.\u201cThis issue has been litigated in four federal elections, and the result has been historic Republican majorities in Congress,\u201d Mr. Phillips of Americans for Prosperity said. \u201cThat\u2019s why there is no sympathy when some Republicans talk about contentious town halls or a few hundred calls into their office.\u201dAmericans for Prosperity, which has spent tens of millions of dollars in advertising opposing the Affordable Care Act, is bringing back some of the subjects of its initial ads \u2014 ordinary people who spoke about the problems with \u201cgovernment-run medicine\u201d \u2014 for its new push. And it is arming activists with supporting evidence \u2014 it found, for instance, that 98 percent of Republicans in the Senate, or 51 of the 52, had voted at one point to repeal the law.\u201cCongressional Republicans have promised an Obamacare repeal in unequivocal terms,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to keep their promise.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But right now it represents the past.\u201dShimon Mercer-Wood, a spokesman for the Consulate General of Israel in New York, acknowledged that there had been a \u201ccertain back and forth\u201d between Ms. Regev and Mr. Nafar but said that Israel was still interested in funding \u201ca wide, diverse range of artists.\u201d He also noted that while the Israeli government, which is dominated by right-wing and religious parties, may be cautious about providing money, it is not limiting artists\u2019 expression.At the same time, he added, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the government has \u201ctaken a stricter approach to saying we won\u2019t fund a certain artist if we feel this artist is using the arts to undermine the legitimacy of the state of Israel,\u201d Mr. Mercer-Wood said. \u201cThat\u2019s true as a general statement. I wouldn\u2019t speak on behalf of the Ministry of Culture and say funding would not be given this film today. But yes, there is a more hard-line approach.\u201d\u201cUsually, the Arab is the object and the Jew is the subject,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this, I wanted the Arabs to be the subject \u2014 which is why the worst person in the film is also an Arab. The Jews are portrayed almost the way a kid in the ghetto sees the Jews\u201d \u2014 that is, without a lot of nuance.Inspired by Mr. Nafar\u2019s life and written with the Israeli-born screenwriter Oren Moverman (\u201cThe Messenger\u201d), \u201cJunction 48\u201d tells of an emerging rap artist, Kareem, who has issues with his family and confrontations with rival Jewish rappers, and experiences a political awakening. The demolition of a friend\u2019s home to build a \u201cMuseum of Coexistence\u201d is a pivotal event. (The title refers to 1948, when Israel gained its independence and thousands of Palestinians were ousted from Lyd \u2014 Lod in Hebrew \u2014 the railway-junction town where the film is set.) The film also has, Mr. Aloni emphasized, a feminist bent: Kareem\u2019s girlfriend, Manar (the Palestinian actress-singer Samar Qupty), is under pressure from family members, who consider her stage performances to be shameful; the threat of honor killing is implied.Released in Israel last May, \u201cJunction 48\u201d received mixed reviews there.\u201cTo my surprise, he wrote it in English,\u201d Mr. Moverman said. \u201cHe told me how he learned English from hip-hop and he felt comfortable writing in English. So we shaped an outline, Udi got involved, they worked on it in Hebrew and Arabic, and it eventually became the movie.\u201dMr. Nafar added, \u201cHe asked for 20 pages, and after two days I gave him 150.\u201dThe film\u2019s conclusion \u2014 involving Manar and her family, and much discussed by post-screening audiences \u2014 is open-ended, and initially made Mr. Nafar nervous. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how people were going to take it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut after the first screening, my wife told me how great it was.

The remains found at the site indicated that the victims might have been killed years ago, Mr. Winckler said.Describing the crime-ridden state as a \u201cgiant grave,\u201d Mr. Winckler said the state authorities would match D.N.A. samples at the scene to a database from the relatives of the missing.Mr. Winckler did not say when or by whom the pits were discovered, but the first graves in the area were found in August with the help of members of Colectivo Solecito, a group of women whose children are missing.The federal police and state prosecutors later discovered 125 clandestine graves over eight months across a large area known as Colinas de Santa Fe, said Luc\u00eda Diaz, a spokeswoman for the collective.On Mother\u2019s Day last year, some of the collective\u2019s members were approached at a street protest by cartel members who handed them a map indicating the locations of the graves, Mrs. Diaz said.With the new information, the collective raised money by holding bake sales and raffles to finance the searches, including paying for excavators.Among the remains recovered in the last six months and already identified were the bodies of a former state prosecutor and his secretary, who were kidnapped by police officers working for a drug gang in 2013.\u201cWhat we have found is abominable and it reveals the state of corruption, violence and impunity that reigns not only in Veracruz, but in all of Mexico,\u201d Ms. Diaz said.\u201cA reality that speaks of the collusion of authorities with organized crime in Veracruz, for it is impossible to see what we found without the participation of authorities,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Trump Budget, More for Military, as His Supporters May Lose Out", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisTo construct an \u201cAmerica First\u201d budget, the initial trade-off for President Trump was fairly obvious: The military and veterans would get more of what they want or need, while diplomats and foreign countries would have to make do with less.But in his first spending blueprint since taking office, Mr. Trump also made choices demonstrating that parts of America will be more first than others \u2014 and some of the budget losers, it turns out, may be some of the very constituencies that have been most supportive of the new president during his improbable rise to power.While border guards will have more prisons to lock up unauthorized immigrants, rural communities will lose grants and loans to build water facilities and financing to keep their airports open. As charter schools are bolstered, after-school and summer programs will lose money. As law enforcement agents get more help to fight the opioid epidemic, lower-income Americans will have less access to home energy aid, job training programs and legal services.The budget proposal that will be unveiled by Mr. Trump\u2019s White House on Thursday represents the most dramatic shift in how national resources are divvied up of any presidential spending plan since Ronald Reagan. In his rhetoric both before the election and since his inauguration, Mr. Trump outlined a vision of a country getting back to basics, tapping into a visceral sense among many Americans that Washington has been too generous with taxpayer money spent wastefully both at home and abroad while doing nothing to alleviate what he called the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d The budget is his first attempt to translate that into concrete reality.Mr. Trump wants to slash deeply into domestic and international programs to pay for a large military buildup and protect Social Security and Medicare without increasing the deficit or raising major taxes. As a practical matter, the budget may stand little chance of passing intact. But as a political statement, it represents a new way of doing business.\u201cTo keep Americans safe, we have made the tough choices that have been put off for too long,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in the introduction to the budget proposal. \u201cBut we have also made the necessary investments that are long overdue.\u201dNot surprisingly, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget would sharply ratchet back American investment in the outside world. The United States would cut back financing for international peacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance, cultural exchanges, refugee assistance and third world development. The United Nations, the World Bank and other institutions would no longer find themselves as flush with American dollars.What his budget proposal makes clear, however, is that such cuts, deep as they are, would not be enough by themselves to pay for his reinvestment in the armed forces, meaning that Mr. Trump had to turn to programs that might be defined by others as America-first in their orientation and goals.The tough choices he promised would eliminate longstanding staples of American life.Gone would be federal financing for public television, the arts and humanities. Federal support for long-distance Amtrak train service would be eliminated. Washington would get out of the business of helping clean up the Chesapeake Bay or the Great Lakes.While he may not care about East Coast elites upset about ending financing for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, some of the agencies and programs that would be \u201czeroed out\u201d are institutions in parts of the country that Mr. Trump won last November.Among the agencies to be cut off, for instance, would be the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal-state agency founded in 1965 to promote economic development and infrastructure in some of the poorest parts of the United States.Mr. Trump and his aides argue that many of these programs have long since passed their usefulness or would be better off run and paid for at the state or local level. While he talked about the ravaged inner cities in his Inaugural Address, Mr. Trump would eliminate $3 billion in funding for the Community Development Block Grant program that helps provide affordable housing. The president argued in his budget that \u201cthe program is not well targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results.\u201dSimilarly, federal support for rural airports should go, he argued, because it was originally conceived of as a temporary program nearly 40 years ago to provide subsidized commercial air service to communities that otherwise would not have flights.With the cost per passenger so high, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget argues that some of these communities are close enough to major airports that they do not need their own or that they \u201ccould be served by other existing modes of transportation.\u201dThe sharpest domestic cuts would scale back the Environmental Protection Agency, which Mr. Trump believes has hamstrung economic growth with excessive regulation.Under his plan, funding would be eliminated for international climate change programs, climate change research and President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to force power plants to limit their carbon emissions.More than 50 other E.P.A. programs would be eliminated, including those assisting Alaskan native villages and communities along the Mexican border. Funding for Superfund cleanups of hazardous waste sites would be reduced by about a third.The president\u2019s plan would make deep cuts in most areas to pay for increased military spending.\u201cThese cuts are sensible and rational,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in his budget message about his overall approach. \u201cEvery agency and department will be driven to achieve greater efficiency and to eliminate wasteful spending in carrying out their honorable service to the American people.\u201dEven with that, Mr. Trump would make no progress toward his campaign promise to reduce not only the annual budget deficit but the accumulated national debt. During the election, he said he could eliminate in just eight years the entire $20 trillion in debt that the nation has built up over generations.But he offered no plans to reduce the deficit in this proposal, simply offsetting $54 billion in increased military spending with $54 billion in domestic and international cuts.As a result, the nation next year will continue to spend more than it takes in through taxes and therefore will still add hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt.Mr. Trump made no mention of that in his budget message, but his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, a longtime deficit hawk, did, foreshadowing the tension that will eventually challenge this president as his term progresses. \u201cOur $20 trillion national debt is a crisis, not just for the nation, but for every citizen,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney wrote.But that will be a crisis for another day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Penn State Hockey, Still New to Division I, Chases First Tournament Berth", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byBut this weekend at the Big Ten tournament in Detroit, Penn State\u2019s team, now known as the Nittany Lions like the rest of school\u2019s athletic teams, is seeking to secure its first berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament, after only four years playing a full Division I schedule.That Penn State is even in contention for such an accomplishment is remarkable.Matt Wallace played on Penn State\u2019s 2003 A.C.H.A. title team. Back on campus two weeks ago for alumni weekend, he said he expected the Nittany Lions to struggle in their first years in Division I.\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to ramp up momentum, but they hit the ground running,\u201d he said about the team. \u201cI\u2019m impressed, but not surprised, because I know how Penn State operates. If they decide to do something, it\u2019s going to be top-notch.\u201dGuy Gadowsky, who twice took Princeton to the N.C.A.A. tournament, was hired the following April as Penn State\u2019s first varsity coach, and he coached the Icers in their last club season.\u201cHe was the complete package,\u201d said Joe Battista, a 1983 Penn State grad who coached the Icers for 19 years, winning five national titles. \u201cHe had energy and enthusiasm, and he understood the importance of building a fan base. It wasn\u2019t just, \u2018We gotta go win.\u2019\u201dPenn State\u2019s move to Division I allowed the Big Ten to form a hockey conference that included Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota and Wisconsin, who have won a combined 23 national titles.Gadowsky won 18 and 21 games in the next two years, then guided Penn State to a 13-1-1 start this season despite having 13 new players.\u201cHonestly, we probably were bracing for a bit of a rebuilding year,\u201d Gadowsky said in his office this month.The senior captain, David Goodwin, who scored as a freshman in the arena opener in 2013 and tallied twice in his home finale on March 4, said the eight freshmen on the roster contributed immediately.\u201cThey showed they could play a confident, reliable game in major roles,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made it easy for us to trust them.\u201dOn Jan. 16, after three victories in their first four games following the Christmas break, the Nittany Lions rose to No. 1 in the USCHO.com poll, heady progress for a program still in its infancy.The following weekend, Penn State hosted Ohio State. Mark Fischer, who covers the team for The Daily Collegian, said the atmosphere before the game \u201cwas like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. It felt like being at Beaver Stadium for an Ohio State football game.\u201dBut then, that was the plan all along. Battista, who worked closely with Pegula in securing the largest private gift in university history, said Pegula wanted \u201cthe rockingest arena in college hockey.\u201dTo that end, Pegula\u2019s days as a youth going to Sabres games at Memorial Auditorium inspired him to prod the lead architect, David Murphy, to create a steeply pitched student section behind the goal occupied for two periods by the opposing goalie.Called the Roar Zone, the 1,000 seats that extend from ice level to the rafters sell out in minutes at the start of each season. The pep band amps up the energy, as does an increasingly sophisticated student section. As Gadowsky noted, \u201cas we\u2019ve improved as a team, so has the student section.\u201d\u201cI think a big part of what\u2019s happening here is the support of the student body and the Roar Zone,\u201d Gadowsky added. \u201cI had extremely high expectations, and they have exceeded every expectation, every dream I possibly had about having a great atmosphere.\u201dAn official student organization, the Roar Zone meets monthly to brainstorm new cheers and routines intended to energize the crowd and unnerve the visiting goalie.The current Roar Zone president, Chris Godissart, a senior from Philipsburg, Pa., said interest in Penn State hockey had \u201cblown up\u201d over the last four years. He said Gadowsky provided support whenever asked, and had even attended meetings.Although he was familiar with Penn State\u2019s overall sports profile, Gadowsky said he did not fully understand the hockey culture that already existed on campus until he arrived. With many of its sports-loving students from the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia areas, Penguins and Flyers sweaters are mainstays of campus attire. The Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, who play about two hours away, have led the league in attendance the last 10 years, and Johnstown, Pa., also had a long minor-league hockey history, including being the inspiration for the movie \u201cSlap Shot.\u201dPenn State club games at 1,350-seat Greenburg Ice Arena, nicknamed The Thunderdome, often sold out.\u201cThis is a big hockey state,\u201d Gadowsky said.It also helps that Gadowsky, who fell in love with hockey in Edmonton, Alberta, in the 1980s watching the Wayne Gretzky-led Oilers, promotes a similarly dynamic style.Among this year\u2019s freshmen are wing Brent Murray, a 2016 fourth-round draft pick of the Sabres, and the towering Russian center Nikita Pavlychev, who was taken by the Penguins in the seventh round in 2015. The team\u2019s leading scorer is another Russian, the freshman left wing Denis Smirnov, who, like Pavlychev, moved to the United States as a teenager.\u201cThe first couple of years, we didn\u2019t have the blue-chip talent we can compete for now,\u201d Battista said.Penn State\u2019s presence among the nation\u2019s elite this year may be ahead of schedule, but the Moscow-born Smirnov is not surprised.\u201cWe have great upperclassmen,\u201d he said, \u201cso from the beginning of the season, I was believing our team could do something special here.\u201dIn many ways, it already has.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raiders Leaving Oakland Again, This Time for Las Vegas", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byThe N.F.L. gave its approval on Monday for the Oakland Raiders to move to Las Vegas, casting aside decades of fears that putting a team in the gambling capital would corrupt the sport, while sending the team to a new and growing market but one that is far smaller.The team owners, meeting in Phoenix, voted overwhelmingly, 31-1, persuaded that having a team in Las Vegas would allow the league to capitalize on the city\u2019s booming tourist trade and image of excitement, and on its willingness to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars toward the construction of a new stadium.For years, major leagues steered clear of Las Vegas because some owners worried that putting a team there would lead more players and referees to rub elbows with unsavory characters from the gambling world trying to influence games. But such attitudes have faded with the growth and acceptance of gambling around the country, and with the city\u2019s reduced reliance on revenue from its many casinos.The N.H.L. agreed last year to create a team in Las Vegas, the Golden Knights, that will begin play this year.The Raiders, known for a passionate fan base that delights in a rough-hewed image, are likely to begin playing in Las Vegas as soon as 2019, in temporary quarters, with the lease at their current stadium expiring after the 2018 season. In 2020, they are expected to move into a nearly $2 billion stadium, with $750 million in public financing, an arrangement that helped attract the league\u2019s interest. The rest of the money was expected to come from a $600 million loan from Bank of America to the team, $200 million from the league and revenue from naming rights and other deals.\u201cWe know that some fans will be disappointed and even angry,\u201d said Mark Davis, the Raiders\u2019 principal owner. \u201cBut we hope they do not direct that frustration to the players, coaches and staff.\u201dLibby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, said that losing the team would tear at the city\u2019s psyche and pride, and that the league would regret its decision.\u201cThe Raider nation is the last of the blue-collar, salt-of-the-earth fan bases, and it absolutely breaks my heart to lose this team,\u201d she said.The team will become the first to leave its home city, return and then leave again. The Raiders are also the third N.F.L. team to move, or announce a move, in a little more than a year, ending a period of turmoil in which the owners agreed to abandon longtime N.F.L. cities that were unable to appease the owners\u2019 desire for bigger markets and more public financing for new stadiums.Last year, the Rams left St. Louis for Los Angeles, and then the Chargers announced that they would leave San Diego to move in with the Rams, starting in the fall.Davis said repeatedly that he was frustrated with the efforts by lawmakers in California to replace the team\u2019s current home, Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, one of the oldest stadiums in the league.Unlike the Rams and the Chargers, who left immediately for their new homes, the Raiders will remain in Oakland for at least two more seasons while their new home is built, creating the specter of awkward lame-duck seasons. Davis said the team would continue to be called the Oakland Raiders during that time.Only Stephen M. Ross, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, voted against the deal. He said in a statement after the vote that not all the options to stay in Oakland had been exhausted. Other owners voted reluctantly for the move because, they said, the league would be leaving the sixth-biggest television market in the country for the 40th-largest. Oakland is also in the booming San Francisco Bay Area, home to some of the wealthiest fans and sponsors in the country.Las Vegas is recovering from one of the most brutal recessions in its history. Unemployment in Clark County, Nev., was 5.1 percent in January, compared with 14.1 percent in 2010.A region that was once the face of the foreclosure crisis is turning around, economists say. Las Vegas, which long led the nation in foreclosures, was ranked No. 22 in February, according to Attom Data Solutions, a housing tracker. The median price of a house in the Las Vegas region was $199,000 in January, a nearly 5 percent jump over the year before, still a far cry from the booming housing market in Oakland.And revenue from gambling \u2014 a key marker for tracking the health of the economy \u2014 increased 2.7 percent statewide compared with six months ago, according to the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.The league owners preferred the certainty of a substantial amount of tax dollars for a stadium over uncertain prospects for the team in Oakland, where Ms. Schaaf said often that her city could not afford to pay for the construction of a new stadium. She suggested it could provide the land and infrastructure improvements, and said she was working with Fortress Investments to secure construction financing. Yet in a letter he sent to the mayor last week, Commissioner Roger Goodell said that was not enough, all but sealing the team\u2019s fate.While the league\u2019s stance on Las Vegas has softened, it continues to uphold rules that prevent owners from holding stakes in gambling operations. That was a big reason that Davis ended his dalliance with Sheldon Adelson, the chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corp., who offered to pay for part of a new stadium in Las Vegas.The Raiders will be the second major team to go to Las Vegas, after the N.H.L. team, and there has been talk of Major League Baseball, M.L.S. and the N.B.A. moving to Las Vegas as well.The moves by the Rams, the Chargers and the Raiders ended a long period of relative stability. They were the first franchises to move in the league since the mid-1990s, when the Browns moved to Baltimore, the Rams to St. Louis and the Oilers to Tennessee.The decision to let the teams move has been wrenching and filled with vitriol. Lawmakers in St. Louis approved funding for a new stadium for the Rams, yet the N.F.L. owners rejected their efforts in favor of a proposal by the Rams\u2019 owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, to pay for a $2.6 billion stadium in Inglewood, Calif., south of downtown Los Angeles.After trying for years to get a new stadium in San Diego, the Chargers applied to move to Los Angeles in 2015. When the owners chose the Rams instead, the Chargers did an about-face and backed a referendum that would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars for a stadium in downtown San Diego. Voters soundly rejected the proposal.The Raiders, though, have a much wider following, in Oakland and across the nation. The team got its start as a charter member of the American Football League in 1960, then went to the N.F.L. when the leagues merged in 1970. After two Super Bowl victories in Oakland, the team owner Al Davis defied the other owners and moved to Los Angeles for the 1982 season, only to return to Oakland in 1995 after the city agreed to expand the Coliseum for him.The team\u2019s tough image delighted the port city\u2019s working-class fans, who earned a reputation for tormenting visiting players. Fans sitting in the \u201cBlack Hole,\u201d a cheering section near the field, perpetuated the team\u2019s menacing reputation.But as team after team moved into new stadiums over the last decade, and as the teams\u2019 valuations soared, Mark Davis, who took over ownership when Al Davis died in 2011, started to complain openly about his team\u2019s stadium.The team is the only one in the league that shares a building with a baseball team, the Oakland A\u2019s, and the Raiders are among the teams that generate the least amount of revenue from their home games, lacking the fancy suites and epicurean dining options that other stadiums have.Yet fans continue to flock to their games, including last season, when the team was 12-4 and, after 13 seasons without a playoff appearance, made the wild-card game, in which it lost to the Texans.Now it is Oakland that will be losing the Raiders. Again.Adam Nagourney and Michael Powell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe Hurt by New Disclosures Over Ties to Extreme Right-Wing Group", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 The leader of a scandal-tainted Japanese education group known for extreme right-wing views said Thursday that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had donated money to it in 2015, a claim that directly contradicted accounts by Mr. Abe.The assertion, if true, has the potential to inflict significant political damage on Mr. Abe. The group\u2019s leader, Yasunori Kagoike, did not immediately offer evidence to back up his claim.Accusations that Mr. Kagoike received improper financial favors from the government have escalated into a scandal that has dominated headlines in Japan and hurt Mr. Abe\u2019s approval ratings.Network news crews followed a group of parliamentarians to Mr. Kagoike\u2019s home in Osaka in Thursday, broadcasting live as the lawmakers waited to question him.Mr. Kagoike\u2019s extreme views have become a contentious issue in Japan, partly because of his links to prominent political figures. A kindergarten operated by his group seeks to promote \u201cpatriotism and pride\u201d by reviving elements of Japan\u2019s militaristic prewar education system. He has been accused of making derogatory statements about Chinese and Koreans.His political connections took on a newly troubling dimension after it emerged last month that officials had allowed Mr. Kagoike\u2019 group, Moritomo Gakuen, to buy government-owned land at a discount. The land was to be used for an elementary school, for which Moritomo Gakuen has been soliciting funds and drawing encouragement from the right.Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie, has been a prominent supporter, serving until recently as \u201chonorary principal\u201d of the planned school. She resigned the position last month amid the escalating furor.But Mr. Abe has denied that he had direct personal links to the group.\u201cHe did not donate money, or donate through Akie or his office or any third party,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the government spokesman, said on Thursday after Mr. Kagoike made his assertion.Previously Mr. Abe had said he would quit politics if he or his wife were found to have influenced official dealings with Moritomo Gakuen.Atsuo Ito, a political analyst, said that while a donation by Mr. Abe of his own money would have been legal, it would be \u201can ethical problem\u201d for him, because \u201cit could mean his statements until now have been lies, which would be a big incident that would shake the government.\u201dMr. Kagoike said he recalled having receiving donations in September 2015 \u201cincluding money donated by Abe.\u201dHe did not elaborate but said he would provide more information to Parliament. Mr. Abe\u2019s party, the Liberal Democrats, had resisted opposition demands to call Mr. Kagoike to testify, but relented on Thursday after Mr. Kagoike\u2019s remarks, according to NHK, the national broadcaster. Mr. Kagoike will testify on March 23, NHK said.In Mr. Kagoike\u2019s meeting with the lawmakers in Osaka on Thursday, he elaborated somewhat, members of the parliamentary group said afterward. Mr. Kagoike told them he had received 1 million yen from Mrs. Abe when she gave a speech at the kindergarten in September 2015, they said. The lawmakers also quoted him as saying he believed some of the money had come from the prime minister.Mr. Abe\u2019s defense minister, Tomomi Inada, has also been embroiled in the scandal. A former lawyer, she helped defend Moritomo Gakuen in a lawsuit in 2004, but under questioning in Parliament she initially denied working for the group. She retracted that statement this week and apologized, saying she had forgotten, but opposition parties have demanded that she resign.Officials in Osaka prefecture said this week they were considering filing a criminal complaint against Moritomo Gakuen over irregularities in the school\u2019s licensing application.In early publicity materials for the new school, Mr. Kagoike proposed naming it after Mr. Abe, a champion of conservative causes who has driven changes to Japan\u2019s school system, including revisions in history textbooks to soften depictions of Japan\u2019s wartime atrocities in its former Asian empire.The Finance Ministry allowed Moritomo Gakuen to acquire the land \u2014 a two-acre vacant lot near an airport in an Osaka suburb \u2014 for 134 million yen, or about $1.17 million, one-seventh its assessed value. Additional subsides for clearing landfill reduced Moritomo\u2019s outlay to next to nothing.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iceland, Symbol of Financial Crisis, Finally Lifts Capital Controls", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byNine years after a giant banking crash made Iceland a symbol of the global financial crisis, the government on Tuesday effectively declared that financial stability had been restored as it ended longstanding restrictions on the flow of money into and out of the country.Iceland\u2019s growth surge \u2014 the economy expanded 7.2 percent last year \u2014 represents a remarkable comeback since 2008, when the country\u2019s three main banks failed and its currency and economy fell into a tailspin. To prevent an outright collapse, the government imposed capital controls on businesses, pensioners and individuals.\u201cWithout the capital controls, Iceland would have suffered a much more serious fate,\u201d said Yngvi Kristinsson, the chief economist for the Icelandic Financial Services Association, a consortium of banks and insurance companies.Although untested at the time, the capital controls played a pivotal role in stopping panicked foreign investors and others from taking money out of Iceland and decimating its economy even further.Initially designated for six months, they dragged on for nearly a decade as financial authorities restructured debts and sought to diversify the economy, which had thrived on fishing exports before pivoting to the lucrative, and ultimately perilous, realm of international finance. In that time, the government has been locked in a longstanding dispute with international investors, after freezing their assets amid the crash.Iceland, a Nordic island nation of 330,000, has gradually been easing the controls for more than a year now, and their full removal on Tuesday signifies the country\u2019s return to international financial markets.Countries generally try to avoid using capital controls except in desperate circumstances because restrictions on the free flow of funds can cripple businesses and cause hardship for households short of cash.The capital controls have hit companies by deterring investment and raising borrowing costs. Their removal should help Icelandic firms that had not been allowed to invest in new operations outside the country.\u201cGood riddance,\u201d said Georg Ludviksson, the chief executive and a founder of Meniga, a digital banking software vendor based in Reykjavik. The company, with 80 employees, almost could not get 3.5 million euros, or $3.7 million, in foreign venture capital when it was set up in 2009.\u201cIt was hard to convince foreign investors to bring money into a country with capital controls,\u201d Mr. Ludviksson said. The company had to apply to the central bank for an exception, which \u201cslowed us down,\u201d he added.The combined assets of Iceland\u2019s three biggest banks were 14 times the size of the nation\u2019s economic output when the 2008 crisis hit. When the industry collapsed under $85 billion in debt, foreigners owned such a huge chunk of that figure that allowing them to take assets out would risk severely devaluing Iceland\u2019s currency, the krona.The country\u2019s success in engineering a recovery stands in contrast to the efforts of Greece, which uses the euro and does not have its own currency to manage.Greece has continued to falter since Athens imposed capital controls in 2015 as the country seemed to be veering toward abandoning the euro. Some restrictions have been eased, but they are mostly expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future. As long as Greece, now in its third international financial rescue program in seven years, continues to labor under a huge debt, economists see little hope of a recovery.Iceland, by comparison, did not have a huge national debt overhang, although corporations and individuals owed large sums after the financial crash, which some are still working off.The government, working with the International Monetary Fund, took steps to ward off future crises, including strengthening regulatory oversight of banks and curbing foreign currency loans. The authorities also sought to tamp down the oversize presence of banks in the economy by encouraging growth in tourism, fisheries, tech start-ups and renewable energy.With the cheap krona, tourism took off much faster than other new ventures because visitors could see the northern lights and the rugged Icelandic landscape at a steep discount.Today, tourism has exploded into Iceland\u2019s biggest industry, overtaking fishing and banking. With the number of visitors approaching two million a year, tourism revenue topped $3 billion in 2015, a third of the country\u2019s export earnings. Tourism is also the single biggest employer, accounting for a tenth of jobs.Over all, the unemployment rate has fallen to a near record low of 2.6 percent. Double-digit wage increases are crimping productivity and may encourage inflation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Many Icelanders are pouring money into services and new construction, and cranes keep rising across the country.And that seems to be the rub \u2014 in a bid to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on finance, Icelanders are wondering if they may have planted the seeds of another bubble.The current boom is healthier than the growth in the years leading up to the 2008 crash, which was driven by the flow of foreign funds, said Asgeir Jonsson, an economics professor at the University of Iceland.Still, growth in the past six years \u201chas been led by mainly one sector of the economy,\u201d he noted.\u201cIceland has become a very expensive destination, but the tourism sector keeps heating the economy,\u201d Mr. Jonsson said. \u201cWhat can be done to slow it, ban more visitors? Hardly.\u201dA picture caption on March 15 with an article about the lifting of capital controls in Iceland, where the economy has been improving, misstated the type of construction equipment shown. They are machines that pump concrete; they are not cranes.Egill Bjarnason contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maajid Nawaz\u2019s Radical Ambition", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "FeatureThe former Islamist has started a foundation to combat extremism among Muslims \u2014 and has made a lot of enemies in the process.Supported byA former Islamist, for the past nine years Nawaz has made a name for himself as an indefatigable anti-extremist activist. These days he blends seamlessly into the sort of cosmopolitan circles that extremists decry; at his club, dressed in an olive bomber jacket over fitted workout sweats, he could have been a senior marketing exec or a music-video director. At 39, Nawaz is handsome and vaguely famous looking in person, prematurely silver-haired, with a widow\u2019s peak and Mephistophelean soul patch that punctuates a politician\u2019s easy smile. Whenever I saw him, he dapped me with one of those handclasp-half-hugs that, to anyone of a certain age, serves as shorthand for an adolescence steeped in the manners of hip-hop.For Nawaz\u2019s detractors, of whom there are many, it\u2019s this very chameleon quality, this at-homeness in disparate roles and spaces, that has earned him a reputation as something of a charlatan, a preening opportunist cashing in on his own sensational travails by means of society\u2019s abundant anti-Muslim bias. This uncharitable narrative has shadowed him from the outset, yet his point of view has only grown more relevant after an exceptionally violent 2016 that saw coordinated suicide bombings in Brussels and Istanbul; a mass shooting in a nightclub in Orlando; the ambush and execution of a police officer and his partner near Paris; a Bastille Day slaughter in Nice; ax and suicide bomb attacks in Bavaria; the throat slitting of a Catholic priest in a church in Normandy; pressure-cooker bombs in Manhattan and New Jersey; and a massacre at a Christmas market in Berlin. And on March 22 this year in London, a man mowed down pedestrians with his car near Parliament before stabbing a police constable to death.With each grisly new assault \u2014 and the specter of Syria and the Islamic State looming beyond it \u2014 the voices of hatred and reaction in the United States and throughout Britain and Europe found not only sympathetic ears but also willing hands to pull levers in the voting booths. Throughout the upheaval and backlash, Nawaz has remained a constant presence in the media: on \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher,\u201d trying to draw a distinction between religion and political dogma; in his book, \u201cIslam and the Future of Tolerance\u201d (co-written with the prominent \u201cnew atheist\u201d Sam Harris), insisting that Islamism does have something to do with Islam and that ISIS in fact possesses a plausible if terribly ungenerous interpretation of the Quran. But whatever role Nawaz enjoys as a public intellectual is inextricable from his personal celebrity as a former fundamentalist. His work is his story, and his story is his celebrity. In order to make his case against radicalism, he finds himself in the not entirely enviable position of nonstop self-promotion.On this front, he\u2019s as busy as ever. He is finishing a documentary based on his book with Harris, but foremost on Nawaz\u2019s mind these days is the 2017 opening of the first new chapter of his anti-extremist organization, the Quilliam Foundation, in the United States. \u201cLots of Muslims in America are basically liberals, but if you don\u2019t have a visibly anti-extremist presence, then the Trumps of this world win\u201d through fear-mongering and misrepresentation, he says. \u201cOur presence is needed in America to reassure the mainstream, whereas our presence is needed in Europe to stop radicalization.\u201dDespite such deliberate affirmations and qualifications, there is nonetheless confusion as to where Nawaz\u2019s sympathies actually lie. According to Vice News, he has earned a \u201cterrorism\u201d designation on Thomson Reuters World-Check, a risk-assessment database. (Thomson Reuters would not confirm this.) But, last October, the Southern Poverty Law Center took the incredible step of including him on a \u201cField Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists,\u201d which they published with three other research organizations. The guide listed 15 public figures, and Nawaz was the only Muslim among them. (This is why Beirich brought him up at Duke.) He was visibly furious whenever the topic came up and told me he plans to crowdfund a legal response.Though he and his allies, and even some of his opponents, have complained to the S.P.L.C. \u2014 there is a change.org petition to remove him and the Somali-born atheist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which has garnered almost 12,000 signatures \u2014 the group has not wavered on its position, the costs of which have already been real for Quilliam. Nawaz claims that the listing has compromised some funding for the organization. \u201cI consider myself a liberal and wanted to work with liberals,\u201d he said, shaking his head.In reality, his views on Islamic extremism are more complex than these labels allow, which is, arguably, one of the more compelling reasons to listen to him on the subject.What\u2019s indisputable is that soon after that day in Southend, first following Kaashif\u2019s example but then with a fervency that was entirely his own, Nawaz threw himself into his new identity, falling under the sway of Nasim Ghani, a charismatic young recruiter and future leader of the British branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a multinational Islamic revolutionary organization founded in 1953 in Jerusalem. H.T., as Nawaz refers to it, advocates the imposition of Shariah law through \u201cbloodless\u201d coups in majority-Muslim countries first and ultimately in the West as well. In other words, these were Islamists but not jihadists, and the distinction isn\u2019t frivolous. Still, the line is a porous one: Two H.T. leaders, Anjem Choudary and Omar Bakri Mohammad, would go on to lead a splinter group of a far more deadly variety.In September 2001, after stints of organizing and recruiting for H.T. in London and Pakistan, Nawaz took his first wife and their infant son to Alexandria, Egypt, where he posed as an Arabic-language student while secretly proselytizing for the group. Though H.T. is legal in Britain, it is banned in many majority-Muslim countries, including Egypt. In 2002, at 24, Nawaz was forcibly removed from his home, blindfolded and thrown in the back of a van, one more Islamist caught up in the wide and extralegal international crackdown on extremism in the wake of 9/11. He spent his next four years in Egyptian prisons, where he claims to have witnessed torture and where, in his solitude, he was able to memorize half of the Quran.A pivotal moment in Nawaz\u2019s moral education came when news of the 7/7 attacks in London reached the inmates at Tora, Egypt\u2019s prison notorious for holding political dissidents. Four attackers bombed a bus and three subway trains, claiming 52 lives. Nawaz writes that he suddenly \u201cfelt revulsion\u201d at the human cost of his ideas. A man Nawaz calls Omar, a Dagestani bomb maker, had celebrated the slaughter. Nawaz is a hero in his own telling of the ensuing exchange: He claims to have debated Omar for the entirety of the day about the legitimacy of killing British civilians, until the latter eventually conceded defeat. Nawaz writes, \u201cI felt that I had saved many future lives.\u201dIn 2004, Amnesty International adopted Nawaz as a prisoner of conscience and secured his return to London two years later. His was not an overnight epiphany, but within two more years, he had graduated from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, renounced Islamism and H.T. and publicly reinvented himself as an advocate for liberal democracy: a media-savvy expert on preventing radicalization. His enemies, a long list made up of family members, ex-friends and former H.T. associates, have publicly questioned his conversion narrative. Ian Nisbet, a white convert to Islam who was jailed with Nawaz in Egypt, told a reporter from Alternet that Nawaz remained a fanatical Islamist after he was freed. Indeed, back in England, Nawaz appeared on the BBC\u2019s \u201cHardtalk\u201d program and declared that his experience in Egypt left him convinced \u201cthat there is a need to establish this caliphate as soon as possible.\u201d In his defense, Nawaz claims that making a clean break with a former life is both difficult and genuinely confusing. He rather colorfully compares it to a breakup with a lover. (Nawaz and his first wife split up around the time of his departure from H.T.) He has also insisted that his public positions were in part strategic: He didn\u2019t want to tip his hand to H.T. until he had his exit plans in place.Whatever the case, that same year, alongside a college friend named Ed Husain, who had already made a name for himself with his own reverse-conversion memoir, \u201cThe Islamist,\u201d Nawaz co-founded the Quilliam Foundation, which they named for William Quilliam, a British convert who opened one of Britain\u2019s first mosques in the late 1880s. Quilliam\u2019s first headquarters occupied the ground floor of a brick-and-terra-cotta rowhouse overlooking the verdure of Russell Square, practically the same view T.S. Eliot would have had when he worked at Faber & Faber, and just a block from two of the sites of the 7/7 attacks. As his critics constantly stress, Nawaz\u2019s timing was convenient; the British government was then looking to finance anti-extremist organizations and provided Quilliam with early funding.And that may be harder than it seems. While the vast majority of British Muslims today are certainly not flocking to join groups like H.T. \u2014 and many who have never been attracted to the ideology justifiably find it irritating to be lectured by a man who was \u2014 a sobering number nonetheless have expressed views that would be very much at home in even more extreme precincts. An online poll done in Britain following the 7/7 bombings, for example, showed that more than a fifth of British Muslims felt some sympathy for the bombers\u2019 feelings and motives; more than half said they could understand the bombers\u2019 behavior; and nearly a third agreed that \u201cWestern society is decadent and immoral and that Muslims should seek to bring it to an end\u201d by nonviolent means. One incredible Gallup report from 2009 found that 0 percent of British Muslims viewed homosexual acts as morally acceptable. Though it is not at all clear what pushes any given individual to cross the line into violence, attitudes like these are what Nawaz and Quilliam have controversially described as the \u201cmood music\u201d to terrorist acts.It is this last contention that seems to be the crux of the S.P.L.C. complaint against Nawaz, along with the disclosure that, in 2010, Quilliam provided a list of nonviolent \u201cIslamist\u201d organizations to a British counterterrorism official. But Nawaz justifies the move by arguing that the distinction between violent and nonviolent Islamism is far less rigid than many liberals would like to think. \u201cNow when these guys are joining ISIS, the arguments have been made,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is just putting that last piece in the jigsaw: \u2018I\u2019m going to go and fight for this cause.\u2019 But the ideology\u2019s already been established. The surveys and the polls tell you that.\u201dAside from the life experience of some of its members and the issuance of the occasional counter-fatwa, Quilliam is a standard left-of-center think tank: a body of experts conducting research and providing advice and ideas on specific political or social problems in support of liberal democracy. The group works to shape public opinion from the top down, making frequent media appearances, publishing reports that aim for the highest levels of government (such as a critical 2009 investigation into the ways British prisons incubate extremism) and periodically advising government ministers and heads of state on matters of terrorism. But they also engage ordinary Muslims and non-Muslims alike through outreach work, organizing debate and training programs in Europe and the Middle East.All of this ought to make Quilliam a natural ally of progressives and of institutions like the Southern Poverty Law Center, whose mission, after all, is to advocate for the vulnerable. Yet that has not been the case. Nawaz\u2019s layered arguments and concessions \u2014 his insistence, for example, that Islam does have something to do with Islamism \u2014 provoke a visceral suspicion among those who are concerned with fighting Islamophobia above all. A term that you will hear with frequency from Nawaz is \u201cthe regressive left,\u201d as in purportedly progressive institutions like the S.P.L.C. that, often starting from a legitimate concern that Muslims en masse not be persecuted for the actions of a few, nonetheless embody a perplexingly backward mind-set when it comes to Islam. \u201cIt\u2019s an Orientalist fetish,\u201d Nawaz says, \u201ca deeply socially conservative Muslim who is medieval in their outlook is a \u2018real\u2019 Muslim, and anyone who\u2019s challenging that status quo is a sellout.\u201d The left has, in Nawaz\u2019s view, forfeited what\u2019s best about the liberal project, entirely conceding the right to speak in moral absolutes and about universal values. \u201cThe problem is you can\u2019t draw a line with that reasoning: Why is what ISIS is doing bad, then?\u201dA core idea Quilliam espouses is that space must be claimed for secular identities within Islam; the measure of Muslim authenticity would then be a matter of individual imagination and will, not a test to pass or fail. In other words, he would like to see many more Muslims thinking, speaking and acting like him. Which is a big part of the reason it\u2019s impossible to think of Quilliam independent of the outsize figure cut by its co-founder, and why so much debate about the validity of the organization\u2019s ideas comes down to a question of being for or against Nawaz.Attack pieces about Nawaz have practically become their own literary genre. In the summer of 2015, The Guardian ran a deeply critical story about him, which questioned the integrity of Nawaz\u2019s work with the Cameron administration and took him to task for, among other misdeeds, \u201csipping a skinny flat white\u201d coffee in front of the reporter. This was followed, in January 2016, by a hard takedown at The New Republic, whose writer, Nathan Lean, had earlier referred on Twitter to Nawaz as Sam Harris\u2019s \u201clap dog.\u201d Roughly a week after that piece came a longer, even more personal attack at Alternet, which stood out in its attempt to debunk, scene by scene, the events in \u201cRadical.\u201d The authors revisited the subject of the bomb in the backpack and quoted Nawaz\u2019s older brother as well as an anonymous cousin, who called the story \u201cimaginary.\u201d (Many of the sources in the Alternet article seem concerned that Kaashif\u2019s ruse in the anecdote might be taken literally.) When I asked him about it, Nawaz was dismissive. \u201cYou go to a deeply wounded brother that loved me all of his life, and I turn out to be not who he aspires for me to be,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a journalist, you can exploit that.\u201d He shrugged soberly.It is undeniable that one advantage, and shortcoming, of memoir as a form lies in its ability to dominate the reader through an empirical imbalance that can never be resolved in its entirety. Arguments, when unsound, can be negated, but who can negate another person\u2019s lived experience? It is a rhetorical tactic that is, in fact, most at home on the left, where personal stories of grievance and oppression are typically set in opposition to the status quo in the wider society. Perhaps, then, this is why so much attention has been paid to Nawaz\u2019s biography. If his life story can be shown to be contrived, the deeper message, however compelling, can be pre-emptively dismissed: Not only is the messenger\u2019s life not a genuine Muslim life, when seen from this angle, it may even prove to be an anti-Muslim life.It reminded me of an observation that had been running through my head since the previous winter, when Quilliam opened an art exhibit in London called \u201cThe Unbreakable Rope.\u201d Billed as \u201can exploration of sexuality in Islam,\u201d the show was co-curated by Nawaz\u2019s second wife, Rachel Maggart (the couple had their first child in January), a lanky 32-year-old brunette from Tennessee by way of N.Y.U. In addition to the regular Quilliam bodyguards, there were plainclothes counterterrorism officers monitoring the site. Inside the venue, a shirtless, tattooed Kuwaiti performance artist did preparatory stretches with his assistant and a crystal ball. He would eventually be tied up in a corset and left on the floor for guests to contemplate. The crowd sipped wine and soft drinks and milled about the sparsely hung, mildly provocative artwork, which was in fact beside the point. The point, of course, was that they were even daring to do this in the first place.I fell into conversation with Nawaz\u2019s mother and little sister and lost track of time as the space filled up all around us. There were whites, blacks, Persians, Arabs; people looked devout and nondevout, gay, straight, young and old. Standing next to me was a man with the voluminous beard of a cleric, turned out in an ankle-length djellaba, ironed as crisply as a bedsheet at the Ritz, a pair of Nike Air Force 1s and a flat-brimmed New Era cap printed with a four-letter expletive. He looked like a cross between the leader of Hezbollah and the Bay Area rapper Lil B. The room darkened and quieted, and Nawaz, brimming with life, stepped into the middle of the crowd, whose diversity he lauded, and thanked them all for coming. Like the B-boy he once aspired to be, he thrills to the sound of his own voice flowing through the microphone. \u201cThe first thing they do is try to silence us, and the first to suffer are the creators!\u201d he told the room to enthusiastic applause. \u201cBut while you throw gays off the rooftops, we who are Muslims want to respond like this!\u201dAs I watched Nawaz bask in the applause of his most earnest admirers and glanced back at the walls adorned with such unbearably unhip art, the enormity of his task pressed itself upon me. After all, Islamism, like good art, is innately subversive; it captures diffuse feelings of alienation in a way that is difficult to fabricate. And therein lies the biggest challenge confronting Quilliam in Europe and, as it seeks to expand, in America: Though Nawaz himself is a star, there is something both noble and perilously square about this kind of eat-your-peas forced secularism.Yet I\u2019m convinced that Nawaz really does have his finger on the pulse of one of the most urgent problems of the contemporary era, a problem that is far too often mishandled or greeted with flat-out denial, through ignorance, hatred and fear, certainly, but also as a result of the very best of intentions. Without having planned to, I found myself at the hotel bar in New York opening up to Nawaz about a recent train ride my wife and I made in France. I watched an agitated young Arab man and his wife, in full abaya, shut themselves inside the bathroom along with all of their luggage. When they opened the door, the hair on my neck stood up, and I braced myself for a fusillade that never came. Even as I chastised myself for overreacting, I was convinced that the man continued to behave strangely. My shame increased with each moment nothing happened.Nawaz listened intently to my story, but his eyes showed he\u2019d long since arrived at his answer. \u201cYou\u2019re caught in a classically Catch-22 situation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two competing forces, which are entirely legitimate. One is not wanting to racially profile, and the other is not wanting to be the neighbor of the San Bernardino shooter who didn\u2019t want to profile and, as a result, people lose their lives. Or, more urgently, [you] just don\u2019t want to be the first person to catch a bullet! On a human level, that is a perfectly natural reaction.

{"Headline": "Will a Leak Reveal Trump\u2019s Tax Returns? Don\u2019t Hold Your Breath", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The early days of the Trump administration have turned Washington into a land of leaks, with a national security adviser\u2019s telephone calls, raw intelligence dossiers and confidential C.I.A. surveillance schemes spilling into the public. But the holy grail of leaks remains elusive: President Trump\u2019s tax returns.As taxpayers scramble to file their own returns and Republicans push to overhaul the tax code, attention has shifted back to Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes and how he could benefit from the sweeping legislation he hopes to sign. Looking for the ultimate leak, opponents of Mr. Trump have wondered aloud how it could be that top intelligence agencies are suddenly fonts of classified information while the staid tax collector remains hermetically sealed.\u201cThe American people deserve to know what conflicts of interest are hiding in Trump\u2019s taxes,\u201d said Delvone Michael, a member of the Tax March executive committee, which is organizing a mass demonstration to call for the release of the tax returns next month. \u201cEvery president in a generation has released his taxes. Trump must too.\u201dMr. Trump broke with 40 years of tradition as a presidential candidate, declining to make his tax information public on the grounds that he was undergoing an I.R.S. audit. The government has made clear that is, in fact, no impediment to release, but since corporations like the Trump Organization are audited constantly, the excuse will not disappear, and he is not expected ever to release his returns willingly.So how might Mr. Trump\u2019s returns come to light?If you\u2019re thinking about a rogue I.R.S. agent or Russian cybertheft, don\u2019t count on it.\u201cI think an I.R.S. leak is extremely unlikely,\u201d said Fred Goldberg, who served as I.R.S. commissioner from 1989 to 1992. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the culture, the legal framework, the logistics and the risks.\u201dAlthough the I.R.S. has nearly 80,000 employees, the agency uses strict safeguards when it comes to privacy. The number of people with access to returns is limited, and improper browsing of taxpayer files is automatically flagged.\u201cI would never say never, because it has happened in the past,\u201d said Lawrence B. Gibbs, another former I.R.S. commissioner who was its chief counsel when Mr. Nixon\u2019s tax information was made public. \u201cBut people are probably going to have to look elsewhere than the I.R.S. for the president\u2019s tax returns if that\u2019s what they want.\u201dJeffrey Greene, senior director for global government affairs and policy at the cybersecurity firm Symantec, said that the agency appears to have strengthened its computer systems since the theft two years ago, noting that Mr. Trump\u2019s returns remained secure during the presidential campaign.\u201cJust the simple fact that those returns were never stolen or leaked over the past year speaks to the level of security on them,\u201d said Mr. Greene, whose company works with the I.R.S.Democratic lawmakers lately have been playing the national security card, clinging to the notion that congressional investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s ties with Russia will be the key. Twice this month they have forced votes to demand the returns\u2019 release, but Republicans have closed ranks around the president.\u201cI think that certainly in our emoluments case they will be germane to establish the foreign cash and relationships and other benefits,\u201d said Norman L. Eisen, an Obama administration ethics lawyer who is on the legal team that filed the lawsuit. \u201cShould we make it to discovery, we\u2019ll seek them.\u201dIf the court system seems too cumbersome, there are potential targets beyond the I.R.S. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers and accountants who keep copies of his returns could also be vulnerable to hacking. And the White House and Trump Tower, where copies of Mr. Trump\u2019s files could potentially be stored, have also proved susceptible to leaks.\u201cThere are a number of tax proposals that would benefit him on a personal level,\u201d said David Herzig, a tax expert at Valparaiso University School of Law, who pointed to a potential estate tax repeal and lower individual tax rates for the rich. \u201cThere are many dimensions to tax reform, but the constant is that the proposed modifications help people that have similar investment profiles as President Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beginning \u2018Brexit\u2019 and Bracing for Impact", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The world did not end. No recession unfolded. Nine months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, disregarding warnings of grim economic consequences, a nation famous for calmly carrying on has seemingly gone about its business.As Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday officially initiated Britain\u2019s exit from Europe \u2014 Brexit, in everyday talk \u2014 the lack of disaster was touted by those steering the departure as a sign of little trouble ahead.\u201cThere were predictions about what would happen to the economy if the United Kingdom voted to leave,\u201d Ms. May told Parliament on Wednesday. \u201cThose predictions have not proved to be correct. We see a strong economy.\u201dBut the reassuring talk did not reckon with one significant detail: Nothing has actually happened yet.Mrs. May has only set in motion the complex, politically fraught divorce proceedings through which Britain must settle its affairs with the 27 jilted members of the European Union. The outcome will almost certainly be costly: Britain has placed in jeopardy its trading relationship with Europe, its largest customer for exports, while imperiling London\u2019s status as banker to the planet.The markets essentially shrugged. The move was as expected as the next Super Bowl. The pound dipped a tad. So did shares on London\u2019s stock market.The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.The immediate impact of Mrs. May\u2019s action was to start negotiations on future dealings across the English Channel. Those talks have a two-year deadline. If no deal is struck before then, Britain and Europe would plunge into a state of chaotic uncertainty.Trade would revert to the rules of the World Trade Organization, making Britain\u2019s exports to Europe vulnerable to tariffs and other barriers to commerce, including health and safety rules.London\u2019s bankers would be effectively severed from Europe, with many transactions for clients based on the Continent rendered illegal.Until now, such issues were wrapped in layers of hypotheticals, with the details left for some indeterminate day when Britain\u2019s government would make it real. That day has come.Though the financial industry has been preparing to move jobs to other financial capitals in anticipation of a messy Brexit, other industries have waited for clarity. Now, they will feel pressure to act \u2014 shifting some lines of business to European capitals, perhaps shelving British expansions.Global banking giants like Citigroup, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase may soon carry out plans to shift thousands of jobs to financial centers in the European Union. Goldman Sachs recently confirmed that it is moving hundreds of jobs out of London while expanding offices in Frankfurt and Paris.Vodafone, the telecommunications giant, said after the referendum that it might shift its headquarters from London.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cThe fact of setting this clock ticking is significant, because two years for many businesses is enough time for them to adapt, but short enough that they have to start making decisions really quickly,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, an economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. \u201cYou will start to see very observable, concrete consequences of Brexit very soon.\u201dBritain has exploited its inclusion in Europe\u2019s vast single market to make itself a dominant hub for multinational companies as various as aviation, pharmaceuticals and finance. They have set up factories, marketing teams and trading floors in Britain while selling to clients from Ireland to Greece, as if this swath of geography \u2014 home to some 500 million people \u2014 were one country.So much for all that.European leaders have consistently reaffirmed that remaining in the single market requires that Britain accept the free movement of people. That collides with a primary aim of many Brexit supporters \u2014 restricting immigration.After months of pretending that a finesse could be found, Mrs. May in January declared her government\u2019s choice: enter immigration limits, goodbye single market.Long before this political reckoning with reality, executives at global banks were already mulling which jobs to move from London to other cities in the European Union \u2014 Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Luxembourg.\u201cPeople will have to move,\u201d said William Wright, founder and managing director of New Financial, a research institution in London. \u201cThere\u2019s no other option.\u201dBrexit supporters called the outcome a template for how a pragmatic British government would prevent businesses from abandoning its shores \u2014 with tax cuts, friendly regulation and deal making. But if Britain promised anything meaningful to Nissan, it probably violated World Trade Organization rules. Nissan has since said it continues to assess the uncertain economics of Britain. Ford and BMW are reassessing their British factories, too.For now, Britain has managed to avoid the most frightening economic forecasts.Before the referendum last June, the British Treasury predicted that a vote to exit could shrink the economy by as much 6 percent annually for the first two years.The economy expanded by 1.8 percent last year. British consumers continued to spend. British factories continued to churn out cars, medical devices and aircraft parts, many of them destined for Europe.This month, Toyota announced plans to sink an additional \u00a3240 million (about $297 million) into a factory in Derbyshire, though it qualified that it required reliable access to Europe. Snap, the parent company of social media darling Snapchat that raised $3.4 billion in an initial public offering, recently picked London as its international headquarters.But consumer spending has been increasingly paid for by debt. The British pound has surrendered 17 percent of its value against the dollar since the referendum, raising the cost of imported goods. Investment is flagging.A weaker pound helps exports, making British goods cheaper on world markets. But exports have also been aided by the very thing Britain is trying to ditch \u2014 inclusion in Europe.Proponents of Brexit tend to dismiss Europe as a land leading only in the numbers of unemployed men who are moving in with their parents. Britain\u2019s next era is supposed to be centered on trade with faster growing, innovative nations like the United States.Britain and Europe must negotiate a trade deal that will prevent a rupture to commerce. During the campaign, Brexit supporters argued that Europe would ultimately make it happen because its most powerful member, Germany, now sends a parade of BMWs, Audis and Volkswagens to Britain.But trade negotiations are vulnerable to the manipulations of politically protected industries. This one seems particularly prone to acrimony. European leaders confront existential threats to their union, with political parties across the Continent hostile to its powers. Many are intent on using Britain to illustrate what they contend happens when a member leaves \u2014 nothing good.\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d said Mr. V\u00e9ron, an economist. \u201cYou don\u2019t allow someone who leaves the club to have better terms than someone who\u2019s in the club, or otherwise the club doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201dWhatever the comparative rankings of unfortunate events, Britain\u2019s leaving Europe sans deal would be bad, as economists and people running businesses have said.It is often said that businesses fear uncertainty more than anything. Mrs. May just eliminated some of that. But she replaced it with an apparent certainty that presents its own troubles: Britain really is departing the largest consumer market on earth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, Caltrain Upgrade Is Imperiled as Trump Withholds Funds", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The engineers of Silicon Valley are fine-tuning driverless cars, building robots designed to replicate the human brain and shaving milliseconds off internet response times.Their trip to work, however, can be a throwback to the predigital age. The region\u2019s commuter rail line is saddled with aging, smoke-spewing, diesel-powered locomotives.For more than a decade, the managers of the Silicon Valley railway, known as Caltrain, have been planning to upgrade to faster and less polluting electric trains.But those plans are now imperiled by the Trump administration\u2019s decision in February to withhold a $647 million federal grant.In this impasse, some transportation experts see a foretaste of the political infighting and financial hurdles that could plague the nationwide infrastructure projects that President Trump is promising. Reviving America\u2019s rusted and sagging infrastructure is one of the few areas where it seemed Democrats and Republicans could agree. But making these projects a reality \u2014 the \u201cnew roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land\u201d that Mr. Trump enumerated to Congress last week \u2014 will require political cooperation and accommodations that are increasingly rare in ultrapartisan times.In the case of Caltrain, the decision to withhold the grant came after California\u2019s Republican congressional delegation asked the transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, to withdraw funding because the electrified system also would be used for the state\u2019s bigger high-speed rail project, a plan they vehemently oppose.The high-speed rail line connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles is the most ambitious rail plan in the country and has been in the works for more than two decades with a projected cost of $64 billion. The project calls for completion in 2029.Despite initial support, Republicans now regard the high-speed project as too costly.\u201cWe have said no more federal dollars will go to California high-speed rail,\u201d said Representative Jeff Denham, a Republican who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Railroads. \u201cWe\u2019re very strong on that position.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Denham said the project should immediately stop.There has long been tension in California between advocates of more freeways and those favoring public transport. But the high-speed rail project had bipartisan support in its early stages. It was formally started in 1996 by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and was supported by another Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.That consensus is long gone. The letter penned by the state\u2019s 14 Republican members of Congress, including Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, called the project a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and described the Caltrain grant as an \u201cirresponsible use of taxpayer dollars.\u201dCaltrain and the high-speed rail project are administratively separate, but a 2013 agreement to share tracks as a cost-saving measure raised Republican ire.Defunding the electrification of the Silicon Valley corridor has immediate consequences for the system\u2019s 65,000 daily commuters. Caltrain had hoped to switch to its electric system by 2021. The current trains are overcrowded and breakdowns are frequent; there are more than 19 mechanical failures per month, according to Caltrain engineers. Two-thirds of the fleet has \u201creached the end of its useful life,\u201d Caltrain says.At the rail line\u2019s maintenance depot, engineers say they have trouble finding parts for the locomotives, which were built in the 1980s. And new maintenance workers need lectures from veteran technicians because they have no experience working on such old equipment.\u201cYou change out parts here and there,\u201d said Joe Navarro, director of operations and maintenance at Caltrain. \u201cWe are putting Band-Aids on. It\u2019s very challenging.\u201d\u201cWe are lucky to live in a place where innovation is in the DNA, but we don\u2019t see that for public transport,\u201d said Sridhar Iyer, a software engineer for Twitter who rides the double-decker Caltrain that runs near the headquarters of Apple, Facebook and Google. \u201cThe whole thing is stuck in the past.\u201dIn recent weeks, more than a dozen leaders of Silicon Valley firms called lawmakers to urge that the federal money be released for the Caltrain electrification project, according to Carl Guardino, the president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents most of the region\u2019s large tech companies.Mr. Guardino called the Republican campaign to block funding \u201ca misinformed effort.\u201d\u201cThe most important asset of the innovation economy are our employees,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they are stuck and stalled in traffic they are not productively creating the future.\u201dThe specific objection by Republicans is that $600 million of state funds allocated to Caltrain\u2019s electrification were initially authorized by a 2008 referendum on high-speed rail, known as Proposition 1A.\u201cThey are stealing Prop 1A money and using it for something else,\u201d Mr. Denham said.Caltrain says that although the two trains will use the same tracks, the electrification project is \u201cindependent\u201d and high-speed rail\u2019s use of the corridor will require a separate environmental review.The bigger picture, proponents of the electrification project say, is that the commuter rail project deserves the support of the Trump administration because it meets the broad criteria of its infrastructure push \u2014 it will be made in America by American workers. Almost all of the materials for the new train system will be sourced from factories across 14 states. Caltrain estimates the project will create nearly 10,000 jobs.\u201cThis is the perfect project if you care about infrastructure, if you care about jobs and if you care about focusing on areas that are going to deliver long-term economic benefit,\u201d said Stuart Cohen, the executive director of TransForm, a nonprofit group that advocates public transportation.The state High-Speed Rail Authority is making a similar pitch. \u201cEvery ounce of the steel, every ounce of the concrete is domestic,\u201d Dan Richard, the authority\u2019s chairman, said. \u201cWe are reaching out to the Trump administration to make the case that this is entirely consistent with the president\u2019s vision.\u201dOutside Fresno, a city in California\u2019s Central Valley surrounded by almond and fruit orchards and racked by poverty, about 1,000 workers have been employed on the project to build viaducts and tunnels at 10 construction sites.The Finance Department of Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, decided on Friday that the project was ready to lay some track and approved $2.6 billion in spending. But there are lingering questions about how the later stages of the project will be financed, especially if Congress blocks more federal support.Although the authority was established more than two decades, ago it was only in 2013 that construction began on the first, 119-mile segment of the project.Mayor Lee Brand of Fresno, a Republican, supports the project, which would make Silicon Valley a 45-minute train ride away by 2025.\u201cI don\u2019t look at this ideologically,\u201d Mr. Brand said. \u201cI look at it practically. The city of Fresno can enjoy a major benefit from what\u2019s going on with high-speed rail. This is a poor city that needs all the help it can get.\u201dTom Richards, a real estate developer in Fresno who is on the authority\u2019s board, said the rail connection could encourage tech companies to set up in the city and workers to commute to well-paying jobs in Silicon Valley.\u201cThis is a whole story about connecting California together,\u201d he said.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

Kmart, which has its own lengthy history beginning as a five-and-dime store in Detroit, became a major national presence in the 1960s as a big-box department store, with Blue Light Special discounts geared toward penny-wise middle-class Americans.But both brands were squeezed by Walmart Stores, with its heavy discounts, and Target, which sold affordable goods but with more design and flair. Both Sears and Kmart also suffered because they were in older shopping malls and neighborhoods. Online retailing, with the rise of the likes of Amazon, presented a more recent challenge.In February, Sears Holdings said it had started a restructuring program that it said would save $1 billion annually. The plan focuses on streamlining back-office corporate and support functions, tweaking product offerings and supply chain and looking for ways to reshuffle real estate.As of January, Sears Holdings said, it had 1,430 Sears and Kmart stores in the United States.

{"Headline": "New Firms Catching Up to Banks in Foreclosure Rankings", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byThe number of home foreclosures is down sharply from the depths of the financial crisis, even as many of the mortgage firms involved remain the same, including Fannie Mae, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.But the latest foreclosure rankings also include a number of firms that barely registered or did not exist when the crisis began a decade ago.These new entrants include firms affiliated with the private equity giant Lone Star Funds, the mortgage lender PennyMac Loan Services, the investment bank Goldman Sachs and the mortgage firm Carrington Mortgage Services.This changing of the guard in the foreclosure rankings, based on data compiled by RealtyTrac, reflects the new reality that most foreclosures today are not coming from mortgages written during the post-crisis period, but from soured loans written before the crisis that are in the final stages of liquidation.Most of these newer firms that are moving up in the foreclosure rankings are ones that have bought soured mortgages and are looking to profit by restructuring those loans and getting delinquent borrowers to start making payments again. And when those efforts fail, the firms are foreclosing on borrowers, taking back the homes and reselling them.\u201cThe players who are running counter to the overall trend in foreclosures are ones who have been involved in purchasing nonperforming loans over the past few years,\u201d said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of ATTOM Data Solutions, the parent company of RealtyTrac. He added that these new firms were \u201ctaking on the risk that the big banks want to distance themselves from as much as possible.\u201dForeclosure activity in the United States stemming from the financial crisis peaked in 2010 with lenders foreclosing and taking possession of about 835,000 homes, according to RealtyTrac. Ever since, the pace of foreclosures has been on a downward trajectory. Last year there were 264,458 foreclosures \u2014 the lowest number since 2006, the data firm said.At the big banks, the decline in foreclosures is striking.In 2016, JPMorgan foreclosed and took the titles of 6,221 homes compared with 25,126 homes in 2010. At Wells Fargo, the number of completed foreclosures last year was 17,850, down from 57,098 in 2010. And at Bank of America, 7,756 homes were foreclosed on, compared with 43,612 in 2010, according to RealtyTrac.The number of foreclosures is down as a result of big banks\u2019 selling delinquent loans and modifying distressed mortgages to comply with the terms of their multibillion-dollar settlements with federal and state authorities. The settlements arose out of investigations into the banks\u2019 sales of flawed mortgages and mortgage bonds in the run-up to the financial crisis.Under the terms of the mortgage settlements, banks do not get credit for foreclosing on a mortgage. So some banks have dealt with their thorniest delinquent mortgages by selling them to upstart firms willing to buy loans at a steep discount on the gamble that they will have better luck restructuring them.PennyMac, for instance, has bought nonperforming loans from Citigroup, and Lone Star has bought bundles of soured mortgages from JPMorgan Chase and HSBC.Lone Star has also been a major buyer of delinquent mortgages sold by Department of Housing and Urban Development and Fannie Mae, the giant government-controlled mortgage finance firm.The buying of those delinquent loans and the inability to restructure all of them is now showing up in the foreclosure ranking for those firms.In the case of Lone Star, affiliates of the private equity firm foreclosed on 4,980 mortgages last year and 5,378 in 2015, the data shows. By comparison, Lone Star affiliates foreclosed on just 147 mortgages in 2010.PennyMac, which was founded in 2008 with just 72 employees, foreclosed on 1,281 mortgages last year and 1,594 in 2015. The firm foreclosed on 361 home loans in 2010. Today, PennyMac employs more than 3,000 employees and is the nation\u2019s fourth largest originator of new mortgages.Firms buying nonperforming loans have consistently said foreclosure is the last resort. The firms all contend that they make more money by getting delinquent borrowers to start making monthly payments again, as opposed to foreclosing on and selling vacant homes.\u201cOur best solution is keeping families in their homes with foreclosure as the last option, as evidenced by the 6,747 loan modifications we completed last year,\u201d said Stephen Hagey, a representative of PennyMac, a California-based mortgage firm.But with Fannie Mae and its sister company Freddie Mac looking to sell tens of thousands of distressed mortgages in the coming year, the new mortgage firms will continue to catch up to the banks.An article on Friday about new data on foreclosures, compiled by RealtyTrac, misstated the ranking of the firm PennyMac Loan Services in some copies. It is the fourth largest originator of new mortgages, not the 11th largest.Advertisement"}

Mr. Waller, on leave from teaching business at the University of Northern Iowa, was shooting pictures with a friend along the Mississippi River in the early 1990s when he decided to make a detour and photograph covered bridges in Madison County, Iowa. He was an enthusiastic guitarist and singer, and years earlier he had written a song about the dreams of a woman named Francesca. An idea stirred.Francesca and Robert discover that they are kindred spirits, athirst for love, and a torrid affair commences. It lasts just four days \u2014 but four days unlike any other.\u201cGod or the universe or whatever one chooses to label the great systems of balance and order does not recognize Earth-time,\u201d Kincaid tells her in a post-affair letter. \u201cTo the universe four days is no different than four billion light-years.\u201dMany critics found the characters unconvincing, the sentiments sappy and the writing overripe. Kincaid, who called himself \u201cone of the last cowboys,\u201d was fond of delivering statements like \u201cI am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea.\u201dMillions of readers, however, found Mr. Waller\u2019s story of reawakened love deeply moving. The Orlando Sentinel spoke for them when it wrote, \u201cThis lyrically written first novel is as perfect as a tear \u2014 and don\u2019t be surprised if you shed a few upon reading it.\u201dOprah Winfrey, who broadcast a special edition of her television show from Madison County, called it \u201ca gift to the country.\u201d\u201cBridges\u201d leapt to the top of the best-seller lists and stayed there, eventually outselling \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d It took root on The New York Times\u2019s list and remained there for three years, becoming, as Entertainment Weekly put it, \u201cThe Book That Would Not Die.\u201dRobert James Waller Jr. was born on Aug. 1, 1939, in Charles City, Iowa, and grew up in nearby Rockford, about 125 miles northeast of Des Moines. His father was a chicken-and-egg wholesaler and a local magistrate. His mother, the former Ruth Welch, was a homemaker.He won a basketball scholarship to the University of Iowa but transferred in his freshman year to Iowa State Teachers College (renamed the State College of Iowa in 1961). While an undergraduate, he married Georgia Wiedemeier, whom he had met at a dance in Iowa City. The marriage ended in divorce.In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Linda Bow, and a granddaughter.Mr. Waller earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business education in 1962 and a master\u2019s in education in 1964 before pursuing graduate work at Indiana University\u2019s school of business. He was awarded a doctorate of business administration in finance in 1968. His thesis was on the American guitar industry.He returned to his undergraduate alma mater, renamed the University of Northern Iowa in 1967, and taught management and economics there. In 1980 he was appointed dean of its business school.On the side he began writing travel and nature essays for The Des Moines Register\u2019s Sunday edition. These were collected in \u201cJust Beyond the Firelight: Stories and Essays\u201d (1988) and \u201cOne Good Road Is Enough\u201d (1990).Fed up with teaching, Mr. Waller took an unpaid leave of absence in 1990 and obtained a $200,000 grant from the state to study the future of the region. His report, \u201cIowa: Perspectives on Today and Tomorrow,\u201d was published in 1991.With \u201cBridges\u201d still riding high, Mr. Waller recorded an album, \u201cThe Ballads of Madison County,\u201d and in 10 days wrote his second novel, \u201cSlow Waltz in Cedar Bend,\u201d about the love affair between an economics professor and a colleague\u2019s wife. With a first printing of a million copies, it, too, shot to the top of the best-seller lists.Seeking solitude, Mr. Waller moved to a run-down ranch in Alpine, Tex., southeast of El Paso. The high desert country provided the setting for his novels \u201cPuerto Vallarta Squeeze: The Run for el Norte\u201d (1995) and \u201cBorder Music\u201d (1995). Both sold well, but not spectacularly.Mr. Waller decided to revisit the scene of his first novel in \u201cA Thousand Country Roads: An Epilogue to The Bridges of Madison County,\u201d published in 2002. It continued the adventures of an older, lonelier Kincaid, who hits the road again and, at one point, finds his way back to covered-bridge territory.In his next novel, \u201cHigh Plains Tango\u201d (2005), Mr. Waller passed the generational baton to Kincaid\u2019s son, a master carpenter who battles to stop development on the site of an Indian burial ground in South Dakota.Mr. Waller\u2019s last novel, \u201cThe Long Night of Winchell Dear\u201d (2006), was a taut, atmospheric thriller about a retired professional poker player and a fateful night at his ranch in the Texas desert.The romantic flame ignited by \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d was slow to die.\u201cI receive letters each week from people who have read it and are moved by the story,\u201d Mr. Waller told Book Page in 2005. \u201cAt one time, I received 50 to 100 letters per week. Now it\u2019s more on the order of five. The last I knew, 350 marriage ceremonies had been celebrated at Roseman Bridge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Rockefeller, Philanthropist and Head of Chase Manhattan, Dies at 101", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported by15 PhotosDavid Rockefeller, the banker and philanthropist with the fabled family name who controlled Chase Manhattan bank for more than a decade and wielded vast influence around the world for even longer as he spread the gospel of American capitalism, died on Monday morning at his home in Pocantico Hills, N.Y. He was 101.His son David Jr. confirmed the death.Chase Manhattan had long been known as the Rockefeller bank, although the family never owned more than 5 percent of its shares. But Mr. Rockefeller was more than a steward. As chairman and chief executive throughout the 1970s, he made it \u201cDavid\u2019s bank,\u201d as many called it, expanding its operations internationally.His stature was greater than any corporate title might convey, however. His influence was felt in Washington and foreign capitals, in the corridors of New York City government, in art museums, in great universities and in public schools.Mr. Rockefeller could well be the last of a less and less visible family to have cut so imposing a figure on the world stage. As a peripatetic advocate of the economic interests of the United States and of his own bank, he was a force in global financial affairs and in his country\u2019s foreign policy. He was received in foreign capitals with the honors accorded a chief of state.He was the last surviving grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the tycoon who founded the Standard Oil Company in the 19th century and built a fortune that made him America\u2019s first billionaire and his family one of the richest and most powerful in the nation\u2019s history.As an heir to that legacy, David Rockefeller lived all his life in baronial splendor and privilege, whether in Manhattan (when he was a boy, he and his brothers would roller skate along Fifth Avenue trailed by a limousine in case they grew tired) or at his magnificent country estates.Imbued with the understated manners of the East Coast elite, he loomed large in the upper reaches of a New York social world of glittering black-tie galas. His philanthropy was monumental, and so was his art collection, a museumlike repository of some 15,000 pieces, many of them masterpieces, some lining the walls of his offices 56 floors above the streets at Rockefeller Center, to which he repaired, robust and active, well into his 90s.In silent testimony to his power and reach was his Rolodex, a catalog of some 150,000 names of people he had met as a banker-statesman. It required a room of its own beside his office.Spread out below that corporate aerie was a city he loved and influenced mightily. He was instrumental in rallying the private sector to help resolve New York City\u2019s fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s. As chairman of the Museum of Modern Art for many years \u2014 his mother had helped found it in 1929 \u2014 he led an effort to encourage corporations to buy and display art in their office buildings and to subsidize local museums. And as chairman of the New York City Partnership, a coalition of business executives, he fostered innovation in public schools and the development of thousands of apartments for lower-income and middle-class families.He was always aware of the mystique surrounding the Rockefeller name.\u201cI have never found it a hindrance,\u201d he once said with typical reserve. \u201cObviously, there are times when I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m treated differently. There\u2019s no question that having financial resources, which, thanks to my parents, I learned to use with some restraint and discretion, is a big advantage.\u201dWith his powerful name and his zeal for foreign travel \u2014 he was still going to Europe into his late 90s \u2014 Mr. Rockefeller was a formidable marketing force. In the 1970s, his meetings with Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union and Zhou Enlai of China helped Chase Manhattan become the first American bank with operations in those countries.\u201cFew people in this country have met as many leaders as I have,\u201d he said.Some faulted him for spending so much time abroad. He was accused of neglecting his responsibilities at Chase and failing to promote aggressive, visionary managers. Under his leadership, Chase fell far behind its rival Citibank, then the nation\u2019s largest bank, in assets and earnings. There were years when Chase had the most troubled loan portfolio among major American banks.\u201cIn my judgment, he will not go down in history as a great banker,\u201d John J. McCloy, a Rockefeller friend and himself a former Chase chairman, told The Associated Press in 1981. \u201cHe will go down as a real personality, as a distinguished and loyal member of the community.\u201dMr. Rockefeller\u2019s forays into international politics also drew criticism, notably in 1979, when he and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger persuaded President Jimmy Carter to admit the recently deposed shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment. The shah\u2019s arrival in New York enraged revolutionary followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, provoking them to seize the United States Embassy in Iran and hold American diplomats hostage for more than a year. Mr. Rockefeller was also assailed for befriending autocratic foreign leaders in an effort to establish and expand his bank\u2019s presence in their countries.\u201cHe spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club, no matter what they did,\u201d the New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote in 2002, citing the profitable deals Mr. Rockefeller had cut with \u201coil-rich dictators,\u201d \u201cSoviet party bosses\u201d and \u201cChinese perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution.\u201dStill, presidents as ideologically different as Mr. Carter and Richard M. Nixon offered him the post of Treasury secretary. He turned them both down.After the death in 1979 of his older brother Nelson A. Rockefeller, the former vice president and four-term governor of New York, David Rockefeller stood almost alone as a member of the family with an outsize national profile. Only Jay Rockefeller, a great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller, had earned prominence, as a governor and United States senator from West Virginia. No one from the family\u2019s younger generations has attained or perhaps aspired to David Rockefeller\u2019s stature.\u201cNo one can step into his shoes,\u201d Warren T. Lindquist, a longtime friend, told The Times in 1995, \u201cnot because they aren\u2019t good, smart, talented people, but because it\u2019s just a different world.\u201dThe youngest of six siblings, David Rockefeller was born in Manhattan on June 12, 1915. His father, John D. Rockefeller Jr., the only son of the oil titan, devoted his life to philanthropy. His mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, was the daughter of Nelson Aldrich, a wealthy senator from Rhode Island.Besides Nelson, born in 1908, the other children were Abby, who was born in 1903 and died in 1976 after leading a private life; John D. Rockefeller III, who was born in 1906 and immersed himself in philanthropy until his death in an automobile accident in 1978; Laurance, born in 1910, who was an environmentalist and died in 2004; and Winthrop, born in 1912, who was governor of Arkansas and died in 1973.David grew up in a mansion at 10 West 54th Street, the largest private residence in the city at the time. It bustled with valets, parlor maids, nurses and chambermaids. For dinner every night, his father dressed in black tie and his mother in a formal gown.Summers were spent at the 107-room Rockefeller \u201ccottage\u201d in Seal Harbor, Me., and weekends at Kykuit, the family\u2019s country compound north of New York City in Tarrytown, N.Y. The estate was likened to a feudal fief. As Mr. Rockefeller wrote in his autobiography, \u201cMemoirs\u201d (2002), \u201cEventually the family accumulated about 3,400 acres that surrounded and included almost all of the little village of Pocantico Hills, where most of the residents worked for the family and lived in houses owned by Grandfather.\u201dIn that bucolic setting, he developed a fascination for insects that would lead to his building one of the largest beetle collections in the world.David was 21 when John D. Rockefeller died. \u201cHe told amusing stories and sang little ditties,\u201d Mr. Rockefeller recalled in 2002. \u201cHe gave us dimes.\u201dMr. Rockefeller\u2019s sense of noblesse oblige was heightened by his early education at the experimental Lincoln School in Manhattan, founded by the American philosopher John Dewey and financed by the Rockefeller Foundation to bring together children from varied social backgrounds. He went on to study at Harvard, receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1936, and then spent a year at the London School of Economics, a hotbed of socialist intellectuals. Mr. Rockefeller was awarded a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1940.Moved by the Great Depression at home and abroad, he stated in his doctoral thesis that he was \u201cinclined to agree with the New Deal that deficit financing during depressions, other things being equal, is a help to recovery.\u201d The notion that a Rockefeller would take such a liberal economic view was major news; the family, rock-ribbed Republican, was known for its fierce opposition to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the New Deal\u2019s author.After receiving his doctorate, Mr. Rockefeller became a secretary to Fiorello H. La Guardia, New York\u2019s pugnacious, liberal Republican mayor. In 1940, he married Margaret McGrath, known as Peggy, whom he had met at a dance seven years earlier, when he was a Harvard freshman and she was a student at the Chapin School in New York. His wife, a dedicated conservationist, died at 80 in 1996.Mr. Rockefeller enlisted in the Army in 1942, attended officer training school and served in North Africa and France during World War II. He was discharged a captain in 1945.He began his banking career in 1946 as an assistant manager with the Chase National Bank, which merged in 1955 with the Bank of Manhattan Company to become Chase Manhattan.Banking in the early postwar era was a gentleman\u2019s profession. Top executives could attend to outside interests, using social contacts to cultivate clients while leaving day-to-day management to junior officers.Mr. Rockefeller found plenty of time for such activities. In the late 1940s, he replaced his mother on the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s board and eventually became its chairman. He courted art collectors. In 1968, he put together a syndicate, including his brother Nelson and the CBS chairman, William S. Paley, to buy Gertrude Stein\u2019s collection of modern art. David and Peggy Rockefeller\u2019s own prized paintings \u2014 by C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasso \u2014 were lent to the museum permanently.Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s rise in banking was swift. By 1961, he was president of Chase Manhattan and its co-chief executive with George Champion, the chairman. Promoting expansion overseas, Mr. Rockefeller clashed with Mr. Champion, who thought that the bank\u2019s domestic business was more important. After Mr. Rockefeller replaced Mr. Champion as chairman and sole chief executive in 1969, he was able to enlarge the bank\u2019s presence on almost every continent. He said his brand of personal diplomacy, meeting with heads of state, was crucial in furthering Chase\u2019s interests.\u201cThere were many who claimed these activities were inappropriate and interfered with my bank responsibilities,\u201d Mr. Rockefeller wrote in his autobiography. \u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree more.\u201d His \u201cso-called outside activities,\u201d he insisted, \u201cwere of considerable benefit to the bank both financially and in terms of its prestige around the world.\u201dBy 1976, Chase Manhattan\u2019s international arm was contributing 80 percent of the bank\u2019s $105 million in operating profit. But instead of vindicating Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s avidity for banking abroad, those figures underlined Chase\u2019s lagging performance at home. From 1974 to 1976, its earnings fell 36 percent while those of its biggest rivals \u2014 Bank of America, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover and J.P. Morgan \u2014 rose 12 to 31 percent.The 1974 recession hammered Chase, which had an unusually large portfolio of loans in the depressed real estate industry. It also owned more New York-related securities than any other bank in the mid-1970s, when the city was edging toward bankruptcy. And among major banks, Chase had the largest portfolio of nonperforming loans.Chase also got caught up in a scandal in 1974. An internal audit discovered that its bond trading account was overvalued by $34 million and that losses had been understated. A resulting $15 million drain in net income tarnished the bank\u2019s image. In 1975, the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency branded Chase a \u201cproblem\u201d bank.Even as he struggled to reverse Chase Manhattan\u2019s decline, Mr. Rockefeller found time to address New York City\u2019s financial problems. His involvement in municipal affairs dated to the early 1960s, when, as founder and chairman of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, he recommended that a World Trade Center be built.In 1961, largely at his instigation, Chase opened its 64-story headquarters in the Wall Street area, a huge investment that helped revitalize the financial district and encouraged the World Trade Center project to proceed.In the mid-1970s, with New York City facing a default on its debts because of sluggish economic growth and uncontrolled municipal spending, Mr. Rockefeller helped bring together federal, state and city officials with New York business leaders to work out an economic plan that eventually pulled the city out of its crisis.From 1976 to 1980, the bank\u2019s earnings more than doubled, and it outperformed its archrival, Citibank, in returns on assets, a critical indicator of a bank\u2019s profitability. Even after retiring from active management in 1981, Mr. Rockefeller continued to serve Chase as chairman of its international advisory council and to act as the bank\u2019s foreign diplomat. He did not hesitate to criticize United States officials for policies he considered mistaken.He was notably harsh about President Carter. In 1980, he told The Washington Post that Mr. Carter had not done \u201cwhat most other countries do themselves, and expect us to do \u2014 namely, to make U.S. national interests our prime international objective.\u201dBut Mr. Rockefeller also played the gadfly to Mr. Carter\u2019s far more conservative successor, President Ronald Reagan. While the Reagan administration was supporting anti-Marxist guerrillas in Africa, Mr. Rockefeller took a 10-nation tour of the continent in 1982 and declared that African Marxism was not a threat to the United States or to American business interests.Late in life, Mr. Rockefeller was involved in controversies over Rockefeller Center, the Art Deco office building complex his father built in the 1930s. In 1985, the Rockefeller family mortgaged the property for $1.3 billion, pocketing an estimated $300 million. In 1989, the family sold 51 percent of the Rockefeller Group, which owned Rockefeller Center and other buildings, to the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan. Mitsubishi later increased its share to 80 percent.The purchase represented the high tide of a buying spree of American properties by Japanese corporations, and it opened the family to criticism that it had surrendered an important national symbol to them. When Japan\u2019s economic bubble burst in the early 1990s and Mitsubishi was forced to declare Rockefeller Center in bankruptcy in 1995, Mr. Rockefeller was criticized again, this time for allowing the site to slip into financial ruin.Before the year ended, Mr. Rockefeller put together a syndicate that bought control of Rockefeller Center. Then, in 2000, it was sold in a $1.85 billion deal that severed the center\u2019s last ties with the Rockefeller family.Even in his 90s, David Rockefeller continued to work at a pace that would tire a much younger person. He spent more than half the year traveling on behalf of Chase or groups like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. In 2005, when he was interviewed in his offices at Rockefeller Center, he remained physically active, working with a trainer at the center\u2019s sports club.He continued to collect art, including hundreds of paintings as well as furniture and works in colored glass, porcelain and petrified wood.That same year, he pledged a $100 million bequest to the Museum of Modern Art. Such giving became grist for the society pages. One celebrity-filled fund-raising gala at the museum in 2005 drew 850 people paying as much as $90,000 for a table. The occasion was Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s 90th birthday, and at the end of the evening, he was presented with a birthday cake modeled after his house in Maine. Then it was off to a week in southern France to continue the celebration with 21 members of his family.With the book \u201cMemoirs\u201d in 2002, he became, at age 87, the first in three generations of Rockefellers to publish an autobiography. Asked why he wrote it, he replied in his characteristic reserved tone, \u201cWell, it just occurred to me that I had led a rather interesting life.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this obituary misstated the year a photograph of David Rockefeller was taken. It was 2002, not 2005.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valuation Shell Game: Silicon Valley\u2019s Dirty Secret", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneYou want to know the dirty, little secret of Silicon Valley? It\u2019s called the 409A valuation.Yes it\u2019s obscure, and yes, it\u2019s a little bit technical. Here\u2019s how the process works: In order to attract and to retain high-powered employees, high-flying tech companies want to issue them common stock or options. To do so and to comply with Internal Revenue Service rules, they need to obtain an independent, third-party valuation of the company.This type of valuation allows hot, privately owned technology companies \u2014 like Uber, Airbnb or Nextdoor \u2014 to issue common stock or stock options to employees at a low price and, at the same time, or nearly the same time, sell preferred stock to outside investors at a price that is often three or four times higher. It\u2019s also a way for company founders to control the market for the stock of their private companies while rewarding themselves and key employees with cheap shares that seem instantly worth a lot more than the price at which they were issued.Failure to comply with section 409A of the tax code would make employees receiving the stock grants personally liable for immediate taxation on the excess value embedded in the stock or options, plus a 20 percent penalty tax.But of course the valuations are costly and wrapped in complexity. The many firms that do the 409A valuations are able to charge around $50,000 a pop for them depending on the work needed to be done to value a company, and they often prompt discussions between the appraisers and the company\u2019s auditors, raking in still more fees for all involved. Because companies are often issuing stock \u2014 say, when new employees are hired \u2014 the 409A valuations get done several times a year.The result is reports with curiously precise numbers that often have a dubious practical value.\u201cSo you have two companies, paid by the hour, arguing over false precision,\u201d Bill Gurley, the general partner at Benchmark, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm, texted me recently. Mr. Gurley, whose firm has invested in Nextdoor, disdains the 409A valuations as a wasteful exercise. He calls the valuations \u201cquite precise \u2014 remarkably inaccurate.\u201dThere are all sorts of supposed valuation experts \u2014 such as eShares (\u201cthe world\u2019s largest provider of independent, audit-defensible 409A valuations\u201d), or Silicon Valley Bank (\u201chigh-quality, audit-defensible valuation reports to support you through a liquidity event\u201d) or Duff & Phelps, which claims \u201cdeep expertise\u201d in 409A valuations \u2014 and are all eager and willing to provide the work that is legally necessary to justify the granting of stock or options to employees at a price well below the price at which the companies are selling stock to outside investors.(One way the lower valuations are justified for employee stock grants is because they are of common stock, not the preferred stock that often gets sold to outside investors. There are other reasons to justify the higher price, too, such as board seats and access to financial information.)But valuing these private companies is often a difficult and imprecise exercise, even though the experts can come up with a number that feels real. \u201cThe thought that ANYONE can be precise about the value of a private company to the second decimal place is preposterous,\u201d Mr. Gurley continued. \u201cNo one that is properly trained in finance should have ANY confidence in such an exercise. As such it\u2019s become a bureaucratic waste of time.\u201dThe valuations also give the founders of technology companies extraordinary control over the market for the private sale of company stock.Whether employees realize it or not, the stock the company grants to them often explicitly prevents its sale to anyone, or in any private secondary market, without the express written consent of the founder, the chief executive or the board of directors. Obviously this becomes a problem when an employee wants to sell his or her private stock. And who wouldn\u2019t, if for instance, the stock is issued to employees at a $500 million valuation, and then sold to outside investors at a $1.5 billion valuation.This is often the point where the founder steps in and says, sorry, no sale, or at least not at the higher valuation. Selling implies the person is no longer a true believer in the company or in its mission. This dynamic falls especially hard on early investors who are not company employees, those so-called \u201cseries A\u201d or \u201cseries B\u201d venture-capital investors who would like to sell at the higher valuation but can do so only with the founder\u2019s or chief executive\u2019s permission and only at the sanctioned valuation. Employees looking to diversify their wealth also often feel frustrated.Whether the Securities and Exchange Commission has examined these odd discrepancies in valuations of private tech companies is not known. A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.Regardless, the payoff, of course, is an initial public offering of the stock. Once that happens, as with Snap Inc. last week, 409A valuations are no longer needed. With the company shares trading, the market sets the valuation at nearly every second of every day. Independent valuation experts with their false precision are no longer needed. Before that big event, though, 409A valuations allow a lot of stock to be issued to insiders at prices that don\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Certainty of G.O.P. Health Plan: Tax Cuts for the Wealthy", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House Republicans\u2019 plan to replace the Affordable Care Act is messy and confusing. No one is sure exactly how Americans will be affected and how much more health insurance will cost them.But there are two certainties. Their health care plan provides a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. And it will make it easier for Republicans to pass more tax cuts this year. It could also be viewed by some people as a break from some of the populist campaign promises President Trump made to lift up the country\u2019s \u201cforgotten men and women.\u201dThe repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s taxes is necessary for Republicans to move forward with an even more ambitious part of their agenda: tax reform. \u201cDoing this first shrinks the amount of revenue they are going to have to raise to make their tax bill add up,\u201d said Howard Gleckman, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center.The Republican\u2019s proposed health care legislation has met the inevitable backlash by Democrats. \u201cThis scheme will give billions upon billions of dollars in tax cuts to the most fortunate at the expense of the most vulnerable,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who is the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cIt clearly and directly breaks the \u2018Mnuchin rule\u2019 promise that there would be no absolute tax cut for the wealthy, period.\u201dSteven T. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, gave assurances as recently as last month that \u201cthere would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.\u201d During Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing, Democrats referred to the promise as the \u201cMnuchin rule.\u201dWhether the legislation, if passed, hurts Republicans in next year\u2019s midterm elections remains to be seen. Democrats are already preparing to argue that Republicans are out of touch with working Americans, while Republicans insist that they are following through on their promises.Republicans may have the harder time of it. A study by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group, found that when the bill would take full effect in 2022, 40 percent of the benefits from the tax cuts would go to the richest one percent of the country. Those households would receive an average tax cut of $37,000, or 2.1 percent of their incomes. People in the lowest income bracket would get an average tax cut of $150, an amount that is just 0.9 percent of their earnings.Companies and investors would see big benefits too. The Republicans\u2019 plan removes $145 billion in taxes on health insurers, $158 billion on investment income for top earners, $25 billion on drug companies and $20 billion medical device companies.While businesses in the health care sector have so far been skeptical of the health plan, the bill also comes with some sweeteners. One that has drawn particular outrage among defenders of the Affordable Care Act is a provision that would give health insurers greater incentives to give their executives raises by eliminating the health plan\u2019s cap on compensation deductions.Some of the gains for the most well off will come at the expense of the vulnerable. Health insurers will be allowed to once again increase premiums on older customers who are more likely to require medical services. Over the next 10 years, $880 billion in federal funding for Medicaid would be cut.Democrats have seized on the tax cuts as evidence that Mr. Trump, who is aggressively pitching the health plan, is selling out his base and breaking campaign promises that he made to working class Americans. At one point during the campaign Mr. Trump said that the rich should pay more in taxes and that he would gladly do so.\u201cThis is the type of class warfare that Democrats like to stir up,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for Mitt Romney, who made the case that tax reform would be the centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s legacy on taxes.For its part, the White House so far appears undeterred by accusations that it is lavishing tax breaks on the rich.He added, \u201cWho cares if somebody else benefits?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Park Honoring Franklin Roosevelt Excludes Disabled People, Suit Says", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byA New York park honoring President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair for years, is not fully accessible to disabled people, according to a class-action suit filed against the state and the conservancy that runs the park.The strongly worded complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan, accuses the Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island of the \u201csystemic, discriminatory exclusion\u201d of people who use wheelchairs, scooters and other motorized devices from full access of the park. The complaint says that this is not only in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which prohibits discriminating against people with disabilities in public facilities, but also violates state and local statutes.\u201cSuch blatant violation of disability law is tragically ironic in light of the fact that President Roosevelt himself used a wheelchair for mobility after becoming paralyzed from polio,\u201d the lawsuit states.An elevated lawn lined with trees that forms a significant portion of the park\u2019s space is accessible to wheelchairs from the far end of the park\u2019s entrance, on paths of uneven paving stones, gravel and grass, the lawsuit charges.\u201cThe combined effect of the increased distance, uneven surfaces, and vertical incline makes the monument substantially inaccessible to those with mobility disabilities.\u201dNor is the gift shop fully accessible, nor the bathroom A.D.A. compliant, the suit says. And most strikingly, the terrace at the end of \u201cthe room\u201d \u2014 an open granite enclosure at the southernmost tip of the park \u2014 that looks out over the East River is only accessible by stairs, and therefore \u201centirely inaccessible\u201d to many disabled visitors.The three individual plaintiffs named in the lawsuit \u2014 Phil Beder, Milagros Franco and Edith Prentiss \u2014 all use wheelchairs.Ms. Prentiss felt like a \u201csecond-class citizen\u201d after visiting that section of the park, the lawsuit notes; Ms. Franco left disappointed and angry; and Mr. Beder was deeply offended by the feature.\u201cI\u2019m not a radical wheelchair-accessibility person \u2014 if a restaurant isn\u2019t accessible I\u2019ll find another one,\u201d Mr. Beder, a retired teacher in Brooklyn, said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut when it comes to something like a memorial to a wheelchair-using president, it\u2019s just insane that it wouldn\u2019t be 100 percent accessible.\u201dSally Minard, the president and chief executive of the conservancy, said at the time that the consequences of adding ramps to the terrace \u201cseemed to outweigh the value.\u201d\u201cThe decision was not seen as a problem because we believed then, as we do now, that the park more than meets the requirements for accessibility for those with a disability, and that the memorial as a whole is A.D.A. compliant,\u201d she said.The lawsuit against Four Freedoms Park said that the park sets a troubling precedent.\u201cIf it remains inaccessible, the precedent will be set whereby future architects will be free to design other public monuments and historic sites with zero regard for A.D.A. compliance,\u201d the lawsuit said.Michelle A. Caiola, the litigation director at Disability Rights Advocates, the nonprofit legal group that is representing the plaintiffs, said the group is looking for changes to the park, not financial compensation.The Four Freedoms Park Conservancy said that it had not had time to review the lawsuit.\u201cThe park has had thousands of visitors in wheelchairs, walkers, scooters, or other assistive devices who have enjoyed visiting the park and have found it accessible,\u201d a spokeswoman said over email.The state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation did not return multiple requests for comment.It\u2019s not the first time a monument to President Roosevelt, who served between 1933 and 1945, has caused a heated discussion about disability.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Democrats Should Work With Trump", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has discovered that trying to work with Republicans, like trying to work on health care policy, is complicated. So with all his big campaign pledges in limbo following last week\u2019s Obamacare fiasco, he reportedly is contemplating overtures to a party that actually wants to govern: the Democrats.This new tack comes, mind you, after Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for refusing to help him and House Speaker Paul Ryan eviscerate Obamacare. With zero support from Democrats, the pair had no margin for error as Republicans started to defect and were forced to pull their bill.Perhaps it\u2019s beginning to dawn on the president that today\u2019s Republican Party is designed for maximal obstruction and minimal constructive policy making. The rigidly doctrinaire Freedom Caucus essentially has veto power over White House initiatives, while moderates will jump ship if Mr. Trump concedes too much to right-wing purists.What\u2019s more, Republicans are all over the map on the next big items on Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 tax reform and infrastructure. So even though Republicans control Congress and the White House, Washington\u2019s new political math suggests that Mr. Trump may have no choice but to reach out to Democrats.If he could peel off several dozen moderate Democrats in the House and a handful in the Senate, he could neutralize the far right\u2019s naysaying and give moderate Republicans a chance to vote for measures with broad, bipartisan support.If Mr. Trump does turn to Democrats, how should they respond?\u201cHell, no\u201d will most likely be the first response. Under pressure from their base, congressional leaders are dug in for years of unremitting resistance. They\u2019ve even issued orders to Democrats on tax-writing committees not to produce a reform blueprint of their own, lest they be tempted to talk turkey with the White House.All this is understandable, given the ugly and dishonest campaign Mr. Trump waged and what most Democrats still regard as his obvious unfitness for the office he now holds. Yet hold it he does \u2014 and if he\u2019s willing to make real concessions to their party\u2019s core values and priorities, pragmatic Democrats should hear him out.Unlike depriving millions of Americans of health insurance, revamping America\u2019s outdated tax code and modernizing our run-down infrastructure are progressive causes Democrats should be for. And unlike Republicans, whose ideological rigidity and strident partisanship often border on nihilism, Democrats still hew to the quaint notion that the people elected them to solve problems, not prevent them from being solved. McConnellism is not in the party\u2019s DNA.But if moderate Democrats are disposed to cooperate with the deal-maker in chief, they ought to exact a high price. On tax reform, for example, they should insist that Mr. Trump deliver tax relief to the middle class, not the wealthy, and that he jettison Mr. Ryan\u2019s proposed border-adjustment tax, which would hit consumers and business with big price hikes. The administration needs to find better ways to pay for a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate. Democrats don\u2019t have to love big business to recognize that our antiquated tax system forces companies to pay much higher taxes than their overseas competitors. That makes American workers less competitive and gives our companies incentives to move investment abroad \u2014 and keep profits there \u2014 to avoid the higher rate.Some die-hard Republican supply-siders would gladly abandon Mr. Ryan and simply add the cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s enormous tax cut to the federal deficit. Democrats ought to hold their feet to the fiscal fire. One way is to close loopholes that cost hundreds of billions in lost revenue and, most economists believe, distort investment decisions. Another is to cap the value of tax deductions (as President Obama proposed) so that high-income people would receive no more tax relief than anyone else. More ambitiously, Democrats could go where Mr. Ryan apparently feared to go by proposing a consumption tax that has actually been tried and proved effective around the world \u2014 the value-added tax, with adjustments to ensure progressivity.Finally, pro-growth Democrats should be prepared to work with the White House to pass a major boost in spending on roads, air and seaports, railways, water systems, a \u201csmart\u201d electrical grid and other public goods that can support more robust economic innovation and investment. In return, they should demand that it\u2019s actually funded, and that a significant share target people and communities left behind by changing technology and globalization.Would Mr. Trump accept Democrats\u2019 help on these terms? If he really wants to start racking up \u201cwins\u201d for his voters, he would. He\u2019d have to share credit \u2014 a novel experience \u2014 with Democrats, who\u2019d get points from swing voters for being pragmatic and competent. And they wouldn\u2019t be constrained from fiercely opposing Mr. Trump on just about everything else.If Democrats have a chance to help average working families and show they\u2019re not obstructionists, they should take it. America doesn\u2019t need two parties of no.Will Marshall is the president and founder of the Progressive Policy Institute.Advertisement"}

But he presented it less as a cornerstone of his legislative agenda than as a necessary prerequisite to finance deep tax cuts.\u201cWe have to get this done to do the other,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.For Mr. Trump, who is enduring one of the most difficult stretches of his young presidency, the rally was a chance to bathe in the adulation of a campaign crowd, a sea of people waving placards that said: \u201cBuy American. Hire American\u201d and \u201cPromises Made. Promises Kept.\u201d\u201cThis place is packed,\u201d he exulted. \u201cWe\u2019re in the heartland of America, and there is no place I would rather be.\u201dIn the packed stands of Freedom Hall in Louisville, the swirl of questions back in Washington \u2014 about the Trump campaign\u2019s ties with Russia or the president\u2019s debunked assertions that he had been wiretapped by his predecessor \u2014 seemed a million miles away.That was exactly the point. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have used these campaign-style events to buoy their boss and provide a respite from the pileup of pressures in Washington. Mr. Trump recycled many of his favorite lines from the aftermath of his election victory in November.\u201cThere is no path to 270,\u201d he said gleefully, recalling the skepticism that he would win an Electoral College majority. He talked about a representative of the \u201cfake media\u201d who asked him recently what it would take to unite the Republican Party. \u201cI said: \u2018Wait a minute. We won the House. We won the Senate. We won the White House.\u2019\u201dOn the legislative business at hand, repealing the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the Republican bill would have to be changed to make it through Congress. But he offered no details and appeared unconcerned about the ultimate outcome.\u201cWe\u2019re going to negotiate; it\u2019s going to go back and forth,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s going to be great.\u201dMr. Trump pointed to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who as the Republican leader will have to shepherd health care legislation through the Senate. \u201cHey, Mitch, we going be O.K.?\u201d he said. \u201cThat health care looking good?\u201d Mr. McConnell introduced Mr. Trump as the leader who would help the United States recover from the wreckage of the Affordable Care Act.The president saved most of his fire for trade. He said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and other \u201cterrible\u201d trade deals to bring jobs and factories back to the United States. The nation, he claimed, has lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\u201cWe sacrificed our own middle class to finance the growth of foreign countries,\u201d Mr. Trump declared. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, those days are over.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t be played for fools, and we won\u2019t be played for suckers anymore,\u201d the president said.Mr. Trump noted that he had cleared the way for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and would demand that they be built with American steel. He said that under its new administrator, Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency would go from a \u201cjob killer into a job creator.\u201dClay, the president said, had pioneered an economic philosophy known as the American System, which he said prefigured his approach: steep tariffs to protect American exports and generous government spending on roads, canals and other public works projects.\u201cLike Henry Clay, we want to put our own people to work,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe believe in two simple rules: Buy American, and hire American.\u201d\u201cAfter spending trillions and trillions of dollars overseas,\u201d he added, \u201cwe are going to start taking care of our country.\u201dMr. Trump left the capital at the end of a tumultuous day that showcased the perils and promise of his presidency.Mr. Trump made no reference to Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony and only a brief reference to Mr. Gorsuch. He urged the Senate to swiftly confirm \u201can outstanding man from an outstanding family.\u201dThis was the third speech of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency that had an explicitly political theme, drawing on his campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d It had been conceived as a rally with supporters in a state where one of the Republican senators, Rand Paul, had expressed opposition to the Republican health care legislation, which Mr. Trump is backing.The visit to a major coal-producing state also resonated in the context of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to lift emissions restrictions on coal-fired power plants, something he is expected to do with an executive order on climate issues that the administration has yet to release. Mr. Trump said he had already eliminated some regulations on the coal industry, and he promised that the executive order would do more.\u201cWe are going to put our coal miners back to work,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have not been treated well.

And many of the people whose jobs have already been automated can\u2019t find new ones. Technology leads to economic growth, but the benefits aren\u2019t being parceled out equally.

In a perilous political climate, however, some advertising agencies have decided to use their marketing acumen in service of advancing cultural and political causes, rather than selling products.It is not unusual for agencies to work with nonprofit groups or create public service announcements, pro bono, but this new activism entails a deeper level of involvement.The campaign included a 60-second video directed by Mr. Linklater \u2014 the tagline: \u201cI pee with L.G.B.T.\u201d \u2014 and 15-second versions, which are being disseminated through targeted Facebook advertising.\u201cOur goal with this, ultimately, is to get people to reach out to their legislators,\u201d said Duff Stewart, the chief executive of the agency, GSD&M, which is spearheading the campaign. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s an important issue for Texas.\u201dPointing to North Carolina as an example, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s also an economic-impact issue. It\u2019s going to have a detrimental effect to the economy in the state of Texas, and the ability to recruit and maintain talent.\u201dFor the agency, though, the impetus to get involved goes beyond that. \u201cFrom a cultural perspective, being open and kind and accepting of our fellow human beings is, I think, what we\u2019re about,\u201d Mr. Stewart said.Other advertising professionals who have taken on more issue- or cause-related projects also see the work as a kind of affirmation of their principles and beliefs in the Trump era.\u201cYou sort of have this feeling of being helpless when something goes off the tracks in the country, so it\u2019s nice to be able to do something,\u201d said Neil Kraft, president and creative director of KraftWorks, which last year developed a platform to support female entrepreneurs in collaboration with Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Day.KraftWorks created the concept for choosewomen.org, which helps impoverished women finance business ventures, and recruited corporate partners, like Sephora and Lilly Pulitzer, willing to donate a portion of sales made through the site. \u201cIt was a deeper involvement, and it was more personal,\u201d Mr. Kraft said.\u201cWe\u2019re storytellers, so if we\u2019re going to create a movement, we\u2019re going to do it through stories,\u201d Ms. Flanik said.These kinds of forays into social issues do carry some risk.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many people would make their decision about an ad firm based on this one way or another, but some people who are more involved in politics might be upset,\u201d said William Benoit, professor of communication studies at Ohio University. In today\u2019s social-media-driven culture, anything that carries even a whiff of political opinion carries the potential for opposition, he said, pointing to the ire that Nordstrom department stores faced over curtailing sales of Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories.The flip side, though, could be an increase in business from clients whose viewpoint aligns with that of the agency.\u201cI think there are some risks in the sense of potentially alienating a client or a potential client if the agency has decided to put a stake in the ground,\u201d said Jeremy Rosenberg, a managing director at the public relations firm Allison & Partners. He added that an ancillary risk could be alienating employees opposed to a particular cause. \u201cI think agency principals would have a good pulse on their employee base, but I think that is a potential concern as well.\u201dAgencies that have allocated resources to social projects say, however, that their employees are eager to participate.Mr. Kraft said his millennial employees were especially enthusiastic. \u201cThey\u2019re in a lot of ways more idealistic than I am and really like this and working on stuff like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it helps everyone feel good about selling other stuff all the time.\u201dUltimately, though, advertising executives say, the motivation is more about feeling compelled to use their industry\u2019s skills to draw attention to issues that matter in a divided culture.\u201cIf we don\u2019t speak up, somebody else will,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cThis last election is evidence that we cannot be complacent.

It is clear that fewer teenagers have been using indoor tanning facilities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of indoor tanning among high school students decreased to 7.3 percent in 2015, from 15.6 percent in 2009, a year before the A.C.A. and its taxes took effect.The American Suntanning Association, an industry group, says the number of tanning salons around the country has shrunk by about half, dropping to about 9,500, from about 18,500 in 2010. And while it is hard to confirm the accuracy of those numbers, Chris Sternberg, a spokesman for the group, said most of the closings stemmed from the tanning tax and various state and federal efforts to regulate indoor tanning.\u201cIt certainly takes away the negative perception that the government has over the last number of years tried to cast upon the industry,\u201d Mr. Sternberg said of the planned repeal of the tax, which the Joint Tax Commission estimates will cost the federal government $600 million over 10 years. \u201cWe think lifting the tan tax is an important step to letting folks know it\u2019s O.K. to tan.\u201dMany dermatologists and researchers strongly disagree. A review of the scientific research published in 2014 estimated that tanning beds accounted for as many as 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the United States each year, including 6,000 cases of melanoma, the deadliest form. And a 2012 study found a 15 percent increase in the risk of certain skin cancers with every four sessions in a tanning bed before age 35.But unlike with taxes on tobacco, the deterrent effect of taxes on tanning salons \u2014 which are typically passed onto customers \u2014 have not been carefully studied.\u201cCertainly we know from tobacco research, there\u2019s very clear evidence that increasing taxation results in declines in adolescent smoking,\u201d Ms. Lazovich said. \u201cAdolescents are very susceptible to the price increases, so one could imagine that it could also work here. But we don\u2019t know the price point at which it will be a deterrent.\u201dOne small study out of Illinois found that while 26 percent of tanning salons surveyed there reported fewer clients after the A.C.A. tax went into effect, \u201cdistinguishing the impact of the tax from the current economic climate as the source of decline was difficult.\u201d Not only that, but 78 percent of salons reported that clients did not seem to care about the tax.Still, Ms. Lazovich said that if the tanning industry\u2019s numbers are accurate and there are fewer salons since the A.C.A. passed, that in and of itself could curb usage. \u201cThe less access, the fewer people who will be exposing themselves to tanning beds,\u201d she said.Dan Humiston, who opened his first tanning salon in Buffalo in 1985 and grew it into a chain of several dozen, gave up on the business in 2015. He said the tanning tax made an already difficult climate worse.\u201cIt let into people\u2019s minds that this is really not good for you,\u201d said Mr. Humiston, a former president of the Indoor Tanning Association, another industry group. \u201cIt also emboldened all the regulatory agencies; they just felt like they had to come down on us harder on everything.\u201dBut the atmosphere seems to be changing, said John Overstreet, executive director of the Indoor Tanning Association. Among other things, the industry is increasingly confident that a 2015 proposal by the Food and Drug Administration to ban tanning among minors will be quashed by the Trump administration.\u201cFor this industry,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s certainly a time of hope.\u201dAdvertisement"}

L.G.B.T. people are part of the fabric of our nation. We have families, we go to work, we simply wish to be treated equally.\u201dBut he added, \u201cA company deciding to spend money and time to pursue a hard-line activist agenda that has nothing to do with their core business is a different issue, and is a waste of investor dollars.\u201dIssues investing \u2014 some call it \u201csocially responsible investing,\u201d which includes the \u201cE.S.G.\u201d (environmental, social and governance) style of investing \u2014 has been a hot business in recent years. Major investors like the pension fund behemoth known as Calpers have made it a part of their philosophy, even though the strategy has costs in lost investment opportunity. Last year, for example, Calpers re-endorsed its ban on tobacco stocks, though staff recommended the opposite.The concept has made its way to exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which have been popular with mom-and-pop investors because they are a low-cost, tax-efficient way to invest in a broad index \u2014 more often than not, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. As a category, exchange traded funds have ballooned in recent years, amassing $2.6 trillion. And the opportunity to create niche products seems to be boundless.\u201cThe minority are a success, and the majority are flops,\u201d said Ben Johnson, the director of E.T.F. research at Morningstar. \u201cIt\u2019s spaghetti slinging.\u201dThe new funds would hardly be the first religion-oriented investment products. An earlier group of funds tracking Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and, more generally, Christian, values came out in 2009 but folded in 2011 with just $2 million, Morningstar said.There are also the $790 million iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF and the $500 million iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF, which look for stocks of companies with good labor policies or sustainable and renewable products. There are also longstanding mutual funds, such as the $927 million Domini Impact Equity fund.The benefits off exchange traded fund investing \u2014 getting cheap exposure to a broad universe of stocks \u2014 can be diminished by eliminating companies based on subjective criteria. And academic studies have concluded that sin stocks perform better as a group than stocks of virtuous companies, at least before factoring in the extra risks to investing in companies that are frequent targets of litigation and boycotts.Greg Richey, who lectures on finance at California State University San Bernardino, developed a portfolio of 65 sin stocks and tracked them from 1996 to 2016, finding an average annual return of 11 percent.Once taking variables like litigation and boycott risk into account, the gains disappear, he said. Also, \u201cthe definition of vice keeps changing.\u201dPensions and other institutions are asking fund companies for ways to invest that avoid these risks, said Jay Jacobs, the director of research for Global X Funds, which has $4.5 billion under management.Last year, Global X introduced a fund that adheres to the values of the Roman Catholic Church, and it has taken in $87 million in assets, according to Morningstar. The idea came from conversations with clients that invest on behalf of Catholic groups and foundations, which follow the guidelines set out by the church, he said.This week, Inspire Investing, based in Hollister, Calif., introduced the two biblically responsible funds, a small- and medium-size company fund and a large-company fund called Inspire Global Hope Large Cap ETF.The large-company fund tracks an Inspire-created index of 400 companies it screened to match its investment criteria, which follow conservative Christian values, Mr. Netzly said.Shares of Berkshire Hathaway, whose chief executive, Warren E. Buffett, has been a major donor to Planned Parenthood, would not make the cut, he said. Nor would Apple, Mr. Netzly said, claiming that pornography can be purchased through iTunes. (An Apple spokesman said pornography is not permitted.)Companies like Amazon that have publicly supported gay marriage also would not pass muster. \u201cAny company that takes a hard-line approach\u201d to the issue would not pass the test, Mr. Netzly said.On the other hand, shares of Tesla Motors and Under Armour would.Advertisement"}

The following is a transcript, as prepared by the Federal News Service. (APPLAUSE)... and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation\u2019s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.Recent threats ...(APPLAUSE)Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\u2019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.(APPLAUSE)Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter ...(APPLAUSE)... of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.(APPLAUSE)All the nations of the world \u2014 friend or foe \u2014 will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.For too long, we\u2019ve watched our middle class shrink as we\u2019ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We\u2019ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.(APPLAUSE)Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.(APPLAUSE)Thank you. It\u2019s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I\u2019ve made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.(APPLAUSE)The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. We\u2019ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic \u2014 and it is a fantastic \u2014 new F-35 jet fighter, and we\u2019ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials \u2014 and a lifetime ban ...(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency ...(APPLAUSE)... and we\u2019re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines ...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.(APPLAUSE)And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.(APPLAUSE)At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)We want all Americans to succeed, but that can\u2019t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.(APPLAUSE)For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.(APPLAUSE)According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.(APPLAUSE)Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.(APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.(APPLAUSE)As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.(APPLAUSE)I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.(APPLAUSE)Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.(APPLAUSE)I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.(APPLAUSE)More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.(APPLAUSE)Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.(APPLAUSE)It will be a big, big cut.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers \u2014 have to do it.(APPLAUSE)Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.(APPLAUSE)And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d(LAUGHTER)At our meeting, I asked them, \u201cHow are you doing? How is business?\u201d They said that it\u2019s good. I asked them further, \u201cHow are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?\u201dThey told me \u2014 without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they\u2019ve become used to it \u2014 that it\u2019s very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.They weren\u2019t even asking for a change. But I am. I believe ...(APPLAUSE)I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It\u2019s been a long time since we had fair trade.The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that \u201cthe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201dLincoln was right, and it\u2019s time we heeded his advice and his words.(APPLAUSE)I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken \u2014 advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country no longer.(APPLAUSE)I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.(APPLAUSE)The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.(APPLAUSE)I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security and to restore respect for our laws.If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.(APPLAUSE)Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.(APPLAUSE)America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.(APPLAUSE)To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.(APPLAUSE)This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.(APPLAUSE)Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare ...(APPLAUSE)... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.(APPLAUSE)Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.(APPLAUSE)The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.(APPLAUSE)One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they\u2019re losing them fast, they are losing them so fast. They\u2019re leaving. And many Americans have no choice at all. There\u2019s no choice left.(APPLAUSE)Action is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.(APPLAUSE)Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.(APPLAUSE)Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.(APPLAUSE)Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.(APPLAUSE)And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines ...(APPLAUSE)... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?(APPLAUSE)On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.(APPLAUSE)My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave ...(APPLAUSE)... to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.(APPLAUSE)True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan ...(APPLAUSE)Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan\u2019s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\u2019s life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.(APPLAUSE)Megan\u2019s story is about the unbounded power of a father\u2019s love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need.If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.(APPLAUSE)In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \u2014 and the souls \u2014 of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time.(APPLAUSE)I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.(APPLAUSE)These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.(APPLAUSE)Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning \u2014 great learning center \u2014 with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will get her master\u2019s degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.(APPLAUSE)But to create this future, we must work with \u2014 not against \u2014 not against \u2014 the men and women of law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it\u2019s \u2014 really, it\u2019s what it is, division. It\u2019s pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They\u2019re friends and neighbors, they\u2019re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they\u2019ll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.(APPLAUSE)Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiel\u2019s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands \u2014 Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \u2014 were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.(APPLAUSE)To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.(APPLAUSE)Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war \u2014 if they must \u2014 they have to fight and they only have to win.(APPLAUSE)I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...(APPLAUSE)... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.(APPLAUSE)The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.(APPLAUSE)We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.(APPLAUSE)I just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \u201cRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.\u201dRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he\u2019s very happy, because I think he just broke a record.(APPLAUSE)For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.(APPLAUSE)To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism ...(APPLAUSE)... and a Cold War and defeated communism.(APPLAUSE)But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.(APPLAUSE)We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost \u2014 have to do that.We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.(APPLAUSE)Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world. All across the world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.(APPLAUSE)America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\u2019s centennial. At that celebration, the country\u2019s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America\u2019s 250th year.(APPLAUSE)Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear \u2014 schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow \u2014 are not too much to ask.(APPLAUSE)When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same God.(APPLAUSE)When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Man Who Loathed Pajamas", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byCritical ShopperTwo days before the snowstorm that was supposed to be a blizzard (but wasn\u2019t quite), I decided to get serious. I went to the supermarket to stock up on paper towels and cookies and the caramel-flavored almond-milk-infused concoction that is the only coffee drink I can stomach. I went to the butcher and bought a thick sirloin that I would go on to woefully torture on the stove top.Let\u2019s start with this: I abhor pajamas. I abhor most forms of casual attire, even in the most casual of settings. I didn\u2019t buy sweatpants until about two years ago, not because demathleisureboyz.net told me to, but because I thought I might one day see the inside of a gym and hoped to pass for a native. (I have; I don\u2019t.) I wear them around the house, too, but I don\u2019t want to be seen in them. If I wear them to the trash chute, I walk quickly.As for pajamas, I\u2019ve had a few. Two, actually, in my adult life. One, a pair I bought in London when it seemed culturally appropriate and chic; the other, by Burberry, a gift. I had spells of wearing both, but they passed quickly. Working from home \u2014 writing from home \u2014 is close enough to subsidized indolence that you don\u2019t need a sartorial reminder of just how little you\u2019re accomplishing.Besides, being home is a prize all of its own. You get to keep the worst of the world, and most of the rest of it, at bay.But the house no longer feels like such a safe space. There are CNN and all the other news channels on my TV, alerts from The New York Times and The Washington Post on my phone screen. Anxiety is persistent. Even \u201cFixer Upper\u201d barely helps.Pajamas, I recently reasoned, might be the only hope for sanity.In the store, the two clerks wore full sets, top and bottom, with some accessories atop them so no one got too cozy. They seemed to promise that, yes, you could wear pajamas and get things done \u2014 maybe not everything, but some things, and certainly that would be enough.I didn\u2019t come to Sleepy Jones to be sensible, though. That seemed besides the point. I think I was hoping for neon stripes, a rich paisley, a garish gingham \u2014 something that would connote relaxation even from space. Allowing yourself space to relax is a herculean task. Pajamas, I was positing, would make it an irresistible one, too.The choices here were basic, though. Friendly and nonjudgmental. Ice blue and white, or a nongarish gingham, or one particularly dizzying plaid. (Pants ranged from $128 to $158; tops from $138 to $178.) Sleepy Jones is part of the Andy Spade ecosystem, which is why, in these pajamas, you don\u2019t look like Julian Schnabel so much as a fastidious finance executive who packs thoroughly for a 36-hour pond jumper trip to Brussels.In the spirit of the place, and also of possible in-home soothing, I tried on several sets. They were fine. It turns out it is hard to exult about pajamas \u2014 simple ones, at least \u2014 especially in a store where the staff is enthusiastically curious about how your pajamas look. (Buddy, I\u2019m buying pajamas because I don\u2019t want to be seen, not because they unleash my inner conversationalist.)Pajamas also have limitations, which Sleepy Jones, a jovial place, addresses by offering items that are related in tone: underwear, some pencils, fragrant soaps ($14), almost-funny T-shirts that had the names of other clothing items (loafer, navy blazer) in generic fonts ($48), zines filled with strange things said by the son of a friend of the brand ($10).I decided to buy a pair of simple blue-and-white gingham pants. It was both an experiment and a symbol of na\u00efve hope. Sweatpants, I\u2019d come to realize, never felt formal. Pajama pants might allow a dash of seriousness to temper my relaxation.It wasn\u2019t to be. When I got home and pulled the pants out of the bag, the white tissue paper they were wrapped in was sealed with a small circular sticker that read, \u201cFinish nothing today.\u201d I\u2019m certain whoever came up with that felt it would reinforce my decision to tap out, but the longer I looked at it, the more it began to feel nihilistic.Finish nothing? I had, like, five deadlines. I bought pajamas because I wanted everything around me to telegraph calm so that my brain and fingers could be free to roam. I\u2019m not lazy, I\u2019m overstimulated.Still, I held out hope that a pajama-clad life could also be a productive one. A day or so later, when the snow came, I gamely put the pants on. An hour later, it was back to the sweatpants. An hour after that, jeans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now Cleared, de Blasio Gets Out of His Own Way in Mayor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byIt was the moment the New York political world had been waiting for since last spring, when word of a flurry of state and federal investigations into Mayor Bill de Blasio first emerged: prosecutors had finished their work and no criminal charges would be brought against the mayor or his aides.But it also left lingering ethical questions about the mayor\u2019s behavior and even confirmed the existence of a culture at City Hall in which the mayor considered it normal to make the case for donors in front of city agencies that report to him and acceptable to seek \u201can end run around\u201d campaign finance limits.Mr. de Blasio, rather than seeming relieved that no criminal charges would be brought, appeared by turns dismissive, defensive and combative when faced with questions throughout the day about the investigations, eager to move on to other topics and permanently put the issue to rest.\u201cThe exhaustive investigation has come to a clear conclusion,\u201d he told reporters in the afternoon. \u201cLots of allegations, and no charges brought.\u201dHe defended his actions and refused to acknowledge that the prosecutors raised serious ethical questions about his activities, even as they said they did not have the legal grounds to accuse anyone of a crime.\u201cGuys, there\u2019s laws,\u201d he said, bombarded by questions from reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s laws.\u201dIn a royal blue suit and lately sporting long, pale gray sideburns, Mr. de Blasio said that he had only glancingly read the documents provided by prosecutors \u2014 even though the federal prosecutor\u2019s statement was only five sentences long \u2014 and at one point referred dismissively to the investigations by saying \u201caspersions were cast.\u201dThe end of the probes means that Mr. de Blasio, already facing an anemic slate of declared opponents, faces a road to re-election cleared of any major obstacles in the primary election in September. At the same time, his Republican opponents have been robbed of their most potent argument against him \u2014 that criminal corruption pervades his administration.It turned out that Mr. de Blasio was in gym clothes when news that he would not be charged broke on Thursday morning. He made his first public comments in a radio interview minutes later and sought to put the whole episode behind him.\u201cWe gotta get back to work,\u201d he told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer during the mayor\u2019s regular weekly radio session.But Mr. de Blasio and his administration did not emerge unscathed. Federal prosecutors and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office made a point of highlighting conduct by the mayor and those acting on his behalf that, while not criminal, appeared to breach an ethical line. He acted on behalf of donors, federal prosecutors said; he attempted to evade \u201cthe spirit\u201d of state campaign contribution limits, according to the state prosecutors.\u201cIt shows that while the line was not legally crossed, it was ethically blurred,\u201d said Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, a good government group. \u201cHarm was still caused because a pay-to-play culture was created in that New Yorkers felt that they needed to support the mayor\u2019s fund-raising in order to be considered for positive action by City Hall.\u201dThe mayor deflected questions about those findings at a news conference in City Hall on proposed federal budget cuts. Flanked by his top aides, Mr. de Blasio refused to detail cases where, in the characterization of prosecutors, he had acted on behalf of donors seeking favors, and said he would not change how his administration dealt with such requests in the future.\u201cWhat matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year and no charges have been brought and this is the end of the matter,\u201d he said.Even before the prosecutors\u2019 announcement, Mr. de Blasio appeared to be in a strong political position heading into the re-election campaign. Crime is low, the city\u2019s economy has been strong and he has policy achievements to point to, such as universal prekindergarten. His poll numbers have improved slightly and challengers preferred to let the investigations play out before jumping into the race.That analysis appeared to be correct, according to conversations with those mulling a run or their aides on Thursday. It all but ended speculation of a run by the city\u2019s public advocate, Letitia James; Ruben Diaz Jr., the borough president of the Bronx; and Scott M. Stringer, the city\u2019s comptroller.\u201cIt\u2019s behind us now,\u201d said Ms. James. \u201cI look forward to working on intractable issues such as affordable housing and homelessness.\u201dBradley Tusk, a former Bloomberg adviser who had been openly seeking a Democratic challenger to Mr. de Blasio, said Thursday that he would stop. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in tilting at windmills,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all came down to indictments and there were no indictments, so there\u2019s not much else to do.\u201dOn the Republican side, undeclared potential challengers such as Eric Ulrich, a city councilman, or the billionaire supermarket magnate, John Catsimatidis, now appeared less likely to enter the race.\u201cI was definitely willing to run if he was not going to be around,\u201d Mr. Catsimatidis said. But he added, \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at it.\u201dMr. Sheinkopf said there were still issues that a challenger could press the mayor on.\u201cThe issue now switches from corruption to management and performance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not as sexy, more subject to argument and always gives the incumbent an advantage except when crime rises.\u201dHe added: \u201cIs there an attack on him that works? Yes. Are the ethics issues gone as of today? No. But will it be tougher to beat him? The answer is yes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Lets States Defund Clinics That Perform Abortions", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, aided by Vice President Mike Pence and an ailing Georgia colleague who gingerly made his way to the Capitol with the aid of a wheelchair and a walker, voted Thursday to undo an Obama administration rule preventing states from blocking funding for family planning clinics that also provide abortions.The vote was one of a string of showdowns to reverse Obama-era regulations, but this one unfolded with all the drama of numerous past conflicts over abortion funding \u2014 with Mr. Pence casting the tiebreaking vote in his role as president of the Senate.\u201cToday, Congress is sending a resolution to President Trump ensuring that states are not forced to fund America\u2019s abortion giant, Planned Parenthood, with Title X tax dollars,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a prominent anti-abortion group.Taking money away from Planned Parenthood, the bill\u2019s target, has been a longstanding goal of congressional Republicans, but earlier efforts were blocked by Democrats and President Barack Obama. Even with Republicans in full control of Washington, however, the process was not easy.The measure fell under a somewhat obscure and, until recently, rarely used Congressional Review Act that allows a new Congress to undo late actions of a previous presidential administration during the first few months of the year.It returns to the states the power to exclude health care centers that perform abortions from receiving Title X money set aside for family planning and related preventive health services for women. Title X grants cover contraception, as well as cancer and other disease screenings and treatments, but they cannot, under current federal law, be used to pay for abortion services.Democrats all voted against the bill, as did two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski have long opposed attacks on funding Planned Parenthood, which they argue provides services for women in areas with scarce health care options.Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, who returned after two back surgeries, was cleared by his doctors to travel for one day only to help pass the measure, but it took the final vote of Mr. Pence to break the 50-50 tie. The measure will now head to the desk of Mr. Trump, a onetime supporter of Planned Parenthood who adopted an anti-abortion rights position during the campaign.Democrats excoriated the measure on the Senate floor. \u201cHistorically low teen pregnancy rates did not happen in a vacuum,\u201d said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan. The measure, he said, \u201cwill disproportionately hurt people in rural and underserved areas where these clinics are more often than not their primary source of health care.\u201dMr. Pence was also forced to travel to the Capitol earlier in the day for a procedural vote that opened debate on the bill.The final vote remained open for more than an hour as aides waited for Mr. Isakson. He finally arrived in a wheelchair and was transferred to a walker so he could make his way into the Senate chamber and, flanked by Senate pages, give a thumbs up as an \u201caye.\u201d Mr. Pence then swept in to break the tie.A handful of Democrats stood on the floor, taking in the scene. \u201cIt will take one Republican this afternoon on the final vote to say yes for the women in their state,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cThat\u2019s all we\u2019re asking. For the women of this country.\u201dThe Democrats could find no other Republicans to join them. But Republicans were also scarce in defending the bill on the floor before it passed.\u201cThe deafening silence from the group of almost entirely male Republican senators are voting today to make it harder for women to get health care they need,\u201d Ms. Murray said. \u201cNot one spoke today to justify this vote.\u201cWhere were those Republican senators today, Mr. President?\u201d she added. \u201cWhy did they feel so entitled, not just to interfere with women\u2019s health care decisions, but to do so without explaining themselves? If they are ashamed of their votes today, which they should be, they had ample opportunity to reconsider.\u201dAfter the vote, Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, did give a speech praising the measure, one of the few that Republicans have been able to pass in recent years concerning abortion providers.\u201cIt should be the right of our states to allocate sub-grants under the Title X program in the way that best fits the needs of the people living there,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, like many other rules issued during the Obama administration, this rule attempted to empower federal bureaucrats in Washington and silence our states.\u201dA showdown over Planned Parenthood could occur next month when Congress moves to pass a measure to finance the government for the rest of the year. Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski have resisted these moves, saying that family planning clinics provide essential care for women.\u201cMike Pence went from yesterday\u2019s forum on empowering women to, today, leading a group of male politicians in a vote to take away access to birth control and cancer screenings,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cPeople are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access health care, and they will not stand for it.\u201dAn article on March 31 about Congressional efforts to undo an Obama administration rule preventing states from blocking funding for family planning clinics that also provide abortions misstated the purpose of the Congressional Review Act. The law allows a new Congress to undo regulatory actions completed in the final weeks of a previous presidential administration, not the actions of a previous Congress.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Health Policy Expert Is Confirmed as Medicare and Medicaid Administrator", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Monday confirmed Seema Verma, a health policy expert from Indiana, to lead efforts by the Trump administration to transform Medicaid and upend the Affordable Care Act.By a vote of 55 to 43, the Senate approved the nomination of Ms. Verma to be the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which spends more than $1 trillion a year on programs providing health care to more than one-third of all Americans.Unlike most people who have held the job, Ms. Verma has extensive experience in Medicaid, a program that was expanded by President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and now provides coverage to more than 70 million low-income people.Ms. Verma was an architect of Indiana\u2019s Medicaid program, widely seen as a model by conservatives, and she worked closely with Vice President Mike Pence when he was the state\u2019s governor. Indiana expanded Medicaid eligibility, but emphasized \u201cpersonal responsibility.\u201d That means that beneficiaries pay premiums, contribute to health savings accounts and receive incentives for healthy behavior.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, said Ms. Verma was \u201cthe ideal candidate to oversee the reform of the Medicaid program,\u201d as she had worked well with members of both parties in Indiana and in other states.But Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said she has supported proposals that \u201ccreate roadblocks to coverage for low-income Americans.\u201d And she would have a major role in carrying out legislation to gut the Affordable Care Act and remake the Medicaid program, said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee.Senate Democrats cast a wary eye on how Ms. Verma might enforce the legislation, if it is approved. Mr. Wyden said she \u201cwould be able to give states a green light to push the very frail and sick into high-risk pools\u201d in which they could receive substandard coverage or be forced to pay more for the care they need. Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said Ms. Verma in Indiana \u201cmade millions of dollars in consulting fees by kicking poor, working people off of Medicaid for failure to pay monthly contributions similar to premiums.\u201dAnd Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said she was dismayed that Ms. Verma had suggested at her confirmation hearing last month that coverage of maternity care should be optional, not required, as it is now under the Affordable Care Act.At that hearing, Ms. Verma said: \u201cSome women might want maternity coverage and some women might not want it, might not choose it, might not feel like they need that. So I think it\u2019s up to women to make the decision that works best for them and their families.\u201dBut not all Democrats found fault with Ms. Verma\u2019s work on Medicaid in Indiana. Under the program she helped devise, \u201chundreds of thousands of Hoosiers currently have health insurance,\u201d said Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana, one of three Democrats who voted for her on Monday.\u201cThis plan,\u201d he said, \u201chas helped lower our state\u2019s uninsured rate and improve health care outcomes, and has played a critical role in combating the opioid-abuse and heroin-use epidemics.\u201dThe Obama administration granted a waiver for Indiana\u2019s Medicaid program following lengthy negotiations, and several other states are considering similar changes. Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, promised last week to give states \u201cgreater flexibility.\u201dJudith Solomon, a vice president at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, said the premiums charged to Medicaid beneficiaries in Indiana, as well as the complexity of the program, appeared to be \u201cdeterring significant numbers of eligible low-income people from enrolling.\u201d Still, she said, the coverage provided under Indiana\u2019s plan is \u201cbetter than no coverage at all.\u201dAnd without the conservative features of the program, state officials said, Indiana might not have expanded eligibility.Dennis M. Murphy, the chief executive of Indiana University Health, and top executives of five other hospital systems in Indiana endorsed Ms. Verma, saying in a joint statement that she had shown a knack for \u201cbipartisan solutions that unite people across the political spectrum.\u201dThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has led federal efforts to carry out the Affordable Care Act, setting standards for private health insurance and operating HealthCare.gov, the online marketplace on which more than 10 million people obtained coverage last year.Ms. Verma has comparatively little experience with Medicare, the popular program that insures 57 million people who are 65 or older or have disabilities. Within a decade, enrollment is expected to grow by one-third, to 76 million. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump said he did not intend to cut Medicare or Medicaid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For I.P.O., Saudi Oil Company May Have to Give Up Some of Its Secrets", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byAs investment bankers and Saudi officials plan the trading debut, there are more questions than answers: Is the company worth $2 trillion, as the Saudis insist, or a small fraction of that, as argued by bankers and international oil experts? Will members of the royal family, with their secret oil payments, allow the kind of transparency that investors are demanding? Can the Saudis pull this off by late next year, as promised, especially if oil prices decline again or tensions heighten around the Persian Gulf?Khalid A. al-Falih, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister and chairman of Saudi Aramco, brushed aside many of those concerns before global energy executives here on Tuesday, seeking to build confidence that the Saudi Aramco offering would be the richest ever.But not all energy experts are so sure the offering will go smoothly, although investment bankers and Saudi officials alike have plenty of incentives to make it a success.\u201cTalk is cheap, implementation is difficult,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \u201cThey will have to recreate books that never existed.\u201dAs a prize, there are fewer bigger than Saudi Aramco. The Saudis plan to offer 5 percent of the company, which could raise $20 billion to $100 billion, depending on a company valuation still to be determined.The Saudis insist on the higher values based on the country\u2019s 266 billion barrels of oil reserves, roughly 15 percent of total global supplies, which they say provide the company with a total valuation of $2 trillion. The bankers, however, are relying on other calculations, based on various analyses of operations, costs and projections of future commodity prices. The consultants at Wood Mackenzie reportedly have estimated a valuation of roughly $400 billion. The firm would not confirm that figure for this article.The biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC, are positioning themselves by advising the Saudis on how to structure the offering.But investment bankers say the value of the company can be determined only after the Saudi government outlines the minority protections that investors will have, what taxes they will have to pay, and what Saudi Aramco\u2019s cost structure will be. Complex assumptions must be made involving projections of oil prices and demand over the next 30 to 50 years in a world increasingly worried about climate change and susceptible to technological disruption.Under a privatization, some combination of the government, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund and members of the royal family would have to share the profits with foreign investors. Since the government depends on the company for most of its revenue, that is a delicate issue.Separating Saudi Aramco from the government could be as complicated as separating conjoined twins. Not only is the company\u2019s governance tied to the management of the state\u2019s most valuable assets \u2014 its oil, refineries, production equipment and pipelines \u2014 but it is called on to do things far removed from energy, like building hospitals and schools and financing homeownership. The company sells a substantial amount of its production domestically at sizable discounts to world prices.The state company now pays an 85 percent tax on its profits. That rate would probably be reduced considerably to make the stock offering attractive, but that could complicate state finances at a time when the government is struggling with higher debts and lower revenue.\u201cYou can imagine a lot of things going wrong,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, a Middle East energy expert at the University of California, Davis. \u201cMaybe they are going to get a lot less money than they thought they were going to get, and that is going to be a budget problem and a failure.\u201dSaudi Aramco has never released the kind of financial statements that Western companies do routinely. That could be a problem if the company pushes for a New York Stock Exchange listing, as expected, since the Securities and Exchange Commission would insist on precise disclosure of proven undeveloped reserves, which must be developed within five years to remain on the books. Such decisions have been kept strictly secret by the Saudis.Bankers say they are enthusiastic about the potential of the deal to produce a bountiful and secure dividend stream, but only as long as Saudi officials make the pragmatic decisions to structure Saudi Aramco like other public companies. They praise the company for its professional management and productivity.\u201cAssuming a market-related governance and tax structure,\u201d said Osmar Abib, global co-head of oil and gas investment banking at Credit Suisse, \u201cSaudi Aramco should produce strong cash flows given its low-cost crude production profile and substantial reserve position.\u201dIn his talk on Tuesday, Mr. Falih acknowledged that there was still resistance to change in the kingdom and that his company still needed to work on its accounting practices to meet international stock exchange standards.\u201cIt\u2019s not simple, it\u2019s really complex,\u201d he said.\u201cEverything is changing,\u201d said Samer S. al-Ashgar, president of the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, based in Riyadh. \u201cThere is no better way to describe it than as a business culture revolution.\u201dStanley Reed contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

Brian McFadden, rentals manager at TripleMint, has placed many tenants in Normandie Court on the Upper East Side \u2014 a 1980s building also known as \u201cDormandie Court,\u201d where landscaped gardens and amenities such as a doorman, gym, laundry and swimming pool give it a \u201ccollegiate feel.\u201dMr. Delaney \u2014 along with Jared Binder, 25, a software developer for Nomura Securities; Casey Gambuti, 25, a technology auditor at Goldman Sachs; and a fourth roommate who preferred to be unidentified \u2014 had previously lived together on campus as members of the Chi Psi fraternity.Their Jersey City high-rise is a bit more sophisticated than frat house living, but some traditions carry over. There is a white board over the couch in the living room for writing random quotes and in-jokes \u2014 and on occasion, website coding.\u201cWhen you have four of us, there\u2019s always people over, always something going on,\u201d Mr. Gambuti said.\u201cWhen we first started living here, we\u2019d bring some beers to the rooftop, bring a guitar out and meet other people doing the same thing,\u201d Mr. Delaney said.The friends feel no pressure to engineer a social life since the company that owns the building has it built in. \u201cThey have a good amount of social events they throw,\u201d Mr. Delaney said. \u201cThey threw a party for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, they did one at the end of summer when the pool was closing. A Christmas party. They put movies on. Thursday Night Football on a white screen on the roof. There\u2019s very little reason to leave here.\u201dWhen the men first saw an ad for the apartment on Craigslist, with four bedrooms and a rooftop swimming pool for $4,800 a month, they thought it was too good to be true. They also worried about their application being accepted since they were young graduates embarking on their careers. But when they took up residence in July, they quickly realized that the building was full of people just like them. And while Mr. Delaney, Mr. Gambuti and Mr. Binder all commute to work in Manhattan, they prefer life in Jersey City on the other side of the river.\u201cI was looking at a place like this with a pool in Manhattan,\u201d Mr. Binder said. \u201cIt was just under $8,000 for a three-bedroom.\u201dEven co-workers, who were initially skeptical of his commute back to the Garden State, agree that he has a great setup.\u201cI told them about the St. Patrick\u2019s Day party and my co-worker said, \u2018You\u2019re just going to go back to summer camp over there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Binder said. \u201cHe came over this summer and we\u2019d work on the pool deck. He\u2019s from Brooklyn. He was like, \u2018Can we work here every day?\u2019 Coming to this building changed his opinion.\u201dThe roommates hope that the new owners who recently bought the building will continue putting up fliers next to the elevators advertising the next community building activity.When Jamaal Davis, 26, a licensed real estate agent at Citi Habitats, heard that his friend and fellow Morehouse College graduate Terry Anderson, 26, was moving to New York City to work in finance, he immediately knew where to place him.\u201cBattery Park City would not work for Terry,\u201d said Mr. Davis, who gets a lot of business through the \u201cschool pipeline.\u201d He knew his friend and client required a neighborhood that \u201cdoesn\u2019t shut down at 6 p.m.\u201dMr. Davis also crossed the Financial district and TriBeCa off the list \u2014 he saw the neighborhoods as lacking in night life and city views. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to open my window and be looking at a brick wall,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.Mr. Davis found Mr. Anderson his current apartment \u2014 a two-bedroom in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, that he shares with a roommate, Javonie Hodge, 26, a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an investment analyst with TIG Advisors. The men, who became friends while interning at Goldman Sachs, are splitting the $5,300-a-month rent. Their high-rise has become the Thursday through Sunday meeting spot for friends, new and old, no doubt in part because of the stunning views of the city from their living room windows.Mr. Davis, a native New Yorker, finds himself acting as a sort of guide for recent Morehouse graduates, many of whom are unsure of which neighborhoods they should consider.The placement was a perfect fit for Mr. Anderson, who required proximity to work, a garage to park his motorcycle and night life. He described the building as \u201ccommunal,\u201d and he has befriended neighbors who happen to be affiliated with Spelman, the college across the street from Morehouse.\u201cThe neighbors we\u2019re closest with are this couple \u2014 the guy taught at Spelman and the wife, I find out she\u2019s from Spelman,\u201d he said.\u201cMe and Jamaal, we kick back here,\u201d he said. \u201cSuper Bowl, we do a big party. Boxing matches. Javonie\u2019s big into basketball. The kickbacks we throw, a lot of people from our colleges come because that\u2019s the network. Morehouse is so small you make one call, and it\u2019ll be a reunion.\u201dIn the East Village, six friends from Notre Dame share a six-bedroom apartment that has given them a sense of continuity and also provided a support network as they embark on their careers.The apartment, which features a long hallway with doors opening up to individual bedrooms, is the definition of dorm living, right down to the fact that the men tried to put an inflatable hot tub on their private roof deck. (The landlord politely requested it be removed, and they complied).After two of the friends saw the apartment, they acted immediately, sending the others video of the place and waiting for an affirmative from each potential roommate, knowing that apartments of this size are not easy to come by. \u201cOur lease was shipped from New York to Cleveland, to another suburb of Cleveland, to Chicago, to St. Louis and back to New York,\u201d said T.J. O\u2019Brien, 24.Their parents acted as guarantors. \u201cThe thing everyone\u2019s parents think is you\u2019re going to be living in the city with people you know, and you\u2019re not going to get killed by some random guy on Craigslist,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said.Mr. O\u2019Brien \u2014 along with Greg Duffy, 23; John Planek, 23; Kurt Wemhoener, 24; Matt Pinover, 24; and a sixth friend who declined to be identified \u2014 split the $10,000-a-month rent, based on the size of the bedroom.But the living situation has been about more than just partying \u2014 when a neighboring building was on fire, the men quickly alerted one another. \u201cWith this many roommates, there\u2019s always a helping hand to be first on the scene,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cRight away we knew our stuff\u2019s all right, we\u2019re safe, we\u2019re good.\u201dAnd when a water valve broke, flooding the bedroom and all the belongings of one roommate, the men each took the comforters off their beds to try to stop the flow of water.\u201cThat night the heat had to be turned off,\u201d Mr. Pinover said. \u201cIt was six guys piled into two beds pushed together. We filled the room with space heaters.\u201cWe were \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 for Halloween one year, so I slept in my Cookie Monster costume,\u201d he said, clarifying that it was without the mask.\u201cEven when your apartment floods, it\u2019s still fun because everyone is cracking jokes,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said.Evan Rugen, a 22-year-old licensed real estate agent at Citi Habitats, known in his office as the \u201cfrat whisperer,\u201d not only rented the Notre Dame graduates their apartment, but he has also become part of their social network. His office is just a few blocks from the graduates\u2019 apartment, and he will often stop by after work.\u201cIt\u2019s the Midwest hospitality,\u201d he said, explaining the group\u2019s appeal. \u201cThey\u2019re very welcoming. If you ring the buzzer at 11:30 p.m., you can come up and hang out. We got to New York City around the same time and we\u2019re sort of exploring the city together.\u201dMr. O\u2019Brien said: \u201cI think one big thing coming from Notre Dame is that the majority of kids we go to school with went to Chicago after graduation. So the Lincoln Park, Wrigley Field neighborhoods are kind of the big Notre Dame communities. That\u2019s not true of New York so we kind of created our own community here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sheldon Silver Appeal Looks to New Definition of Corruption", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byA lawyer for Sheldon Silver cited a unanimous Supreme Court decision that narrowed the definition of what kind of conduct can serve as the basis for a corruption prosecution, as he argued on Thursday that the disgraced former speaker of the State Assembly should be acquitted or granted a new trial.But a federal prosecutor told the panel that the evidence at Mr. Silver\u2019s trial \u201coverwhelmingly established that Sheldon Silver abused the immense power that he had as the speaker of the Assembly,\u201d and that his case was \u201cnothing like the McDonnell case.\u201dMr. Bharara was not present at the arguments. His former deputy, Joon H. Kim, now the acting United States attorney, was in attendance.Mr. Silver, 73, a Democrat, who served for more than two decades as Assembly speaker and became one of New York\u2019s most powerful politicians, was also not in the courtroom.Evidence at trial showed that Mr. Silver had orchestrated two criminal schemes in which he obtained nearly $4 million in illicit payments in return for official actions that benefited a cancer researcher at Columbia University and two real estate developers, Glenwood Management and the Witkoff Group.In one scheme, Mr. Silver arranged to have the State Health Department award two grants totaling $500,000 to the researcher, Dr. Robert N. Taub. In return, Dr. Taub referred patients with potentially valuable legal claims to a law firm, Weitz & Luxenberg, that gave Mr. Silver a portion of its fees.In the second scheme, Mr. Silver arranged to have the developers move certain tax business to a law firm, Goldberg & Iryami, that also shared its fees with him. In return, Mr. Silver supported critical rent legislation that Glenwood backed, for example, and met with its lobbyists.There was no question, Judge Caproni wrote, that Mr. Silver \u201ctook a number of official acts \u2014 most obviously passing legislation and approving state grants and tax-exempt financing \u2014 as part of a quid pro quo\u201d in the two schemes. But there was a \u201csubstantial question,\u201d she added, of whether the court\u2019s jury instructions, which defined official action, were in error in light of the McDonnell decision, and if so, whether such error was harmless.The McDonnell ruling says that official action must involve formal and concrete government actions or decisions, like filing a lawsuit or holding a hearing, not just making phone calls or setting up meetings.\u201cThe definition that was given by the district court is too broad,\u201d Mr. Molo, the lawyer for Mr. Silver, argued on Thursday, citing the judge\u2019s instruction that \u201cany action\u201d taken under color of official authority \u201cwas sufficient to be an official act.\u201dMr. Silver\u2019s lawyers contend that there is no way to tell whether the jury, in convicting Mr. Silver, improperly relied on acts that would not be considered official under the McDonnell decision.\u201cMcDonnell says you cannot instruct that way,\u201d Mr. Molo said. \u201cMcDonnell changed the law dramatically.\u201d\u201cHere, as the court required and the jury found,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said, \u201cSheldon Silver engaged in official decision-making as the opportunities arose, in order again and again and again, for each scheme, over a decade\u2019s period of time, to benefit those who were paying him.\u201dThe panel, which included Judges Jos\u00e9 A.

{"Headline": "When Teachers Face the Task of Fixing Their Retirement Accounts", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyOther tables were quick to answer. It was a reminder, as if she needed one, that for all of the money smarts in the community, which is packed with hedge fund executives, she and her colleagues were still mostly on their own when trying to fix their 403(b) retirement savings plan.Time will tell if legislation can pass and then help. Meanwhile, educators like Ms. Sutton are left to fend for themselves or lobby their school districts for assistance. Which means the system, as it stands, looks like this: We have essentially forced some of the people who do the most good in the world to turn themselves into part-time plan administrators who do annuity and mutual fund prospectus-reading on the side. Or at least that\u2019s what they need to be if they want something better for themselves.Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re a new teacher in Greenwich. Yes, you have a shot at a pension, as long as you stick with teaching. But it may not be enough to support you in your old age. Not everyone is sure about staying with education, and not everyone trusts that underfunded pension plans will persist. Moreover, not everyone pays into Social Security, including teachers in Connecticut. If you don\u2019t pay in, you don\u2019t get a check for your own work for those years.There is no explanation there on how the plan works. No explanation on how the companies differ. No menu of investments. And no contact information for people who can explain anything to you.A befuddled (and annoyed) educator might then call the phone number for every one of the companies and ask for the investment menu, as I did this week through the companies\u2019 public relations representatives. Foresters Financial and Voya Financial would not provide the menu or answer any questions, and would not explain why they did not want to talk to me. (Foresters said it could not meet my deadline, which made me wonder: Does it take two days to respond to potential customers, too?)The Oldham Resource Group said it could not speak without permission from its custodian, GWN Securities. I had a brief conversation with its representative, who then did not respond to additional questions or inquiries about the reason for its reticence.USAA did not reply to my message before my deadline. A representative for Ameriprise said she would help and then went radio silent, while MassMutual and Security Benefit employees did not respond to my messages seeking comment. What are these people so afraid of?Want mutual funds? Only funds from Oppenheimer (and no index funds) are offered via Compass Capital Management, another company on the Omni list. It offers different classes of funds, and the best deal for investors tends to be those on which it pays half a percentage point a year to an adviser on top of whatever the underlying fund expenses are. Over all, these investments seemed best for most people in the Greenwich plan (keeping in mind that many of the companies on the list would not talk to me).But better deals do exist out in the world, and more teachers ought to have the opportunity to snare them. For instance, it should be easier to buy simple target-date mutual funds, the all-in-one funds that let you set an intended retirement date and then allocate money to a collection of index mutual funds that track the market and adjust risk according to your age.Ms. Sutton, the union president, said she was working on it. She has fired up her members to ask more questions of any adviser who is helping them with their 403(b)\u2019s. Her finance committee is putting spreadsheets together and looking into other options, like a cheaper state plan that should be available to teachers but currently is not.But it\u2019s all a bit wearying, and it\u2019s not lost on her that the human resources employees at many corporations serve up cheap Fidelity and Vanguard mutual funds to colleagues on a silver platter. \u201cSome of us in the public sector are working our tails off; we hope for the good of humanity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not educated in this area.\u201d\u201cWe get pushback from the teachers\u2019 union,\u201d he said of the local opposition that bubbles up. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to restrict choice for their members.\u201dQuite often, his advice to educators around the state is this, given that many plans are as questionable as the one in Greenwich or worse: Skip the 403(b) plan altogether and just open up a Roth individual retirement account at a low-cost brokerage firm like Vanguard. Young people, especially, may not benefit much from the tax break they get by putting away pretax money in a 403(b) as opposed to after-tax money in a Roth.Finally, press the investment companies that serve your employer. They may stonewall me, but you should not stand for it. Demand answers to your questions. If you don\u2019t want to pay 2 percent or more annually for an annuity that you do not understand, lobby your union or district for index mutual funds. And to all of you finance executives in Greenwich who had no idea what sort of challenges your teachers were facing until now: How about raising your hands to help those teachers fix this problem?You know where the world is going. Pensions, if you have them at all, aren\u2019t going to become more generous. Clearly, your health insurance isn\u2019t, either. So these supplemental savings plans can make all the difference between a comfortable retirement at the time when you want it and having to work far longer than you ever could have expected.Now, it\u2019s time to make them better.Tara Siegel Bernard contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And great, Meals on Wheels sounds great. Again, that\u2019s a state decision to fund that particular portion, to take the federal money and give it to the states, and say look, we want to give you money for programs that don\u2019t work. I can\u2019t defend that anymore. We cannot defend that anymore.\u201d \u201cIf you can provide these lower-cost programs and keep seniors out of nursing homes, that in essence will save money,\u201d said Kali S. Thomas, a professor of health services at Brown University.The White House does propose to eliminate the Community Service and Community Development Block Grants, two programs that provide assistance to antipoverty efforts. These are characterized by the budget as having little effect, but are used by many state and local Meals on Wheels programs to cover gaps in funding, said Jenny Bertolette, the vice president of communications at Meals on Wheels.\u201cThe C.D.B.G.s have been identified as programs since I believe the first, actually the second Bush administration as ones that were just not showing any results.\u201dThe 42-year-old program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, largely falls under the control of local grantees. This means spending can be tailored to the specific needs of a low-income area, said William Rohe, a professor of city and regional planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s statement is \u201csimply not accurate,\u201d Dr. Rohe said. \u201cRather than doing away with this important program, it should be revised to require local governments to better target the funds geographically.\u201d\u201cSo, let\u2019s talk about after-school programs generally. They\u2019re supposed to be educational programs, right? And that\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do, they\u2019re supposed to help kids who can\u2019t \u2014 who don\u2019t get fed at home, get fed so that they do better at school. Guess what? There\u2019s no demonstrable evidence they\u2019re actually doing that. There\u2019s no demonstrable evidence they\u2019re actually helping results, helping kids do better at school.\u201dThe budget does propose to cut 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which fund after-school programs for about 1.6 million children in high-poverty areas. While the vast majority provide snacks and meals, feeding children is not their core mission.\u201cIt\u2019s something they do, but let\u2019s not miss their primary purpose,\u201d said Heather Weiss of the Global Family Research Program, who has evaluated after-social programs for decades. \u201cThey were set up to provide safe environments for kids with learning opportunities of all sorts.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the Arts Thrive Without Washington? A Kansas Town Says Yes", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byFor Ms. Meder, a great purpose is at stake. There are the traveling performers\u2019 visits to elementary schools that she arranges. The classes on stained glass and drawing. The quarterly art walks she organizes in the brick-paved downtown, where storefronts transform into makeshift galleries that draw hundreds of spectators from Hays and beyond.And for the last six years, Ms. Meder has sustained all that without consistent financing from state and federal sources.\u201cWhen what you\u2019re about is important enough to you, you will find a way,\u201d said Ms. Meder, who grew up around here, roughly halfway between Denver and Kansas City, Mo. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how it always is with the arts.\u201dHays, a college town with about 21,000 residents, is a case study of how the arts can continue to thrive when public funds dry up. But it is also a cautionary tale of the sometimes-hidden costs.Ms. Meder fears that artists in Kansas have become more siloed and less engaged with one another in recent years, as financing for conferences has become more elusive and eligibility for grant money has fluctuated. Since Mr. Brownback\u2019s cuts in 2011, some public money has returned to Kansas, but arts advocates here say they have learned to forge ahead \u2014 and in some cases scale back their ambitions \u2014 without always counting on that assistance.\u201cA lot of my good Republican friends are out there, conservative and moderates, and they\u2019re taking it in, they\u2019re going to all of the venues and taking in the live music and the art,\u201d said Henry Schwaller IV, a Democrat who serves on the Hays City Commission and who was chairman of the Kansas Arts Commission when Governor Brownback withdrew its funding. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of our DNA here. And that\u2019s hard to replicate in other communities.\u201dThe board president of the Arts Council, Mike Morley, 47, is a registered Republican who voted for Mr. Trump in November. Ms. Meder, 60, is a Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton.\u201cOn the political spectrum, we\u2019re right to left and everything in between,\u201d said Mr. Morley, who moved to Hays about five years ago and works in the utility industry. \u201cBut the one thing that we all have in common is an appreciation for the importance of the arts.\u201dJacob Brubaker, a sophomore at Fort Hays State and a member of the College Republicans, said that the federal government should perhaps stop funding the arts eventually but that the drawdown should be gradual so that artists could find other money.\u201cThe very last thing I want is to just eliminate these artistic opportunities for people at the high school and college level,\u201d said Mr. Brubaker, a Trump voter who participated in school musicals while growing up on a farm outside Bird City, Kan., and who has attended performances during college. \u201cArt just says so much about the culture of a county, a state, a country,\u201d he added.\u201cThere are other, larger avenues they should be going after first,\u201d said Mr. Schiel, a registered Democrat.Janis Lee, a Democrat who spent years representing a rural district in the Kansas Senate, said that midsize cities and large metropolitan areas often had the means to offset the lack of public funds. But many tiny towns across Kansas had few other options to draw regional or national performers, she said, or even to offer art classes in schools.\u201cYou have a wholesale, gradual diminishing of that kind of activity for your community,\u201d Ms. Lee said.And in places like Hays, where the arts have persisted, advocates are concerned that their very survival might unintentionally prove that public money was never needed in the first place. Ms. Meder called it \u201ca catch-22.\u201d\u201cThere is that fear, because we are finding a way to make it work,\u201d Ms. Meder said. \u201cBut believe me, we have had to make some significant compromises and still been affected in certain ways.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Downside of Ride-Hailing: More New York City Gridlock", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byWhen Uber arrived in New York City in 2011, subway ridership was soaring and the medallions required to drive a yellow cab were selling for a sky-high $1 million.But Uber had an enticing offer: Your ride could appear at the touch of a button.Ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Lyft, are rapidly transforming transportation in New York, emerging as an existential threat to the taxi industry and siphoning passengers away from subways and buses, while raising concerns over worsening street congestion. They are also expanding quickly across the country, altering the travel landscape in places with poor public transit.In New York \u2014 Uber\u2019s largest United States market \u2014 yellow cab trips are dropping, while the use of ride-hailing services has skyrocketed to about 16 million passengers in October from about five million in June 2015, according to an independent report on ride-hailing apps. The price of a taxi medallion has plummeted, many drivers have abandoned cabs for ride-hailing services and taxis sit idle in garages.\u201cIt\u2019s hit a point where people are choosing to travel by ride-hailing because the subways have become intolerable,\u201d said Thomas K. Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group.Subways and buses have absorbed much of the city\u2019s growth in recent decades as subway ridership has hit levels not seen since the middle of the last century. But both have become less appealing \u2014 buses trapped in traffic, prolonged waits for trains, packed platforms and all-too-frequent mechanical breakdowns.Patricia Martinez has switched from the bus to an app called Via. It is more comfortable, she said, and the $5 flat rate in most of Manhattan is not much more than the bus.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to pay yellow taxis all the time,\u201d said Ms. Martinez, who lives on the Upper East Side. \u201cThe price makes a difference, and the cars are very good.\u201dLilja Owsley uses Lyft to travel late at night from her job at a wine bar in Chelsea to her home in Bushwick, Brooklyn. \u201cI\u2019d rather just take an Uber or Lyft instead of waiting for the L train for 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d she said.And while ride-hailing services predominantly serve Manhattan, they are spreading to parts of the city where public transit is limited and taxis are scarce.Yao Kou, a 27-year-old student, lives on the East Side of Manhattan, but is several blocks from the nearest subway stop, so she takes Uber or Lyft when she is in a rush. \u201cI want to avoid walking a long distance to the subway station,\u201d she said.But the proliferation of ride-hailing vehicles appears to be contributing to increasingly gridlocked streets. Average travel speeds in the heart of Manhattan dropped to about 8.1 miles per hour last year, down about 12 percent from 2010, according to city data.Subway service must become more competitive because it is unsustainable for the city to grow by adding more vehicles, said Bruce Schaller, a former senior transportation official for the city who prepared the report on ride-hailing services.\u201cThis is a wake-up call that action is needed now to deal with delays, crowding and a host of problems that people experience every day on the transit system,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that runs the city\u2019s subways and buses, said it was working to modernize the system and improve service.The city\u2019s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said her agency was working to assess the impact of ride-hailing services.\u201cThere\u2019s no question they have provided a convenient new service and a lot of people are making use of them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s also no question that if they continue to grow in popularity and add a lot of new car trips to the streets, we have to look at the externalities, which could include congestion, lower air quality, reduced safety or declining transit usage.\u201dThe largest ride-hailing apps in New York \u2014 Uber, Lyft and Via \u2014 and their supporters said there were many reasons for the growing congestion, including construction, truck deliveries and thick pedestrian traffic. The companies said they actually reduced congestion through more efficient use of streets and considered themselves a supplement rather than a substitute for public transportation.\u201cLyft\u2019s goal is to replace private car ownership, not transit, walking or biking,\u201d said Adrian Durbin, a Lyft spokesman.Still, ride-booking services are succeeding at the expense of others. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has taken a hit to its budget because it receives financing from a 50-cent surcharge on taxi trips. Officials say the shift from taxis to Uber and other apps has cost the authority about $28 million since 2014.The Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog, has also questioned whether New York can still count on the $1.2 billion in revenue it expects to collect from the future sale of taxi medallions, because their value has sunk.Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said ride-hailing apps were able to lure riders with artificially low prices because they were subsidized by an influx of cash by investors. The apps have made it easier for people to travel by the \u201cmost inefficient mode of transportation possible,\u201d she said.Andrew Salzberg, who oversees transportation policy and research for Uber, said about 33 percent of total Uber pickups started and ended in boroughs outside Manhattan.Other cities have struggled to regulate the growth of ride-hailing services. Uber left Austin, Tex., last year after losing a ballot measure over regulations, but that was an exception \u2014 ride-hailing apps operate in over 300 communities, and some cities are actually partnering with the services. In Summit, N.J., officials began a commuter program offering free or discounted Uber rides to a New Jersey Transit station instead of building more parking.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s been a symbiotic relationship between public transit and these tech-enabled services,\u201d said Darnell Grisby, director of policy for the association.But in New York, where fewer than half of residents have a car, people have long relied on public transit and yellow cabs, and many are using the apps to replace those transportation modes.For William Prince, 31, who lives in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, price is all that matters. He uses whichever app is offering the best promotion, especially when the subway is unreliable. The F and G trains have been \u201ckind of a nightmare\u201d recently, he said. \u201cUsually the cost benefit is it\u2019s worth the money to avoid the hassle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And on Friday, the investigators said that the remains of babies, small children and fetuses had been found where she said they would.From 1925 to 1961, the St. Mary\u2019s home was run by the Sisters of Bon Secours, a Roman Catholic order, but was financed by the Irish government. Tests showed that most of the remains were \u201clikely to date from the 1950s,\u201d according to the statement, which added that further examinations were being conducted.\u201cThis is very sad and disturbing news,\u201d Katherine Zappone, the minister for Children and Youth Affairs, said in a statement. \u201cIt was not unexpected as there were claims about human remains on the site over the last number of years. Up to now we had rumors.\u201dThe historian, Catherine Corless, said in an interview that she welcomed the commission\u2019s report but thought the deaths should have been investigated \u201cdecades earlier.\u201d\u201cNobody was listening locally or in authority, from the church or the state. They said, \u2018What\u2019s the point?\u2019 And that I shouldn\u2019t view the past from today\u2019s lenses.\u201dThe remains are of some of the 796 children who died at the home over more than three decades. According to death certificates that Ms. Corless hunted down, the causes included malnutrition, measles, tuberculosis, gastroenteritis and pneumonia.The commission that was established in 2015 to investigate allegations of abuse in the institutions, which are known in Ireland as mother and baby homes, said its inquiry in Tuam focused on two structures on the grounds of St. Mary\u2019s.The first of these structures appeared to be \u201ca large sewage containment system or septic tank that had been decommissioned and filled with rubble and debris and then covered with topsoil,\u201d while the second was \u201ca long structure which is divided into 20 chambers and appears to be related to the treatment/containment of sewage and/or waste water.\u201dIt was within this second structure that the commission reported that \u201csignificant quantities of human remains had been found in at least 17 of the 20 underground chambers.\u201dAccording to the statement, the remains included those of 35-week-old fetuses to children up to 3 years old.Further tests are now being conducted and the commission has asked that the relevant state authorities take responsibility for the \u201cappropriate treatment\u201d of the remains. A coroner had also been informed, the statement added.Although there is no official state religion in Ireland, the Catholic Church has long had a profound influence over the country\u2019s culture and government. Bearing a child outside of marriage was considered both sinful and shameful, and unmarried mothers and their children often suffered discrimination and abuse.Ms. Corless, who lives outside Tuam, went to school with children from the St. Mary\u2019s home and remembered how they were kept to one side of the classroom and had to arrive and leave at different times so there would be no interaction with children of parents who were married.She said the \u201chome babies,\u201d as they were known, looked vulnerable and malnourished to her. When her own children were more grown up, she began to look into conditions at the home, and learned of the 796 deaths. None of the bodies were buried in any of the local cemeteries.She also concluded that the children lived in substandard conditions. After the home finally closed, the buildings were demolished, and now a housing development sits adjacent to the site.In 2012, Ms. Corless published an article in a local history journal. The article concluded that some of the children had been buried in an unofficial graveyard in the back of the home. But after studying a map of the grounds, she thought that other bodies might have been interred in the sewage treatment facilities.A sewage tank had been replaced by a public water system in 1937, but she said there was sufficient evidence to show that some babies and small children had been buried there while it was still in operation.Ms. Corless wanted to erect a plaque with the names of all of the children who had died, and she helped up set a committee in 2013 to finance it. The committee was unable to raise enough money.She also approached journalists with her work. In 2014, Alison O\u2019Reilly, a reporter for the Irish edition of The Mail on Sunday, a London newspaper, wrote an article.She said on Friday that that had been difficult but that she had known she was right. \u201cI never made a statement unless I could back it with facts. I only presented the truth.\u201dOn Friday, the Bon Secours order issued a statement that promised its \u201ccontinued cooperation with and support for the work of the commission in seeking the truth about the home.\u201dThe order declined further comment.The commission has been examining allegations of abuse at 14 mother and baby homes, and four similar institutions between 1922 and 1998. But it has no power to award compensation or bring criminal charges.Ms. Corless added that it was important now that the investigation continued its work, and that \u201cit needs to go further inside.\u201dThe commission\u2019s announcement marked another development in a series of scandals involving church and state in Irish life.The director of Amnesty International Ireland, Colm O\u2019Gorman, who himself experienced clerical abuse, said it was time for the government to \u201cjoin the dots.\u201d\u201cThere is a direct line between the industrial schools, the mother and baby homes and the abuse committed and covered up by priests,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state never really accepted that it had accountability or responsibility when it came to their own citizens, so it outsourced all of that to the church.\u201dIn the interview on Friday, Ms. Corless said that Ms. Zappone, the minister for children, had telephoned her earlier in the day and thanked her for her work and perseverance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Willing to Blow the Whistle on Doping? New Legal Aid Group Wants to Help", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byLAUSANNE, Switzerland \u2014 Inspired by the Russian doping scandal, a new nonprofit foundation is offering financial and legal assistance to whistle-blowers with information about cheating in international sports.The foundation, Fair Sport, is working with the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports, and plans to help protect and advise people who have evidence that could inform the agency\u2019s investigations as well as related government investigations into bribery, corruption or drug trafficking.Whistle-blowers approved by Fair Sport\u2019s board of directors \u2014 which includes a venture capitalist, a former United States federal prosecutor and a four-time Olympic speedskating gold medalist from Norway \u2014 will be eligible for assistance with a range of services, including housing, criminal defense, immigration applications and psychological counseling.\u201cMost of the big cases of cheating have been revealed because of whistle-blowers,\u201d said Johann Koss, the speedskating medalist and a founder of Fair Sport. \u201cBut most of the people who\u2019ve come out and talked have been totally isolated afterward.\u201dDrawing on private donations and commitments from international law firms to provide their services without fees, the organization is seeking to minimize the risk whistle-blowers face in speaking out, emphasizing confidentiality while empowering people who are jeopardizing their livelihoods and possibly incriminating themselves.Fair Sport, registered as a nonprofit organization in both the United States and Britain, hopes to raise $3 million to $5 million this year, Mr. Koss said. A majority of the money will go toward whistle-blower expenses, he said, while some is expected to be used to vet candidates before the foundation agrees to help them.Fair Sport is completing an agreement with WADA, the antidoping regulator, under which each may refer witnesses to the other. The foundation does not plan to conduct investigations itself aside from initially assessing the credibility of those it might help, Mr. Koss said; it will instead hand information over to WADA or the proper authorities.The Stepanovs and Dr. Rodchenkov have left Russia and have lived in hiding in the United States, expressing concerns about their personal safety while relying on individual donations since leaving their jobs. They have been vilified in Russia, called traitors by government officials and the state news media.\u201cThey took risks with not only their lives but also financially, and it became clear there was really no support for whistle-blowers,\u201d said Bryan Fogel, a filmmaker who financed Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s move to Los Angeles in late 2015 and produced a documentary about the Russian doping scandal, \u201cIcarus,\u201d which was acquired by Netflix this year.Jim Swartz, an American venture capitalist and a founder of Impact Partners, which produced Mr. Fogel\u2019s film, conceived of Fair Sport after seeing the risk Dr. Rodchenkov had opened himself up to in speaking out about the orders the Russian sports ministry had given him to \u201cwin at any cost.\u201dMr. Swartz recruited a group of founders, including Edwin Stier, a former chief of the criminal division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in New Jersey; Louisa Watt, a partner at the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in London; and Mr. Koss, the Olympian, who is also a social entrepreneur and a physician who has worked with the International Olympic Committee.Though many of the principal players are from North America, Mr. Stier said the foundation planned to establish relationships with investigators and lawyers throughout the world, hoping to be poised to protect informants of any nationality.\u201cPeople who come forward are going to have a lot of baggage,\u201d Mr. Stier said. \u201cThey can be heroic figures who emerge from a dark past, but we\u2019ve got to be prepared to assess who they are and how accurate their information is, and then assure them they\u2019re protected.\u201dIn addition to its collaboration with WADA, Fair Sport is also pursuing agreements with national antidoping authorities and law enforcement agencies, Mr. Koss said, hoping to refer witnesses while also soliciting referrals of credible whistle-blowers in need of assistance.Last year, as the doping scandal mounted, WADA committed to building out its investigation team, from one person to six. Five of those jobs have been filled, WADA said. Heading up the regulator\u2019s new intelligence division is G\u00fcnter Younger, a former employee of the German criminal police and Interpol.\u201cClearly people are at great risk when they come forward,\u201d said Rep. Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce committee. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to do it if they think they\u2019re just going to get blown off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Chicago and Philadelphia, the Difference a Park Makes", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookCHICAGO \u2014 Despite the bitter wind, Kim Wasserman showed me around La Villita Park. Occupying 21 acres in the middle of this city\u2019s largest Mexican-American neighborhood, called Little Village, the park used to be a brownfield and illegal dump. Back then, the site leached toxins into hundreds of nearby basements. Sickened residents protested for years. The federal cleanup, finally completed in 2012, became the largest urban Superfund project in America.She pointed out where residents got the playground, ball fields, skate park and community gardens they wanted. The $19 million park now hosts city-sponsored sports programs and free concerts. During warm months, Ms. Wasserman said, formerly incarcerated young residents from Little Village help keep an eye on La Villita, discouraging gangs from moving in. \u201cThe community feels ownership of the place,\u201d she said.One result in this city known for its murder rate: next to no violent crime in the park, according to Ms. Wasserman.Chicago is at the forefront of a growing, big-city trend. It has been undertaking a major parks and open space program, upgrading neighborhood playgrounds and recreation centers, scooping up acres of disused land for new green areas and repurposing large swaths of formerly industrial waterfront. Aided by a longstanding tax that goes directly to parks, these efforts to improve public space, begun under the city\u2019s former mayor, Richard M. Daley, have gathered steam since Rahm Emanuel took office in 2011.They have met with some of the usual resistance from state authorities reluctant to finance city improvements and from some aldermen who want money now allocated for parks, trees and after-school programs redirected toward violence-prevention. The mayor has testily noted that after-school programs and parks, like La Villita, provide exactly the sort of safe spaces for young people that help reduce crime.From Philadelphia to Seattle, other American cities are also banking on parks and public spaces to drive social and economic progress. Parks may not seem particularly urgent compared with the latest gangland murder epidemic; but the effort in Chicago to improve and expand them has, neighborhood by neighborhood, delivered long-term rewards. A few downtown showpieces, like the urbane Riverwalk and glamorous Millennium Park, have reaped immense financial windfalls for the city. Barack Obama\u2019s presidential library in Jackson Park promises to become a major new attraction and help rejuvenate that part of the South Side.Other park projects are not making headlines but are making a difference. I caught up with Mayor Emanuel one afternoon at an arts and recreation center in Ellis Park in Bronzeville, one of the city\u2019s historic African-American neighborhoods. The center, on former Chicago Housing Authority land, is a sunny, brightly colored two-story building with big windows and a state-of-the-art indoor pool. It\u2019s linked with a network of related improvements to transit, public health and street life in Bronzeville. Like La Villita, it was among various long-percolating community-initiated dreams, realized only lately, thanks to a cocktail of financing the mayor helped mix.\u201cUrban policy often focuses too much just on housing,\u201d Mr. Emanuel told me, grateful to focus on what has become a central plank of his administration and not talk policing or murder rates. \u201cHousing alone doesn\u2019t make a neighborhood.\u201dThat\u2019s a view shared by Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia, who was swept into office last year on a platform committing hundreds of millions of dollars to fixing up some 400 dilapidated green spaces, ball fields, pools, libraries and recreation centers in underserved districts. Philadelphia has the highest poverty rate among the 10 most-populated cities in the United States. The plan focuses on the city\u2019s neediest areas.Hunting Park, in North Philadelphia, is an example. For years, it was a troubled place before its revitalization started in 2009. Since then, crime has plummeted 89 percent, probably not all thanks to improvements to the park, though Philadelphia authorities attribute declines in prostitution and drug dealing to families taking over the park.I spent an afternoon with the city\u2019s parks commissioner, Kathryn Ott Lovell, touring crumbling libraries and rec centers in North and West Philadelphia now scheduled for makeovers. Once great buildings, still bustling with children, they remain critical to their neighborhoods, barely held together today by bubble gum and underpaid, overworked custodians who are among the city\u2019s unsung heroes. Changing demographics, new technologies and evolving demands by residents on parks and libraries to be complex community hubs require that these places receive more than just a fresh lick of paint or sod.They need extensive rethinking. The William Penn Foundation in Philadelphia has pitched in an additional $100 million to help make all that happen, its biggest grant ever.\u201cWe want every Philadelphian to be able to walk to a place that says, \u2018You are worth it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lovell explained.Chicago is trying to send the same message. East of Little Village, in the Bridgeport neighborhood, Studio Gang, the highly regarded architecture firm, has designed an elegant new zinc-clad public boathouse, with clerestory windows and a jagged roofline (based on stop-action photographs of rowers, the architects say), providing a gateway from Bridgeport to the waterfront. Farther north, the 606, Chicago\u2019s version of the High Line, which opened in mid-2015, has turned a defunct rail corridor into a wildly popular pedestrian greenway.And to the south, near Lake Calumet, in an area of shuttered mills where Chicago approaches wilderness, Big Marsh has lately opened as a public bike park and nature preserve carved from nearly 200 acres. I drove to Big Marsh with Michael P. Kelly, the chief executive of the Chicago Park District, who envisioned it becoming \u201ca major new attraction\u201d for cyclists, then took me to a housing project called Altgeld Gardens Homes in far southeast Chicago.There, the city has installed playground equipment and spruced up parts of Altgeld Gardens\u2019 decrepit 1920\u2019s-era rec center, including an indoor swimming pool. At the center, Mr. Kelly introduced Brian Bradley, the park district\u2019s supervisor for Altgeld Gardens, a huge, quiet man who, in his spare time, teaches young residents how to box.\u201cThis is a community that fights hard,\u201d Mr. Bradley told me. We were standing beside the heated pool, a magnet for older residents and children, with a view onto the playground. \u201cPlaces like this are where everybody comes together,\u201d he said.Mr. Bradley recalled growing up in a different neighborhood, whose park and rec center became his salvation and second home. He paused.Tears suddenly welled in his eyes, and he apologized. The Altgeld Gardens rec center still needed repairs. But the park district\u2019s improvements so far have sent a message: \u201cGrowing up in a place like this you can feel nobody cares,\u201d he said.\u201cThese changes tell people they\u2019re not forgotten.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Troubling Appeal of Education at For-Profit Schools", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the revelatory \u201cLower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy,\u201d the sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom introduces us to London, a 48-year-old widow and single mother of three children. London lives in rural North Carolina, and has watched as decent working-class jobs in the textile industry disappeared from her region. She hopes to land an office job with benefits, and knows she needs additional training. But she fears she would be turned away from the oversubscribed local community college because of her lack of academic preparation.So London has gone deep into debt enrolling in five for-profit college programs, only one of which she has completed. At various times she trained to be a child care provider, a medical biller, a computer technician and, most recently, a medical assistant. Cottom asked London what she would do if she could not find the middle-class health care administration job she desired \u2014 a type of position that often requires training in a medical specialty like cardiology. London\u2019s program at a branch of for-profit Everest College does not provide such specialized training. She smiled and told Cottom, \u201cJesus is my backup plan.\u201dSome two million Americans are enrolled in for-profit colleges, up from 400,000 in 2000. Those students, most of them working adults getting short-term certificates, are disproportionately nonwhite and female. They graduate with more debt than students who have attended public and nonprofit institutions, and are more likely to default on their loans. It is taxpayers who are financing the expensive and often academically inferior education that for-profit colleges provide. Ninety-four percent of for-profit students pay tuition with federal student loans.The Obama administration worked doggedly to regulate this sector. Its \u201cgainful employment\u201d rule led to the collapse of hundreds of for-profit colleges whose graduates performed poorly on the job market. In response, the industry complained that it was being punished for attempting to educate so-called low-status students: single mothers on welfare, high school dropouts with G.E.D.s and graduates of underperforming public schools who lack basic math and reading skills. Now for-profit colleges may find an ally in President Donald Trump, founder of Trump University. The incoming Department of Education could easily overturn Obama\u2019s regulations.There are other books, like \u201cDegrees of Inequality,\u201d by the political scientist Suzanne Mettler, that better explain the lobbying and legislating that empowered this industry and allowed it to expand far beyond its humble roots as a provider of certificates in fields like hairdressing and auto mechanics. But Cottom has written the best book yet on the complex lives and choices of for-profit students, who, she shows, are often quite savvy about the trade-off they\u2019re making by attending a low-prestige, high-cost institution. Unlike many traditional colleges, for-profits seek to accommodate the needs of busy working parents like London. Enrollment officers are available by phone and in person virtually around the clock. Classes begin throughout the year and meet at night.Part of Cottom\u2019s wisdom comes from personal experience. Before she earned her Ph.D., she worked for two for-profit colleges. Some of the most disturbing parts of \u201cLower Ed\u201d concern her training to become an enrollment officer at a technical school, where she was taught how to \u201cclose\u201d students, meaning sign them up at any cost. Officers were encouraged to isolate potential students from loved ones, like parents, who might urge caution before taking on debt. They presented recruits with misleading data on the number of jobs available in fields like cosmetology or tech support.Cottom also conducted fascinating field research. She interviewed for-profit college executives and over 100 students who enrolled in degree programs. She argues persuasively that the growth of the for-profit sector is a rational response to a service economy in which there are fewer living-wage jobs, and employers invest less and less in training their work forces. Panicked workers, having absorbed America\u2019s \u201ceducational gospel,\u201d believe the only way to ascend into the middle class is to engage in \u201ccredentialing,\u201d returning again and again to school in an often fruitless quest to find stable work.What these students really need, Cottom believes, are public supports like affordable child care. She writes, \u201cgiven the character of the new economy, one that by definition is risky and highly variable,\u201d for millions of people there simply isn\u2019t a good educational choice to be made. Even President Obama\u2019s efforts to rein in the industry amounted to little more than regulatory theater, she argues. \u201cWhat is interesting to me is how much disdain is spread among students and schools and how little disdain there is for labor markets.\u201d With great compassion and analytical rigor, Cottom questions the fundamental narrative of American education policy: that a postsecondary degree always guarantees a better life.Dana Goldstein, a national correspondent for The Times, is the author of \u201cThe Teacher Wars: A History of America\u2019s Most Embattled Profession.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Liberian Women Delivered Africa\u2019s First Female President", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byMONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 Bernice Freeman was chatting with some market women, trying to explain why it was so important that they leave their food stalls to vote for the first woman to be elected president of an African country, when she noticed some boys laughing nearby, waving something white.It was October 2005, the first presidential election after 15 years of a hideous civil war in Liberia. On the ballot was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Harvard-educated global technocrat with so much government experience it practically oozed from her pores, and a group of men, most notably the professional soccer player George Weah.Like many of the 1.5 million women in Liberia who had survived the civil war, Ms. Freeman had personally witnessed acts of violence so brutal she still had nightmares. Soldiers had gutted her 8\u00bd-months-pregnant cousin. Drugged-up rebels wearing Halloween masks had murdered her friends. Ms. Freeman herself had knelt in the dirt, praying, while henchmen loyal to the president had chambered rounds of their machine guns on orders to shoot her and the other women praying with her one afternoon.Ms. Freeman had seen it all. But even so, she was unprepared for the sight of the young men laughing nearby as she campaigned for a female president. The boys had taken women\u2019s panties, had smeared the crotches with tomato paste and were waving them at the women \u2014 their unsubtle way of saying that a woman could not be president.But instead of making Ms. Freeman and the other women embarrassed, the heckling only angered them.\u201cYou know what?\u201d one of the undecided women told Ms. Freeman, looking at the boys in disgust. \u201cWe will vote. Don\u2019t worry, we will vote.\u201dAnd vote they did. Close to 80 percent of the Liberian women who flooded the polls during the country\u2019s first postwar presidential election voted to usher a woman into power for the first time on a continent that for centuries had been the world\u2019s most patriarchal.Eleven years before Pantsuit Nation became a secret Facebook group for women who supported Hillary Clinton in America and \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d buttons and bumper stickers sprouted on lapels and S.U.V.s, the women of Liberia held a master class in how to get a woman elected president. Now, as the American women who supported Mrs. Clinton grapple with the whys of last November\u2019s election, the story of how, 4,500 miles away, the women of Liberia upended centuries of male rule to accomplish what their American counterparts could not has acquired a sharp and keen relevance.The Liberia story is one of extremes. It is almost as if for Liberians to contemplate installing a woman as president, the country needed to first go over a cliff so steep that there seemed nowhere left to drop. Mothers saw their children kidnapped, drugged and forced to take up arms in the country\u2019s never-ending civil war. More than 70 percent of Liberian women were raped during the war years. Starving young girls gnawed on tree bark for sustenance, while horrified children were forced to watch their sisters, mothers and grandmothers gang-raped in front of them.What happened in the war years so devastated Liberian women, who blamed the men who waged the war for the ensuing horrors, that many of them came to view Mrs. Sirleaf not necessarily as the better of the presidential candidates but, rather, as the only alternative to putting a man back in power in a place that men had just run into the ground.Masawa Jabateh, who had seen her 3-year-old daughter die from malnourishment during the war, said her despair became infused with a blind fury when she saw men campaigning to be president in 2005, especially since the leading candidate was Mr. Weah. \u201cThose men want put some grona boy in the chair who don\u2019t know what we doing? So we can go back to war again? No,\u201d she said.Her thought process was straightforward: She was \u201cvoting for woman,\u201d she said.\u201cVote for Woman,\u201d in 2005, became the de facto campaign slogan of Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s run for the presidency. It all started on the morning of May 2, 2005, a week into the voter registration period for the looming presidential elections, when Vabah Gayflor, the minister for gender, woke up to discover that women had not been registering to vote.A string of men were tossing their hats into the ring for the presidency, including Mr. Weah, a renowned athlete who had won the Ballon d\u2019Or and been named FIFA world player of the year and African player of the century.Unlike his rivals, Mr. Weah was not tainted by any association with those who had brought Liberia to ruin over the past 15 years, but he had no college education. (His listing of a bachelor\u2019s degree in sports management from Parkwood University in London was a subject of a scandal after news accounts surfaced calling the school an unaccredited diploma mill requiring no actual study.)At the other end of the spectrum was Mrs. Sirleaf. A former finance minister and jailed dissident, she had a pedigree that included the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. She had transformed herself from an abused wife, cowering and hunched in the front seat of her husband\u2019s car while he slapped her, to an international bureaucrat attempting what no woman had ever done before: winning, by popular vote, the right to lead an African country.To the Weah supporters, there was no contest. Grandmother versus soccer star? But to women like Ms. Gayflor, Ms. Jabateh and Ms. Freeman, there was also no contest. \u201cYou will take our country, our baby, and throw the baby away to football player? I beg you, no,\u201d Ms. Gayflor said.Ms. Gayflor\u2019s job as gender minister was supposed to be about helping women and children get access to health care, school feeding programs (in a postwar country with hardly any schools) and rape support.But she decided to redefine her role: getting a woman elected president. And she was not happy with the news from the National Elections Commission: Of the 100,000 Liberians who had registered to vote in the first week of the monthlong registration drive, only 15 percent were women.Who was registering instead? Former combatants, from all the armed groups that had fought in the war. Ms. Gayflor was appalled.Huddling with Etweda Cooper, the women\u2019s activist known throughout Liberia as \u201cSugars,\u201d Ms. Gayflor knew they had to take action fast.The men were holding mass rallies. But market women didn\u2019t have time to go to mass rallies. They were busy making market. Ms. Gayflor and Mrs. Cooper realized they would have to try a different strategy.Quickly they organized a group to use the radio stations to plead: \u201cWomen, oh women! Y\u2019all got to register to vote.\u201d They fanned out to the Monrovia markets.At first, some of the market women balked; they had their wares and their babies to tend. But Mrs. Cooper was ready for them with babysitters and stall tenders. \u201cWe will mind it for you,\u201d she said. \u201cGo register.\u201dIt was not enough to stay in Monrovia. The Liberian bush loomed, large, imposing and filled with village women. The women bought bullhorns and scattered their troops along the road. \u201cWomen, oh women!\u201d they yelled into the bullhorns. \u201cGo register.\u201dBy the end of the registration period, the final figures came out: Some 1.5 million Liberians out of the country\u2019s population of three million had registered to vote.Fifty-one percent of those registered were women.Unlike American presidential campaigns, the Liberian campaign season begins two months before Election Day. Liberian election rules dictate that a winning candidate has to get 50 percent of the vote \u2014 a quirk that guaranteed that in a crowded field of 22 candidates, there would be a runoff. So the key for Mrs. Sirleaf was to survive the first round by coming in second at least, so that she would then stand alone against Mr. Weah.As a government minister, Ms. Gayflor was not allowed to show favoritism for any candidate, let alone campaign on one\u2019s behalf. So she and Mrs. Cooper devised a strategy: They would present their efforts as simply an attempt to empower women. Ms. Gayflor would not sully her cabinet position by telling women whom to support. (She left that to Mrs. Cooper.) Instead, she would simply encourage women to exercise their right. She organized women\u2019s rallies where she gave speeches exhorting the crowd to vote.\u201cI\u2019m not telling you who to vote for, women!\u201d she said. \u201cJust make sure you vote.\u201dRight after Ms. Gayflor spoke, Mrs. Cooper \u2014 not constrained by any neutrality vows \u2014 shouted at the crowd, \u201cVote for woman!\u201dEverywhere, the women\u2019s rallies followed the same script:Ms. Gayflor: \u201cWomen, oh women! If y\u2019all got to tie your baby on your back soon in the morning, I beg y\u2019all, go vote!\u201dMrs. Cooper: \u201cVote for woman!\u201dMs. Gayflor: \u201cEven self your baby got poo-poo diapers, put it down, go vote!\u201dMrs. Cooper: \u201cVote for woman!At the rallies, the women passed out plastic bags of drinking water, a rare and precious commodity in a place where people regularly drank from unsanitary wells and dirty rivers.The rainy season was ending, but the air was still stewy when Election Day dawned. Of the 1.5 million people registered to vote, some 900,000 showed up at the polls. They came in wheelbarrows and wheelchairs. They came with babies on their backs. They came the night before, some sleeping on the hard ground outside the polling booths so they could vote when morning came.The results began to trickle in that night. As expected, Mr. Weah was in first place. But he wasn\u2019t close to 50 percent. And Mrs. Sirleaf was right behind him, where she needed to be.Time for the real battle. The soccer player versus the 67-year-old grandmother.The men fell in line behind Mr. Weah and complained that the women supporting Mrs. Sirleaf were sexist. Given the choice between a soccer player with no credible college education and a Harvard-educated development expert, the top male presidential candidates who fell short of the runoff, with one exception, endorsed the soccer player.In the meantime, Mr. Weah, honing a message explaining why he, and not Mrs. Sirleaf, should run Liberia, settled on an \u201ceducated people failed\u201d theme.But what the men who endorsed that strategy failed to realize was how much that very idea was angering the market women. Those women may not have been educated themselves, but they worked in the fields and the market stalls to send their children to school. Now the men were telling them that education wasn\u2019t important. Just as the men fell in behind Mr. Weah, the women fell in behind Mrs. Sirleaf.The market women went door to door, passing out T-shirts and fliers. They slept on the side of the road at night, curled up on their mats. They walked from village to village, calling out the now familiar mantra \u201cVote for woman!\u201dMr. Weah\u2019s supporters responded by promising that if he lost, the country would go back to war. \u201cNo Weah, no peace!\u201d they chanted.Thus the runoff started resembling past elections, like the one in 1985, in which Samuel Doe\u2019s supporters had suggested the same thing: Vote for Mr. Doe or the country goes back to war.Except that in November 2005, this tactic appeared to have met its match. Because the women had their own tricks, tricks that would make Mr. Weah\u2019s threats look like boys\u2019 play.\u201cYou want beer? Just give me your voter ID card; I will buy you beer.\u201d\u201cI say, we buying voter ID cards, oh. Ten Liberty dollars for one.\u201d\u201cWho looking for money? Just bring your voter ID card.\u201dA group of women had stationed themselves at a bar near a major intersection, luring young men in a time-honored fashion. Except this time the women were the ones with the cash, and the young men were the ones with the commodity for sale.\u201cSome of those boys were finish stupid,\u201d a market woman, Nancy Nagbe, recalled with a smirk. \u201cWe were crafty, oh!\u201dMany of the young men thought they were done with voting after the first round and didn\u2019t understand that they would need their IDs again. Others knew and did not care; late in the evening of a muggy hot day, the lure of a crisp, cold and malty Club Beer far outshone whatever benefits they thought their voter card could bring them.As for the ones who were too smart to sell their voter card \u2014 their mothers simply stole them, recalled one gender ministry official, Parleh Harris.One market woman said she sneaked into her son\u2019s room while he was sleeping, slipped his voter ID out of his wallet and buried it in the yard.\u201cYeah, I took it. And so what?\u201d the woman said. \u201cThat foolish boy, what he knew? I carried him for nine months. I took care of him. I fed him when he was hungry. Then he will take people country and give it away?\u201dMs. Gayflor, by now, was sailing perilously close to getting fired for illegally campaigning as a government minister. A few days before the runoff, she called a meeting in a room at the gender ministry. She invited every female political candidate, no matter what party she belonged to, along with market women, female lawyers and anyone else she could think of who lacked a Y chromosome.That night, in the stuffy room, the women all stood, one by one, and pledged to support Mrs. Sirleaf, who was so overcome afterward she could barely stand upright. \u201cIf I were a crying woman,\u201d she said, \u201cI would be crying right now. You have humbled me.\u201dThe repercussions came the next day. Ms. Gayflor arrived at work to find reporters camped out on the ministry\u2019s steps. The questions came furiously.Ms. Gayflor was past the point of backing down. \u201cYou take a former football player and give him our country?\u201d she shot back. \u201cLiberia is not a learning ground!\u201dShe had one last shot to fire. \u201cLet me give you a goodbye statement,\u201d the soon-to-be-former minister said. \u201cMrs. Sirleaf will be the next president of this country.\u201dOn Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2005, the people of Liberia went to the polls for the second time in four weeks. There was a palpable sense in the air that something big was happening. International observers stationed themselves at polling places and voting booths; some 230 agencies, from the Carter Center to the European Union, showed up to chronicle the proceedings. Helicopters from the United Nations mission hovered overhead, a constant presence above the voting booth lines.But the helicopters could not see what was going on at a polling station in Sinkor. Helpful poll workers were allowing pregnant women and nursing mothers to cut to the front of the line. So Ms. Freeman \u2014 who had been heckled weeks before by the young men waving white panties smeared with tomato paste \u2014 and a handful of other women were passing around babies and toddlers.\u201cYou want borrow the baby?\u201d Ms. Freeman grinned at one woman, sneaking a furtive look over her shoulder. \u201cPut the baby on your back.\u201d To another woman, she advised: \u201cAct pregnant. If they think you pregnant you can vote in front.\u201dIt was unclear whether the poll workers noticed how many different women were carrying the same baby to vote on that Election Day in November 2005.And when the National Elections Commission, on Nov. 23, announced the election results \u2014 Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s 59.4 percent to Mr. Weah\u2019s 40.6 percent \u2014 Ms. Freeman wore a smile on her face.Helene Cooper, the Pentagon correspondent for The New York Times, grew up in Liberia before emigrating to the United States in 1980. This article is adapted from her forthcoming book, \u201cMadame President: The Extraordinary Journey of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,\u201d to be published on Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Boom in Rock Climbing, Minus the Rocks", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurship\u201cRight foot. You\u2019ve got to put your right foot on the pink hold.\u201d So a young woman coached a friend who was trying to scale a 30-foot wall at the Brooklyn Boulders outpost in Long Island City, Queens, on a recent Saturday morning.\u201cThere you go, guy,\u201d called another member of the group. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there. You got it, bro.\u201dWell, not quite. Bro lost his footing, dropped to a padded surface, grinned ruefully and prepared to try again. Elsewhere in the 25,000-square-foot space, a father watched his son and daughter clamber partway up a 19-foot wall, and a fitness instructor led a class that was heavy on push-ups.Once a niche sport, indoor rock climbing is becoming more and more mainstream, thanks in part to facilities like Brooklyn Boulders, which also has gyms in Brooklyn, Chicago and Somerville, Mass. Plans for other locations are on the drawing board, the company\u2019s president, Lance Pinn, said.But the 16 percent growth that Climbing Business Journal anticipated in 2016 was overly optimistic; expansion did not quite hit 7 percent. Would-be owners have a tough climb of their own: finding and financing real estate with the right dimensions, never mind the high cost of building a wall (no, not that kind of wall).Another challenge: How do you get people to sign up for an activity that many view as difficult, if not downright dangerous? And what\u2019s with all the lingo \u2014 lead climbing? Belaying?On that Saturday at Brooklyn Boulders, a staff member gave an orientation tour to half a dozen first-timers, most of them millennials. She pointed out the cardio room, the yoga studio, the co-working spaces and the walls pocked with molded-plastic grips in many shapes and colors.And she discussed the various means of ascent with and without ropes and harnesses: bouldering (climbing without ropes); top-roping (ascending a wall with a rope anchored above); lead-climbing (ropes and harness, but no anchor above); and belaying (helping the lead climber by means of rope). There is also chimney climbing (think Jackie Chan).Mr. Pinn and two former classmates from Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., were inspired to establish a rock-climbing gym in New York City in 2008 when they were put off by the high costs and limited options around town.\u201cWe started a Facebook page called \u2018New York Needs a Rock-Climbing Gym,\u2019 and we got 300 friends overnight,\u201d Mr. Pinn, 32, said. \u201cThis told us there was a lot of interest in climbing.\u201dHe said he and his partners \u201cdid the math, and thought we could build a 6,000-square-foot facility for bouldering and a little bit of top-rope climbing for 300 members.\u201dThey ended up opening for business in 2009 in a garage in Brooklyn formerly owned by The Daily News. It had a pop-up roof (ideal for their purposes) and 18,000 square feet of space. Success came quickly, as did the decision to expand the gym\u2019s offerings to include yoga, Pilates, fitness classes and exercise machines. A day pass is $32; a monthly membership is $135.Brooklyn Boulders has an average of 1,000 visitors a day in each of its locations, and \u201c90 percent of people will interact with the wall while they\u2019re here,\u201d Mr. Pinn said.But building one is an enormous undertaking. Thomas Betterton, 33, the majority owner of the Denver Bouldering Club, recalled the reluctance of landlords when, in 2009, he opened the first of his two locations.\u201cIt was hard to get anyone to take us on as tenants, because they didn\u2019t know what a bouldering business was,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd trying to get a small business loan was an uphill battle, because this is a nontraditional business.\u201dIt is an expensive one, too. \u201cYou\u2019re talking millions of dollars for the walls \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of engineering,\u201d said Kevin Goradia, 26, the owner of Crux Climbing Center, a nine-month-old, 22,000-square-foot gym in Austin, Tex.\u201cYou need a lot of space, and you have to find a place where you will be allowed to construct a tall building,\u201d Mr. Goradia continued. \u201cMost small-business owners don\u2019t have the ability to fork out that kind of money.\u201dHe funded Crux himself, thanks to a stake in his family\u2019s petrochemical business. The center offers three climbing \u201cproducts\u201d: bouldering, top-roping and auto-belay. A bar and a sauna are in the works.Mr. Pinn has backing from the private equity firm North Castle Partners. \u201cWhen we were raising money for the first two facilities, we would hear: \u2018Climbing is a fad. It\u2019s going to go out of style,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut climbing facilities have been a constant in the U.S. since 1987, and maybe before that.\u201dThe steep upfront costs persuaded Bradley Speaks and Blake Maddux, both 31-year-old climbers and entrepreneurs in Louisville, Ky., to think small. Their company, Elemental Climbing, which opened in July, has a mobile sport-climbing wall that can be rented.That wall, which is 26 feet high and can accommodate four climbers at a time, has been deployed for events sponsored by the local government and by Boys and Girls Clubs, as well as for team-building activities at high schools.\u201cThe interest people have had in our business has shown us there\u2019s a market,\u201d Mr. Speaks said. \u201cBut brick-and-mortar isn\u2019t an imminent move for us.\u201dOwners of rock-climbing facilities are selling a lifestyle as much as a physical challenge, a community as much as a gym, social climbing as much as rock climbing.\u201cPeople come for the climbing, but also to be with friends,\u201d said Taki Miyamoto, 39, an owner and the general manager of Salt Pump Climbing in Southern Maine. \u201cYou can only climb so much, so the atmosphere is important.\u201d His 10,000-square-foot gym, which opened in 2015, has exercise and yoga classes and a cafe.But do not count Ms. Lee out. \u201cA shattered fibula (I still have a metal rod and two screws in my leg a year later) certainly won\u2019t keep me away for the long haul,\u201d she said in an email.Climbing facilities do not want to dismiss the hazards, nor do they want to make the sport seem like the province solely of the young and the restless. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to explain that this is something anyone can do,\u201d Mr. Miyamoto said.The Denver Bouldering Club may have an easier sell than most. Bouldering \u2014 its sole climbing option \u2014 involves neither ropes nor harnesses.\u201cThere\u2019s a lower barrier of entry with bouldering,\u201d Mr. Betterton said. \u201cWith rope climbing, there\u2019s more equipment, and there\u2019s safety information and instruction just to get started.\u201dThe fitness classes, the yoga rooms and the saunas at Brooklyn Boulders and Salt Pump Climbing are safe havens for the acrophobic. They are also a way for climbing gyms to hedge their bets.\u201cThe older generation of owners just had climbing walls,\u201d said Mr. Goradia of Crux Climbing Center. \u201cThe newer generation is saying, \u2018We have to add more amenities to bring people in.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner Still Benefiting From Business Empire, Filings Show", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, will remain the beneficiaries of a sprawling real estate and investment business still worth as much as $740 million, despite their new government responsibilities, according to ethics filings released by the White House Friday night.Ms. Trump will also maintain a stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The hotel, just down the street from the White House, has drawn protests from ethics experts who worry that foreign governments or special interests could stay there in order to curry favor with the administration.It is unclear how Ms. Trump would earn income from that stake. Mr. Kushner\u2019s financial disclosures said that Ms. Trump earned between $1 million and $5 million from the hotel between January 2016 and March 2017, and put the value of her stake at between $5 million and $25 million.The disclosures were part of a broad, Friday-night document release by the White House that exposed the assets of as many as 180 senior officials to public scrutiny. The reports showed the assets and wealth of senior staff members at the time they entered government service.Those disclosures included the assets of Gary D. Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs who now leads the National Economic Council, Kellyanne Conway, the pollster and counsel to Mr. Trump and Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist to the president.Mr. Bannon\u2019s most valuable asset was Bannon Strategic Advisors Inc., a privately held consulting firm into which income from his other investments appeared to flow. It was valued at between $5 million and $25 million. He also held bank accounts valued at up to $2.25 million, and rental real estate worth as much as $10.5 million.Ms. Conway earned at least $842,614 last year, and perhaps slightly more, the filings show. Her assets are valued at between $11 million and at least $44.2 million.Mr. Cohn is far wealthier, with assets valued between $253 million and $611 million, and income last year as high as $77 million. Another White House official, Reed Cordish, who heads up technology initiatives, accumulated assets as a Maryland developer valued as high as $424 million.\u201cI think one of the really interesting things that people are going to see today \u2014 and I think it\u2019s something that should be celebrated \u2014 is that the president has brought a lot of people into this administration, and this White House in particular, who have been very blessed and very successful,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. The officials \u201chave given up a lot to come into government by setting aside a lot of assets,\u201d he said.Until January, Mr. Kushner was the chief executive of Kushner Companies, a family-run real estate investment firm with holdings across the country. It is a growing business that has taken part in at least $7 billion of acquisitions over the past decade.Late Friday, the White House released details of the plan devised by his advisers to avoid conflicts of interest between Mr. Kushner\u2019s government role and the wide-ranging business empire he ran with his father. That business depends on foreign investment from undisclosed sources, as well as billions of dollars in loans from the world\u2019s biggest financial services firms.Although Mr. Kushner has stepped down from his management positions at the more than 200 entities that operated aspects of the family real estate business, he will remain a beneficiary of a vast majority of the business he ran for the past decade, through a series of trusts that already owned the various real estate companies.The plan laid out on Friday \u201cis not sufficient,\u201d said Larry Noble, a former general counsel and chief ethics officer for the Federal Election Commission. \u201cWhile removing himself from the management of the businesses is an important step, he is still financially benefiting from how the businesses do. This presents potential for a conflict of interest. Given his level in the White House and broad portfolio, it\u2019s hard to see how he will recuse himself from everything that may impact his financial interest.\u201dWhile the filing discloses Mr. Kushner\u2019s personal lenders, it does not provide information on his business partners or lenders to his projects.His real estate firm has borrowed money from the likes of Goldman Sachs, the Blackstone Group, Deutsche Bank and the French bank Natixis. It also received loans from Israel\u2019s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim, which is the subject of a United States Justice Department investigation into allegations that it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes using undeclared accounts.Mr. Kushner\u2019s company and the firm, Anbang Insurance Group, agreed to end the talks on Wednesday after weeks of negative publicity about the deal, criticized as a bailout of the Kushners. The building had already been rescued by a number of prominent firms, including the private equity giant Carlyle Group, and Zara, the Spanish fashion retailer founded and owned by Amancio Ortega, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men.Mr. Kushner has divested his stakes in any businesses connected to that property.The disclosures do not reveal the names of investors and lenders to ventures that Mr. Kushner is retaining a stake in. For example, the form shows Mr. Kushner is retaining a stake in a limited liability corporation that owns a Trump-branded luxury rental high-rise building in Jersey City worth as much as $5 million. That project was financed with tens of millions of dollars from wealthy Chinese investors through a controversial visa-for-sale program called EB-5.However, the filing does not disclose the names of any of those investors \u2014 or partners in any of his other projects.\u201cWe don\u2019t know who the business partners are in many of these investments,\u201d Mr. Noble said, \u201cand those business partners may also have interests that will be affected by how he advises the government. And that\u2019s a concern.\u201d\u201cHe could have foreign business partners who have a real interest in policy, and he may be advising the president on those policies,\u201d Mr. Noble added. \u201cThis is a dark area where we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201dIn all, the Kushner company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.Previous disclosures by the United States Office of Government Ethics showed that Mr. Kushner had divested his interests in several entities, mostly partnerships connected to a venture capital firm run by his brother, Joshua, called Thrive Capital, that invests in technology firms like Instagram.He also shed his interests in funds run by the private equity giant Blackstone Group \u2014 whose chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, is an economic adviser to Mr. Trump \u2014 as well as BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager.Over all, he has shed his stakes in 58 businesses.He is still the sole primary beneficiary of a majority of the trusts that will retain assets, with his children as the secondary beneficiaries.Mr. Kushner was required to submit some limited financial information for his wife, Ms. Trump, who will continue to receive payments from the Trump Organization as well as her fashion brand.Ms. Trump, who now serves as an assistant to the president, resigned from her leadership roles at both companies. Instead of performance-based payments, Ms. Trump will receive fixed payments from T International Realty, the family\u2019s luxury brokerage agency, as well as fixed fees from two entities related to real estate projects, the documents show.The disclosure forms released Friday for less senior White House staff members were not reviewed by the federal Office of Government Ethics. Only the White House Counsel\u2019s Office examines their assets to determine if there are potential conflicts, and to decide what steps employees must take to sell assets, resign positions or recuse themselves from decisions.Already, a complaint has been filed against at least one White House staff member for taking actions that might benefit his own financial interests. Christopher P. Liddell, an assistant to the president and the director of strategic initiatives, had been the chief financial officer of companies including Microsoft, International Paper and General Motors before taking his White House job. Until recently, he also owned stock in General Motors, according to disclosure forms, among more than 750 other companies.\u201cIt is Ethics 101 \u2014 the most basic thing you are not supposed to do: using your official capacity to benefit your financial interest,\u201d said Norman Eisen, who served as a White House ethics lawyer during the Obama administration and now is a co-chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.The White House did not respond Friday when asked about the complaint.Rachel Abrams, Sarah Cohen, Jeremy Bowers, Andrew Lehren, Steve Eder and Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DeVos and Tax Credit Vouchers: Arizona Shows What Can Go Wrong", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported bySchool ChoiceSteve Yarbrough is one of the most powerful men in Arizona. As president of the State Senate, he has promoted a range of conservative policies, including a tuition tax credit system that provides over $100 million per year to finance vouchers for private schools.In his speech to Congress this week, President Trump singled out a young woman who attended private school using a tax credit-financed voucher. The president urged Congress to pass legislation that would provide similar benefits to millions of students.But Mr. Yarbrough is not just a champion of tax credit vouchers. He also profits from them personally. The story of how that happened raises questions about President Trump\u2019s campaign promise to spend $20 billion to increase school choice. There\u2019s a strong chance that he\u2019ll do that through tax credit vouchers \u2014 a mechanism that Betsy DeVos actively campaigned for before she became Mr. Trump\u2019s education secretary.State tax credit voucher programs have grown rapidly in recent years. The number of students receiving them increased to 256,000 this year, from about 50,000 in 2005. Arizona has one of the oldest and largest programs. It allows taxpayers who donate money to nonprofit voucher-granting organizations to claim a 100 percent, dollar-for-dollar credit against their state taxes (up to a certain limit). In other words, if a married couple donates $1,000 to a voucher-granting nonprofit, their tax bill is reduced by $1,000. The nonprofit then gives the money to families who use it to pay tuition at private schools.Arizona law allows the group to keep 10 percent of those donations to pay for overhead. In 2014, the group used that money to pay its executive director $125,000. His name? Steve Yarbrough. Forms filed by the organization with the I.R.S. declare that he worked an average of 40 hours per week on the job \u2014 in addition, presumably, to the hours he worked as president of the State Senate.Yet the group doesn\u2019t do all the work involved with accepting donations and handing out vouchers. It outsources data entry, computer hardware, customer service, information processing, award notifications and related personnel expenses to a private for-profit company called HY Processing. The group paid HY Processing $636,000 in 2014, and millions of dollars in total over the last decade.Most voucher-granting nonprofits are not run by powerful legislators who pay themselves rent. While Arizona has over 50 loosely regulated voucher organizations, Florida disburses nearly 100,000 tax credit vouchers with just two. In Pennsylvania, private schools can accept tax credit donations and provide vouchers to themselves.But the fact that an influential politician can both promote and profit from tax credit vouchers shows what can happen when public funding for education is largely removed from public hands.Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers like tax credits, for several reasons. For some, spending $1,000 directly on a school voucher is government spending, while forgoing $1,000 in revenue to finance a $1,000 nonprofit voucher is a tax cut. Spending is often subject to strict budget limitations, while certain forms of tax credits can face less scrutiny.Tax credits for vouchers also allow states to circumvent so-called Blaine amendments, legal prohibitions against the direct disbursement of public funds to parochial schools that were added to many state constitutions in the 19th century during a wave of anti-Catholicism.But the shell-game process of moving money from the public treasury to a donor to a nonprofit to a family to a private school makes it very difficult to account for how well those public dollars are ultimately spent.Managing the transfers of all that money is also expensive. Arizona\u2019s 10 percent overhead provision is typical, which means that millions of dollars meant for education are being diverted to pay for, at best, pure bureaucracy. If President Trump makes good on his campaign promise of $20 billion for school vouchers by creating a national tax credit scheme, it could vastly increase the amount of bureaucratic waste.Some states, like Alabama and Indiana, limit tax credit vouchers to low- and middle-income families, or to students who were previously enrolled in public school. But others, including Arizona, do not, subsidizing private education for the well-off.If the Trump administration moves ahead with a $20 billion tax credit voucher plan, it will have to decide how \u2014 or whether \u2014 to address issues that have arisen with state tax credits.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letter Bomb Injures Worker at International Monetary Fund Office in Paris", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 A letter bomb exploded in the Paris offices of the International Monetary Fund on Thursday, lightly wounding one person and prompting the French authorities to announce an investigation of the incident as a possible terrorist attack.The explosion came one day after the German authorities in Berlin discovered a parcel bomb apparently sent by a Greek terrorist organization to the office of the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and there were indications that the Paris device also was sent from Greece.Although there were no fatalities, the episode at such a high-profile target in Paris renewed jitters in France, which remains under a state of emergency after terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and in Nice last year.Michel Cadot, the Paris police chief, told reporters at the scene that the explosion at the monetary fund occurred just before noon when a secretary, who has not been identified, opened an envelope addressed to the fund\u2019s representative in France.The explosion wounded the secretary, who suffered injuries to the face and eardrums, but two other people who were nearby were not hurt, Mr. Cadot said. The parcel, he said, contained what appeared to be a handmade \u201cpyrotechnical device,\u201d or a \u201cbig firecracker\u201d that caused only limited damage.A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said it was opening an investigation into the attack, specifically into attempted murder in relation to a terrorist undertaking, terrorist conspiracy and destruction with explosives in relation to a terrorist undertaking.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the monetary fund, said in a statement from Frankfurt that the organization was \u201cworking closely with the French authorities to investigate the incident and ensure the safety of our staff.\u201dThe attack occurred in western Paris, not far from the Arc de Triomphe and the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, one of the most famous streets in Paris.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Paris device, but a Greek terrorist cell claimed responsibility on Thursday for the parcel bomb addressed to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble that was discovered in Berlin the day before.That package contained a mixture of explosives that could have caused considerable damage and injury if anyone had opened it, the Berlin police said.The German police said that the homemade bomb included material used in the production of pyrotechnics, and the German news media confirmed that the package bore Greek stamps and was sent from Attica, in the Athens area.The package was marked as if it had been sent by Adonis Georgiadis, a prominent lawmaker and spokesman for the main Greek conservative opposition party, New Democracy. He is broadly perceived as backing some of the painful economic changes imposed on Greece by its international creditors \u2014 led by the monetary fund and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble.A spokesman for the Greek national police, Theodoros Chronopoulos, said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to link the blast at the monetary fund\u2019s Paris offices to the Greek terrorist group, which calls itself Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire.But the Greek minister for public order, Nikos Toskas, said on Greek television that the French authorities had found similarities between the Paris and Berlin parcel bombs. Mr. Toskas said the Paris device had also been found to have come from Greece, and that it, too, was marked as if it had been sent by a New Democracy politician \u2014 this time, Vassilis Kikilias, a party spokesman and Mr. Toskas\u2019s predecessor at the ministry.The militant group that claimed the Berlin attack has described itself as a nihilist guerrilla operation, and it has been designated as a terrorist organization by Europol, Europe\u2019s law enforcement agency, and by the United States Department of State.The group has claimed responsibility for sending parcel bombs to several European leaders since the beginning of Greece\u2019s economic crisis, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in 2010. It has condemned the austerity measures imposed on Greek society and pledged to fight \u201cthe system of power.\u201d In its statement on Thursday, it claimed that it would \u201ccontinue stronger.\u201d But it did not mention the Paris attack.Ms. Lagarde, in her statement, reaffirmed \u201cthe I.M.F.\u2019s resolve to continue our work in line with our mandate.\u201dThe Greek government is in the middle of negotiating terms of its third international bailout since 2010, this one valued at 86 billion euros, or about $92 billion.Greece\u2019s creditors have been pushing the government to pass further austerity measures in exchange for the release of funds that the government needs before July in order to avoid defaulting on its debt.Greece has been asking for additional debt relief in exchange for adopting further austerity measures, while the monetary fund and Germany have been at odds on whether such relief should be granted; the fund has advocated a more forgiving approach.He added that the authorities would track down the \u201cpersons responsible, and we will do it with tenacity, perseverance and until the end.\u201dThe police and firefighters were quick to arrive at the monetary fund\u2019s offices on Iena Avenue, which was temporarily closed to traffic while the authorities secured the area. People who had been working in the building waited outside a perimeter, unsure what to do next.\u201cThey told us to leave, and we left, and here we are learning about things,\u201d said Anneke Slob, a consultant visiting from the Netherlands to advise the International Finance Corporation, a sister agency to the monetary fund.She said her consulting team was in a meeting with employees of the finance corporation when they realized something was wrong, but there was \u201cno panic at all.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t stop our meeting,\u201d Ms. Slob said as she stood near luggage that the police had retrieved from the building.Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.

{"Headline": "Solar Experiment Lets Neighbors Trade Energy Among Themselves", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byBrooklyn is known the world over for things small-batch and local, like designer clogs, craft bourbon and artisanal sauerkraut.Now, it is trying to add electricity to the list.In a promising experiment in an affluent swath of the borough, dozens of solar-panel arrays spread across rowhouse rooftops are wired into a growing network. Called the Brooklyn Microgrid, the project is signing up residents and businesses to a virtual trading platform that will allow solar-energy producers to sell excess-electricity credits from their systems to buyers in the group, who may live as close as next door.The ability to complete secure transactions and create a business based on energy sharing would allow participants to bypass the electric company energy supply and ultimately build a microgrid with energy generation and storage components that could function on their own, even during broad power failures.\u201cCommunity members can work both individually and collectively to help meet demand in an efficient way,\u201d said Audrey Zibelman, who recently resigned as chairwoman of the New York State Public Service Commission, which regulates the state\u2019s utilities.\u201cIt takes a central procurer \u2014 in this case, historically, the utility \u2014 out of the mix,\u201d she continued, \u201cand really sets the market where they\u2019re not buying and selling to the utility but they\u2019re identifying each other\u2019s need and willingness to buy and sell.\u201dThe project is but one example of how rapidly spreading technologies like rooftop solar and blockchain are upending the traditional relationships between electric companies and consumers, putting ever more control in the hands of customers. Across the globe, upstart companies like LO3 Energy, which is designing the Brooklyn experiment with the industrial giant Siemens, are building digital networks that offer the promise of user-driven, decentralized energy systems that can work in tandem with the traditional large-scale grid or, especially in emerging economies, avoid the need for a grid at all.In Australia, where Ms. Zibelman will soon run the nation\u2019s energy markets, a company called Power Ledger announced the start of a residential electricity trading market based in blockchain last year at a housing development in Perth.And in Germany, Sonnen, a leading supplier of home batteries and smart energy products and services, has created a web of about 8,000 customers, both with and without solar on their roofs, who are trading their stored energy among one another.\u201cPeer-to-peer is slowly but surely becoming a reality,\u201d said Olaf Lohr, Sonnen\u2019s head of United States business development. \u201cThis really is a very disruptive technology. The customers are also the owners \u2014 they are the producers of the energy. There is no centralized feed-in from one big power plant.\u201dThe ideal power system, said Richard L. Kauffman, who as the governor\u2019s chairman of energy and finance is leading that effort, is one that combines large power plants and transmission lines with clusters of smaller-scale producer-consumers, \u201cwhere electrons can flow in more than one direction and supply and demand of electricity is dynamic \u2014 and that\u2019s different than the grid is today.\u201dPeer-to-peer power sharing is consistent with that vision, he said, though a number of regulatory changes are necessary for it to take off.The State Public Service Commission has already taken a few of them, including last week approving new ways to determine pricing for electricity from renewable energy projects that more accurately reflect the value to the grid based on geographic location, timing and other factors yet to be determined. But Lawrence Orsini, LO3\u2019s chief executive, said the state still needed to determine how to define his company and its network of participants before it could get its market up and running, a move he anticipates by June.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing technically infeasible about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order for transactive energy to take off as a whole, regulators have to be comfortable that markets can actually work this way and, more importantly, that people want markets like this.\u201dOver the past year, LO3 has been working to find those people, using Google Earth to identify homes with rooftop solar installations and then knocking on doors to enlist participants, with some success throughout Park Slope and Gowanus.On a block of President Street last year, the company carried out two sales of green electricity credits generated by one homeowner\u2019s solar system to a neighbor across the street \u2014 tiny transactions, but important in proving the concept\u2019s viability.Those sales involved test versions of renewable-energy credits \u2014 numbered certificates that are used to track electricity exported from a renewable system to the grid. Utilities, corporations and other customers can buy the credits to claim green energy use.In the Brooklyn case, LO3 used the credit sales, conducted over PayPal, to test its approach; it cannot legally buy and sell electricity until regulators determine its market status. Once that occurs, Mr. Orsini said, the company will be able to facilitate the trading of energy among its participants \u2014 though they would still pay the utility, Con Edison, for infrastructure fees and services, as customers now do when they choose to use a green energy supplier through the utility.Mr. Orsini\u2019s team is busy collecting data from meters installed in prosumer homes, measuring production, use and export of the solar electricity to help model the market. They are also testing a smartphone app that customers will be able to use to manage their electricity purchases, setting parameters to control the source \u2014 selecting from a range of conventional, renewable, local and bulk options \u2014 as well as how much they are willing to spend.Mr. Orsini said he expected that most users would want to make their choices and then let the system take over.\u201cNo one wants to day-trade energy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re giving something to people that they haven\u2019t ever had before, and that\u2019s really a way to personalize their energy consumption.\u201dThat is the aspect that appeals to a number of the participants, including Garry Golden of Windsor Terrace, a futurist who consults for a variety of businesses, including electric utilities and infrastructure companies. Mr. Golden installed solar as part of a group purchase that proved so popular with his neighbors that almost a dozen systems are within view of his roof, forming an attractive cluster for the microgrid experiment.\u201cWe need to make energy a product and a service that people can purchase on their own and not rely on a large centralized entity,\u201d Mr. Golden said. He added that it was important to build out infrastructure that would be able to better withstand disasters, both natural and man-made.Other participants echoed that concern.\u201cThe long-term goal is to be at least partially independent of the grid in emergencies, which was a reasonable argument to join,\u201d said Patrick Schnell, whose Gowanus basement flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, though he did not lose power. \u201cHopefully it will expand and more people will join and it will be more worthwhile.\u201dThe project includes plans to create a roughly five-square-block area \u2014 either around a collection of public housing projects or near a hospital \u2014 that could disconnect from the grid and operate independently in case of a power failure.\u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of energy needs beyond your own,\u201d Mr. Golden said. \u201cThere\u2019s a microgrid of our community, and that\u2019s great, but the hospitals, the clinics, the schools, large housing complexes \u2014 you can feed the energy where it needs to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, urged Mr. Trump to \u201cpress for the release of political prisoners in Egypt, including jailed Americans, and encourage Egypt to allow greater space for civil society and freedom of expression for all.\u201dSeveral American citizens figure among the tens of thousands of people jailed under Mr. Sisi, most notably Aya Hjazi, a humanitarian worker arrested in May 2014 on what have been widely viewed as trumped-up charges of trafficking and child abuse.Human rights groups say the charges are part of a wider crackdown on foreign-funded aid groups in Egypt that has drawn sharp criticism from some quarters in Congress. In December, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans, said they would support new restrictions on aid to Egypt if a proposed new law there restricting aid groups is approved \u2014 a measure of the possible limits of Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Mr. Sisi.After deciding to make the promotion of democracy a major theme of his presidency, Mr. Bush kept Mr. Mubarak at a distance and pushed him to release opponents and hold elections, although he made only halting progress and eased up later in his tenure.At a briefing on Friday, White House officials said Mr. Trump did not consider it constructive to air disputes over human rights publicly. His approach, they said, would be to handle such issues in a more discreet way. In the case of Ms. Hjazi, they said, Mr. Trump\u2019s team aims to address her captivity in a way that would maximize the chances of its being resolved. The officials were not allowed to be identified under ground rules set by the White House.At the same time, the officials said the White House could not commit to maintaining Egypt\u2019s aid package at current levels, citing a budget review. Mr. Trump has proposed deep cuts in the State Department budget, and while officials have said military assistance to Israel will remain untouched, reductions in aid to Egypt are under consideration.Also on the table is aid to another crucial regional ally, Jordan, whose King Abdullah II will visit the White House on Wednesday. Like Egypt, Jordan has a peace treaty with Israel and has been a vital intelligence partner to the United States. Aid to Jordan has been increased substantially in recent years as it has absorbed hundreds of thousands of refugees from the civil war in Syria.At their briefing on Friday, the White House officials indicated that no decision had been made to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, but they anticipated Mr. Sisi would raise the matter.The White House written statement said terrorism posed a major threat to Egypt\u2019s stability. \u201cThe United States is fully committed to helping Egypt take the necessary steps to defeat Sinai-based terrorist groups,\u201d it said.The Washington trip has been keenly anticipated in Egypt, where Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters see a public handshake in the White House as a symbolic validation of a leader long spurned for his human rights record. A trade delegation is expected to accompany Mr. Sisi, hoping to attract urgently needed foreign investment.But privately, Egyptian officials have been alarmed at talk of a cut in American aid, Western officials say, and have sought to temper expectations over what the trip can produce in concrete terms.Declan Walsh contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Republicans Turn to Upstate New York to Lure Votes for Health Bill", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders, trying to lock down the votes of wavering upstate New York Republicans, inserted a last-minute special provision in their health care bill that would shift Medicaid costs from New York\u2019s counties to its state government.The move \u2014 one of a number of late changes designed to gain more votes \u2014 would affect New York State only. It could save county governments outside of New York City $2.3 billion a year. But it could shift costs to state taxpayers or deny New York that same total in matching federal aid if the state continues to require those counties to contribute to the cost of Medicaid. Upstate New York Republicans, backed by local government officials, pressed for the measure over the angry opposition of New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Andrew M. Cuomo.\u201cThe more we learn about the repeal and replacement for the Affordable Care Act, the sicker New York gets,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement Monday night.Republican leaders were in no position to oppose the demands of back-bench House members as they scrounged for a majority of votes. Democrats used such targeted provisions to push the Affordable Care Act over the finish line in 2009 and 2010 \u2014 to the angry cries of Republicans who accused them of kickbacks and buyoffs.Republican opponents of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement accused Democrats of back-room deal making, rushed legislating and strong-arm partisan tactics, even as the health care bill plodded toward passage over months of deliberation and public debate.But wheeling and dealing may be what the Republican leaders need to get the health bill through the House as they dash toward a vote as early as Thursday. The House leaders released a set of revisions to the bill late Monday night, including some to speed up the repeal of taxes in the Affordable Care Act.The newly released set of changes does not directly provide more generous tax credits for older Americans, as many Republicans had been requesting, but it lays the groundwork for the Senate to enhance those tax credits at a later stage in the legislative process.House leaders pulled the health care bill from consideration.\u201cWith the president\u2019s leadership and support for this historic legislation, we are now one step closer to keeping our promise to the American people and ending the Obamacare nightmare,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said in a statement.The changes designed to win over conservatives may still not secure the votes of some of the most hard-line among them, including many members of the House Freedom Caucus. But in a big break for Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan, the group\u2019s leader, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said it would not take a collective position on the bill.That gave Mr. Trump the power to woo members one by one. The president planned to meet with House Republicans at the Capitol on Tuesday.But House leaders also faced a problem from the other direction: Some Republicans had misgivings about the House bill not because they viewed it as \u201cObamacare Lite,\u201d but because they worried that it would cause millions of people to lose health insurance or would inflict great harm on their districts.By offering a provision to please Republicans from New York \u2014 which expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 House leaders could stand to secure several needed votes, with little risk of alienating other members.Representative John J. Faso, Republican of New York, said the state would be provided a substantial period of time to prepare for the change.At the last minute, House Republicans added two new changes to the American Health Care Act, to the seven they unveiled Monday.\u201cThe New York State property tax burden is one of the worst in the country, and Medicaid is part of the reason,\u201d Mr. Faso said.Mr. Faso and his fellow Republicans from New York had leverage. Representative Chris Collins, who pushed for the provision with Mr. Faso, noted that House leadership \u201cwas concerned about getting the votes\u201d to get the health bill passed.\u201cI suggested we put this in,\u201d Mr. Collins said, \u201cand the question that came back was, \u2018If we do it, can we get the New York votes?\u2019\u201d He said aside from one member, \u201cthe rest of us, kind of as a pack, went to leadership and said, \u2018Yeah, you get this in here, you\u2019ve got our votes.\u2019\u201dMr. Collins, a former Erie County executive, said he now believed that eight of the nine Republican members of New York\u2019s House delegation would vote for the bill. \u201cIf they did not have the New Yorkers, I\u2019m not sure they could get it over the finish line,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo, who had already warned that the House bill would cause New York to lose billions of dollars, said the change sought by the Republicans would have dire consequences.\u201cThe cut is so severe that the majority of hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities located in upstate New York and on Long Island would be devastated,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income people, is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. New York raises some of its share from counties, which have long chafed under what they view as an \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d from Albany.County property taxes represent only a portion of the overall amount of property taxes that are paid by New Yorkers. A much larger share goes toward schools.But William Cherry, the Schoharie County treasurer, said upstate counties would be able to make a significant reduction to their property taxes if they did not have to shoulder part of the cost of the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\u201cThis would be a huge step and a great benefit to taxpayers,\u201d said Mr. Cherry, a Republican who is president of the New York State Association of Counties.The provision being added to the House bill would not apply to New York City, which would continue to foot the bill for its share of Medicaid costs.Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said the provision would be harmful to hospitals and Medicaid beneficiaries.\u201cRather than providing relief for county taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Raske said, \u201cthe state would surely respond to the lack of federal revenue through huge spending cuts,\u201d and those cuts could pose a risk to hospitals and their patients.Bea Grause, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, said the provision being added to the House bill might give \u201cthe appearance of tax relief,\u201d but would really just amount to shifting costs from counties to the state, while still leaving patients in need of care.She, too, warned of a devastating effect on hospitals in New York. \u201cIt adds insult to injury,\u201d she said.Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Text: President Trump\u2019s Executive Order on Immigration", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byThe following is the text of President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, as released by the White House on Mar. 6, 2017.EXECUTIVE ORDER- - - - - - -PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATESSection 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: \u201c(I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists.\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries \u2014 each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States \u2014 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities \u2014 whoever they are and wherever they reside \u2014 to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the \u201cpolitical branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions\u201d about who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government\u2019s willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State\u2019s Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa\u2019ida and has permitted al-Qa\u2019ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.(ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States\u2019 counterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa\u2019ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa\u2019ida and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan\u2019s support to al-Qa\u2019ida has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States\u2019 counterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa\u2019ida and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States\u2019 counterterrorism efforts.(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa\u2019ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen\u2019s porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government\u2019s capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq\u2019s commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.Sec. 2. Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern During Review Period. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat. The Secretary of Homeland Security may conclude that certain information is needed from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the worldwide review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security\u2019s determination of the information needed from each country for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 20 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence.(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists, and in light of the national security concerns referenced in section 1 of this order, I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that the entry into the United States of nationals of those six countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order, subject to the limitations, waivers, and exceptions set forth in sections 3 and 12 of this order.A wide array of people are affected by President Trump\u2019s order.(d) Upon submission of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request that all foreign governments that do not supply such information regarding their nationals begin providing it within 50 days of notification.(e) After the period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals of countries that have not provided the information requested until they do so or until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the country has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through other means. The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security may also submit to the President the names of additional countries for which any of them recommends other lawful restrictions or limitations deemed necessary for the security or welfare of the United States.(f) At any point after the submission of the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment, as well as the names of any countries that they recommend should be removed from the scope of a proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section.(g) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 90 days of the effective date of this order, a third report within 120 days of the effective date of this order, and a fourth report within 150 days of the effective date of this order.Sec. 3. Scope and Implementation of Suspension.(a) Scope. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section and any waiver under subsection (c) of this section, the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall apply only to foreign nationals of the designated countries who:(i) are outside the United States on the effective date of this order;(ii) did not have a valid visa at 5:00 p.m., eastern standard time on January 27, 2017; and(iii) do not have a valid visa on the effective date of this order.(b) Exceptions. The suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall not apply to:(i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States;(ii) any foreign national who is admitted to or paroled into the United States on or after the effective date of this order;(iii) any foreign national who has a document other than a visa, valid on the effective date of this order or issued on any date thereafter, that permits him or her to travel to the United States and seek entry or admission, such as an advance parole document;(iv) any dual national of a country designated under section 2 of this order when the individual is traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country;(v) any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; or(vi) any foreign national who has been granted asylum; any refugee who has already been admitted to the United States; or any individual who has been granted withholding of removal, advance parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.(c) Waivers. Notwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner\u2019s delegee, may, in the consular officer\u2019s or the CBP official\u2019s discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer\u2019s satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest. Unless otherwise specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security, any waiver issued by a consular officer as part of the visa issuance process will be effective both for the issuance of a visa and any subsequent entry on that visa, but will leave all other requirements for admission or entry unchanged. Case-by-case waivers could be appropriate in circumstances such as the following:(i) the foreign national has previously been admitted to the United States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity, is outside the United States on the effective date of this order, seeks to reenter the United States to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry during the suspension period would impair that activity;(ii) the foreign national has previously established significant contacts with the United States but is outside the United States on the effective date of this order for work, study, or other lawful activity;(iii) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States for significant business or professional obligations and the denial of entry during the suspension period would impair those obligations;(iv) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship;(v) the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an individual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case;(vi) the foreign national has been employed by, or on behalf of, the United States Government (or is an eligible dependent of such an employee) and the employee can document that he or she has provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government;(viii) the foreign national is a landed Canadian immigrant who applies for a visa at a location within Canada; or(ix) the foreign national is traveling as a United States Government-sponsored exchange visitor.Sec. 4. Additional Inquiries Related to Nationals of Iraq. An application by any Iraqi national for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit should be subjected to thorough review, including, as appropriate, consultation with a designee of the Secretary of Defense and use of the additional information that has been obtained in the context of the close U.S.-Iraqi security partnership, since Executive Order 13769 was issued,concerning individuals suspected of ties to ISIS or other terrorist organizations and individuals coming from territories controlled or formerly controlled by ISIS. Such review shall include consideration of whether the applicant has connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations or with territory that is or has been under the dominant influence of ISIS, as well as any other information bearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise threaten the national security or public safety of the United States.Sec. 5. Implementing Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall implement a program, as part of the process for adjudications, to identify individuals who seek to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis, who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry. This program shall include the development of a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program described in subsection (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the effective date of this order.Sec. 6. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication processes to determine what additional procedures should be used to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. The suspension described in this subsection shall not apply to refugee applicants who, before the effective date of this order, have been formally scheduled for transit by the Department of State. The Secretary of State shall resume travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP 120 days after the effective date of this order, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall resume making decisions on applications for refugee status only for stateless persons and nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that the additional procedures implemented pursuant to this subsection are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.(b) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any entries in excess of that number until such time as I determine that additional entries would be in the national interest.(c) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, including in circumstances such as the following: the individual\u2019s entry would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement or arrangement, or the denial of entry would cause undue hardship.(d) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of State shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.Sec. 7. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority permitted by section 212(d)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)(B), relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing directives or guidance.Sec. 8. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry\u2011exit tracking system for in-scope travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the effective date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit further reports every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.Sec. 9. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions. This suspension shall not apply to any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the IOIA; or traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government.(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that nonimmigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.Sec. 10. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements and arrangements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If another country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a truly reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by that foreign country, to the extent practicable.Sec. 11. Transparency and Data Collection.

{"Headline": "A.I.G.\u2019s Chief Executive to Resign After Turnaround Setback", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byNearly nine years after the insurance giant American International Group peered into the abyss of the global financial crisis, the latest in a long line of new chief executives will try to return it to its pre-crisis heights.Peter D. Hancock, the current chief executive, said on Thursday that he would resign after shareholders had lost faith in his two-and-a-half-year effort to turn the company around. A.I.G. said Mr. Hancock, 58, would stay until a successor had been chosen in a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d search by its board.His resignation announcement followed a quarterly loss of $3.04 billion that surprised investors last month. He is the fifth chief executive since Maurice R. Greenberg was forced out in 2005.Like his more recent predecessors, Mr. Hancock, a former J.P. Morgan banker, has wrestled with trying to streamline the sprawling colossus, which spent years repaying a federal bailout. Yet he also has had to deal with pressure from another, more immediate, source: activist investors.In a rare tilt at a financial giant, the billionaire Carl C. Icahn publicly called in 2015 for A.I.G. to be split up and to get new leadership.Mr. Icahn and John Paulson, another hedge fund billionaire, later ended their threat of a proxy fight after the company gave up two seats on its board last year. They supported Mr. Hancock\u2019s less radical alternative to a breakup that was unveiled in January 2016: sell assets, cut costs and jettison less profitable insurance policies.Now, the two investors will have a say in what comes next at A.I.G.A representative for Mr. Paulson did not respond to a request for comment. Paulson & Company has sold nearly half of its stake, and owns about 0.49 percent of A.I.G.Shares of A.I.G., which is based in New York, rose in early trading Thursday, but ended the day down nearly 0.4 percent, to $63.21. For the year, the shares are down 3.2 percent.A.I.G. was once the gold standard for insurance companies, as it expanded through acquisitions engineered by Mr. Greenberg, its longtime leader. But in September 2008, with Mr. Greenberg gone, A.I.G. nearly collapsed and it received a $185 billion government bailout. In recent years, A.I.G.\u2019s performance has lagged its peers, despite efforts by Mr. Hancock to simplify the company and trim costs.Investors have been frustrated by the slow pace of recovery at A.I.G., but they were rattled last month by the quarterly loss of $3.04 billion, which was larger than expected. The loss was largely a result of a $5.6 billion increase in reserves to cover potential claims. Shares of A.I.G. tumbled 9 percent the day after the results were announced.Despite Mr. Hancock\u2019s impending departure, Douglas M. Steenland, the company\u2019s chairman, said on Thursday that the board believed that the chief executive\u2019s two-year strategic plan announced last year was \u201cthe right plan\u201d for the company and that it remained committed to financial targets and objectives announced earlier. \u201cPeter\u2019s accomplishments at A.I.G., including his role in the company\u2019s turnaround and in driving shareholder value, are immeasurable,\u201d Mr. Steenland said.Mr. Hancock said in a statement: \u201cI believe this is the right decision to make for the company and all its stakeholders. Without wholehearted shareholder support for my continued leadership, a protracted period of uncertainty could undermine the progress we have made and damage the interests of our policyholders, employees, regulators, debtholders and shareholders.\u201dThe cost of claims is showing signs of inching up throughout the insurance industry. But A.I.G. has done worse than its competitors, analysts said.\u201cA lot of work still needs to be done to sustainably improve A.I.G.\u2019s returns, in our view,\u201d Brian Meredith, a UBS analyst, said in a research note on Thursday.A.I.G. sold some of its most profitable businesses in the years after its bailout to repay the government, which it did in 2012.And, it faced a brain drain as underwriters and others left after its two crises, said Meyer Shields, an insurance analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. First, investigations by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general at the time, and the Securities and Exchange Commission led Mr. Greenberg to resign in 2005. And a little more than three years later, the company nearly collapsed.\u201cYou\u2019ve had enormous talent outflow from A.I.G. to competitors,\u201d Mr. Shields said. \u201cA.I.G., in the past, may have been the only place where certain large complicated risk could go for insurance. That skill set has been enormously fragmented, and I don\u2019t think you can get all of those feathers back in the pillowcase again.\u201dThe announcement on Thursday was a reversal for an executive who had been one of the brightest lights in finance. A banker for nearly 20 years at what was then J.P. Morgan, Mr. Hancock made his name helping to establish the bank\u2019s global derivatives group.He was an Oxford graduate and \u201cthe intellectual godfather\u201d of a team of bankers who helped revolutionize finance in the 1990s, according to \u201cFool\u2019s Gold,\u201d a 2009 book by Gillian Tett.Among his team\u2019s innovations was the credit default swap, contracts that put A.I.G. on the brink in September 2008. At the time, the company had credit default swaps covering some $440 billion in securities on its books.Mr. Hancock, who also was J.P. Morgan\u2019s chief financial officer and chief risk officer, left the company in 2000 after its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank.He joined A.I.G. in 2010 as executive vice president for finance, risk and investments and later ran its property-and-casualty arm.In 2014, he was appointed to succeed Robert H. Benmosche, a former MetLife chairman who came out of retirement in 2009 to lead the insurer. Mr. Benmosche died two years ago.It is not clear who may succeed Mr. Hancock as chief executive. Industry analysts said executives who might be considered include:\u25a0 Gregory C. Case, the chief executive of Aon;\u25a0 Brian Duperreault, the chief executive of Hamilton Insurance Group and former top executive at the professional services firm Marsh & McLennan Companies;\u25a0 Daniel S. Glaser, the chief executive of Marsh & McLennan;\u25a0 Constantine Iordanou, the chief executive of the specialty insurer and reinsurer Arch Capital Group;\u25a0 Michael S. McGavick, the chief executive of the insurer and reinsurer XL Group;\u25a0 Steve McGill, the former president of Aon;\u25a0 Thomas F. Motamed, the former chief executive of CNA Financial Corporation;\u25a0 Peter Zaffino, the chief executive of the insurance broker and risk manager Marsh, which is part of Marsh & McLennan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Accounts Hacked With Pro-Erdogan Messages", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byTwitter accounts belonging to high-profile news outlets, international brands and politicians were hacked on Wednesday, briefly showing posts in support of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president who is in a bitter standoff with several European Union countries.The dispute involves several countries, including the Netherlands and Germany, where Turkish politicians wish to hold rallies and campaign for a referendum on Turkey\u2019s proposed Constitution. The Twitter breaches on Wednesday, however, came as Dutch voters were casting ballots in their general election. Separately, websites in the Netherlands that help people decide how to vote were hit by online attacks on Tuesday.The Twitter hacking on Wednesday appeared to be related to that growing dispute. The defamatory messages, in Turkish, accused Germany and the Netherlands of having Nazi ties, and they linked to a video of a speech by Mr. Erdogan.While the online messages were quickly removed and control of the accounts returned to their owners, many of the targeted organizations and policy makers moved to distance themselves from what had been posted.It was unclear who had carried out the digital attacks.In response, Twitter said that it was aware that the intrusion may have resulted from a third-party app.\u201cWe quickly located the source,\u201d Twitter said in a statement. \u201cNo additional accounts are impacted.\u201dOn Tuesday, a separate attack affected two websites set up to help voters choose among Dutch political parties in the general election. Known as a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, which typically involves flooding computer servers with online messages until they collapse, the attack took the Kieskompas and Stemwijzer sites offline on Tuesday afternoon.The voter-aid websites are not part of the official electoral process.\u201cWe don\u2019t know where it is coming from, but it is an organized attack coming from abroad,\u201d said Anita de Jong, a spokeswoman for ProDemos, an independent government-financed organization that runs Stemwijzer. She said the geographic origin of the attack was unclear.Engineers from the National Cyber Security Center in The Hague and from Google offered to help the organizations that run the two websites. Wednesday morning, as voting was underway, the sites were still struggling to function and were not consistently available.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Envoy Draws From Playbook of an Aide Steeped in Conservative Ideology", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, has candidly described herself as a newcomer to the world of international diplomacy.For guidance, she has relied, in part, on an important adviser plucked from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank: Steven Groves.Some of his previously expressed views are no longer public.After the Orlando nightclub shooting, he took a swipe at Loretta Lynch, then the attorney general, who sought to ensure Muslims that their rights would be protected. \u201cTHAT must be reassuring since the patrons of the #Pulse nightclub were also under DOJ \u2018protection,\u2019\u201d Mr. Groves said on Twitter, with the hashtag #ShootBack.The United States Mission did not respond to a request for an interview with Mr. Groves.One of the main issues that Ms. Haley has promised to tackle at the United Nations comes from the Heritage Foundation\u2019s playbook: How to fix peacekeeping operations, the organization\u2019s biggest, most costliest element.Heritage Foundation analysts have advocated mission-by-mission scrutiny of peacekeeping operations, and argue that the United States should pay no more than 25 percent of the total budget \u2014 down from what is currently a little over 28 percent. Both items have become part of the ambassador\u2019s agenda.Ms. Haley said this week that she wants to do a thorough review of the United Nations\u2019 16 peacekeeping operations to \u201cdetermine where we need to augment, where we need to restructure, and where we need to cut back.\u201dShe also said she would seek to cap United States funding at 25 percent. Morgan Vina, another Heritage alumnus and a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations aide, is involved in the review of peacekeeping missions.The first test for Ms. Haley\u2019s diplomatic muscles came this week with a review by the Security Council of the largest peacekeeping mission, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The United States wanted far larger reductions in the number of boots on the ground. It settled for far fewer. The new mandate for the mission, adopted Friday after intense negotiations, ordered a modest cut of about 500 from the 16,700 peacekeepers there now.American officials were quick to point out that they pushed for improvements to the mission, but fell short of a major strategic overhaul. The peacekeepers\u2019 central tasks will now be to guard against political violence in the run up to elections that are yet to be scheduled, and to protect civilians in areas where armed groups operate. United Nations officials will have to regularly brief the Council on whether troops are living up to their mandate, and they will have to submit plans for an eventual drawdown.Other peacekeeping missions will come up for review soon. Whether Ms. Haley can yield value for taxpayer money, or fundamental reform, as she has promised, remains to be seen.\u201cHaley is left with the unenviable task of finding logic for cuts,\u201d said Richard Gowan, a foreign-policy analyst with the European Council on Foreign Relations, who calls himself a \u201cliberal\u201d scholar of the United Nations. \u201cThe work Heritage has done on peacekeeping gifts her that on a plate.\u201dMs. Haley won praise from Brett D. Schaefer, a Heritage Foundation fellow and a former office neighbor of Mr. Groves. \u201cShe\u2019s asking the right questions in terms of U.N. peacekeeping operations,\u201d he said. \u201cAre these missions past their sell date, are they accomplishing what they were set out to do?\u201dOther Heritage Foundation priorities have already found their way into the ambassador\u2019s own. She dismissed the Human Rights Council as \u201cso corrupt,\u201d echoing criticism from Heritage. And she invited the think tank to join her delegation to the annual Commission on the Status of Women. Whether she will withdraw American funding for the United Nations' population agency, which Heritage has pressed for, remains to be seen.Mr. Groves worked for 10 years as a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, according to his LinkedIn profile, and before that, was senior counsel for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in the inquiry into the United Nations oil-for-food program.He is one of about a dozen political appointments made by Ms. Haley; the rest of her staff are career State Department diplomats who are experts in their fields, and virtually all of whom have stayed on from the previous administration.Advertisement"}

One Chase Manhattan Plaza. The United Nations. Rockefeller Center. The Museum of Modern Art. Lincoln Center. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The Rockefeller University. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Riverside Church. The Cloisters.What many Rockefeller-influenced monuments have in common is an air of confidence, bordering on arrogance. (Actually, the twin towers reached well into arrogance.) There is a sense of noblesse oblige. \u201cNever you mind,\u201d these institutions seem to say to the public. \u201cWe and our architects will know just what to do.\u201dMr. Rockefeller was one of the last power brokers who seemed able to change the face of New York City with effortless understatement.Before he became the chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, he was its executive vice president for planning and development. In 1955, the Chase National Bank had merged with the Bank of the Manhattan Company. The enormous new bank required an enormous new headquarters \u2014 60 stories tall.Under zoning rules, to construct such a tower without setbacks Chase needed to set it in an especially large plaza. This it proposed to create by combining parcels on the north and south sides of Cedar Street in Lower Manhattan. That meant eliminating a stretch of public way more than 400 feet long from a part of town where every inch of street and sidewalk is precious.No problem for David Rockefeller.\u201cI went to see Moses, who, among many other official positions, was the chairman of the City Planning Commission,\u201d Mr. Rockefeller wrote. \u201cMuch to my relief, Bob proved to be an easy sale. He believed that a dramatic gesture was needed to save Wall Street, and he liked the concept of opening up more space and letting a little more light into the gloomy downtown streets. Once we had his O.K., other needed approvals came easily.\u201dNever mind those messy, querulous public hearings. Never mind the objections that other planning commissioners might have brought to the table. It was just David and Bob, longtime acquaintances, having an agreeable little chat about that pesky annoyance called a public way. When their visit was through, so was Cedar Street.Mr. Rockefeller was a longtime board member, chairman and patron of the Museum of Modern Art. In the late 1970s, a financially beleaguered MoMA planned to sell unused development rights from properties along West 53rd Street to a private developer, who would build a 53-story luxury condominium tower, with a west wing for the museum at its base.\u201cThe trust would collect the equivalent of property taxes from the new building to amortize the bonds and, after deducting expenses and other costs, pay over the remaining funds to the museum each year,\u201d Mr. Rockefeller wrote.Anyway, elected officials \u2014 whoever they were \u2014 played along. The Appellate Division of State Supreme Court did not.\u201cThe evil is not that the city will be supporting a valued museum, for that would not be evil at all,\u201d Chief Judge Breitel wrote. Instead, he said, the evil was that the law, stripped of its \u201cingenious gimmickry,\u201d would conceal from the city\u2019s taxpayers and creditors the \u201cpermanent, unreviewable diversion of anticipated city tax revenues to the museum.\u201d\u201cMy recollection is that there were, obviously, problems, but I think we were able to overcome them,\u201d he said. With effortless understatement.slide showAdvertisement"}

And as it unfolds, it is remaking the urban and economic landscape.Within the next six months, three of the biggest academic building projects in years will be opened up to students, faculty and staff. Focusing on advanced technology and the sciences, these projects, together with others recently completed or in the planning stages, are aimed at helping the city lure and retain people to compete with places like Silicon Valley and Boston.New York, though, has the advantage of its sheer number of potential recruiters and employers, and its proximity to the financial services industry, said John Tepper Marlin, a former chief economist for the New York City comptroller\u2019s office.\u201cNew York City has always been a great market but we have always been a bit snobby about tech and about practical things, and that has hurt us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are now catching up.\u201dLee C. Bollinger, Columbia\u2019s president, acknowledged that on its main Morningside Heights campus, \u201cthere are a lot of laboratories that are substandard, and there are offices that really need work and conference rooms and laboratories that need to be renovated.\u201dBut failing \u201cto invest in the long-term,\u201d he said, would mean that \u201cColumbia would slide into a modest research university over time.\u201d Moreover, \u201cthe new expansion creates a sense of excitement internally and among alumni, and that leads to gifts, which benefits the institution in full.\u201dThe campus has attracted university officials and international visitors, who want to see how academics can work alongside start-ups and established companies. Universities want to \u201cpush the envelope to have that unique advantage,\u201d said Diana Allegretti, assistant director for design and construction, who previously had worked on both the N.Y.U. and Columbia projects.The third major project \u2014 to be unveiled in the fall \u2014 is N.Y.U.\u2019s $350 million plan, part of an ambitious push into Brooklyn and beyond.\u201cWe are not just Greenwich Village University. We are all over New York,\u201d said Andrew Hamilton, N.Y.U.\u2019s president. But \u201cwe are critically short of space.\u201dA wild card, however, is government support, given President Trump\u2019s plans to slash federal science and education spending. Intangible factors will also determine whether the projects meet expectations.\u201cAre the lights on late at night?\u201d said Mr. Bollinger of Columbia. \u201cAre people just smiling because they are in environments and buildings that they feel are incredibly special? I don\u2019t know of any other projects in urban environments in the United States, or any place, of this scale, so I think this is really quite an experiment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She and her husband occupied the apartment from around 1992 to 2013, using it first as a pied-\u00e0-terre and eventually as a permanent residence before relocating to San Francisco. Mr. Reisfield also lived there for a couple of years in the mid-1990s.But the apartment is now largely vacant. Mr. Reisfield said that in the interest of estate planning, his family, which includes two brothers, Scott and Craig Reisfield, and a sister, Gray Horan, decided to sell the place. The asking price is $5.95 million, with a monthly maintenance of $9,090, according to William A. Kerr II of Halstead Property, who is listing the property with his son, William A. Kerr III, and Brian Lewis. Buyers must be prepared to pay all cash: The 14-story Venetian-Gothic Campanile, whose other famous residents have included Rex Harrison and Ethel Barrymore, does not allow financing.The Garbo co-op encompasses 2,855 square feet and includes three bedrooms, three full baths, a home office, a laundry room and an abundance of storage space and oversize windows, each with automated shades. Oak floors and Venetian crystal lighting can be found throughout the space.Though partially renovated in the \u201990s \u2014 the kitchen and bathrooms were redone, and a dressing room converted to an office \u2014 the apartment still retains much of Ms. Garbo\u2019s aesthetic sensibility. There are the walls of knotted pine and silk fabric and the recurring latticework, along with her signature palette of pink and green hues.\u201cShe decorated her home in a way that was very comfortable,\u201d Mr. Reisfield said. \u201cShe chose pine paneling, which has more of a country element.\u201dThe apartment has a private elevator that opens to a long, narrow hallway. On the north side of the unit is the formal dining room and an eat-in kitchen with a banquette. The kitchen, expanded with the removal of a maid\u2019s room, has granite countertops and Miele appliances. Two bedrooms, one with an en-suite bath, are nearby.On the south side was Ms. Garbo\u2019s favorite room and the heart of the home: the 34-by-20-foot living room, which leads to a library. The living room features a gas fireplace with a green marble surround, a small balcony and several windows, each with mirrored side panels to enhance the water views. Ms. Garbo would often step out on the balcony in the morning, according to the elder Mr. Kerr.\u201cThe great thing about this apartment is that you get great views from almost every room \u2014 sweeping views,\u201d he said. These vistas extend along the East River from the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge to the Williamsburg Bridge, with Roosevelt Island in between.Mr. Reisfield said that he and his family are sad to part with the apartment; they all have fond memories of frequent family get-togethers at the home of their glamorous aunt, whom few people really got to know.She was hardly a hermit, he said: \u201cIf you look at her date books, you see she was going out to lunch and dinner and had a fairly active social life.

Actual growth last year, according to official data, was 6.7 percent.Even with the slight drop in projected growth, many economists argue that China\u2019s annual target remains too ambitious and is adding to its long-term problems. But Mr. Li defended the target.\u201cThe projected target for this year\u2019s growth is realistic,\u201d Mr. Li said in a report issued on Sunday before lawmakers convened. \u201cAn important reason to stress the need for stable growth is to ensure employment and improve people\u2019s lives.\u201dIn a separate report issued to the legislature, the National Development and Reform Commission \u2014 which helps steer the economy \u2014 said the growth target was meant to reassure the public at an anxious time. Later this year, the Chinese Communist Party will undergo a leadership shake-up, and officials have said that stability is essential.\u201cThis rate of growth is conducive to fostering healthy public expectations,\u201d the commission report said. China, it added, was \u201cfacing complex and volatile\u201d conditions this year.Since the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, China has rapidly expanded debt to stimulate the economy and to make sure that it hit fairly ambitious targets for economic growth. Reformers have called for lower targets that would not require so much debt to achieve.Mr. Li also tried to reassure a public that has grown increasingly angry about noxious air, water and soil left by decades of feverish industrial growth, and burning coal is a main culprit.\u201cWe will work faster to address pollution caused by coal burning,\u201d Mr. Li said. Those steps would include trying to cut the amount of coal used for winter furnaces and heaters. \u201cAll key sources of industrial pollution will be placed under round-the-clock online monitoring,\u201d he said.But China\u2019s appetite for coal remains enormous. Mr. Li said that China would keep cutting excess coal production this year, but more slowly than previously. He said that this year the government aimed to shut down at least 150 million metric tons of coal production. Last year, he said, the government cut 290 million tons.In terms of other pollutants, Mr. Li said that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions would be cut 3 percent this year and that fine particles of pollution in the air, which are of particular threat to health, would decrease \u201cmarkedly\u201d in \u201ckey areas.\u201d He also said that energy consumption would decline by 3.4 percent per unit of economic output \u2014 a calculation that will still allow increases in emissions of global warming gases.Mr. Li did not mention President Trump, whose campaign language suggested a tougher stance against China on trade and regional issues. These annual reports by China\u2019s prime minister are traditionally used for laying out generalities, not specific policies. But Mr. Li built on an effort by the president, Xi Jinping, to promote China as a reassuringly stable and mature power in uncertain times.\u201cIn the face of profound changes in the international political and economic landscape, China will always be on the side of peace and stability,\u201d he said.On trade, Mr. Li said China will continue to oppose protectionism. \u201cEconomic globalization is in the fundamental interests of all countries,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cChina will not shift in its commitment to promoting global economic cooperation.\u201dBut Chinese officials were circumspect about the government\u2019s latest increase in military spending.Mr. Li said that the government was looking to lower debt loads in the economy from a splurge of bank lending, but he suggested it would be done a \u201cprudent\u201d way that would not risk an economic shock.But the Ministry of Finance budget report, issued alongside Mr. Li\u2019s report, outlined a tougher approach to local governments that have collected debt to pay for infrastructure. \u201cHigher priority will be given to preventing and controlling local government debt,\u201d the budget report said. Provincial governments would develop \u201clocal contingency plans\u201d to deal with debt risks, it said.Foreign companies have become increasingly vocal about business barriers, intellectual property theft and other problems in the Chinese market. Some are turning elsewhere to establish a base for production.Mr. Li held out an olive branch, promising to \u201cmake big moves to improve the environment for foreign investors.\u201d He said that service industries, manufacturing and mining would become more open to these investors.He also promised that, contrary to most expectations and previous experience, foreign companies would not be discriminated against on license applications, setting standards or government procurement. The country has laid out plans \u2014 called the Made in China 2025 initiative \u2014 for it to seize a global lead in a long list of key high-tech and manufacturing industries in the next eight years.Legislators gave polite applause to most of Mr. Li\u2019s plans. But one new policy drew vigorous clapping in a country where a national grid of bullet-train routes has quickly made long-distance travel commonplace: Mr. Li said the government would end roaming charges on cellphones used outside the province in which the phone numbers were initially registered.Sui-Lee Wee contributed reporting, and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Bet G.O.P. Will Regret Opposing Scrutiny of Trump", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byCongressional MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump gives Democrats in Congress an ideal adversary, one who can set off impassioned protests and ignite their supporters with a single Twitter post.But with the Democrats\u2019 power severely limited by their minority status, they cannot conduct congressional investigations. The chances their bills will even get a vote are slim.What they do possess, they hope, is the power to shame. So they have been offering up bills that stand virtually no chance of passing, like ones forcing Mr. Trump to release his tax returns, with the clear intent of putting Republicans on the record now in hopes that voters will punish them later.Last week, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, vowed a weekly vote on the matter. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to pound away,\u201d she told colleagues in a closed-door meeting, according to an aide who was present.The results so far are modest. On Friday, two House Republicans signed a Democratic letter requesting the release of the president\u2019s tax returns, becoming the only Republicans to do so.During the first six weeks of the Trump administration, Republicans have supported the president with a watch-what-he-does, not-what-he-says approach. It has largely been a policy of muted assent.\u201cI think we\u2019re going at it from all angles, hoping that whether it\u2019s the pressure or wanting to do the right thing,\u201d Republicans will join them, said Representative Eric Swalwell of California, one of the two Democrats who introduced the bill.Democrats say the tax returns provide a nexus between concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s personal financial conflicts of interest and his campaign\u2019s ties to the Russian government, issues that have troubled members of the president\u2019s own party.\u201cI\u2019m for transparency,\u201d Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, told a few hundred people in a high school cafeteria in Denham Springs, La., on a recent afternoon, stopping well short of a call for legislation.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has led the chamber\u2019s efforts to disclose Mr. Trump\u2019s returns, a push he said was driven by constituent outrage. \u201cPeople just kind of gasp,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cI can tell you it comes up at every one of my town meetings. People think it is very much linked to the Russia issue.\u201dIn the House, Democrats have pressed the issue on several, so far fruitless fronts. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr. of New Jersey, who wrote the letter that has drawn two Republican signatures, introduced a measure that would compel the House Committee on Ways and Means to request Mr. Trump\u2019s tax documents, as it is empowered to do.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has resisted calls to, as he described it to reporters, \u201crummage around in the tax returns of the president.\u201dA few Republicans have broken from their party on investigating connections between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. Representative Darrell Issa of California, who narrowly won re-election in November and is considered vulnerable in 2018, recently called for an outside investigation. The House and Senate intelligence committees will conduct their own inquiries.Representative Walter B. Jones of North Carolina \u2014 who, with Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, signed Mr. Pascrell\u2019s letter and voted \u201cpresent\u201d on his measure \u2014 said he wanted to send a message to Republican leaders that he intended to keep \u201can open mind.\u201dMr. Jones is also the sole Republican co-sponsor on Mr. Swalwell\u2019s independent commission bill, calling Russian interference in the election \u201cserious business.\u201d (\u201cHere you go again, Walter,\u201d he recalled a couple of Republican colleagues saying to him.)\u201cIf they would not let the politics drive their thinking and let the needs of the American people drive their thinking, then I think some of them would join this effort,\u201d he said.With control of what legislation comes to the floor in both the House and Senate, Republican leaders have easily fended off Democrats. A House measure seeking more information on Mr. Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest and his ties to Russia was sent to the Judiciary Committee, where it was rejected along party lines last week.The vote came at the end of the committee\u2019s meeting, hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress, when many lawmakers were having dinner. When the live stream on the committee\u2019s website temporarily failed, Democrats streamed the meeting on their Facebook pages, a low-yield guerrilla-style tactic.While Democrats argue that they are giving voice to concerns about the Trump administration, pressuring rivals to cast votes on a contentious subject is a standard political strategy.Democrats are hoping to use the Republican votes against forcing disclosure of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, and on other issues, in the 2018 midterm elections.\u201cNow he is the president, he is their standard-bearer,\u201d said Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats. \u201cThey\u2019ll have real votes on his agenda, from helping him hide his tax returns to helping him hide his connections to Russia.\u201dBut Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the House Republicans\u2019 campaign organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee, said their incumbents had established themselves with their voters, who care more about economic issues than whether a particular lawmaker pushed to see Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns.\u201cVoters won\u2019t be swayed by these legislative tactics,\u201d Mr. Gorman said. \u201cThey\u2019re stunts.\u201dMr. Jones said he saw the efforts to answer lingering questions about the election as a \u201cservice\u201d to the Trump administration, as well. \u201cWe are an equal branch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an obligation to the American people, just like the president has. And to me, I think the sooner we start dealing with this situation, the better off we are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Auto Prices Rise, Used Cars Are Looking Shinier", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byWheelsDennis McNabb had just started thinking about buying a roomier car last year when he suddenly had no choice. A heavy storm rolled across Texas and dropped golf-ball-size hail that pummeled his 2013 Hyundai Genesis and punched holes in the sedan\u2019s windows.Another shock came when Mr. McNabb, a firefighter from San Antonio, saw the sticker prices of new cars. The Toyota 4Runner sport utility vehicle had caught his eye, but 2016 models were more than $40,000 when loaded up with the heated seats, touch screen and other options that he wanted.Mr. McNabb quickly found a solution: a used 2014 4Runner with 38,000 miles that cost him just $29,750 and came with a one-year warranty.\u201cThe new ones are fairly expensive, and you lose about a third of the value as soon as you drive it off the lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 2014 is pretty much fully loaded, and it\u2019s practically the same car as the 2016, but way less. Kind of a no-brainer.\u201dThat\u2019s also more than many consumers can or want to pay. The result is that used cars, especially the nearly new models that were leased or turned in by their original buyers, represent increasingly enticing deals.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to beat the value of a late-model used car,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com. Depreciation is one of the biggest costs of owning a car, she noted. \u201cIf you buy a used car with low mileage, someone else has already taken the depreciation hit, so it\u2019s a very smart way to get a car.\u201dNew-car prices are rising as automakers add more technology. Features like rear cameras, radar sensors, collision-preventing automatic braking systems and Bluetooth are now standard in most new cars and trucks. Americans\u2019 preference for S.U.V.s and other larger vehicles is also pushing prices higher compared with the days when less expensive small cars were more in vogue.Consumers aren\u2019t the only ones seeing opportunities in used vehicles. In Jackson, Mich., 80 miles west of Detroit, Wes Lutz has just built a 5,000-square-foot addition to his Chrysler Dodge Jeep franchise to accommodate his expanding used-car sales.\u201cWe\u2019ve hired salespeople and managers because there\u2019s a lot of demand for used cars,\u201d Mr. Lutz said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a $33,000 price for new, you can get a similar car for half the price. That\u2019s a great deal, especially for people who don\u2019t drive that much, or first-time car buyers.\u201dMr. Lutz estimates that he\u2019ll soon be selling 200 or more used cars a month, up from the 130 he typically sold per month last year.\u201cMore people will look at used if they\u2019ve got peace of mind that you\u2019re getting a fair price,\u201d said Marc Cannon, AutoNation\u2019s vice president of marketing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential in the used business, and we think this is what consumers want.\u201dSales of certified pre-owned cars rose 4 percent from 2015, to a record 2.6 million vehicles in 2016, according to Edmunds.com. Those are cars that are less than three years old, generally have under 50,000 miles, and have been inspected and serviced by a franchise dealer. They usually come with an extension to the original warranty. That\u2019s the type of deal Mr. McNabb got on his 4Runner.Like new-car prices, used prices have also been rising, to an average of $19,189 in 2016, according to Edmunds.com. But analysts think used prices will ease because inventories are rising. This year, about 3.5 million cars that were leased for two or three years will be returned and sold as gently used cars, Ms. Caldwell, the Edmunds.com analyst, said.One caveat about buying pre-owned cars is that they are usually not subject to the rebates and discounts manufacturers typically offer on new cars. Also, even cars that are only a year or two old may not have the latest technology. So it pays to shop carefully.Joe Codiroli, a Defense Department consultant in Richmond, Va., discovered that last month when he looked for a bargain on a slightly used Subaru Forester. He wanted to get a model with EyeSight, Subaru\u2019s safety electronics system, which includes advanced cruise control with automatic braking and blind-spot warning technology. The used Foresters he found didn\u2019t have those features.On top of that, he found that Subaru was offering zero-percent financing on the 2017 Forester. He picked out a reddish one \u2014 a color Subaru calls \u201cVenetian pearl.\u201d\u201cIt came down to a few thousand dollars\u2019 difference between new and used,\u201d Mr. Codiroli said. \u201cSo the value for the extra features and the zero-percent swayed me to go with new.\u201dAnd he\u2019s glad he opted for the latest safety electronics. \u201cIf a car cuts in front of me on the highway, it just slows down nice and easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal. It\u2019s easier to drive, and I feel a lot safer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peugeot Maker\u2019s Deal for G.M.\u2019s Opel Faces Political Headwinds", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Turning a French carmaker and its German rival into a global auto giant would be tough under any circumstances. But the deal by PSA Group of France on Monday to buy General Motors\u2019 Opel and Vauxhall brands has the added complexity of politics.Politicians have become acutely aware of how corporate decisions can create the resentments toward immigration and globalization that fed Donald J. Trump\u2019s rise in the United States, contributed to Britain\u2019s vote last year to leave the European Union, and nourished far-right politicians in France and Germany.To make the deal work, PSA will have to navigate elected officials and labor leaders in three countries where it has big plants \u2014 Britain, France and Germany. The focus of the deal has already been centered on saving jobs. In a conversation on Sunday with Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, the British prime minister emphasized the need to protect the plants and the homegrown brand, Vauxhall.Car companies provide particularly fertile ground for nationalist appeals. The closing of a car factory is often devastating for the surrounding community, and it can fall hardest on less-educated, lower-income workers who feel neglected by elites and victimized by global finance.\u201cWhat better industry to express a view of \u2018France first\u2019 than the auto industry?\u201d said David J. Herman, who was chief executive of Opel in the 1990s. Making the acquisition work, he said, \u201cis going to be excruciatingly difficult.\u201dAt a time when European unity is under threat, the sale of Opel to PSA could strain relations among Britain, France and Germany as they try to ensure that any pain is imposed in someone else\u2019s backyard. PSA\u2019s Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn factories are concentrated in France, while the biggest Opel and Vauxhall factories are in Germany and Britain.It is difficult to see how PSA\u2019s takeover of Opel, which would create the second-largest carmaker in Europe after Volkswagen, could succeed without major job cuts and, probably, shutting some factories. Opel has not been profitable since the 1990s, and both companies have more factories than they need. Unused factory space is deadly to a car company\u2019s bottom line because it requires expensive upkeep without producing revenue.\u201cThe idea is that this deal makes a strong second to VW,\u201d Mr. Herman said, \u201cbut they\u2019ve got to make money.\u201dThe two British plants, with the Opel and Vauxhall brands, could be particularly vulnerable to political and economic forces. Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union means that cars exported to the Continent could face substantial tariffs.\u201cTavares is talking about saving $2 billion,\u201d said Peter Wells, an automotive expert at Cardiff University in Wales, referring to the chairman of the managing board of PSA, Carlos Tavares. \u201cIt has to come from somewhere.\u201dThe pressure on automakers had made the industry a point of contention in the discussion over a so-called Brexit.\u201cThe uncertainty caused by Brexit is harming the U.K. auto sector,\u201d said Len McCluskey, general secretary of the union Unite, which represents many British autoworkers. \u201cWe need assistance from the government to give this sector a fighting chance.\u201dSuch cases have prompted Mrs. May to speak of an industrial policy, repudiating years of Conservative Party free-market doctrine.In January, the prime minister announced \u201ca modern industrial strategy\u201d as part of her plan to prepare Britain for a future outside the European Union. The government will no longer be laissez-faire, she said, but will be \u201cstepping up to a new, active role that backs business.\u201dThe French government has backed PSA\u2019s acquisition of Opel, a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy economy. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande commended the alliance on Monday as the \u201cbirth of a European champion of the automotive industry.\u201dThe deal represents a remarkable turnaround for PSA, which had a record loss just four years ago. Freed of constraints imposed by G.M., Opel may be able to establish a stronger presence in Asia and South America, potentially allowing the company to reduce its heavy reliance on the slow-growing European market.But Opel will require work. In a reflection of the troubles, G.M. is selling its European operations for just $2.3 billion, and it is taking a charge of up to $4.5 billion as it books a paper loss from the deal. (PSA is spending about $1.85 billion, with BNP Paribas kicking in the rest in exchange for part of the financial group.)\u201cWe think, with humility, but with a certain trust, that we can help Opel to accelerate its economic reconstruction,\u201d Mr. Tavares told reporters at a news conference on Monday. \u201cWe see that there\u2019s a similarity between the difficulties Opel is going through today and PSA\u2019s situation three, four years ago.\u201dThe French government has already demonstrated that, at least during an election year, it will intervene to protect jobs. The Hollande administration threatened several years ago to nationalize an ailing steel plant run by ArcelorMittal to stem possible job losses, and it prevented Yahoo from taking a majority stake in a French company, Dailymotion.When Alstom tried to shut down a train factory in the working-class city of Belfort in the autumn, Mr. Hollande, who had come under fire for France\u2019s high unemployment rate, reacted with fury. Although the company vowed that the factory\u2019s 400 jobs would be relocated to a larger site in northern France, the government insisted that the site remain open, and it then placed a multibillion-euro order for trains to keep the operation running.Mr. Tavares of PSA emphasized several times on Monday that the Opel deal was not based on job cuts. \u201cShutting down a plant is rather simplistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that protects us is performance.\u201dBut politics cannot defy economics forever. Without growth, PSA will have no choice but to cut costs.Stanley Reed contributed reporting from London and Liz Alderman and Beno\u00eet Morenne from Paris.Advertisement"}

In the past five years, the bureau\u2019s investigations and enforcement actions against banks and other lenders have returned nearly $12 billion to homeowners, students, servicemen and servicewomen, car buyers, credit card holders and other borrowers who were subject to abusive, deceptive or predatory practices. The bureau is now working on ways to regulate payday lending, where loans often end up impoverishing borrowers.Mr. Cordray and the bureau have been doing what President Trump pledged to do in the campaign: protecting Americans from a system that has \u201crobbed our working class.\u201d So why would he want to fire Mr. Cordray? For one, Mr. Trump, despite his populist claims, has promised to dismantle the Dodd-Frank law, with the consumer bureau arguably the law\u2019s most visible accomplishment. Second, the move may be part of a bigger power play.Mr. Cordray is not the only agency head with statutory protections from removal at will by the president. The heads of the Office of Special Counsel, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Reserve, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and other agencies are also shielded. Such protection is intended to insulate independent agencies from political interference.But even if the full appeals court, which is hearing the case, rules that the president cannot fire Mr. Cordray at will, its decision could be appealed to the Supreme Court. The result could be a ruling that, if applied broadly, weakens the independence of agencies across the government.The arguments against the bureau and Mr. Cordray are weak.

{"Headline": "Behind the Quiet State-by-State Fight Over Electric Vehicles", "Date": "2017-03-11", "News": "Supported byWhen Georgia repealed its generous $5,000 tax credit on electric vehicles in July 2015, and instead slapped a $200 registration fee on electric cars, sales quickly tumbled.In the month before the repeal, nearly 1,300 electric vehicles were sold in the state. By August, those sales had all but evaporated \u2014 to just 97 cars.It was a hint of what would come.Today, the economic incentives that have helped electric vehicles gain a toehold in America are under attack, state by state. In some states, there is a move to repeal tax credits for battery-powered vehicles or to let them expire. And in at least nine states, including liberal-leaning ones like Illinois and conservative-leaning ones like Indiana, lawmakers have introduced bills that would levy new fees on those who own electric cars.The state actions could put the business of electric vehicles, already rocky, on even more precarious footing. That is particularly true as gas prices stay low, and as the Trump administration appears set to give the nascent market much less of a hand.In coming days, the Trump administration is widely expected to roll back stringent federal regulations on vehicle emissions, one of the biggest environmental legacies of President Barack Obama. The changes would give American carmakers less incentive to produce more battery-powered cars. There are also concerns among advocates of electric cars over the fate of a $7,500 federal tax credit on the vehicles, a major catalyst for sales.But while the battle in Washington gets much of the attention, the most direct attack against electric vehicles, and in some cases hybrid vehicles, is quietly being waged at the state level.A handful of other states, including Illinois, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, have already let their incentives expire. That has brought down to 16 the number of states that offer financial support for buyers of electric vehicles. That number once approached 25.\u201cIt\u2019s baffling,\u201d said Matt Jones, a Democratic state senator in Colorado, who opposes the move to repeal the tax credit. \u201cIt\u2019s very counterproductive.\u201dEven with the incentives, overall sales of electric vehicles are only about 1 percent of the American market. To start making a real dent in the market, Ms. Caldwell said, \u201celectric vehicles still need to be subsidized for a significant amount of time.\u201dA slowdown in the country\u2019s shift toward battery-powered vehicles could leave the American auto market a global laggard, electric vehicle proponents warn. They say a similar situation played out a couple of decades ago, when American car companies stayed away from small cars, leaving a big opening for Japanese companies.A slower transition could also have big consequences for the United States\u2019 carbon emissions.That makes switching to cleaner vehicles imperative in further reducing America\u2019s carbon footprint, environmentalists say.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the environment,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThese vehicles are also about being a leader in this new technology that everyone agrees is coming. If the U.S. isn\u2019t a leader in this technology, we\u2019ll be buying them from someone else.\u201dAdvances in battery technology, both in quality and price, have allowed companies to bring more affordable battery-powered cars to market.General Motors\u2019 Bolt EV has a 238-mile range for less than $30,000, after the $7,500 federal income tax credit. Tesla plans to introduce the Model 3, a 215-mile-range car, for under $30,000 after federal tax credits.For these lower-cost models, which seek to attract buyers beyond the comfortably wealthy, those incentives are critical to sales. But each automaker has a 200,000-vehicle allotment for the federal tax credits, a limit that Tesla and GM will reach by 2018, according to some estimates. It is unclear whether that limit will be extended, making the state credits even more important.Laura Toole, General Motors spokeswoman, said that incentives were \u201cstill necessary to help build the E.V. market to greater volumes.\u201dA Tesla spokesman declined to comment. But its chief executive, Elon Musk, has said that he supports getting rid of incentives, but only if other subsidies are repealed, including support for fossil fuel industries.Electric vehicles alone could reduce oil demand by two million barrels a day by 2025, the study forecasts. That would be about the same dip that caused the oil price collapse in 2014 and 2015.In general, though, the projections underscore the threat that electric vehicles pose to the oil and gas industries \u2014 and those with big investments in those areas \u2014 and those who back a rapid shift away.The bill in Colorado, which would end income tax credits of up to $5,000 for buyers of electric cars and as much as $20,000 for commercial trucks, cleared its first barrier in a senate committee Feb. 28.They argue that the government should not be choosing between technologies or companies. They also argue that electric vehicle owners tend to be wealthy and do not need financial help.In testimony before Colorado lawmakers, Rudy Zitti, deputy state director at Americans for Prosperity, said, \u201cBy allowing these subsidies to continue, you are unfairly choosing to use our tax dollars to benefit a finite group of individuals and corporate interests.\u201dGeorgia offers an example of how some of these arguments played out. For a few years, attempts to repeal that state\u2019s electric vehicle incentive, first introduced in the late 1990s, went nowhere. Then in 2015, the repeal was rolled into a larger transportation bill, which promised freshly paved roads and shored-up bridges.The bill passed, together with the repeal, with little debate on the incentive itself; amid a budget shortfall, legislators were more interested in securing money for infrastructure projects.In a close vote, also Feb. 28, Utah\u2019s House of Representatives voted against extending the state\u2019s tax credit for electric vehicles after legislators there argued that those credits cost too much.The $1,500 credit for buyers of long-range electric vehicles \u201cdoes not make sense economically to me,\u201d Scott Sandall, a Republican representative, argued. A bill to extend that credit for five more years failed by one vote in the chamber.Kevin Emerson of Utah Clean Energy called the defeat disappointing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t reinstate it, it sends a message that Utah is no longer open to business for E.V.s.,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is so important for Utah. We\u2019d seen it as important in the long term.\u201dSeveral other states have imposed new registration fees on electric vehicles. Lawmakers pushing for the fees say that because owners of battery-powered cars do not pay gasoline taxes, they should help pay for infrastructure in some way.Since 2011, 10 states have adopted special fees of up to $200 a year for electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid owners. At least nine more states are considering similar charges.Despite the setbacks, a broad coalition between environmentalists, electric vehicle manufacturers and some electrical utilities has redoubled efforts to keep the electric car momentum going.Nissan said that the incentive programs are \u201cinstrumental\u201d to building acceptance among American drivers.Some states are bolstering their support for electric vehicles. In a long-awaited move, buyers of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in New York are set to receive a $2,000 rebate.She said the steady growth in electric vehicle sales despite lower gas prices, and the proliferation of electric and plug-in models now available, showed both consumer and industry interest in the technology.\u201cAre we worried about what the federal government will likely try to do? Yes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re concerned that many similar bills are coming out in many states at the same time.\u201dShe added: \u201cBut do we think that\u2019s going to kill electric vehicles? Absolutely not.\u201dStill, electric vehicle owners in states pulling back on incentives are left in the lurch.Alfred Richner, a financial services worker in Atlanta, vowed to go electric over a decade ago, when oil prices in the city spiked after Hurricane Katrina.\u201cIn 2005, I promised myself my next car would not use gas,\u201d he said.It took seven more years for Mr. Richner to find an electric car he was happy with \u2014 a new 2012 Nissan Leaf. And he got a great deal \u2014 $26,000 before sales tax \u2014 from a local dealer desperate to get rid of the car, he said.With the federal and state subsidies, he paid $15,500 out of pocket.\u201cIt was solid, it was comfortable, it was futuristic,\u201d Mr. Richner said. \u201cAnd the dealer was willing to negotiate, because he couldn\u2019t sell it. And then the dealer said Georgia had a $5,000 tax credit. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dA year later, he bought Mitsubishi\u2019s i-MiEV electric car for his wife, again using federal and state incentives. (But his wife, who declared the Mitsubishi car ugly, now drives the Leaf, leaving him to make his 52-mile round-trip daily commute in the i-MiEV.)He had planned to upgrade his Nissan Leaf in 2015. But that plan was foiled when he couldn\u2019t track one down in Georgia before the tax credit expired.\u201cIt\u2019s a great car,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess by then, everyone wanted it. And then it all stopped.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other Presidential Vote that Got Rick Perry\u2019s Attention", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byOn CampusThe essay by Mr. Perry, the former governor of Texas, drew attention, elevating a campus controversy into a subject of national debate. As someone who covered the race as the editor in chief of The Battalion, the university\u2019s daily student newspaper, I found Mr. Perry\u2019s assessment pretty astounding.And thus, Bobby Brooks, the runner-up, became president.The idea that a white, Christian, straight man could be persecuted because of those factors \u2014 at one of America\u2019s most conservative universities in one of America\u2019s most conservative states \u2014 has caused some confusion. Many have found the argument outright laughable.But the thing is, Mr. Brooks\u2019s sexual orientation was completely incidental to the student court\u2019s ruling.Also, call me na\u00efve, but the idea that 20-year-old students would concoct what Mr. Perry called \u201ca series of dirty campaign tactics\u201d to take control of the student government is ludicrous. From everything we have heard or reported on at The Battalion, no part of this controversy stems from malicious conduct. No Russian ambassadors were contacted. No debate questions were given out ahead of time.In fact, while students are certainly politically active here, the majority didn\u2019t vote in the campus election and don\u2019t appear to really care about its outcome. On a campus of more than 60,000, just over 14,000 students voted. Many people are just here to go to school, and that\u2019s fine, too.Why Mr. Perry chose to condemn our election remains mystifying. Mr. McIntosh, the disqualified candidate, is the son of a prominent Republican fund-raiser, but that\u2019s not necessarily the reason for Mr. Perry\u2019s interest. Yet the bad press did a real disservice to the school.A&M has very proud students and alumni. We are big on our honor code \u2014 \u201can Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.\u201d For other universities, college rings are a cool memento that students wear on their graduation day and then store in a jewelry box. But many Aggies wear their rings until the day they\u2019re buried in them. So Mr. Perry\u2019s closing line in his op-ed essay, in which he wrote that the unfair treatment of Mr. McIntosh failed \u201cevery student at our beloved university\u201d and tarnished the ring \u201cthat our alumni wear with pride,\u201d was troubling to many.So, yes, we care about diversity at Texas A&M, but that doesn\u2019t mean we care less about democracy.I don\u2019t know how this will play out for A&M or whether Mr. McIntosh will pursue his case. In the meantime, students don\u2019t have to rely on the national news to get their dose of political controversy. It\u2019s right here on campus.Sam King is a senior at Texas A&M University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In New York, Bringing Broadband to Everyone by 2018", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byHALCOTT, N.Y. \u2014 It\u2019s about 15 miles from here to a dairy testing facility in Roxbury, or about one hour and 20 minutes round trip if you know these dusty mountain back roads like Chris DiBenedetto, a dairy farmer. He has been going back and forth for years, ferrying a sample of fresh milk for a federally mandated drug test before he can start processing each batch.But what stressed him the most were the valuable daylight farming hours lost to the journey, while he was stuck in his car or waiting for the results.Now, Mr. DiBenedetto gives a sample to a driver heading that way to do the drop-off, letting the new fiber wiring hanging over his old route do the simple document delivery for him via email.The dairy farmer in this speck of a town about 140 miles north of New York City was one of the first beneficiaries of an ambitious initiative to extend broadband to every household in the state by 2018 \u2014 no matter how rural or far-flung the address \u2014 which would make New York the first state to reach that high-speed internet milestone.For years, this town was like many isolated spots in New York and across the country, left sitting on the shoulders of the digital highway unable to access the broadband speeds that so many businesses and households count on. But now under a state-led program, towns like Halcott, with fewer than 300 residents, are getting wired, giving residents faster access to the internet and opening new opportunities for businesses.Two Stones Farm, a small goat farm here, has created an online store to offer more products, including artisanal cheese. \u201cI look at it this way: It\u2019s very much like electricity was at one time,\u201d said Alan White, 54, who owns Two Stones Farm with his wife. \u201cElectricity would have never come to our valley if it was based strictly on population. It\u2019s not a luxury. It\u2019s a necessity that we need to operate.\u201dThe problem is worse in poorer and rural areas: At least 30 percent of people in Mississippi and Arkansas do not have access to broadband, and sparsely populated states like Montana have similar access rates.The challenge in the United States is that it has vast tracts of sparsely populated regions where the cost of laying new fiber and cable wiring for broadband significantly outweighs the profits \u2014 39 percent of Americans living in rural areas lack broadband access, compared with 4 percent of those living in cities, according to the F.C.C.Under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s \u201cBroadband for All\u201d initiative, New York\u2019s program is one of the most aggressive broadband expansions in the country, and is designed to help stem any losses a private company incurs through what is known as a reverse auction process.Using data from the Federal Communications Commission to identify both unserved and underserved areas, the program divides the state into census blocks. The state then auctions off grant money for each census block, awarding the financing to the private company that seeks the lowest state subsidy.The system has attracted different providers, including major telecommunication companies like Fairpoint and Frontier, as well as smaller utilities like Middleburgh Telephone Company, known as Midtel, and Margaretville Telephone Company.Along the two-lane roads winding through Delaware County in the Catskills, Midtel trucks are following a path similar to one they took years ago, threading fiber optic cables for broadband across the valley.\u201cAll the served, underserved and unserved areas don\u2019t end up in a nice row,\u201d said Jim Becker, the president of the company, which has existed for more than a century and is still overseen by his 94-year-old grandmother, Marge Becker. \u201cSometimes you have to build through somewhat of a served area to get to an unserved, and vice versa.\u201dTurning on broadband can transform lives in rural places.Here in Halcott, a hamlet in the Catskills, the broadband has allowed Mr. DiBenedetto to broaden his business online \u2014 a yogurt company in Brooklyn recently contacted him about a single source contract. His daughter, Elena, was able to help out on the farm while getting a master\u2019s degree online.\u201cIn today\u2019s technology-driven world, access to high-speed internet is essential to building strong communities, growing the economy and supporting our everyday lives,\u201d Governor Cuomo said. \u201cNew York is leading the nation with the largest state broadband investment program in history \u2014 ensuring high-speed internet access for all residents, especially those in rural areas, and empowering students, entrepreneurs and businesses to thrive in our global economy.\u201dUnder New York\u2019s program, providers must offer 100 mbps speed \u2014 fast enough to download a movie in high definition in 90 seconds \u2014 for $60 a month. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the F.C.C., acknowledging that it was a reasonable price given that prices elsewhere could be much higher. \u201cBut if you\u2019re really poor, can you afford it? I don\u2019t know. If you are a poor rural person living in Appalachia, that\u2019s a big bite out of your budget.\u201dBut many rural businesses in New York have jumped at the chance for faster internet.About an hour from Halcott lies the Beaverkill Valley Inn, a historic hotel sitting on the banks of the Beaver Kill river, a world-famous fly-fishing spot in Lew Beach, N.Y. There\u2019s no cellphone service, so for years the inn and its guests shared a satellite internet connection.\u201cWe were competing with our guests\u2019 need and our own need to do business,\u201d said Kathy Bryant, one of the inn\u2019s managers. She noted that despite a sprawling property well suited for corporate retreats and meetings, the inn was unable to attract such business because of its limited internet.After years of pleading with local officials and telecommunications providers for a broadband connection, the inn was connected to high-speed internet by the Margaretville Telephone Company last August. Today, flush with retreats, weddings and guests spending an extra day or so \u201cworking from home,\u201d the inn just had the most successful year in its 120-year history.\u201cNow, we just reassure them that they can still unplug while they\u2019re up here,\u201d Ms. Bryant said with a laugh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Fed Raises Rates, Credit Card Holders Feel It First", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byGet ready to pay more to borrow.The typical credit card holder who is carrying a balance will quickly see annual interest charges rise to 16.75 percent from 16.5 percent. Rates on auto loans and home equity loans will also creep higher, as will mortgage rates, albeit over a longer period of time.\u201cIt will be a direct pass-through to credit card holders,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst with Bankrate.com. \u201cThis is a rising tide that lifts all boats, and you\u2019re going to feel it in equal magnitude wherever you sit on the credit spectrum.\u201dStill, rather than focusing on the the Fed\u2019s increase, experts have been warning that the long-term trajectory for borrowing costs will steadily move higher, especially if the central bank follows through on signals that it will raise rates twice more this year.But although almost all borrowers will be affected, some will feel it much more than others. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s likely to play out.According to Mr. McBride, credit card costs are directly tied to the prime rate, which in turn is linked to the federal funds rate. The latter is what the Fed increased Wednesday. As both these rates move higher, so will the adjustable annual interest rate on credit cards.Over all, the Fed\u2019s increase \u2014 a quarter point \u2014 is small, and it still leaves short-term borrowing costs near historical lows.The extra quarter-point\u2019s impact is small for now, equaling about $42 per year on that typical balance. But if the Fed moves two more times this year, that will add another $85 annually for the typical family that carries a balance on its cards.The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third consecutive quarter.Unlike credit card terms, which move according to short-term interest rates, mortgage rates generally follow the trajectory of the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds. Bond yields have been moving higher, partly because of the Fed\u2019s intention to tighten monetary policy, but mostly because of indicators that the economy is getting stronger and the possibility that government borrowing will soar under President Trump.Mortgage rates have already run up sharply since the election \u2014 rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage now stand at about 4.25 percent, up from 4 percent late last year and 3.75 percent in early November, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.Guy Cecala, the company\u2019s chief executive and publisher, said that investors had expected the Fed to raise rates, which meant to a degree that the increase was already built into the market and mortgage rates. \u201cBut it\u2019s not lock step, and the Fed is a relatively minor factor in determining mortgage rates,\u201d he said.On the other hand, homeowners who have borrowed against properties using a home equity line of credit will feel a pinch much sooner. These rates are variable and will most likely rise by a quarter-point after a Fed move. With a typical balance equaling $30,000, that adds about $6.25 in monthly interest payments.Still, even if home buyers won\u2019t really be put out by a single Fed move in March, tighter monetary policy and rising bond yields will gradually make mortgages significantly more expensive in the months ahead.And because the outstanding balances of mortgages are so much larger than they are for credit cards or home-equity loans, the ultimate impact of higher mortgage rates is much more noticeable. For example, a rise of one percentage point on a mortgage of $500,000 will lift interest payments by nearly $5,000 in the first year of the loan.As a result, more borrowers are looking at adjustable-rate mortgages, which lock in rates initially, but then let them float after five, seven or 10 years. Rates on five-year adjustable rate mortgage are about a full percentage point below what a 30-year fixed mortgage costs.\u201cWe\u2019ve been spoiled,\u201d said Mr. Cecala, noting that during the housing boom before the recession, 30-year mortgage rates stood at 6 percent. He doesn\u2019t expect a return to that level anytime soon, but he does expect rates on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage to hit 5 percent in 2018.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that mortgage rates are heading to 5 percent or higher,\u201d Mr. Cecala said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of when.\u201dAlthough car loans will also get slightly more expensive, the quarter-point rise in financing costs comes on top of relatively low borrowing rates to begin with. Currently, consumers pay about 4.3 percent annually for a loan on a new car, while the rate on loans for used cars stands at 5 percent, according to Bankrate.com.\u201cThe good news is that there is still intense competition in the auto lending landscape,\u201d Mr. McBride of Bankrate said. \u201cEven with rates moving up, plenty of people are finding loans for 3 percent a year or lower.\u201dWhat is more, as car loans are nowhere near the size of mortgages, the impact of the quarter-point increase is slight. The cost of a $25,000 auto loan looks to rise by just $3 a month.Returns for savers, unlike those for stock market investors, have never recovered from the financial crisis of 2008 and the recession, when overall interest rates plunged. Short-term rates have crept higher since the Federal Reserve embarked on its path to normalize monetary policy in December 2015, but savers wouldn\u2019t know that: The typical savings account currently pays 0.1 percent per year.\u201cIf it goes from 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent, who cares?\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting at your existing bank for better yields to land in your lap, you\u2019re going to be disappointed.\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t mean yield-starved savers have to settle for next to nothing. Mr. McBride notes that a handful of banks pay more \u2014 much more \u2014 on savings and money-market accounts. For example, PurePoint Financial offers a 1.25 percent yield on savings accounts with a minimum of $10,000 in assets, while Popular Direct pays 1.15 percent on savings accounts with at least $5,000.PurePoint is a unit of MUFG Union Bank, whose Japanese parent is among the largest financial institutions in the world, and Popular Direct is an affiliate of the Puerto Rico-based Banco Popular. Both institutions get high ratings for safety and soundness from Bankrate.com.In addition to earning more now, savers at these institutions will also see yields rise more quickly if the Fed continues to nudge rates higher in the months ahead.\u201cTo see an improvement, you have to have your money at one of the banks that\u2019s paying the best yields,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to play in the right sandbox.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats\u2019 Line of Attack on Gorsuch: No Friend of the Little Guy", "Date": "2017-03-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Corporate tool. Enemy of disabled people. Deferential to the privileged, including the man who chose him.The strategy includes two events this week aimed at emphasizing Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights and big money in politics \u2014 an attempt to break through the din in President Trump\u2019s Washington, where the nomination fight so far has been largely overshadowed by administration infighting, Russia-tinged scandals and legislation to overhaul the nation\u2019s health care system.The Democrats\u2019 approach also appears to be in keeping with the preference of some lawmakers to make the nomination as much a referendum on Mr. Trump as Judge Gorsuch, with ready parallels to the president\u2019s history as a profit-seeking boss and serial litigant.As a consequence, though, the kinds of social issues that often animate Supreme Court confirmation hearings, like abortion rights and same-sex marriage, may not be the primary focus for Democrats seeking to raise doubts about Judge Gorsuch.\u201cObviously, the social issues are always looming out there with any justice,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cBut where he\u2019s particularly vulnerable is in this antiworker, pro-corporate record. And second, he cannot really cite examples of him being independent other than saying, \u2018Ask people.\u2019\u201dBut after weeks spent poring over his rulings, their attention in the coming days will be trained largely on Judge Gorsuch\u2019s paper trail on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.Democrats are expected to point out several instances they say highlight his tendency to side against the little guy. In one case, Judge Gorsuch argued in a dissent that a company was permitted to fire a truck driver for abandoning his cargo for his own safety in subzero temperatures.In another, he ruled against a family seeking reimbursement under a federal disabilities law for the cost of sending a child with severe autism to a specialized school. Then there was the professor who lost her job after taking time off to recover from cancer: Judge Gorsuch denied her federal discrimination claim, saying that while the predicament was \u201cin no way of her own making,\u201d it was \u201ca problem other forms of social security aim to address.\u201d\u201cYou can find example after example of Judge Gorsuch siding against workers even in the most dire circumstances,\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 3 ranking Senate Democrat, said last week at an event with union and disability rights representatives.Judge Gorsuch\u2019s defenders have accused Democrats of cherry-picking, arguing that his adherence to the law does not suggest a lack of compassion. In the case of the professor, for instance, the decision was unanimous and joined by a nominee of President Bill Clinton.Former clerks to Judge Gorsuch have cited other cases in which he sided with workers on issues including sexual harassment claims and black-lung benefits for retired miners.Carrie Severino, the chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, a group pushing for Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation, called the Democrats\u2019 criticisms \u201can absurd overgeneralization.\u201dSkeptics of Judge Gorsuch have been unmoved. On Tuesday, Democrats on Capitol Hill have planned an event focused on Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on campaign finance laws, suggesting that he would continue the rightward movement of the court in this area.And on Wednesday, Mr. Schumer is expected to host people who have been negatively affected by Judge Gorsuch\u2019s decisions in a bid to demonstrate the practical implications of his rulings.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole pattern,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cHe sort of expresses sympathetic words in many of these cases, but then his decision is coldly \u2014 he would say pragmatic, we would say coldly \u2014 on the side of the big interests.\u201dMr. Gorsuch\u2019s views on social issues will surely retain a conspicuous place at his hearings. One of his best-known rulings was a vote in favor of Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., which objected to regulations under the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide free contraception coverage.But other cases may offer Democrats a more powerful populist message as they press Judge Gorsuch \u2014 and, if they choose, at least a handful of opportunities to link the nominee to a president with a history of punching down. During the campaign, Mr. Trump was criticized for failing to pay contractors at his buildings, misleading students at Trump University and mocking a reporter with a physical disability.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said a central question of the hearings would be whether Judge Gorsuch passes the \u201cTrump litmus test\u201d laid out during the campaign, when Mr. Trump pledged to nominate a judge with traditionally conservative credentials on issues like abortion and gun rights.\u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating process because clearly he has strengths in intellect and articulateness that make him an appealing candidate,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u201cBut \u2014 and it\u2019s a big \u2018but\u2019 \u2014 what are his core beliefs?\u201dBreaking a possible Democratic filibuster against the nomination would require eight members of the Democratic caucus to join the 52-member Republican majority. Otherwise, Republicans could change longstanding rules and push through the nomination on a simple majority vote \u2014 the so-called nuclear option, which Mr. Trump has encouraged Republicans to embrace if necessary.Last week, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who engineered the Republicans\u2019 Supreme Court gambit in an election year, preached civility at the Capitol, asking Democrats to give Judge Gorsuch due deference.\u201cI hope colleagues on both sides will show him the fair consideration he deserves,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cthe same fair consideration we showed to all four of the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Clinton after they were first elected \u2014 a respectful hearing followed by an up-or-down vote.\u201dTaking to the Senate floor moments later, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the body\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, could not resist a recent-history lesson.\u201cIt was interesting when he said the courtesies that were extended to President Obama and President Clinton,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cHe left out one year: last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those committees could then legally transfer the inflated donations to candidates.On Thursday, the prosecutor said the de Blasio operation \u201cenabled an unprecedented amount of money to flow\u201d to individual campaigns, but did so without violating the limits on contributions.This comes down, then, not to behavior, but to scale. That is why the gold medal goes to the de Blasio team, which was up against a field of strong contenders that included Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and the state committees of both the Republican and Democratic parties. All of them engaged in versions of the de Blasio team\u2019s tactic of washing big pots of money through state or county party committees in support of individual candidates.Mr. Vance, in a letter to the Board of Elections, suggested that the de Blasio team\u2019s activities contradicted the \u201cspirit and intent\u201d of the campaign laws.For this to be true, one would have to believe that the legislature really intended there to be actual limits on how much money could be given to candidates. Mr. Vance is correct that the legislature created limits, but it simultaneously built ways around them; its \u201cspirit and intent\u201d is like the public piety of a Mafia hitman who makes the sign of the cross when passing a church on his way to work.Q. Since you\u2019ve been at Glenwood, how much money have the L.L.C.s donated in contributions?A. In total?Q. In total, approximately.A.

They are not in charge of good and evil. Nor are they civic hygienists. Nevertheless, Mr. Vance made the useful suggestion that the Board of Elections could issue guidance on the tricks used by Team de Blasio \u2014 and prominent others, unnamed by Mr. Vance.Certain practices deserve our attention not because they are against the law, but precisely because they are legal. Moments after the prosecutors\u2019 announcements, Brian Lehrer of WNYC radio spoke to the mayor on the air.\u201cWere you looking to get money to the hands of those candidates through the state committees and understanding the spirit of the law but trying to just stay within the letter of the law \u2013 not caring about the spirit of the law?\u201d Mr. Lehrer asked.Mr. de Blasio loves saddling up on the highest horse he can find.

The outflow of staff members \u2014 in the mere tens, out of a British work force approaching 900 \u2014 is consistent with a sense that \u201cBrexodus\u201d is a steady trickle rather than a torrent.Lloyd\u2019s monitors and supports 99 syndicates underwriting specialist insurance worldwide, who in 2015 wrote 11 percent of their gross written premiums in the European Economic Area. In doing something to preserve this arrangement, it is comparatively late to the party. The risk of British entities losing access to European customers after \u201cBrexit\u201d has been obvious since the vote in June. But most big financial companies, like HSBC and Aviva, already have subsidiaries on the Continent.How many staff members need to actually move is a function of how much business the group does in the European Union and how antsy European regulators might be about the changed circumstances.There is no way to spin this outflow as a good thing. Even if every financial firm moves only 10 percent of its staff, that could still risk a tangible proportion of the 71 billion pounds (about $89 billion) in tax from financial services companies generated in 2016. UBS has said a fifth of its 5,000 London staff members could be affected by Brexit, while a quarter of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 16,000 employees in Britain could be.Still, anecdotally, bankers at the big firms think that the exodus will be less, and that London will retain its financial hub status. While a free-trade agreement between the European Union and Britain on favorable terms for finance seems far-fetched, it\u2019s not impossible. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that a future free trade agreement ought to cover financial services. More simply, not many financial types want to leave London.So Lloyd\u2019s is merely doing what every other firm is doing \u2014 acquiring an option that it hopes will expire, out of the money.Advertisement"}

Yet in Europe, where disclosure laws are porous, loopholes in the Dutch laws still prevent a full picture of the scope and influence of foreign money.Over all, the largest individual donor listed in Wednesday\u2019s filing appeared to be Metterwoon Vastgoed, a real estate agency led by Chris Thunnessen, a businessman from The Hague. The firm gave about $158,000 this year to 50PLUS, a small party representing the interests of older voters. The firm gave nearly $106,000 last year to the same party.The Dutch have tightened their disclosure system in recent years, but gaps still leave it open to outside manipulation. Donations totaling less than 4,500 euros annually, about $4,750, do not have to be made public or reported to regulators. And foreign donations are also permitted, though legislation to ban such gifts has broad support in Parliament.The Party for Freedom listed only three donors in the latest filing, two of which were American. Few other foreign donations have surfaced in Dutch records in recent years. One exception was Chris Rufer, an American who founded a California-based company that produces tomato paste and other tomato products in bulk. He gave nearly $5,000 to the tiny Libertarian Party in 2015. According to federal records, he has been an active donor to libertarian candidates and groups in the United States.Elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany are considered pivotal for the future of the eurozone and the European Union.

{"Headline": "Philip Hammond, U.K. Finance Official, Cautiously Upbeat on Budget", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The British economy has outperformed expectations since last year\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. In his annual budget presentation delivered Wednesday, the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, predicted the economy would continue to do so, giving him the flexibility to guard against the uncertainties that lie ahead as Britain leaves the European Union.Mr. Hammond\u2019s primary task is to manage the possible economic fallout from Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit. Its impact will depend largely on what sort of trade deal the government can negotiate with the remaining members of the bloc.Mr. Hammond said the government would raise the amount that about 1.6 million self-employed Britons have to pay into social security, breaking an election promise but helping to build an economic defense against possible economic shock brought on by the British exit.Prime Minister Theresa May has said that Britain is likely to leave the bloc\u2019s single market and \u2014 almost certainly \u2014 its customs union, which taken together dispense with customs checks at borders and allow for tariff-free trade in goods and many services.Mr. Hammond, who announced money for driverless vehicles, noted dryly that this was \u201ca technology that I believe the Labour Party knows something about.\u201dBut he has a less showy style than his predecessor, George Osborne, who was fired when Mrs. May came to power after last year\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s future.A sober approach may be more appropriate now, given the uncertainty of the economic situation Britain faces, however. Britain is currently a full member of the European Union, but the government is expected to start exit negotiations later this month, setting the clock running on a two-year period to arrange an orderly withdrawal from the bloc.Under the plans outlined on Wednesday, Mr. Hammond created $31 billion of \u201cheadroom\u201d that will give him the resources to stimulate the economy, should the exit negotiations founder, dragging down growth.\u201cBeyond the next couple of years, the long-term economic and fiscal outlook will be heavily influenced by the post-Brexit relationship between the U.K. and the E.U.,\u201d Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, wrote in an analysis.\u201cThe chancellor continues to take a low-risk approach to fiscal policy, setting generous fiscal targets with sufficient headroom in case growth slows by more than expected,\u201d he added.Though Mr. Hammond pledged an additional $2.4 billion in spending over three years for social services, he balanced that commitment by increasing the rate of national insurance contributions \u2014 the name for the taxes that fund welfare programs and the state pension \u2014 paid by self-employed workers.Currently, their contributions are levied at a lower rate. Mr. Hammond said that this was \u201cnot fair to the 85 percent of workers\u201d who were not self-employed.However, the increase in national insurance appeared to be a breach of the manifesto of Mr. Hammond\u2019s Conservative Party, which promised before the 2015 election that it would not increase the value-added tax, the income tax or the national insurance payments.The budget also included tax increases affecting some company owners and investors, as well as aid for some businesses, including all but the largest pubs.The spending plan was criticized by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor from the opposition Labour Party, who described the national insurance changes as an \u201cunfair\u201d attack \u201con the self-employed low- and middle-earners.\u201d\u201cInstead of equipping our country for Brexit, he is building our economy on sand,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said in a statement.Mr. Pickering argued that, despite the positive economic news so far, Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union would still impose significant costs on the economy and could reduce the country\u2019s long-term potential growth rate to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent. \u201cAn increase in spending on projects designed to boost productivity and raise trend growth would be well timed,\u201d he added.Overall, when compared with forecasts made last year \u2014 before the referendum \u2014 by Britain\u2019s independent Office for Budget Responsibility, \u201cBrexit looks still set to cost the taxpayer at least $120 billion,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump said only that the effort would be financed from a mix of private and public sources, and that it \u201cwill be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and hire American.\u201d He also offered one specific example: a requirement that American pipelines be made with American steel.Mr. Trump\u2019s wide-ranging speech touched on many of the problems in American life and promised solutions \u2014 but details were in short supply.He promised to \u201crestart the engine of the American economy.\u201d The American economy is in the midst of one of the longest periods of continuous growth in the nation\u2019s history, though the pace of growth has been tepid.Reporters from The New York Times fact checked President Trump\u2019s first address to Congress.He promised to stop drugs \u201cfrom pouring into our country.\u201dHe described the low quality of public education as \u201cthe civil rights issue of our time,\u201d and he called for legislation to fund \u201cschool choice for disadvantaged youth,\u201d meaning that some students would receive vouchers they could use to pay tuition at private schools. But he did not define which students should get such vouchers, nor what would be done for the students left in public schools.Mr. Trump did offer specific examples of his commitment to reduce regulation.He said that he had stopped one of the regulations \u201cthat threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners,\u201d referring to a rule that restricted the dumping of mining debris in streams. He also noted his executive order requiring federal agencies to offset the cost of each new regulation by eliminating at least two existing rules.And Mr. Trump called for changes to expedite the approval of new medications, addressing what he described as a \u201cslow and burdensome approval process\u201d that prevents potentially lifesaving drugs from reaching people who are dying.If regulations are reduced, he said, \u201cour children will grow up in a nation of miracles.\u201dThere is an inherent trade-off between speed and safety in the drug approval process, and the proper balance is the subject of a long-running debate. The government wants to prevent harmful drugs from entering the marketplace, so it sometimes delays the availability of helpful drugs.

{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Top Tech Investor Is Betting Big on Trump", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byThe world\u2019s largest technology investor is preparing to ramp up his bet on the Trump economy.Masayoshi Son, the billionaire technology entrepreneur from Japan, promised President Trump late last year that he would create 50,000 new jobs in the United States through a $100 billion technology fund.Now, Mr. Son and his financial advisers are weighing several major possible deals for Sprint, the struggling American wireless operator controlled by Mr. Son\u2019s SoftBank.Be it a tie-up with T-Mobile U.S., Sprint\u2019s closest competitor, or a more ambitious marriage with the cable colossus Comcast, a transaction would allow Mr. Son to fulfill a long-held ambition to invest aggressively in wireless networks in the United States and enable next-generation mobile technology.Last month, several executives from SoftBank spent a day in Washington talking to senior members of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team, according to bankers briefed on these meetings.The talks and the rush to assess potential deals for Sprint, the country\u2019s fourth-largest mobile operator, highlight how the Trump administration\u2019s push for lighter regulation and lower taxes has been a powerful lure for cash-rich investors the world over.In their presentations, the SoftBank executives said that because of a lack of advanced digital investments, the competitiveness of the United States economy was at risk. And the executives made the case, quite strongly, that Mr. Son was committed to playing a major role in addressing this issue through a spate of job-creating investments.The discussions were purposely broad in nature, according to investment bankers who were briefed on the discussions. Until the latest government-sponsored auction for spectrum bands finishes in late April, wireless companies are prohibited, owing to concerns about collusion, from pursuing various tie-ups.A Sprint hookup with T-Mobile U.S., Comcast, or any large wireless or cable operator is no slam dunk. For years, federal regulators have opposed such transactions for fear of hurting consumers.Nevertheless, SoftBank seems to be seizing the opportunity of the moment \u2014 one highlighted by numerous analyst reports arguing for Sprint and T-Mobile U.S. to come together.Through a spokesman, SoftBank declined to comment on its plans for Sprint.This emphasis on big technology investments as a selling point for the merger rides in part on a wave of hope that the Trump administration will push for a sharp increase in infrastructure investing as a way to kick-start higher levels of United States growth.Analysts, however, note that in the past six years when Washington frowned upon wireless mergers \u2014 first between AT&T and T-Mobile U.S., and then Sprint and T-Mobile U.S. \u2014 consumers benefited from the ruthless price war among the four major carriers.Moreover, this cutthroat environment has forced the two smaller players, Sprint and T-Mobile U.S., to become more innovative and efficient.\u201cThe Federal Communications Commission looks very smart for blocking the AT&T T-Mobile deal,\u201d said Philip Cusick, a telecommunications expert with JPMorgan Chase. \u201cFive years ago, Sprint and T-Mobile were irrelevant. Now we are seeing them drive down prices. Why would you want to change that?\u201dThat would mean pushing the companies to invest aggressively in the type of fiber technology that will support the next generation of wireless investments before it is too late.\u201cYou want these companies to invest and compete,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, a telecommunications expert at New Street Research who has argued in recent research reports for a Sprint merger with T-Mobile U.S. \u201cThis infrastructure will underlie the entire digital economy, and if it remains weak, compared to Japan and China, then the competitiveness of our economy is at risk.\u201dThis, more or less to a T, sums up the view of Mr. Son and his top SoftBank executives. And while for regulatory reasons they have been extremely careful to not \u2014 publicly or privately \u2014 advocate for a merger, they have not been shy in warning about what might happen to the United States economy if it continues to fall behind in the race for global digital supremacy.Those in favor of a Sprint deal have also pointed out that the two giants, AT&T and Verizon Communications, while making their own digital investment bets, have been diversifying by pursuing media deals, like Verizon\u2019s acquisition of Yahoo and AT&T\u2019s purchase of DirectTV.So, the argument goes, with the two leading players focused on their media ambitions and with T-Mobile U.S. and Sprint not generating enough cash to invest at the needed scale, a Sprint hookup with its slightly larger peer has never been more critical.Of course, a deal could happen only if Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile U.S., agreed to merge. Bankers also do not discount the possibility of a cable deal titan like John C. Malone swooping in to buy T-Mobile U.S.At a bit over $70 billion in combined revenue, a merged company would still trail far behind Verizon and AT&T, which generate about $125 billion and $163 billion in sales respectively.Yet a larger third operator could immediately increase investments from the current $5 billion (for the two smaller companies combined) as Mr. Son pulls out the stops to make his network the class of the competition, as he has done in Japan.Bankers who have spoken to SoftBank executives say a merged company could easily double its annual outlay to more than $10 billion.While SoftBank and Mr. Son have pitched a merger as a boon for investment-starved digital America, it is also true that Sprint, as the smallest, most financially challenged of the four companies, needs to do some kind of deal to stay relevant.Thanks to the financial engineering talents of Rajeev Misra, the former Deutsche Bank executive who has emerged as one of Mr. Son\u2019s more influential advisers, Sprint has been able to reduce punitive financing by issuing cheaper bonds secured by the company\u2019s access to spectrum airwaves.These types of flashy innovations are not a long-term strategy, however. And as the company continues its policy of slashing prices to keep pressure on its larger competitors, its financial position will remain precarious, with a debt pile of $33 billion.Sprint, under Mr. Son, has become more profitable, and the quality of its network has improved sharply. But analysts and investors remain divided as to how long Sprint can remain a stand-alone company.\u201cIt is completely binary,\u201d said Mr. Chaplin, the analyst from New Street. \u201cThere are those who believe in Masa\u2019s vision and those who believe the company is a house of cards.\u201dWhat is more, with phone prices still falling, regulators need not be in a hurry to sign off on a merger.\u201cFor Sprint,\u201d Mr. Chaplin said, \u201cthe waiting is more complicated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I made my first assault on the host stand just after 6:30 one weeknight. (The place doesn\u2019t do reservations.) I was alone and willing to wait even if it took until closing time \u2014 11 that night. What an optimist I was in those days. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking any more names tonight,\u201d a host announced.Later, I learned to stage my raids between 2 and 4 in the afternoon, not hours when I typically crave raw fish. One lucky day, I was in within 30 minutes and out before sunset.One can order sushi by the piece, but the servers and the printed menu heavily push the three \u201cTrust Me\u201d meals. This is a variant on omakase, which roughly means \u201cI trust the chef,\u201d but a Trust Me is not an omakase meal. It is, essentially, a set menu served in waves. All three start with chilled edamame and slices of tuna in ponzu, move on to several small courses of nigiri and end with a hand roll or two. The simplest, Trust Me Lite, is $27 and includes four pieces of nigiri; the most expensive is the Nozawa Trust Me, with 12 pieces of sushi and two hand rolls at a price of $51.Five restaurants that do sushi well for under $60.The rice is not only warm. It\u2019s seasoned with so much vinegar that it\u2019s almost pickled. This makes it appealingly energetic, a quality that sets it apart from the rest of the food.The fish is uniformly soft and pretty, but none of it tastes much like fish. Sweet shrimp and sea scallops were both exactly as they should be. But there was no heft to the tuna, no depth to the salmon, and anybody who happens to like shiny-skinned, fishy-tasting species like mackerel or sardines is in the wrong restaurant.The menu and website make much of Mr. Nozawa\u2019s connections among elite fishmongers, but the selection at Sugarfish rarely rises above entry level. The menu lists certain specials \u201cwhen available.\u201d Sea urchin is one; the last time I went, there wasn\u2019t any. This has to be the only sushi restaurant in New York that can\u2019t get its hands on sea urchin.Fresh wasabi may be too much to ask at Sugarfish\u2019s prices, but there is no wasabi at all under the fish. This is weird. Where sushi is concerned, wasabi isn\u2019t just a condiment. It\u2019s the air in the tires. Sugarfish lets you apply your own from some concentric bloops of stuff that tastes like watery horseradish and looks like a green version of the poop emoji, without the smile.By the end of my third meal, I was desperate for some break in the monotony. If Mr. Nozawa had suddenly materialized to yell at me, I would have given him flowers.Advertisement"}

But the demands of those still demonstrating have hardened, and turned even further to the right.Protesters in the Copacabana seafront area of Rio de Janeiro and along Paulista Avenue in S\u00e3o Paulo brandished posters, shouted slogans and even carried a cardboard cutout of S\u00e9rgio Moro, a federal judge who has sentenced dozens involved in the Operation Car Wash case.But the number of protesters was significantly smaller than before the impeachment, and the protesters on Sunday did not target Mr. Temer, despite a growing number of references to him and his ministers in leaked corruption testimonies. Some demonstrators even argued that removing Mr. Temer would only create more political instability.\u201cIt is a delicate moment,\u201d said Ricardo Ismael, a professor of political science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, who was observing the protests. \u201cWhat do you do to renovate leaders, what do you do to renovate parties?\u201dIn addition to voicing support for the inquiry into the scandal, many of those protesting in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo also called for more freedom to bear arms and even advocated military intervention in the government, as happened in 1964, when a coup led to 21 years of dictatorship.In Rio de Janeiro, Alexsandro Borges, 47, a businessman marching with other retired soldiers from a parachute regiment, said he supported military intervention.\u201cWith the state Brazil is in, I don\u2019t see another option,\u201d he said.Mr. Borges added that Brazilians should have more freedom to carry arms.\u201cWe would like the right to defend ourselves, because the government doesn\u2019t protect us,\u201d he said.The demand for more freedom to bear arms is a new development as demonstrations become more conservative, said Wagner Rom\u00e3o, a professor of political science at the State University of Campinas.Introduced in 2003, Brazil\u2019s disarmament statute made it more difficult and expensive to legally possess firearms. Hundreds of thousands of weapons were handed in during subsequent amnesties.Now, concerned by the country\u2019s high levels of homicide and violent crime, conservative protesters want the statute revoked. The Free Brazil Movement, one of the groups behind Sunday\u2019s demonstrations, includes it on a list of demands.\u201cThe cause is growing,\u201d said Edson Lopes, 70, a retired naval officer marching in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t safe anywhere.\u201dJoice Hasselmann, a conservative commentator whose YouTube broadcasts are watched by hundreds of thousands, called for an end to the disarmament statute in a speech in Rio de Janeiro.\u201cI have been robbed, I have been kidnapped, I have had a weapon held to my head,\u201d she told a cheering crowd. \u201cWhy can\u2019t a woman have a weapon at home?\u201dWith speakers railing against all the major political parties after so many of their leaders have been tied to corruption in leaked testimony, many marchers in Rio de Janeiro said they would vote in the 2018 election for Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right lawmaker from the city who has praised dictatorship-era torturers and attacked gay rights.In a December 2016 poll by the Datafolha polling institute, 9 percent said they would vote for Mr. Bolsonaro in some scenarios.In S\u00e3o Paulo, demonstrators also called for the end of the disarmament statute.\u201cA weapon is the only way we can defend our families,\u201d said Jonas Pallone, 55, a business consultant.Others said they did not want another dictatorship.\u201cIf somebody wants to elect a military person, a padre, or whatever,\u201d said Mirian Dias, 67, a retired elementary schoolteacher, \u201cit should be by the vote.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ways to Save (and Not Spend) Your Tax Refund", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserMore than 70 percent of taxpayers are expected to get refunds this year, the Internal Revenue Service reports. That represents a big opportunity, according to savings advocates and financial advisers, since many Americans struggle to set aside cash for emergencies.Last year, the average refund was nearly $2,900 \u2014 a significant amount of money for many people.\u201cFor a lot of families, it\u2019s the biggest financial event of the year,\u201d said Timothy Flacke, executive director of Commonwealth, a nonprofit in Boston that promotes saving and financial security.There is some indication that more people are focusing on saving at least part of their tax refund. In a Bankrate survey, more than a third said they would save or invest their refund this year, while just 6 percent said they would use it to splurge on a special treat, like a vacation or shopping spree. (The telephone survey, which polled 1,001 people in February, has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.)Millennials in particular were more likely to say they would save their refund, said Sarah Berger, a personal finance specialist at Bankrate. Perhaps, she said, because they have lived through a recession, they are aware of the need to save, in case of a job loss or illness.\u201cFamilies have very little liquid savings,\u201d said Erin Currier, director of Pew\u2019s financial security and mobility project.Tax refunds can offer a chance for people to save, whether by establishing a rainy-day fund or setting up a retirement account, said Mr. Flacke of Commonwealth (which was formerly known as the D2D Fund). Getting a large chunk of your annual income as a lump sum \u201cis a big deal,\u201d he said.Acting before you have the cash in hand can help make sure you save some of the refund. One option, Mr. Flacke noted, is to receive your refund by direct deposit, and have the I.R.S. divide the money into separate accounts \u2014 say, half to a savings account and half to your checking account.Mr. Flacke also said consumers might consider buying savings bonds with their tax refunds. Tax time is the only remaining opportunity for people to purchase paper savings bonds; otherwise, consumers must buy digital savings bonds from the federal government.One way to force yourself to save, said Robert Steen, a certified financial planner with USAA, is to get in the habit of talking with friends and family about your goal, whether in person or on social media.\u201cIf you share it,\u201d he said, \u201cit becomes more real.\u201dHere are some questions and answers about using tax refunds to begin saving:How can I split my tax refund?How do I buy savings bonds with my tax refund?What if my refund is very large?Refunds can act as forced savings, but an outsize refund means that you have missed out on the chance to earn interest on that money. That was not such a big deal in recent years, because interest rates on insured savings accounts have been paltry. But with rates ticking upward, there are likely better places to keep your cash.Of course, if you know you lack discipline and might be tempted to spend the extra money from your paycheck, stick with the larger refund, said Ms. Berger of Bankrate.\u201cIf you\u2019ll just spend it on things like takeout,\u201d she said, \u201cmaybe a refund is better for you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Day After Merkel\u2019s Visit, Says Germany Pays NATO and U.S. Too Little", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump criticized Germany on Saturday for paying too little to both NATO and the United States for security support, a day after he held a chilly meeting at the White House with Chancellor Angela Merkel that showcased the two leaders\u2019 disagreements.\u201cDespite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Twitter as he began his weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla.\u201cNevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!\u201d he continued.The message was misleading because no nation actually \u201cowes\u201d money to NATO; its direct funding is calculated through a formula and paid by each of the 28 nations that are members.Mr. Trump may have been referring to the fact that Germany, like most NATO countries, falls short of the alliance\u2019s guideline that each member should allocate 2 percent of its gross domestic product to military spending, but that money is not intended to be paid to NATO or to the United States.Mr. Trump expressed deep skepticism during his campaign about the utility of NATO, and while he has praised the organization since taking office, he has made it clear that he believes the member countries must contribute more to an alliance that guarantees a common defense for all who belong to it.At the White House on Friday, Ms. Merkel said that Germany would meet its previously stated goal of increasing its military spending to 2 percent of its G.D.P. by 2024.Mr. Trump said on Friday that he had thanked Ms. Merkel for that commitment, but hinted that he was impatient over whether Germany and other countries would \u201cpay what they owe.\u201d\u201cMany nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States,\u201d the president said.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democracy, Disrupted", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byAs the forces of reaction outpace movements predicated on the ideal of progress, and as traditional norms of political competition are tossed aside, it\u2019s clear that the internet and social media have succeeded in doing what many feared and some hoped they would. They have disrupted and destroyed institutional constraints on what can be said, when and where it can be said and who can say it.Even though in one sense President Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 fulfilled conventional expectations \u2014 because it prevented a third straight Democratic term in the White House \u2014 it also revealed that the internet and its offspring have overridden the traditional American political system of alternating left-right advantage. They are contributing \u2014 perhaps irreversibly \u2014 to the decay of traditional moral and ethical constraints in American politics.Such a regime, in his view, would keep the trappings of democracy, including seemingly free elections, while leaders would control the election process, the media and the scope of permissible debate. \u201cWhat you get is a country that is de facto less free.\u201da great thing for getting additional layers of transparency. It was true for Donald Trump as it was for Bernie Sanders; the internet ended smoke-filled back rooms, deal-cutting moved from back room to a true campaign, with a more general population. Maybe an unwashed population, but that\u2019s the beauty of American politics with 350 million people.Goodstein noted, however, \u201ca horrible development on the internet\u201d last year:In this cycle you saw hate speech retweeted and echoed, by partisan hacks, the Jewish star used in neo-Nazi posts. There is no governing body, so I think it\u2019s going to get worse, more people jumping into the gutter.According to Persily, the Trump campaign was \u201ctotally unprecedented in its breaking of established norms of politics.\u201d He argues thatthis type of campaign is only successful in a context in which certain established institutions \u2014 particularly, the mainstream media and political party organizations \u2014 have lost most of their power, both in the United States and around the world.The Trump campaign is the most recent beneficiary of the collapse of once-dominant organizations:The void these eroding institutions have left was filled by an unmediated, populist nationalism tailor-made for the internet age. We see it in the rise of the Five Star Movement in Italy and the Pirate Party in Iceland. We see it in the successful use of social media in the Brexit referendum, in which supporters were seven times more numerous on Twitter and five times more active on Instagram. And we see it in the pervasive fears of government leaders throughout Europe, who worried well before the American election that Russian propaganda and other internet tactics might sway their electorates.The influence of the internet is the latest manifestation of the weakening of the two major American political parties over the past century, with the Civil Service undermining patronage, the rise of mass media altering communication, campaign finance law empowering donors independent of the parties, and the ascendance of direct primaries gutting the power of party bosses to pick nominees.Neither party appeared to have a mechanism of internal correction. Neither could muster the wise elders to steer a more conventional course. Neither could use its congressional leadership to regain control of the party through its powers of governance. Neither could lay claim to financial resources that would compel a measure of candidate loyalty. Neither could even exert influence though party endorsements.The result:The parties proved hollow vehicles that offered little organizational resistance to capture by outsiders. And what was captured appeared little more than a brand, certainly not the vibrant organizations that are heralded as the indispensable glue of democratic politics.Issacharoff was even more concerned about the future of democratic politics in a talk, \u201cAnxieties of Democracy,\u201d that he gave in February at the University of Texas law school.\u201cWe are witnessing a period of deep challenge to the core claims of democracy to be the superior form of political organization of civilized peoples,\u201d he told his audience:The current moment of democratic uncertainty draws from four central institutional challenges, each one a compromise of how democracy was consolidated over the past few centuries. First, the accelerated decline of political parties and other institutional forms of engagement; second, the weakness of the legislative branches; third, the loss of a sense of social cohesion; and fourth, the decline in democratic state competence.In a phone interview, Issacharoff cited the emergence of internet-based methods of communication as a major contributing factor in the deterioration of political parties.\u201cTechnology has overtaken one of the basic functions you needed political parties for in the past, communication with voters,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media has changed all of that, candidates now have direct access through email, blogs and Twitter,\u201d along with Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and other platforms.Teams of hackers, operating with varying levels of resources and at various distances from the central chain of command, had a lot of license to poke and prod and see what they could come up with. Some of these people found it easier to do certain kinds of things \u2014 like break into Podesta\u2019s emails \u2014 than they had expected. Having obtained a windfall, they were then given license to push it even further.The question now is who benefits more from the digital revolution and the ubiquity of social media, the left or the right?It seems to me this is not a question about ideological placement but more about organizational or movement strategy. As long as I am in opposition, the payoff is higher in investing in digital infrastructure and thereby channeling the activities and enthusiasm of my supporters than when in power. So I would expect a re-emergence of political activity, for example in the form of alternative news sources, on the liberal side in the coming years.By qualitatively expanding the pool of participants, social media may thus be substantially contributing to some of the vivid examples of political disruption that we have witnessed over the past few years across and beyond the Western world: from the spread of protest movements to the sudden rise of new parties such as the Five Star Movement in Italy and Podemos in Spain, from the ascent of populist leaders all across Europe to electoral upheavals such as the Brexit referendum and the surge of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in the United States 2016 Presidential elections.The internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time. Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern, and television, radio, magazines, books, gave us the one-to-many pattern, the internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.Shirky continues:The second big change is that, as all media gets digitized, the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media, meaning that phone calls migrate to the internet, magazines migrate to the internet, movies migrate to the internet. And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium. Put another way, media is increasingly less just a source of information, and it is increasingly more a site of coordination, because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well.And the third big change, according to Shirky, is that members of the former audiencecan now also be producers and not consumers. Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well, because the same equipment \u2014 phones, computers \u2014 let you consume and produce. It\u2019s as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free; it\u2019s like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons.There is good reason to think that the disruptive forces at work in the United States \u2014 as they expand the universe of the politically engaged and open the debate to millions who previously paid little or no attention \u2014 may do more to damage the left than strengthen it. In other words, just as the use of negative campaign ads and campaign finance loopholes to channel suspect contributions eventually became routine, so too will be the use of social media to confuse and mislead the electorate.Of course, this problem goes much deeper than the internet. Sam Greene of King\u2019s College London put it this way in an email:Our politics are vulnerable to nefarious influences \u2014 whether of the Kremlin variety or the Breitbart variety \u2014 not because our information landscape is open and fluid, but because voters\u2019 perceptions have become untethered from reality. For reasons that are both complex and debatable, very many voters have stopped seeing government as a tool for the production of the common good, and have instead turned to politicians (and others) who at least make them feel good. Thus, the news we consume has become as much about emotion and identity as about facts. That\u2019s where the vulnerability comes in, and its roots are in our politics \u2014 not in the internet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Norway Is No. 1 in Happiness. The U.S., Sadly, Is No. 14.", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byNorwegians have one more reason to smile, not that they need it.After placing fourth last year, Norway is now the world\u2019s happiest country, according to the 2017 World Happiness Report, released on Monday. The Central African Republic was the least happy of 155 countries.The authors of the report found that a half-dozen socioeconomic factors explain much of the difference in happiness among countries, but that social factors play an underappreciated role. As evidence, they cite periods of substantial economic growth that were nonetheless matched by declining happiness in China and the United States, which ranked 14th.Even in Norway and several other Nordic countries that dominated the top of the list, economics alone did not explain the high rates of happiness.\u201cIt takes good social foundations and trust,\u201d said John Helliwell, one of the report\u2019s editors and a professor emeritus in the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia.The report was prepared by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, an international panel of social scientists convened by the United Nations. It was edited by Dr. Helliwell; Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Columbia University economist; and Richard Layard, of the London School of Economics.\u201cPlease imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?\u201dHumanity is about halfway up the ladder, with an average global score of 5.3, based on hundreds of thousands of surveys conducted by Gallup over those years. The top five countries \u2014 Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland and Finland \u2014 all have scores just above or below 7.5. The Central African Republic\u2019s score is nearly 2.7.The authors found that three-quarters of the variation among countries can be explained by six economic and social factors: gross domestic product per capita (a basic measure of national wealth); healthy years of life expectancy; social support (having someone to rely on during times of trouble); trust (a perceived absence of corruption in government and business); the perceived freedom to make life choices; and generosity (measured by donations).Still, there are outliers.In Latin America, life evaluations are about 0.6 points higher on average than would otherwise be predicted by those indicators. East Asian countries have the opposite problem, reporting less happiness than would be expected based on those factors. In both cases, the authors credit, at least in part, cultural differences.Still, they argue that those six factors explain much of the variation in happiness around the world \u2014 and that nations ignore the social factors at their own peril.Take the United States, which ranked 14th this year. Despite gains in per capita income and healthy years of life expectancy, happiness in the United States declined 0.51 points between the two-year periods ending in 2007 and 2016, they found.\u201cWe\u2019re getting richer, but our social capital is deteriorating,\u201d Dr. Sachs said.Social support, trust, perceived freedom and generosity all suppress happiness in America. And to offset that drag economically, gross domestic product per capita would have to rise from about $53,000 to $133,000, he argues.\u201cThe country is mired in a roiling social crisis that is getting worse,\u201d he wrote in a chapter dedicated to America\u2019s flagging happiness. \u201cYet the dominant political discourse is all about raising the rate of economic growth.\u201dTo fix that social fraying, Dr. Sachs argues policy makers should work toward campaign finance reform, reducing income and wealth inequality, improving social relations between native-born and immigrant populations, overcoming the national culture of fear induced by the Sept. 11 attacks, and improving the educational system.Advertisement"}

Now he is contending with a thicket of ethical and legal considerations as his former boss \u2014 Donald J. Trump \u2014 serves as president.But Mr. Danziger, previously a top executive at such huge brands as Wyndham and Starwood, is plowing ahead with plans for the company\u2019s new Scion chain of hotels. These hotels will offer a four-star alternative to the company\u2019s five-star luxury properties.Last week, Mr. Danziger spoke to The New York Times about Scion and the issues that the new hotels present for the company. Below are excerpts from the interview.How closely involved are Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump in Scion and in meeting with partners?Very much. And when Ivanka was involved, too. That\u2019s why I joined this company. They really are incredible people.They are deeply involved in the hotel company\u2019s growth and branding efforts. They will meet with anyone if I ask them to.Has the presidency affected the interest of potential partners in making a deal?That\u2019s really hard to answer. No one is calling us and saying, \u2018Hey, because Donald Trump is president, I want to do a hotel with you,\u2019 or \u2018Because Donald Trump is president, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re calling me.\u2019 That\u2019s not the case. I really do think that we sort of stand on our own. I know that sounds maybe a little Pollyanna. But the company has a good reputation.To the extent that the presidency has had any effect on us it might be in one or two hotels that would have protests or whatnot. We\u2019re running a business. We\u2019re running brands; we\u2019re adding brands. I can\u2019t do a tie-in between the two.How are you navigating the ethical concerns that come with the presidency? I believe that the largest growth for all of our brands would have been international. But that\u2019s off the table.We do have the two in Indonesia underway now, as they\u2019ve been in place for a couple years, I think. But we\u2019re not growing the brands outside the United States.Are you prohibiting the use of foreign money in United States-based deals?There is not a blanket rule and, of course, still would be subject to the approval process.Does part of the vetting involve the particular county where the money comes from? We\u2019re all working hard at trying to be sure we do the right thing. For example, we might say at an early stage that we want to know who the equity partners are. Let\u2019s check that to the extent we can. Let\u2019s say that the financing or mezzanine financing will be a typical source like a United States bank, or lending institution, something like that, and subject to final approval by us when the deal gets finalized. That\u2019s about all you can do at an early stage because a developer may not have it all done.We\u2019ll use background firm checks, we\u2019ll use the ethics group process and do everything humanly possibly to validate the people involved in the transaction.What if a deal does not satisfy the ethics monitors? I\u2019m never going to try to talk an ethics group \u2014 whose job it is to be protective of all constituents involved \u2014 into it if we can\u2019t satisfactorily answer their questions. Then the deal won\u2019t happen.Where do you see hotel growth while Trump is in the White House?Obviously, in all brands we are limited to domestic growth now because, whereas eight months ago I might have been talking to you about the 40 hotels I want to do internationally, now I\u2019m just talking to you about what is going to happen from sea to shining sea.How many letters of intent do you have with possible Scion partners?The number is now, let\u2019s just say, around 30. The example is, guys, there were three this week.Are you telling partners not to talk to the press? To be honest, I never thought I\u2019d have to do that, but we have to do that.They want to have their face in the paper and the hotel announced for whatever reasons, but we are telling people now you just can\u2019t talk to the press about a deal until we\u2019ve released that there is a deal.Advertisement"}

Since Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997, the election of the chief executive \u2014 which is performed by a special 1,200-member committee stacked in Beijing\u2019s favor \u2014 has generally been a foregone conclusion. But this year China\u2019s leaders may not be able to dictate the outcome. A faction of powerful local business interests sidelined during the last election, in 2012, will come out on top no matter the result of the vote itself.The more formidable challenger is John Tsang Chun-wah, Mr. Leung\u2019s former finance secretary, whose folksy style and smooth P.R. skills contrast with Ms. Lam\u2019s stern and strait-jacketed ways. Mr. Tsang has jokingly called the chief executive position a \u201cthankless, rotten job.\u201d His tickling likeness to the mustachioed Pringles character has earned him the endearing nickname Uncle Chips. Mr. Tsang\u2019s platform promotes conciliation between the government and the various opposition forces, a popular view. He leads Ms. Lam by some 20 percentage points in many recent polls.The pro-democracy camp, which has no credible candidate of its own but is eager to see Ms. Lam defeated (if only to spite Beijing), is firmly behind Mr. Tsang. And for once, it has a fighting chance of getting what it wants.With Mr. Leung now out of the race for chief executive, the Tang Camp has already won half the battle. The question is how much more it can gain.The firmly pro-business Mr. Tsang is, logically, its preferred candidate for chief executive. Mr. Leung\u2019s supporters have staged a rear-guard action to smear him, pointing to Mr. Tsang\u2019s American background \u2014 he graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York and holds degrees from M.I.T. and Harvard \u2014 as evidence that he would serve United States interests.So far Mr. Tsang has seemed unlikely to get waylaid by the conspiracy theories, but were he to, most of his votes would likely shift to Mr. Woo. More interesting, even if he did lose ground to Ms. Lam, or lost the election itself, the Tang Camp might still win out.Since Ms. Lam lacks a power base of her own, were she to win the election, she would be susceptible to the influence of the Tang people surrounding her, including perhaps even to Mr. Tsang\u2019s conciliation agenda. And all the more so because that outcome might sit well enough with Beijing: The presence of another hard-line leader in Hong Kong could help it save appearances even as, out of necessity, the new government would adopt a less confrontational ruling style.Whatever the result of Sunday\u2019s election, in other words, the Leung Camp can only lose, and the Tang Camp can only win. After five long years of Mr. Leung\u2019s painfully divisive administration, a reprieve may finally have come for the people of Hong Kong.Yi-Zheng Lian is a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs.Advertisement"}

Trump campaigns in braggadocio and governs in bombast.Whatever one thinks of Trump\u2019s merits, this competence gap raises profound questions about our national direction. If the administration can\u2019t repeal Obamacare \u2014 or manage friendly relations with allies like Mexico or Australia \u2014 how will it possibly accomplish something complicated like tax reform?Failure and weakness also build on themselves, and the health care debacle will make it more difficult for Trump to get his way with Congress on other issues. As people recognize that the emperor is wearing no clothes, that perception of weakness will spiral.One of the underlying problems is Trump\u2019s penchant for personnel choices that are bafflingly bad or ethically challenged or both. Mike Flynn was perhaps the best-known example.Members of the organization use a lowercase v as a middle initial, and The Forward noted that Gorka has presented his name as Sebastian L.v. Gorka.As Ana Navarro, a G.O.P. strategist, tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump attracts some of the shadiest, darkest, weirdest people around him.\u201dIn fairness, Trump has also appointed plenty of solid people: Jim Mattis, Elaine Chao, H. R. McMaster, Dina Powell, Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin and more. And Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, is a first-rate lawyer.So see the failure of the Republican health care bill through a larger prism: The measure collapsed not just because it was a dreadful bill (a tax cut for the wealthy financed by dropping health coverage for the needy). It also failed as a prime example of the Trump administration\u2019s competence gap.Democrats may feel reassured, because ineptitude may impede some of Trump\u2019s worst initiatives. But even if Trump is unable to build, he may be able to destroy: I fear that his health care \u201cplan\u201d now is to suffocate Obamacare by failing to enforce the insurance mandate, and then claim that its spasms are inevitable.Of all the national politicians I\u2019ve met over the decades, Trump may be the one least interested in government or policy; he\u2019s absorbed simply with himself. And what we\u2019re seeing more clearly now is that he has crafted an administration in his own image: vain, narcissistic and dangerous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SpaceX Launches a Satellite With a Partly Used Rocket", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byA Falcon 9 rocket from SpaceX \u2014 formally Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, based in Hawthorne, Calif. \u2014 lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to deposit the payload, a telecommunications satellite that will service Latin America, in the proper orbit.What was noteworthy was that the first stage, or booster, of the rocket had already flown once before. It could conceivably launch again, since it returned in one piece, landing on a floating platform in the Atlantic.\u201cIt did this mission perfectly,\u201d Mr. Musk said during a SpaceX broadcast of the launch. \u201cIt dropped off the second stage, came back and landed on the drone ship. Right in the bulls-eye.\u201d\u201cIt means you can fly and refly an orbital class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket,\u201d Mr. Musk said.Until now, almost all rockets have been single use. Once the fuel is spent, a rocket stage plummets to Earth, a quick demise to a complex machine that cost tens of millions of dollars to build.Mr. Musk has likened that to scrapping a 747 jet after one flight.After the platform returned to port in Jacksonville, Fla., the booster was refurbished, tested and deemed ready for another flight. SES, the company that owns and operates the satellite launched Thursday, was the first commercial customer for a Falcon 9 in 2013, and it signed up for the first flight with a recycled booster at a discount from the usual $62 million launch price. Neither SES nor SpaceX has publicly said how large the discount was.Mr. Musk has suggested that rocket launches could eventually be much cheaper because the cost of rocket propellants is less than 1 percent of the full price for a launch. So if a rocket could simply be refueled like a jetliner for another flight, the cost of space travel could drop to a fraction of what it is now.How that might play out in practice is still unclear. The same reasoning led NASA to develop space shuttles in the 1970s, but the savings never materialized because of the extensive refurbishment of the orbiters needed between flights. \u201cWe were pushing a lot of technology,\u201d said Daniel Dumbacher, a former NASA official who is now a professor at Purdue University.SpaceX, however, has a better chance. The Falcon 9 was designed from the start to be reusable. Its engines, for example, do not offer cutting-edge performance \u2014 but that means they are simpler and more robust, and thus easier, faster and cheaper to get ready for the next flight.\u201cThey\u2019ve taken the right first steps,\u201d Mr. Dumbacher said. \u201cThis is where you just have to get out and do it.\u201dIn the near term, reusable rockets could lower the cost of launching satellites and thus make space affordable to more companies for more uses. Currently, most satellites are used for telecommunications or for observations of the Earth.For his Mars dreams, Mr. Musk envisions a gargantuan spaceship he calls the Interplanetary Transport System that would someday transport humans. That would be far too expensive to be thrown away, so SpaceX needs to solve the reusability problem.Perhaps an even greater challenge is finding a way to finance the development of such a large rocket. Today, most of SpaceX\u2019s revenue comes from launching satellites for commercial companies and from NASA contracts to take cargo and, soon, astronauts to the International Space Station.Advertisement"}

The 2,906-square-foot apartment is in the Alter Hof, or Old Court, an area that served as the first fixed seat of the imperial government in Germany in the 14th century, under King Ludwig IV.The home has under-floor heating and district heating, as well as a system to control lighting, heating and other features remotely or automatically. Two parking spaces are available in the garage. The land under the building is leasehold, fully paid through the end of its term in 2070.

{"Headline": "Congress Is Headed to Another Government Funding Showdown", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byCongressional memoWASHINGTON \u2014 Ten legislative days before funding would run out, Congress is heading toward another government shutdown showdown. Democrats and many Republicans are likely to refuse to go along with President Trump\u2019s request for money for a border wall financed in part by outsize cuts to medical research. And the specter of another fight over Planned Parenthood funding is also in the offing.Fresh off the humiliating implosion of the House health care bill last week, Mr. Trump appears to be courting another disaster. To help pay for his proposed border wall with Mexico, Mr. Trump has asked for $18 billion in cuts to domestic programs, including many with broad bipartisan support, and an additional $1.5 billion in funding as part of the spending bill to keep the government open for the rest of the year.Democrats said such a plan would arrive dead at the doorstep of the Senate, and Republicans on Tuesday sounded no more enthusiastic. \u201cWe just voted to plus up the N.I.H.,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who has also been lukewarm on the border wall plan. \u201cIt would be difficult to get the votes to then cut it.\u201dCongressional Republicans are desperate to avoid another legislative failure and demonstrate their ability to effectively govern with one-party control of Washington. Another fight over funding to keep the government open would do little to advance their cause.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals also run counter to House and Senate appropriators, who have been working in a bipartisan manner for weeks trying to come up with a series of spending bills that could be bundled together in some form to avoid a shutdown.The spending talks also could be threatened by pledges of House Republicans to stop funding Planned Parenthood, a proposition that has little chance of success in the Senate.For now, House Republicans are pressing ahead to attack Planned Parenthood through either a revived health care bill or a bill to overhaul the tax code, both of which would require only 51 Senate votes to pass, known as reconciliation. \u201cWe think reconciliation is the tool, because that gets it into law,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Tuesday.But if that process seems to lose steam \u2014 it is going to be difficult for the House to put together another health care plan or any other budget plan that would defund Planned Parenthood before next month \u2014 some House Republicans may once again wage the Planned Parenthood fight, which would spell trouble for the measure.\u201cThere is a path to a positive outcome, which I define as a bipartisan omnibus,\u201d said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House appropriations committee, referring to a collection of appropriations bills cobbled together as one.\u201cIt\u2019s going to require Republican leadership to reject poison-pill riders like defunding Planned Parenthood and wasting billions of dollars on a border wall,\u201d Ms. Lowey said.The current funding bill expires on April 28, and Congress is set for a two-week recess just before that deadline.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, saw the sticky path forward from the day Mr. Trump was elected, and pushed for a longer-term spending bill, an idea the White House rebuffed.In the interim, the House Republicans\u2019 failure to get a bill to repeal the health care law passed \u2014 or even voted on \u2014 complicates the process. Some of the more conservative House Republicans, who helped bring down the bill, may want to show that they have muscle to flex on the spending process. But others may be eager to build confidence among voters and have a spending bill pass quickly.But it remains unclear if the debacle of last week will bring House Republicans closer together in the interest of producing something or make them more factionalized. For now, they have to clear the way forward on a spending bill, tax reform and an infrastructure plan, all made more difficult by failing on health care.In the Senate there is more unity among Republicans, but not in ways that are favorable to the White House. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend a lot of money on a wall,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \u201cI\u2019m not going to support a big cut to the N.I.H. I\u2019m not going to support big cuts to the State Department.\u201dDemocrats on the other hand feel emboldened. They say Republicans will need their votes to pass a measure to keep the government open, and they will continue to fight against Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed cuts and the border wall.\u201cThe administration is asking the American taxpayer to cover the cost of a wall \u2014 unneeded, ineffective, absurdly expensive \u2014 that Mexico was supposed to pay for, and he is cutting programs that are vital to the middle class in order to get that done,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. Mr. Schumer added that he did not see that happening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Health Care Crackup", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byThe Republican health care bill could represent the moment when the old order of American politics completely cracks up, the end of a certain era in American politics.That era began around 1974, when Ted Kennedy introduced a bill to supplement America\u2019s employer-based insurance system with a government program. The Democratic dream of universal coverage continued through Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as first lady and reached a partial culmination with the passage of Obamacare.Combating government health care was a central Republican preoccupation through all that time, and the passage of Obamacare provoked the Tea Party reaction and final arrival of Goldwaterite populist conservatism.By 2010, however, both the Obama administration and the Tea Party opposition were out of step with the times. They both still thought the big political issues in American life were universal health care and the size of government.In fact, another set of problems had magnified and come to overshadow the old set. This new set included:First, the crisis of opportunity. People with fewer skills were seeing their wages stagnate, the labor markets evaporate. Second, the crisis of solidarity. The social fabric, especially for those without a college degree, was disintegrating \u2014 marriage rates plummeting, opiate abuse rates rising. Third, the crisis of authority. Distrust in major institutions crossed some sort of threshold. People had so lost trust in government, the media, the leadership class in general, that they were willing to abandon truth and decorum and embrace authoritarian thuggery to blow it all up.If President Obama had made these crises the center of his administration, instead of the A.C.A., Democrats wouldn\u2019t have lost Congress and the White House. If the Tea Party had understood the first two of these crises, there would have been no opening for Donald Trump.Trump came along and exploited these crises. But if his administration\u2019s health care approach teaches us anything, it is that he has no positive agenda for addressing them. He can tap into working class anxiety negatively, by harnessing hostility toward immigrants, foreigners and the poor. But he can\u2019t come up with a positive agenda to make working class life more secure.So we have a group of Freedom Caucus Republicans who still think the major problems in the country today can be cured with tax and spending cuts. We have a Trump administration that has populist impulses but no actual populist safety net policies. And we\u2019ve got a Republican leadership in Congress mired in Reagan-era thinking and trying to pay lip service to every obsolete prejudice in the various wings of the party.You end up with this hodgepodge legislation that pleases nobody and takes the big crises afflicting our country and makes them all worse.The Republican health plan would make America\u2019s economic chasm worse. It would cut health subsidies that go to the poor while eliminating the net investment income tax, which benefits only the top 1 percent.The Republican plan would further destabilize the social fabric for those at the bottom. Throwing perhaps 10 million people off the insurance rolls will increase fear, isolation, social tension, chronic illness, suicide and bankruptcy.The Republican plan will fuel cynicism. It\u2019s being pushed through in an elitist, anti-democratic, middle of the night rush. It seems purposely designed to fail. The penalties for those who don\u2019t purchase insurance are so low they seem sure to guarantee Republican-caused death spirals in the weaker markets.This thing probably won\u2019t pass, but even if it passes it will probably lead to immense pain and disruption. That will discredit market-based social reform, cost the Republicans their congressional majorities and end what\u2019s left of the Reagan-era party.It will also point the way to a new era.The central debate in the old era was big government versus small government, the market versus the state. But now you\u2019ve got millions of people growing up in social and cultural chaos and not getting the skills they need to thrive in a technological society. This is not a problem you can solve with tax cuts.And if you don\u2019t solve this problem, voters around the world have demonstrated that they\u2019re quite willing to destroy market mechanisms to get the security they crave. They will trash free trade, cut legal skilled immigration, attack modern finance and choose state-run corporatism over dynamic free market capitalism.The core of the new era is this: If you want to preserve the market, you have to have a strong state that enables people to thrive in it. If you are pro-market, you have to be pro-state. You can come up with innovative ways to deliver state services, like affordable health care, but you can\u2019t just leave people on their own. The social fabric, the safety net and the human capital sources just aren\u2019t strong enough.New social crises transform party philosophies. We\u2019re in the middle of a transformation. But to get there we\u2019ve got to live through this final health care debacle first.Advertisement"}

Garcetti.Southern California is going through a building boom, and the city has approved a series of dense and tall projects over the ire of some neighborhood groups upset not only with what they see as overdevelopment, but also the influence of deep-pocketed special interests at City Hall. They argue a two-year moratorium will force Los Angeles to adopt uniform zoning plans to guide how neighborhoods should handle developments.Opponents \u2014 including Mr. Garcetti and labor unions \u2014 warn it would be damaging to the economy and throttle any effort to build desperately needed affordable housing here. Both arguments have been played out in television advertisements and billboards across town.Mr. Garcetti has campaigned nearly as hard against the measure as he has for his own re-election. One side note here: Mr. Garcetti, who faces 10 little-known opponents, needs to win 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff. Low turnout races can be dicey, especially with an initiative that could bring out people upset with the direction Los Angeles is taking under Mr. Garcetti.The second measure worth watching is a Los Angeles countywide sales tax increase to pay for services for the homeless. This follows a vote by Los Angeles city voters last year to finance $1.2 billion in bonds to build housing for the homeless. Both measures would require a two-thirds vote by the electorate. Considering how much money will be released should this pass, Los Angeles could offer a test in the years ahead of a key question: Can government spend its way out homelessness?(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)We want to get more of your voices in California Today.To that end, a new plan: Each Monday, we\u2019ll come up with a question for you, solicit responses, then feature a handful by the end of the week.It sounds dangerous.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Plan on Fannie and Freddie? Clues May Emerge Soon", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byFair GameBut we will know a lot more in the coming weeks as circumstances compel Trump officials to show their hand. In essence, their action or inaction on two important matters will demonstrate whether they intend to follow the Obama administration\u2019s approach to the companies \u2014 which was to keep them in federal conservatorship and drain them of capital \u2014 or take a different path, perhaps toward privatization.One of the two action items on the horizon involves what should happen to the $10 billion in earnings that Fannie and Freddie together generated in the most recent quarter.The other matter involves a court ruling last Tuesday ordering the government to produce thousands of documents it has been withholding from Fannie and Freddie shareholders, who have sued for their piece of the companies\u2019 profits that the government has taken in recent years.Diverting Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s profits has been a bonanza for Treasury; if the last quarter\u2019s payment goes through, the companies will have delivered $78 billion more to the government than they received during the financial crisis.That\u2019s one luscious honey pot. But there are a few reasons a new administration may want to stop dipping into it.First, the quarterly payments have left Fannie and Freddie dangerously undercapitalized, with the thinnest of cushions to protect against future losses. Investors have sued the government over the profit sweep, contending that it was a breach of contract and an improper taking of private property without just compensation. Both of these legal arguments are moving forward through various courts.But an even more compelling reason Mr. Mnuchin may want to let Fannie and Freddie hang on to their earnings has to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to big business to lower corporate tax rates steeply. If the plan he has outlined goes through, the value of certain assets held on Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s balance sheets would decline significantly.In the face of such a drop, the companies would have to write down the assets. And given that the companies have almost no capital cushion, they would have to draw money from Treasury to cover the losses associated with the write-downs.The assets that could be subject to a write-down came about during the mortgage crisis, when Fannie and Freddie were generating losses. Under accounting rules, when money-losing companies become profitable again \u2014 as both Fannie and Freddie did in 2013 \u2014 they are allowed to use past losses to reduce taxable income in the future. Losses that can be used in such a way become deferred tax assets.As of September 2016, the value of both companies\u2019 deferred tax assets stood at $53.8 billion. But under a lower corporate tax rate, the value of those deferred tax assets declines, as Fitch Ratings noted in a report dated last Tuesday. If corporate tax rates fell to 20 percent from the current 35 percent, for example, the companies would have to write down the value of those assets by $23 billion, Fitch said, creating the need for a taxpayer draw to cover those losses.Needless to say, this would not be desirable. And it would certainly seem to be something the Trump administration would not want to occur on its watch, especially since it had nothing to do with creating the profit sweep.I asked the Treasury if it might be considering allowing Fannie and Freddie to hold on to their earnings from the fourth quarter and subsequent quarters to protect against a taxpayer draw. A spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.This brings me to the second decision the Trump administration must soon make regarding Fannie and Freddie: Will its Justice Department continue to fight the investor lawsuits as aggressively as the department did under Mr. Obama? Or will the new administration throw in the towel, deciding these are battles it\u2019s not keen to keep waging?We will most likely know the answers to those questions by April 17. That\u2019s the deadline the government has just been given to produce thousands of documents it has been withholding from plaintiffs in one of the shareholder cases.In litigating the matter, Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department requested extreme secrecy. It withheld more than 11,000 documents from plaintiffs relating to the profit decision, arguing that the material was subject to various claims of privilege, including those covering deliberative process and presidential communication.If Mr. Trump wants to continue the fight taken up by his predecessor, his Justice Department will battle Judge Sweeney\u2019s order. If he has no appetite for such a skirmish, the documents may finally emerge.Privilege logs provided to the court show that these materials consist of emails about the profit sweep, internal government memos and confidential briefing documents among high-ranking officials at the White House, Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie.It is not clear, of course, what the documents contain. But it\u2019s a good guess they might provide further confirmation that the government knew the companies were about to become profitable when it changed the terms of the rescue, gaining access to Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s earnings to pay for something or other.I asked the Justice Department how it planned to respond to Judge Sweeney\u2019s order to produce the documents.A spokeswoman there declined to comment. But we\u2019ll know soon enough.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.In case anyone missed the significance of the site, the invitation offers a helpful clue: \u201cShould the president be in residence, another letter will follow explaining the upgraded entry/security procedures.\u201dThat\u2019s right, President Trump\u2019s members-only club, which has been called the winter White House, is the location of a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d hedge fund event organized by the Palm Beach Hedge Fund Association.David S. Goodboy, the association\u2019s founder and the event organizer, is hoping that Mr. Trump will stop by.\u201cHe is invited. Whether he comes or not is in the air,\u201d Mr. Goodboy said. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he added. \u201cIt would be great P.R. for us.\u201dThe reason for the evening is to introduce the Canadian firm Castle Ridge Asset Management (not to be confused with a Greenwich, Conn., firm with a similar name) to the Palm Beach set.\u201cIt\u2019s our debut to the U.S. markets,\u201d said Adrian de Valois-Franklin, chief executive of Castle Ridge Asset Management.The Toronto-based hedge fund pitches itself as a firm that uses artificial intelligence to invest in the market. On its website, which is illustrated with what looks like a high-tech crystal ball, it boasts of proprietary technology \u2014 called Wallace \u2014 that can \u201cpredict market events.\u201d The technology is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, the British naturalist who was a contemporary of Charles Darwin.Mr. de Valois-Franklin said he would welcome the chance to tell Mr. Trump about his firm.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard he\u2019ll be in attendance at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 coming in on Friday,\u201d he said. The event is the day before \u2014 next Thursday.A spokesman for the White House did not respond to a request for comment.It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Mr. Trump was railing against hedge funds, saying that \u201chedge fund guys are getting away with murder.\u201d On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump called for an end to the tax advantage that investment managers including hedge funds receive.But that was then, apparently.\u201cI believe he was simply speaking to his fan base, you know, his constituents,\u201d Mr. Goodboy said. \u201cThe truth is he is pulling back on those statements, the way I see it.\u201dIndeed, the president has surrounded himself with the titans of finance he once complained about \u2014 from both hedge funds and private equity.The billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn is Mr. Trump\u2019s special adviser on overhauling regulation; Steven Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, is Treasury secretary; Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a contrarian billionaire investor in distressed assets, is commerce secretary; Stephen A. Schwarzman, the billionaire co-founder of the Blackstone Group, is chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum; and John Paulson, in whose hedge fund Mr. Trump was once an investor, is an adviser.And Mar-a-Lago has gained some extra luster since Mr. Trump became president. He has visited the exclusive club multiple times and held gatherings, the most famous of which was a dinner with the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, and his wife.Diners seated in the outside dining area of the club were treated to a front-row seat of diplomatic negotiations after North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the sea and Mr. Trump, Mr. Abe and their aides scrambled to respond around a dining table.Membership doesn\u2019t come cheap: The club doubled its entry fee to $200,000 soon after Mr. Trump became president.The Palm Beach Hedge Fund Association got a foot in the door through a friend of Mr. Goodboy\u2019s who is a Mar-a-Lago club member.While he would not give a specific price, Mr. Goodboy did say the cost of hosting the event was \u201cthe price of a pretty substantial wedding,\u201d adding that it was well over $10,000. Castle Ridge is the sponsor and is paying a majority of the cost, he addedMr. Goodboy said he hoped his association\u2019s cocktail event would be a splash. It capped the event at 75 guests, but more than 100 people have expressed interest, he added. That\u2019s a far cry from the turnout that the three-year-old association had at its first event.Then, five people showed up, he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Europe\u2019s Far Right, Female Leaders Look to Female Voters", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byMemo From the United NationsUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Some of Europe\u2019s most successful far-right politicians are women. There is Marine Le Pen of France, of course. But also Frauke Petry of Germany, Siv Jensen of Norway and Pia Kjaersgaard of Denmark, who is something of a pioneer in the new wave of anti-immigrant populism sweeping through Europe.They are leading, or have recently led, what were once fringe parties \u2014 pushing their extremist views to the political mainstream and seeking to appeal to those who once eschewed their parties: female voters.Some of them are also eyeing their country\u2019s highest office. Ms. Le Pen is vying to be president of France in elections scheduled to start in April, and if she wins an expected runoff in May (a long shot, admittedly) she could be the first far-right leader to be directly elected as a European head of state.Gender issues don\u2019t much get the attention of far-right parties, whether led by men or women. The parties don\u2019t support gender quotas in politics, as many centrist and left parties do, nor do they campaign on issues like equal pay. Abortion and gay rights are not lightning rod political issues for conservatives as they are in the United States, so they tend not to be ideological tinder in Europe.Gender is a useful wedge, though, when it comes to highlighting what has become one of their main planks: a critique of immigration, particularly from the Muslim world. The European far right has long seized on the hijab as a symbol of patriarchy; more recently it has said that attacks on gays and women in Muslim enclaves are evidence of the Islamic threat to European values.Ruth Wodak, a professor at Lancaster University in Britain, called Ms. Le Pen\u2019s appeals on gender issues \u201copportunistic.\u201d\u201cThey defend \u2018our\u2019 women against harassment by foreigners \u2014 strangers, migrants, Muslim men,\u201d says Ms. Wodak, the author of \u201cThe Politics of Fear: What Right-Wing Populist Discourses Mean.\u201d \u201cHowever, they never spoke out against sexual harassment before.\u201dHow unusual is it for a woman to lead a nativist party? About as unusual as it is for a woman to head any political party. While some are part of political dynasties, as in the case of Ms. Le Pen, others are self-made.Ms. Kjaersgaard, one of the earliest forerunners of the European far right, established the Danish People\u2019s Party in 1995 and turned what were once considered fringe, racist ideas about restricting immigration into a potent political force.Her party has been crucial in supporting a minority government and has shaped policy as a result. Ms. Kjaersgaard is now the speaker of the Danish Parliament, though no longer the party leader.Ms. Jensen pushed her anti-immigrant Progress Party into a coalition government in Norway for the first time \u2014 and snagged for herself an influential cabinet post as finance minister. She describes herself as a free-market conservative in the Thatcherite tradition. But she too has seized on fears of Islam, warning in a widely criticized 2009 speech about the \u201csneaking Islamization\u201d of European society.Does the far right draw female voters? Not so much, but they are beginning to.Men are neither more \u201cnativist\u201d nor \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d compared with women, the study found, nor do women evince less \u201cdiscontent\u201d with their governments. Women by and large were deterred from voting for the radical right by other things, including the populist right\u2019s \u201cpolitical style, occasional association with historic violence, stigmatization by parts of the elite and the general public\u201d \u2014 in other words, their outlier-ness.That is where the gender of the leader can make a positive difference for the far right, said Cas Mudde, a Dutch scholar of the European far right.In the media, he argued, male leaders are often cast as power-hungry zealots. \u201cFemale politicians are represented as softer,\u201d said Mr. Mudde, who teaches at the University of Georgia. \u201cFor a radical right politician it can be actually very good.\u201dMs. Le Pen\u2019s prospects in the French polls this spring will depend significantly on her ability to woo women, just as the success of far-right parties on the Continent more broadly will rest on their ability to bridge the gender gap.Consider Nonna Mayer\u2019s research on the National Front\u2019s record.In 2002, when it was headed by Ms. Le Pen\u2019s firebrand, Holocaust-denying father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party won a far larger share of men\u2019s votes than women\u2019s. In 2012, by the time Ms. Le Pen took over the party, the gender gap had virtually vanished, only to return again in midterm polls since then.Ms. Mayer, a political scientist, said the gender gap for populist right wing parties could vary from one country to another and from one election to the next. For Ms. Le Pen, she said, \u201cthe test will be the coming presidential election.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the timing of Marine Le Pen\u2019s presidential campaign. It began last month, not this month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Choice of I.M.F. Critic Highlights Trump\u2019s Reversal of Global Policy", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byFor nearly 20 years, Adam Lerrick, a conservative economist, has been a vocal scold of global organizations like the International Monetary Fund, arguing that such institutions burn through taxpayer money and foster an insular culture of elitism, bailouts and scant accountability.Now, Mr. Lerrick, a former investment banker and a visiting scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, is set to get a chance to turn philosophy into policy, after the announcement last week that President Trump intended to nominate him as deputy under secretary of the Treasury for international finance.The selection of Mr. Lerrick, who is well known in global financial circles for his evangelical opposition to bailouts for banks, countries and investors, underscores how Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team is turning to critics of global economic policy as it seeks to reverse decades of Washington consensus.Notably, Peter Navarro, an academic and author known for his highly critical views on China\u2019s economic policies, was named a senior trade adviser to the president, with a brief to examine relations between the United States and countries like China and Germany.Mr. Lerrick\u2019s new job has not yet been formally announced, and he must be confirmed by the Senate before he can get to work.But his pending appointment signals that another major cornerstone of conventional thinking under Democratic and Republican administrations \u2014 broad support for the I.M.F., the World Bank and other international financial institutions \u2014 will be scrutinized at the highest levels of the new administration.Mr. Lerrick\u2019s official remit includes advancing the Treasury\u2019s policy agenda with America\u2019s top economic allies, but it is expected that a major part of his job \u2014 his first in government \u2014 will be to push for major changes in how the World Bank and the I.M.F. are run.His skepticism of the fund\u2019s role as presiding firefighter of the global financial system dates to the late 1990s, when he became disenchanted with the I.M.F.\u2019s response to countries in Southeast Asia experiencing runs on their currencies.In 1999, having already quit his career as a senior investment banker at Salomon Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston, Mr. Lerrick wrote a paper in which he argued that American taxpayers could save a bundle if the I.M.F. were allowed to tap global bond market funds rather than relying solely on quota-based disbursements from the United States and other large nations.In essence, Mr. Lerrick\u2019s complaint was that the fund had strayed too far from its original mandate: to provide short-term loans to developed economies running short on cash. Instead, he said, it had become a lender of first resort to developing economies in various states of financial distress.Mr. Lerrick, a conservative economist, argued in 1999 that American taxpayers could save money if the International Monetary Fund were allowed to tap global bond market funds rather than relying solely on disbursements from the United States and other large nations.It immediately caught the eye of Allan H. Meltzer, a top economist in the Reagan administration who hired Mr. Lerrick in 1999 to help him with a report, ordered by Congress, that examined the business models of the I.M.F., the World Bank and other international lending bodies supported by Washington.\u201cIt\u2019s corrupting to give money to countries like Greece that never reform; those are taxpayer monies the people who voted worked hard for,\u201d Mr. Meltzer, now a professor at the Tepper Business School at Carnegie Mellon University, said in an interview last week. \u201cIf we bail out countries that do things that are not in the interest of their citizens, then we just get more of the same. Adam is the right man for this job.\u201dMr. Lerrick declined to comment for this article.When it comes to preaching the no-bailout line, he is such a true believer that he has come to be seen among bond investors and hedge funds as a sort of prince of darkness, counseling finance ministers from Buenos Aires to Berlin to impose losses on investors when governments can no longer pay their debts. He played a leading role behind the scenes in both the Argentine and Greek debt-restructuring dramas and also advocated haircuts for depositors in Cyprus.Once in government, though, and in the thick of a financial calamity, economists may find deploying the expertise of the fund and its war chest tempting indeed.That is what happened in 2010, when the I.M.F. joined Europe in bailing out Greece, Ireland and Portugal; as a result, the fund\u2019s loan book jumped to a high of $96 billion in 2012, from just $9 billion in 2007.Since the global financial crisis, the policy mood toward such rescues has shifted in Mr. Lerrick\u2019s direction: Those left holding Greek bonds in 2012 took a big hit, depositors with more than 100,000 euros in Cypriot banks in 2013 lost money, and there are now laws in place in Europe that make bond investors pay when a bank fails.Called before the Senate in 2000 to testify about the I.M.F.\u2019s future and the extent to which the United States government should continue backing the institution, Mr. Lerrick was asked point-blank by a senator: Do you think we need an I.M.F.?Yes, he replied, there was a big role for the I.M.F. to play as a lender of last resort to emerging markets. The problem, he said, is that when the fund does all these other things, its utility is diminished.\u201cWhat I would propose is that there is a valuable role for the I.M.F. to play,\u201d Mr. Lerrick said. \u201cBut reforms must be instituted to make sure that the costs are minimized, if not eliminated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Martin Schulz, Merkel Rival, Wins His Party\u2019s Nomination With 100 Percent of Vote", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Even in Germany, where consensus is highly valued, it had never happened before.On Sunday, Martin Schulz was anointed leader of the Social Democrats, Europe\u2019s oldest democratic party, with 100 percent of the valid votes cast at a special convention.But the rallying cries in Mr. Schulz\u2019s 75-minute address to the convention seemed destined to irk an American administration that is already demanding more from its NATO allies. His best applause lines railed against buying more weapons, or argued that even Mr. Trump should hold fast to democratic values.Anyone who tries to curb the freedom of the news media, Mr. Schulz emphasized, \u201cis laying an ax on the roots of democracy, whether he is the president of the United States or a protester at a rally of Pegida,\u201d the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant movement in Germany. \u201cBoth are unacceptable.\u201dAfter the unanimous endorsement of his election bid, Mr. Schulz jubilantly declared, \u201cThis vote is the start of capturing the chancellery.\u201dHe was nominated as the new party leader only in late January and has since been embraced by the center-left with an \u00e9lan not seen in years. More than 13,000 people have joined the Social Democrats in recent weeks \u2014 a fact celebrated by party leaders even though 2016 membership, at around 438,000, was 130,000 less than a decade earlier.Significantly, the 153-year-old Social Democrats have drawn level with Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right bloc, with both hovering around 31 or 32 percent in polls. Currently, the two govern in a coalition led by Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives.Though German politicians and voters are used to the compromises of coalition politics, the partnership seems likely to grow testier. If so, some commentators said, that would be another sign of the effect Mr. Trump is having across a continent he often scorns.Unease about Mr. Trump means that he \u201chas had a much bigger effect in Europe than in the United States,\u201d Rolf Kleine, a senior political editor of the best-selling Bild newspaper, said on the sidelines of the Social Democrats\u2019 convention.\u201cSuddenly,\u201d Mr. Kleine said, \u201cpeople got frightened.\u201d They \u201chave seen what the results are when you elect people you perhaps had better not have elected,\u201d he added.Ms. Merkel, known for her patience and for waiting out crises, has not reacted to either the NATO demands or the Group of 20 statement. But her close ally, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen of Germany, issued a sharp statement on Sunday in which she denied Mr. Trump\u2019s contention.\u201cThere is no debt account in NATO,\u201d Ms. von der Leyen said, adding that it was \u201cfalse\u201d to view the 2 percent pledged for military spending by each member as exclusively for NATO. Included in the sum, which Germany is set to reach over the next decade, is support for United Nations peacekeeping missions and the fight against the Islamic State. \u201cWhat we all want is fair burden-sharing, which requires a modern understanding of security,\u201d Ms. von der Leyen said.While Mr. Trump continues to unsettle, opponents might argue that Mr. Schulz, who failed to finish high school and is entirely untested in national politics, also represents a risk. But Mr. Schulz, a former bookseller, has a compelling personal story, more than 20 years of experience in European structures and, above all, a message that Germans appear newly eager to hear. Since he was chosen as the Social Democrats\u2019 leader and embraced a simple slogan, \u201cMore Justice,\u201d his party has advanced. Supporters chant \u201cMartin! Martin!\u201d when he appears and wave placards proclaiming that it is \u201ctime for Schulz.\u201dHis rise has apparently blunted the advances of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which now runs around 9 to 10 percent in polls. The Green and Left parties are also stuck around 8 percent each, with the liberal Free Democrats hovering around the 5 percent hurdle that must be cleared to win parliamentary seats.So far, Mr. Schulz has provided almost no details of what his policies might be and says he will outline his program only in late June. Even supporters worry that this leaves him vulnerable.\u201cAt the moment, he is everybody\u2019s darling,\u201d said Steffen Burmeister, 54, who is active in local politics near Hamburg. \u201cHe can bring people along, and he has the right themes.\u201d In addition, he said, \u201cit is a very important signal that he is someone who has worked so hard for Europe, and at the top of the structure.\u201d Still, Mr. Burmeister argued, more \u201cfresh faces\u201d are needed.Mr. Schulz sought to appeal to voters of all ages: invoking the iconic Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who pioneered d\u00e9tente with the Soviets, for older generations and seeking to woo younger ones with concern for their future.Anne Wachter, 27, works for the Social Democrats. Embracing a life-size image of Mr. Schulz, which she said she had carried nationwide to appearances in recent weeks, she rejected the idea that his advance was a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s rise.\u201cI think we just let Donald Trump be,\u201d she said, \u201cand make our own policy.\u201dMelissa Eddy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo\u2019s $1.4 Billion Plan Targets Brooklyn in Fight Against Poor Health and Poverty", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byCiting persistent problems of poverty, violence and poor health, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a comprehensive plan on Thursday that would direct $1.4 billion of New York State\u2019s resources to long-suffering areas of central Brooklyn.Obesity, murder and unemployment rates are all higher in central Brooklyn than the city and state averages. The plan would allot the biggest chunk of money, $700 million, to health care. It would also create 3,000 affordable housing units, 7,600 new jobs and more than five acres of recreation space at state-funded housing developments.Mr. Cuomo said the plan also includes anti-violence programs and job-training efforts \u2014 a \u201csoup-to-nuts\u201d approach that he said was designed to give central Brooklyn enough resources so its residents could be \u201cin a position to help themselves.\u201dThe initiative, which Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, held up as a national paradigm, comes at a time he is burnishing his credentials with a string of progressive moves that have stirred talk of a possible run for the presidency in 2020. It also comes as anti-poverty initiatives have all but dropped from the national political agenda.Experts on anti-poverty efforts said the multifaceted approach could, indeed, serve as a model for dealing with intractable problems associated with poverty, which are often overlapping, from inadequate housing to a lack of preventive health care.Most of the elements of the initiative, called Vital Brooklyn, are contained in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposed executive budget, or in proposals previously highlighted by the governor.Much of the money has already been identified; while the affordable housing would be new, the money will come from a 10-year, $20 billion affordable housing plan announced in last year\u2019s State of the State address.But the initiative announced on Thursday seeks to funnel the disparate resources into communities like East New York, Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights. Those neighborhoods have lagged on a number of indicators, such as unemployment and the number of families receiving food assistance, as other areas of Brooklyn have prospered.The $700 million capital investment in health care would help create a network of 36 ambulatory care centers, which would include partnerships with existing community-based providers. The health measures were designed, in part, to end the reliance on emergency room care. Such an infusion of money could prove especially helpful in a borough that lost Long Island College Hospital in 2014.Other parts of Vital Brooklyn would invest in healthy food, education and youth development, and climate resiliency.The nearly $700,000 devoted to economic empowerment and job creation would, among other things, add 7,600 new jobs through the governor\u2019s Unemployment Strikeforce, and would train 1,200 people in the construction trades. The $1.2 million investment in youth development and education would have an environmental focus, expanding an oyster restoration program and creating 30 new environmental education sites across the community.But the plan was short on specifics. It was unclear, for instance, where the state would find the space to build the affordable housing or the vacant land with which to create new parks.\u201cAnytime someone wants to invest and supplement the work we\u2019re doing to make New York City stronger, we welcome it with open arms,\u201d said Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio. \u201cAs the mayor has said, New York City succeeds when the state succeeds and vice versa.\u201dRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents central Brooklyn, lauded the governor\u2019s proposal, saying it would foster healthy lifestyles. \u201cThis plan is a dramatic and comprehensive effort to solve problems that have existed in central Brooklyn for decades,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a meaningful initiative.\u201dStill, experts on poverty cautioned that such a plan must be sustained, with continued funding over time, to be successful. And laws and regulations, such as those that prevent the hiring of convicted felons, could be impediments to revitalizing an area like central Brooklyn.\u201cOne in three adults have some sort of criminal record and there is a huge amount of discrimination in hiring,\u201d Mr. Dutta-Gupta, the poverty expert, said. \u201cSo there are structural challenges that make it hard to imagine how any major investment alone will solve these problems.\u201dIt was unclear how the plan would be received in Albany, where legislators are negotiating the state budget, due April 1. A spokesman for the Senate Republicans, many of whom represent rural areas upstate, said only that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s entire budget proposal was under review.J.

Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has is a law degree. Yet as the highest-ranking Democrat and the chairman on the Senate Judiciary Committee, they will preside over the hearings on Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, that begin on Monday.Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Grassley, both 83, will face tremendous pressure from their respective parties to deliver a vindication of their views not just of Judge Gorsuch\u2019s worthiness to serve on the court but also of the process leading him there.Many are looking to Ms. Feinstein \u2014 the first woman to serve on the committee and the Senate\u2019s most senior woman \u2014 to shoulder the weight of that political burden, and to rigorously challenge Judge Gorsuch on his constitutional views.\u201cThis is an important process that needs to be carried out with the kind of dignity and perseverance that it warrants,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said. \u201cBecause this is so pivotal, as the decisive vote on the court, this is a huge responsibility. This is complicated by what came before, which was the Republican treatment of Merrick Garland, which I found very disagreeable and unprecedented.\u201dMr. Grassley\u2019s role is strategically and procedurally easier: It is up to him to make Judge Gorsuch\u2019s week on Capitol Hill painless even in the face of tough questioning from Democrats on the committee.\u201cHis approach to the hearing will likely mirror what we have seen in recent weeks back here,\u201d Matt Strawn, a former chairman of Iowa\u2019s Republican Party, said of Mr. Grassley. \u201cHe has given Iowans every opportunity to weigh in on town hall meetings. There is a reason he is our longest-serving public servant here because he listens and is respectful even if he disagrees with someone.\u201dMr. Grassley has been a strong defender of the most conservative of the 13 nominees he has voted for, but he also helped approve Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg under President Bill Clinton. Ms. Feinstein has never voted for a Republican nominee.Mr. Grassley\u2019s reputation for independence took a hit when he instantly went along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to block Judge Garland from even a single hearing last year.\u201cI\u2019m not sensitive talking about it,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cI had to defend my position \u2014 I had to defend it up to my election.\u201dHe added that he believed it was appropriate to wait for a new president to approve a new Supreme Court nominee, saying, \u201cI would do the same thing in 2020.\u201dBut both senators, who express respect for each other, have a reputation for a seriousness that transcends party politics, an increasingly rare trait in the modern Congress. They are the leaders of a caucus dedicated to combating the narcotics trade.\u201cThese days there are immense party pressures that will push Chuck, that will push Dianne,\u201d said former Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat of Montana who served as a chairman with Mr. Grassley on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut they will both try to do the right thing.\u201dMr. Grassley, who was first elected to the Senate in 1980, has served on the Judiciary Committee for his entire tenure. He has concerned himself principally with victims\u2019 rights, civil asset forfeiture and justice for older people.

{"Headline": "Health Groups Denounce G.O.P. Bill as Its Backers Scramble", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byThe groups, including the American Hospital Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Catholic Health Association of the United States and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association, said they could not support the bill \u201cas currently written.\u201dThe hospitals and the American Nurses Association joined the American Medical Association and AARP, which rejected the bill on Tuesday.House Republicans have been left scrambling to marshal support from businesses and other interests that stand to benefit from lower taxes if the bill passes. Insurers are on the fence, and other powerful forces like pharmaceutical companies remain largely on the sidelines.But the White House appears increasingly confident about the prospects for a health care overhaul to pass in the House. In a meeting with conservative leaders in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he anticipated the most trouble in the Senate, where moderate and conservative lawmakers are opposing the plan for different reasons. He said he was prepared to pressure holdout senators by holding the kind of stadium-style rallies he led during his presidential campaign.The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said Republicans were \u201cgoing through the inevitable growing pains of being an opposition party to becoming a governing party.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a new system for people,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s all the more reason why we have to do what we said we would do and deliver for the American people, and govern and use our principles.\u201dThe Times would like to hear from Americans who are signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The array of groups taking strong positions against the bill is evidence that its potential consequences extend far beyond health insurance coverage, to much of the nation\u2019s economy.The opposition is also a powerful reminder of how many past efforts to overhaul the American health care system failed because of resistance by major interest groups. Winning the support of the health care and insurance industries allowed the Obama administration in 2010 to push through the most significant health care legislation since President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society.Within a few months after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, his administration had lined up support from health care providers, insurers, consumers and pharmaceutical makers by offering a grand bargain: The health bill would include a requirement that most Americans have health insurance, providing millions of new customers through the law\u2019s often substantial premium subsidies and its option for states to expand Medicaid. In exchange, hospitals would have to accept spending cuts and the health care industry would have to accept new taxes to pay for the legislation.The Obama White House dedicated enormous effort to win pledges of support before Democrats even put out a bill \u2014 an effort not replicated by the Trump White House or Republican leaders in Congress.But the Affordable Care Act also created an array of taxes that the Republicans now hope to wipe away, helping them win the support of groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Tax Reform, led by the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation issued estimates this week showing how much revenue the government could lose starting in 2018 under the Republican bill, which the party has called the American Health Care Act, as a result of repealing taxes on drug makers (nearly $25 billion over 10 years), insurers (nearly $145 billion), makers of medical devices (nearly $20 billion), and high-income households (more than $270 billion from taxes on earned income and investment income).\u201cThe American Health Care Act repeals the medical device tax, which will result in greater investments in medical cures, lower health care costs and more high-tech manufacturing jobs in communities across the United States,\u201d trumpeted the Medical Device Manufacturers Association.The extent to which these groups mobilize on behalf of the Republican bill may help determine whether it succeeds.For now, the supporters of the House bill seem badly outgunned by opponents. On Wednesday, as two congressional committees took up the Republican repeal-and-replace bill, the American Nurses Association and a coalition of hospital groups came out against the proposal.The A.M.A., which has nearly 235,000 members and calls itself the voice of the medical profession, sent a letter to leaders of the two committees on Tuesday saying it could not support the Republican bill \u201cbecause of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations.\u201dIn particular, the group said it opposed a plan to replace the sliding, income-based premium tax credits provided under the Affordable Care Act with fixed credits based on age. The current system, it said, \u201cprovides the greatest chance that those of the least means are able to purchase coverage.\u201dAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance lobby, released its own lengthy statement on Wednesday. In a letter to the leaders of the House committees that drafted the bill, Marilyn B. Tavenner, the group\u2019s chief executive, warned Republican leaders that their plans to change Medicaid financing, among other things, could harm coverage and care.While many insurers have lost money in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s private insurance marketplaces, they have generally profited from the expansion of Medicaid, which would effectively be phased out under the Republican plan.\u201cAs a core principle, we believe that Medicaid funding should be adequate to meet the health care needs of beneficiaries,\u201d Ms. Tavenner wrote. \u201cMedicaid health plans are at the forefront of providing coverage for and access to behavioral health services and treatment for opioid use disorders, and insufficient funding could jeopardize the progress being made on these important public health fronts.\u201dA day earlier, AARP \u2014 the association of middle-aged and older Americans that is another crucial supporter of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 declared its opposition to the bill and even started running an ad against it. In a letter to Congress, the group said the bill would increase health costs for people ages 50 to 64, could lead to cuts in Medicaid coverage of long-term care and would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger ones.The hardening resistance complicated the case for the Republicans as they moved their bill forward on Wednesday.\u201cI respect those organizations and their views,\u201d said Representative Larry Bucshon, an Indiana Republican and a heart surgeon who conceded that criticism of the bill from doctors and hospitals could make it more difficult to sell the measure to the public. \u201cTheir voice is an important voice in health care.\u201dBut, he noted, those groups supported the health care law in 2010.\u201cHospitals have done quite well under the Affordable Care Act, but my constituents have not,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir premiums are going up. Their deductibles are high.\u201dAcross the rotunda, Republican senators were less enthusiastic.Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said she was not certain that a delay in the rollback of Medicaid coverage was \u201cenough for me.\u201d Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, expressed alarm that the bill\u2019s tax credits would not account for higher premium costs in insurance markets like hers, a largely rural state with little competition. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he did not want states that took the Medicaid expansion to \u201cget a benefit\u201d that the states that rejected the program did not.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she was unhappy that the bill removed money for Planned Parenthood.There was also a creeping concern about how quickly the bill was moving. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, essentially promised to move the bill to the Senate floor without the hearings and other processes that are normal for such a far-reaching piece of legislation. He had promised when Republicans took the majority that they would honor normal Senate processes and traditions.\u201cI think if that\u2019s the approach they take,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, \u201cthey won\u2019t have the votes in the Senate.\u201dJennifer Steinhauer, Emmarie Huetteman and Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "Inhabitants of Maldives Atoll Fear a Flood of Saudi Money", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported byMAGOODHOO, Maldives \u2014 As long as anyone can remember, life on the island of Magoodhoo in the Maldives has revolved around fishing in the crystal clear waters that wash the coral reefs, and kicking back under palm trees on deck chairs made from coir rope.\u201cThis is a very fun, happy life,\u201d said Islam Ahmed, 24, a tall, lean man chewing on areca nuts and betel leaves at one of two cafes on the less than one-square-mile island. It is one of nearly 1,200 islands that make up the Republic of Maldives, a nation southwest of India in the Indian Ocean.Most alarming to the residents were reports that the government was breaking with a longstanding policy of leasing the islands that are home to some of the world\u2019s premier resorts and selling the atoll outright to the Saudis. The inhabitants fear they might be moved off the islands.\u201cIt is worrying that we may be taken from here and put in tiny apartment boxes,\u201d said Sobira Aboobukaru, 58, near the farm where she grows chilies and cucumbers. \u201cIt would be hard beyond our imaginations.\u201dThe Maldivian president, Abdulla Yameen, has denied that the atoll will be sold, and the Saudi embassy said it had no intention \u201cof investing in a megaproject or buying an island or atoll in the Maldives.\u201d But the fact that Mr. Yameen pushed to change the Constitution in 2015 to allow the sale of property to foreign entities has continued to fuel rumors of a potential sale.All of this has left Mr. Ahmed and the approximately 4,000 residents of the 19 coral islands in Faafu Atoll guessing about what the future holds. It has also underscored how new allies and investors have gained a foothold in this strategic archipelago. The country has pivoted from its traditional partners \u2014 India and the European Union \u2014 amid growing international pressure over accusations of human rights abuses by Mr. Yameen.Saudi Arabia has for decades spread its conservative strand of Islam in the Maldives by sending religious leaders, building mosques and giving scholarships to students to attend its universities. The Saudis are building a new airport terminal, and have pledged tens of millions of dollars in loans and grants for infrastructure and housing on an artificial island near the capital, Mal\u00e9.Similarly, China, which sees the Maldives as a strategic outpost in its quest for regional dominance, has underwritten hundreds of millions of dollars in loans for a new airport runway and a mile-long bridge connecting the airport to the capital.The $10 billion Saudi investment seemed to be a crowning achievement for Mr. Yameen, but now the Saudis seem put off by the negative publicity, and the deal may be unraveling.The Saudi interest in Faafu Atoll began with a 2014 visit by King Salman, then the crown prince, and his son Mohammed bin Salman, now the deputy crown prince.A year later, Prince Mohammed returned to host a week of parties. He and his entourage took over two resorts, said a person familiar with the plans. That person said guests had flown in night after night on private jets to attend the parties, which featured famous entertainers including the rapper Pitbull and the South Korean singer Psy.Mohamed Maleeh Jamal, formerly a member of Mr. Yameen\u2019s economic and youth council, said that he had attended the signing of a memorandum of understanding between representatives of the Saudi royal family and the Maldives two years ago. He said he had been told that it involved selling the atoll, although he was not privy to the details.The precise plans remain a secret, but Mr. Yameen has said the Saudis envision mixed-use developments similar to the French Riviera. A million people would be drawn to the atoll, on which airports, resorts and high-end housing would be built, he said.For centuries, life in Magoodhoo has revolved around fishing. The second-least populated of the Maldives\u2019 20 administrative atolls, Faafu is steeped in history. The second-oldest mosque on the Maldives, built more than 800 years ago, lies on island of Nilandhoo, which is the atoll capital. The Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl said in his 1986 book, \u201cThe Maldive Mystery,\u201d that he had found ruins of ancient Hindu and Buddhist temples on the same island.About half of the men in Magoodhoo, including Mr. Ahmed, spend much of their lives at sea. Six yellowfin tuna fishing boats operate from here, each with a crew of at least 16 men. Their wives and children stay behind on the island, an oval nub of silver sand rising out of the ocean with a clump of coconut and breadfruit trees in the center.In small, single-story concrete buildings in the center of town stand a school, a police station, a health center and an island council office. Residents live in small houses built with coral limestone along the several roads that crisscross the center of town. The streets are not paved but covered in sand and kept passable by women who sweep them several times a day. By the beachside, many women spend their days cutting palm leaves and weaving thatch, a valued commodity for resorts.With its tiny population spread over hundreds of such islands, the government has struggled to meet its people\u2019s demands for fresh water, sanitation and education. It has a history of pushing people off the smaller islands onto the larger ones, where it can provide centralized services, further fueling the fears of the people of Magoodhoo.Not everyone dreads the potential Saudi embrace. Many are hopeful that Saudi investment will bring jobs and development, even as they worry they could be forced to move off the island. More than a third of the Maldives population of nearly 350,000 is crowded onto the capital island, Mal\u00e9, on just 2.2 square miles of land that is a two-and-a-half-hour speedboat ride northeast of Faafu Atoll.Even Mr. Ahmed said he was willing to move off the island, under the right circumstances. \u201cAnyone who has a bit of wealth is going to Mal\u00e9 to educate their kids,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I get enough money, I, too, will go to give my kid an education.\u201dBut with the prospective Saudi development, he worries that he and his family could be forced to move whether they want to or not. Many residents fear they may be moved to apartments the government is building on an artificial island near Mal\u00e9, financed in part by an $80 million loan from the Saudi Fund for Development.When Mr. Yameen visited Magoodhoo island in late January, he tried to assuage such fears. The president came to announce that King Salman had donated a new mosque to the people of Magoodhoo.But much more Saudi development would be coming, Mr. Yameen promised. \u201cThey have planned a huge project for Faafu Atoll,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the charts and drawings have been completed.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about an atoll in the Republic of Maldives where Saudi Arabia plans to invest $10 billion rendered incorrectly part of the name of a former member of President Abdulla Yameen\u2019s economic and youth council. He is Mohamed Maleeh Jamal, not Mohamed Mal\u00e9 eh Jamal.Hassan Moosa reported from Magoodhoo in the Republic of Maldives, and Geeta Anand from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Financial Lifeline for Owners of Historic Homes", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byAfter the conservancy approved a loan for renovations that were to include the removal of the aluminum siding, a contractor did some probing, prying off a small section of the siding and announcing the discovery: What was underneath was not sandstone, as in an authentic brownstone, or any other kind of stone. It was wood.That was another surprise for Mr. Piros, a data analytics specialist for an advertising agency, and his wife Nina. When they bought the house in 2004, they knew they were getting a fixer-upper. Mr. Piros planned to do the fixing up himself. Only later did words like \u201chistoric district\u201d and \u201clandmarks approval\u201d enter the conversation and govern the fixing up.When they did, there was the money question. What would it cost to redo the front of the house in a way that would pass muster with the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which must sign off on exterior work in historic districts? The Piroses were looking at a tab of about $240,000. \u201cI couldn\u2019t come up with that,\u201d Mr. Piros said.Mrs. Piros heard about the conservancy\u2019s loan program, applied and was accepted.Peg Breen, the president of the conservancy, has reason to be proud of the loan program, which started in the 1980s and now has more than $9 million in assets. It has made more than $26 million in loans and $433,000 in grants.The money has gone toward more than 250 buildings in all five boroughs. \u201cFor a while, it was Brooklyn Brownstones \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were in Brooklyn and Harlem before they became Brooklyn and Harlem.\u201dThe current interest rates are in the 3-to-7 percent range, she said, with terms of five to 10 years.Perhaps she is proudest of the default rate of less than 1 percent. \u201cIn all these years,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re out $1,200.\u201dBut the program\u2019s importance transcends the financials. As the landmarks commission has designated more and more buildings, the conservancy program has helped insure the success of the very concept of landmarking, especially in neighborhoods beyond Manhattan, where landlords or co-op boards can grumble about needing the commission\u2019s approval when the time comes to replace bricks or windows. Landlords and co-op boards can spread the cost over many tenants. Homeowners can only assess themselves.The conservancy provides more than what it calls \u201ctechnical expertise\u201d \u2014 referrals to architects and contractors who have handled similar restoration work. Ms. Breen recalled that when payments on a loan on Staten Island stopped, the conservancy investigated and found that the owner moved to a nursing home. \u201cWe sold the house for her,\u201d Ms. Breen said. \u201cWe found a buyer who was going to fix it up. Chase isn\u2019t doing that.\u201dMany of the loans are \u201csmall stuff for banks,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if we\u2019re doing a $300,000 loan, and we\u2019re doing a lot of $300,000 loans in Jackson Heights in Queens, my understanding is banks really want to loan in the $500,000 range. Are they going to track down an owner in a nursing home? Are they going to help you find the people who know how to do the work? That\u2019s not what they were set up to do.\u201dThe Piroses\u2019 $240,000 loan was larger than the typical loan for a rowhouse; $80,000 to $150,000 is the usual range.\u201cWhen we started, a lot of people couldn\u2019t get conventional financing,\u201d Ms. Breen said. \u201cNow they might, but they don\u2019t get the help. We\u2019ll help you find an architect and we\u2019ll work through the project with you. That makes a big difference. A lot of these places are within historic districts, so there\u2019s Landmarks approval, but there are always issues on a project. Who\u2019s going to help you sort that out so that everything comes out right in the end?\u201dThat sounds like the who-you-gonna-call question in \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d And, yes, Ms. Breen refers to the conservancy as \u201cthe \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 of historic preservation.\u201dCynthia Cummings called the conservancy about the rowhouse in a historic district in Bedford-Stuyvesant that her father bought in 1929. He considered selling the house in the 1980s, but Ms. Cummings and her husband, Richard, moved in.The conservancy arranged a $50,000 loan. Mr. Cummings, a musician, said the purpose was to \u201cfix, tighten and secure the facade.\u201dAnd also paint it. \u201cChanging the green, that was major,\u201d Ms. Cummings said, recalling how she sent paint chips to the landmarks commission before painting the house its current brown. There was also a discussion of the color of the mortar when work was being done on the bricks, and the loan covered other items on the Cummings\u2019 to-do list, like sealing the stained-glass windows in the living room. Also on the list was installing half-moon windows on the second floor, an important step in returning the front facade to the way it looked when the house was new. The original half-moon window frames had long since been replaced by conventional rectangular ones.A mile away in Crown Heights, Mr. Piros found something inside a wall. It was the front page of The New York Sun from Aug. 19, 1874. One of the headlines was \u201cUnraveling a Mystery.\u201dIt sounds like the headline for the story of the house.\u201cThe shortest explanation was this building was built as a faux brownstone,\u201d said Ms. Walsh of the conservancy. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history in building technology of substitute materials. You see plaster that looks like stone or wood. This is wood imitating stone.\u201dIf the experts were fooled, Mr. Piros was not. \u201cI kept saying it was not a brownstone,\u201d he recalled the other day. He had seen the inside of a neighbor\u2019s house that had been damaged by fire.Still, the renovation had to be done \u2014 in wood, Spanish cedar for the facade and mahogany for the front stoop, which was so large it had to be lowered into place by a crane.\u201cIt didn\u2019t really matter\u201d that the house was not a brownstone, Mr. Piros said. \u201cIf we had the chance to restore a brownstone, that would have been nice, but I\u2019m happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Public Broadcasters Fear \u2018Collapse\u2019 if U.S. Drops Support", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byPublic radio and television broadcasters are girding for battle after the Trump administration proposed a drastic cutback that they have long dreaded: the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.The potential elimination of about $445 million in annual funding, which helps local TV and radio stations subscribe to NPR and Public Broadcasting Service programming, could be devastating for affiliates in smaller markets that already operate on a shoestring budget.Patricia Harrison, the corporation\u2019s president, warned in a statement on Thursday that the Trump budget proposal, if enacted, could cause \u201cthe collapse of the public media system itself.\u201dBut the power players in public broadcasting \u2014 big-city staples like WNYC in New York City \u2014 would be well-equipped to weather any cuts. Major stations typically receive only a sliver of their annual budget from the federal government, thanks to listener contributions and corporate underwriters. Podcasts and other digital offshoots have also become significant sources of revenue.\u201cWe\u2019re always living on the edge in this ecosystem of public broadcasting,\u201d Mr. Vogelzang said in an interview.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting supports about 1,500 stations that carry a range of educational, journalistic and arts-related programming. The corporation dates to the administration of President Lyndon Johnson. Its funding, while a minuscule part of the federal budget, has been under regular peril since the 1970s from conservative lawmakers, who often denounce what they view as the liberal bent of public media.Jay H. Pearce, the chief executive of WVIK-FM in Rock Island, Ill., which receives about 15 percent of its budget from the federal government, said he was also concerned about problems with raising money. He pointed to broader cuts under consideration for federal arts and humanities financing, noting that many groups would have to compete against one another for private contributions to make up the difference.\u201cThis year, everybody might rally, we might find the money,\u201d Mr. Pearce said. \u201cBut what will happen next year, and the year after?\u201dExecutives in public broadcasting were on alert since early this year, when rumors of major cuts began circulating, and on Thursday they did not hesitate to fire back. Their top talking point: \u201c$1.35 per citizen,\u201d an approximation of the annual cost to each American for providing a spectrum of public-interest shows.\u201cIt\u2019s not like cutting this would have any appreciable effect on any taxpayer across the country, but losing PBS would,\u201d Neal Shapiro, president of WNET in New York, said in an interview. \u201cIn a lot of markets, the only place for real in-depth local coverage is the PBS station, the only place for arts and culture, the only place for safe harbor for kids.\u201dIra Glass, host of \u201cThis American Life,\u201d which does not receive any federal money, said, \u201cBig stations in big cities will certainly be fine, especially in blue cities, where listeners will surely step up to replace any money that goes away.\u201dBut the proposed cuts, Mr. Glass added in an email, could make it far more difficult for producers to begin ambitious new national programming. \u201cIf you\u2019re starting a new news program, or anything with a public service mission,\u201d he wrote, \u201cC.P.B. is pretty much still the only game in town.\u201dMr. Shapiro, of WNET, said city affiliates would eventually be hurt as much as rural stations. \u201cIf the beach washes out, the little houses go first,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then the big houses go after that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Of Late, De Blasio\u2019s Biggest Supporters Are Out-of-Towners", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio raised significantly more money for his re-election campaign from donors outside of New York City than in it over the last two months, according to a new filing, thanks largely to a last-minute national fund-raising swing.Mr. de Blasio has frequently sought donations from supporters outside of New York City. But amid a continuing federal inquiry into his fundraising activities, the new filing marked the first time in the race, so far, that the mayor raised far more outside of the five boroughs ($237,000) than within them ($157,000). About a third of the total came in March from donors in Florida, Illinois and California, where he held high-dollar fund-raisers this month just before the filing deadline.At the same time, the mayor\u2019s effort to fund his campaign through smaller contributions also showed signs of continuing apace, with donations from more than 3,000 contributors that averaged out to $160 a piece.That means that when those donations are matched with city funds, Mr. de Blasio will see roughly the same amount of money from this period in his campaign coffers as his closest challenger in the fund-raising game, Paul J. Massey Jr., the millionaire real estate sales executive whose campaign said it had raised $895,000 over the same period (The city matches up to $175 in donations at a rate of six to one.)\u201cWe raised about the same amount,\u201d said Dan Levitan, a campaign spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, speaking of Mr. Massey. \u201cObviously from very different sources.\u201dBut whereas Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign filed his paperwork in the midafternoon, ensuring that it would be publicly available on Wednesday, Mr. Massey, who is running on his superior management ability, did not submit his filings to the campaign board before the close of the business day. His campaign provided a draft sheet with numbers it said would be filed before the midnight deadline. It showed that he spent more than he took in from contributions \u2014 a pattern that continued from his previous campaign filing \u2014 and gave himself another large loan, this time of $700,000.But the late filing ensured that details about Mr. Massey\u2019s contributors and his campaign spending would not be public until Thursday.The other declared candidates for mayor have been much less prolific in their fund-raising, the reality of a race that has been stuck in neutral because of a federal investigation into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising activities in the 2013 campaign and early in his tenure. The results of that investigation, should it result in indictments of any kind, could upend the current campaign and may prompt those Democrats waiting on the sidelines, including the comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, the city\u2019s public advocate, Letitia James, or a City Council member like Daniel Garodnick to jump in.Mr. Garodnick, who cannot run for another term in the Council, and Mr. Stringer both have more than a million dollars of campaign cash on hand, should they decide to run.In contrast to the mayor, Mr. Massey, has said that he would not participate in the city\u2019s generous public matching funds program, which limits spending to $6.9 million in a primary and another $6.9 million in a general election. (Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign has already spent about $1.3 million toward the primary.)That approach was embraced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who funded his three mayoral victories with tens of millions of his own money, and it is seen as the only viable path for a Republican to effectively win a race for City Hall in a city where Democrats enjoy a roughly six-to-one advantage over Republicans in registered voters.The Wednesday filings included some unusual details from other candidates. For example, Ms. James, the public advocate, had to give back nearly two thirds of the money she took in, returning about $21,000 out of $33,000 that she raised over the last two months. Her office said the returns were \u201croutine\u201d and a spokeswoman, Anna Brower, said most of the money given back \u201ccame from individuals doing business with the city.\u201d Contributions from those doing business with the city are limited to $400.Two Democrats looking to challenge Mayor de Blasio in a primary showed modest gains, with Sal Albanese, a former City Councilman and four-time mayoral candidate, raising more than $24,000 and State Senator Tony Avella bringing in just over $34,000, the records show.Bo Dietl, a vocal critic of Mr. de Blasio wanted to run as a Democrat, but, filed his paperwork to do so incorrectly. He raised more than $280,000 in the last filing period, with roughly two-thirds coming from outside of New York City.For Mr. de Blasio, his recent fund-raising swing around the country appears to have paid off. He attended a fund-raiser in Los Angeles on March 5. His filing shows that in March he received a total of $55,079 from donors living in California, including contributions from Russell Simmons, a founder of Def Jam Recordings, David Glasser, president of the Weinstein Company, Alan Horn, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, and Sean Parker, an internet entrepreneur. He was in Chicago for a fund-raiser on March 3 and contributions from Illinois residents in March totaled $49,710.A Florida trip was less lucrative. Contributions from residents in that state in March totaled $22,370.Advertisement"}

They\u2019ve been promising to repeal Obamacare for seven years, and having won control of the White House and Congress, they had to try to deliver. But while their bitter denunciations of the Affordable Care Act may have depressed its approval numbers, they didn\u2019t make replacing it any easier.Many Republicans who want to diminish government\u2019s role in health care view the single-payer approach with disdain. But Mr. Trump often seems to take pleasure in being unpredictable, and since he will offend people no matter which way he turns, he may want to consider why liberals and conservatives in many other countries have embraced the single-payer approach.In contrast, they can easily compare the prices charged by competing insurance companies. This asymmetry induces companies to compete by highlighting the lower prices they\u2019re able to offer if they cut costs by degrading the quality of their offerings. For example, it\u2019s common for insurance companies to deny payment for procedures that their policies seem to cover. If policy holders complain loudly enough, they may eventually get reimbursed, but the money companies save by not paying others confers a decisive competitive advantage over rivals that don\u2019t employ this tactic. Such haggling is uncommon under single-payer systems like Medicare (though it is sometimes employed by private insurers that supplement Medicare).Then again, he may fear that move would be seen as a sign of weakness or defeat. But the research findings on loss aversion make one thing clear: Any setback from that change in strategy would pale in comparison to the damage he would have suffered if the A.H.C.A. had actually become law.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banks and Tech Firms Battle Over Something Akin to Gold: Your Data", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The big banks and Silicon Valley are waging an escalating battle over your personal financial data: your dinner bill last night, your monthly mortgage payment, the interest rates you pay.Technology companies like Mint and Betterment have been eager to slurp up this data, mainly by building services that let people link all their various bank-account and credit-card information. The selling point is to make budgeting and bookkeeping easier. But the data is also being used to offer new kinds of loans and investment products.Now, banks have decided they aren\u2019t letting the data go without a fight.In recent weeks, several large banks have been pushing to restrict the sharing of this kind of data with technology companies, according to the tech firms. In some cases, they are refusing to pass along information, like the fees and interest rates they charge. Both sides see big money to be made from the reams of highly personal information created by financial transactions.The struggle over this data points to a growing recognition in the world of finance that personal records rank among the most valuable currencies in the increasingly digital economy.But the law has been slow to keep up with the quickly evolving ways that companies seek to hold on to customer data or share it with others.The tech companies, in turn, complain that the steps being taken by banks will not lead to better security. They say the banks are motivated simply by a fear that the data will allow the financial upstarts to offer better deals on loans and checking accounts.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the real intent of the banks is to limit this data because it puts their business model at risk,\u201d he said.The European authorities have largely decided that people, not companies, own the digital records associated with their accounts. As a result, European banks are generally being forced to make it easy for customers to share their financial data with whomever they choose.In the United States, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act broadly directed banks to make electronic records available to people. But there has been little detail on what that means in practice.Banks, in the meantime, have taken the initiative by pushing technology companies to accept new agreements on how they use the data they pull from the banks.Some of the banks have said they do not want to share the interest rates and fees that they charge customers, even when customers ask for that information to be passed along, said Steve Boms, the vice president for government affairs at Yodlee. Mr. Boms said that his company was pushing back against the requests. \u201cWith data limitations, you are hindering the ability of millions of consumers to save more and optimize their finances,\u201d he said.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, which have been among the most aggressive in seeking new agreements, said they would pass along any information that customers wanted, as long as the customers themselves requested it. JPMorgan is hoping to create a dashboard on its website where people can choose to turn on or off the data flowing from the bank to any outside provider.The banks say they are pushing for new data agreements in an effort to stop technology companies from getting access to customer data in ways that the customers might not understand, or that could create security risks.Right now, few rules or standards exist for how technology companies can use the data they collect from customers. It is also not entirely clear who would be held liable if a data breach at a service like Venmo or Mint led to financial losses for a customer.\u201cIt is in everybody\u2019s best interest to come to more robust arrangements, from a security perspective,\u201d said Brett Pitts, the head of digital for Wells Fargo Virtual Channels.In January, both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo signed agreements with Intuit \u2014 the owner of Mint, TurboTax and QuickBooks \u2014 that will give Intuit more streamlined access to data from the banks, in exchange for new rules about how Intuit uses the data. The banks have said they want the agreement with Intuit to be a model for similar agreements with other technology companies.In recent negotiations, including those with Intuit, Wells Fargo has asked to be paid by technology companies that want better access to its data, a sticking point for technology companies that believe data should flow freely. Mr. Pitts said the payments were intended to help the bank cover the additional infrastructure costs involved in providing real-time access to data.The negotiations with Yodlee are particularly important because it is the largest so-called data aggregator. Yodlee and a few other data aggregators serve as the middlemen between the banks and the start-ups, pulling the data from the banks and putting it into a form that start-ups like Betterment and Digit can use.In addition to being the biggest aggregator, Yodlee has also been the most controversial because of what it does with the data it collects.Other aggregators that compete with Yodlee, including its largest competitor, Plaid, say they do not sell customer data to third parties and do not think it would be right to do so, given that the consumers do not generally know their data is being sold in this way.JPMorgan has been insisting in negotiations that it will provide easy access to its data only if technology companies agree not to sell the data to third parties. Intuit agreed to those terms in its deal with the bank.This has not been the only sticking point in negotiations with Yodlee, however. And Yodlee is not the only company that has complained that the banks are making it harder for customers who want access to information about their bank accounts.Mr. Harris of Personal Capital has been one of the most outspoken critics of the banks. His company allows consumers to look at all their financial accounts on one dashboard, and also provides them with financial advice based on their holdings.Mr. Harris, who was previously the chief executive at Intuit and PayPal, said that many banks publicly say they are sharing data while making it hard, behind the scenes, for companies like Personal Capital to get access to it. Some companies, he said, will throttle access to data, or shut it down for hours at a time.\u201cIt happens with a frequency that is too often to simply be the result of some technical problems,\u201d Mr. Harris said.He said that agreements like those Intuit recently struck with the banks would speed up the movement of data but give the banks too much control over the data flowing to companies like Personal Capital.\u201cWe suss out the data and show the customer what they are actually paying,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a business model point of view, that is not in the best interest of the banks and brokers. It\u2019s encouraging customers to get smart and get well-priced products.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Schaffer, who retired in December as CUNY\u2019s general counsel and senior vice chancellor for legal affairs, will lead the board, which provides public matching funds to candidates running for office and also penalizes campaigns for financial improprieties.Mr. Schaffer, 70, has had a long and distinguished career, including stints as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, as chief litigating corporation counsel under Mayor Edward I.

But his appointment comes at an awkward time for both the mayor and CUNY, the country\u2019s largest urban public university.For almost a year, federal prosecutors in Manhattan with the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York have been investigating Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign fund-raising to determine whether the mayor or his aides traded favorable city action for donations to his campaign or a now-defunct political nonprofit group.Not long afterward, in a move that caught some people by surprise, Mr. Schaffer announced his retirement.Eric Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, said that the city had performed \u201cextraordinary due diligence\u201d on Mr. Schaffer and that \u201cthe mayor is absolutely confident in his ability to do this job with the independence and professionalism it requires.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Schaffer said that he could not discuss the continuing investigations but that he was \u201cvery excited to be chairperson and to head a board that I think is a model for the entire country.\u201dMr. Schaffer, a Democrat, does not appear to have much of a history with Mr. de Blasio.

{"Headline": "Firing of South Africa\u2019s Finance Minister Widens a Political Rift", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The two rival factions inside South Africa\u2019s governing African National Congress attacked each other publicly on Friday after President Jacob Zuma abruptly fired a well-respected finance minister who was considered a bulwark against government corruption.Mr. Zuma, who has been embroiled in a series of scandals since taking office in 2009, dismissed the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, as part of a late-night cabinet shuffle in which 10 of 35 ministers were fired.The deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called the decision \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Another senior figure, Gwede Mantashe, the A.N.C. secretary general, said the cabinet shuffle was not done with the party\u2019s approval. \u201cMinisters have been moved, and the majority of them were good performing ministers,\u201d Mr. Mantashe said.Jackson Mthembu, a senior A.N.C. lawmaker, said Mr. Gordhan\u2019s only crime was \u201cincorruptibility.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented to have senior A.N.C. members come out with dissenting views in public like this,\u201d said William Gumede, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and executive chairman of the Democracy Works Foundation, a good-government group.\u201cNow that the conflict has gone public, people and party members can see the divisions clearly,\u201d Mr. Gumede said. \u201cIt will be very difficult for Zuma to shrug this off and claim that everything is fine.\u201dThe firing was a result of a long-running battle between Mr. Zuma and Mr. Gordhan, and the interests they represent. Mr. Zuma\u2019s supporters have accused Mr. Gordhan of representing South Africa\u2019s white-led business community and have urged Mr. Zuma to fire the minister and replace him with someone with a looser grip on state coffers, so as to carry out \u201cradical transformation.\u201dMr. Gordhan\u2019s backers belong to the urban faction of the A.N.C., one less beholden to the politics of patronage that the party practices in rural strongholds.Mr. Ramaphosa, a liberation figure who also became one of the country\u2019s richest black businessmen after the end of apartheid, is considered the leader of the urban faction, and he is seen as a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Zuma as the party\u2019s leader in December.The other top contender, Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma, a former chairwoman of the African Union who was once married to Mr. Zuma, has been backed by groups most loyal to the president.The finance minister\u2019s dismissal sent the currency, the rand, plummeting as much as 5 percent at one point. The cost of borrowing for the government jumped, amid fears that rating agencies would downgrade South Africa\u2019s government bonds to junk status. Africa\u2019s most industrialized economy, South Africa is projected to grow 0.8 percent this year, and unemployment is 27 percent.Speculation is rife that Mr. Zuma might be compelled to step down before the scheduled end of his second five-year term in 2019, clearing the way for another party leader to take the reins.Mr. Gordhan, who learned of his dismissal from a television report, defended his record on Friday as protesters gathered at the headquarters of the National Treasury, part of the Finance Ministry.\u201cWe hope more and more South Africans will make it absolutely clear that our country is not for sale,\u201d Mr. Gordhan said. \u201cIt is important that the public knows what we do at the Treasury, how we serve South Africa, how the budgeting process works and how we make sure that the poor in South Africa benefit from the taxes that we collect from all South Africans, as well.\u201dThe firing on Thursday night capped a week of tensions that began on Monday when Mr. Zuma ordered Mr. Gordhan to return abruptly from a trade and investment roadshow in Britain. As rumors circulated that Mr. Gordhan would be fired, Mr. Zuma summoned A.N.C. leaders for a meeting. The meeting did not produce a consensus, officials have said.The South African Communist Party, part of the A.N.C.-led coalition that governs the country, said that Mr. Zuma had cited an intelligence report speculating that Mr. Gordhan might be plotting to undermine the president. Mr. Gordhan has called the report preposterous. Mr. Mthembu, the senior A.N.C. lawmaker, said that the intelligence report\u2019s accusations were \u201cplain rubbish.\u201dMr. Zuma, in a statement on Friday, announced that he had replaced Mr. Gordhan with Malusi Gigaba, the home affairs minister. Mr. Gordhan\u2019s deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, was also fired and replaced by Sfiso N. Buthelezi.The two new finance appointees \u2014 A.N.C. loyalists active in the party since their youth, and members of Parliament \u2014 are \u201clargely unknown to investors,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a research note on Friday. \u201cThis could create further uncertainty in South Africa\u2019s financial markets.\u201dMr. Zuma said that the shake-up \u2014 10 new ministers and 10 new deputy ministers were named \u2014 was intended to \u201cimprove efficiency and effectiveness\u201d and to \u201cbring some younger M.P.s and women into the national executive in order to benefit from their energy, experience and expertise.\u201dMr. Gordhan, after a stint as finance minister from 2009 to 2014, was reappointed to the job in December 2015, after Mr. Zuma abruptly replaced his successor, Nhlanhla Nene, with a little-known junior lawmaker. Mr. Zuma changed that decision four days later, after the rand and the stock market tumbled, and Mr. Gordhan\u2019s return to the job helped reassure investors.But Mr. Gordhan has repeatedly been at odds with the president since then. He resisted Mr. Zuma\u2019s push to approve expensive nuclear power plants, and he tried to rein in public spending. He also clashed with a powerful family, the Guptas, who are close to Mr. Zuma and are so influential that Mr. Zuma was obliged to publicly insist last year that he was in charge of his government.Trieu Pham, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities in London, said there were important differences between this week\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Gordhan and the firing of Mr. Nene in 2015. Mr. Gordhan\u2019s departure, if not the timing, had been expected; his replacement, unlike Mr. Nene\u2019s, is a cabinet minister, albeit one with limited experience in finance; and the rand and stock prices have risen in recent months, allowing some room for maneuver.\u201cThe long waiting time indicates that Zuma has well weighed the factors for and against the reshuffle, and thinks that he has garnered enough support to resist a power struggle and a breakup of the A.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Pham said.Norimitsu Onishi reported from Johannesburg, and Sewell Chan from London.

{"Headline": "As the Maldives Gains Tourists, It\u2019s Losing Its Beaches", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byGuraidhoo JournalGURAIDHOO, Maldives \u2014 From the foyer of his small guesthouse some 100 feet from the shoreline, Mohamed Nizar, 52, was wondering how long his business could remain viable.Last year, during an unusually nasty storm, water snaked through the narrow streets of Guraidhoo, a small island in the Maldives, pooling around the floor of the three-room house and chasing away guests.Down along the beach, the picture was even worse. Erosion of the shore has become so severe, he said, that the owner of a neighboring guesthouse stakes plastic jerrycans in the sand to curb flooding during sea swells.\u201cWhat is the lagoon now used to be the football field on this island,\u201d Mr. Nizar said on a recent afternoon. \u201cI have to leave this guesthouse if it keeps eroding. I am sure of it.\u201dGuesthouses have proliferated across this archipelago in the Indian Ocean, as the Maldives shifts away from catering to the \u00fcber-rich and welcomes budget-conscious travelers.But unlike resort islands, which spend millions of dollars on constructing sea walls, dredging sand and hiring marine biologists, islands with small-scale guesthouses are mostly reliant on the government for protection from shore erosion and rising seas, which many on Guraidhoo attribute to climate change.Residents say the funds for conservation projects are available in the form of tourist taxes, paid through business owners to the government. The problem, they say, is that it is unclear where the money is going \u2014 or whether it ultimately can save the world\u2019s lowest-lying country.\u201cWe\u2019re losing a nationality, an identity, a cultural history, a language, a script,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re losing the beaches. We\u2019re losing the coconut palms. We\u2019re losing everything.\u201dFor most of the Maldives\u2019s history as a tourist destination, its government prohibited visitors from staying on the 200 islands inhabited by locals. Instead, foreigners were ferried to privately owned resort islands where villas jutting out into the ocean are the norm.But after the 2008 election of Mohamed Nasheed as president \u2014 the first democratically elected leader after 30 years under autocracy \u2014 a law was passed that allowed residents to open guesthouses.Although the tourism industry is still dominated by villas rented for thousands of dollars a night, foreigners can now book more modest accommodations for as little as $30. Around 400 guesthouses are registered in the Maldives.As this backpacker brand of tourism expanded, questions have arisen about whether allowing visitors to stay alongside Maldivians would chip away at religious tradition on the islands. The Maldives is officially 100 percent Sunni Muslim.On a recent day, clusters of women wearing hijabs wove around Guraidhoo\u2019s candy-colored shops, which sell knickknacks imported from Thailand.Unlike resorts, guesthouses are prohibited from stocking alcohol, and island councils have designated certain stretches of the shoreline as \u201cbikini beaches\u201d where tourists are able to wear more revealing swim suits.The beach is its own separate island, heavily wooded and connected to the rest of Guraidhoo by a plank bridge. Occasionally, residents say, complaints are heard about the guests\u2019 attire. But for now, the question of modesty has mostly been addressed by moving the sunbathers to another island.Now, with guesthouses injecting cash into local economies and providing greater employment opportunities outside the resort industry, many hope this new revenue generator is here to stay. That is, of course, if the islands remain above water.Guraidhoo has a permanent population of around 1,900 people, but hosts 12 guesthouses and another 1,000 day visitors. But residents say the government has yet to start work on their island.\u201cIt is very simple,\u201d said Mohamed Solih, 50, the owner of Ithaa Beach Inn. \u201cThe cow that gives more milk has to be fed more. So islands that pay tourism taxes should be a priority in shore protection initiatives by the government.\u201dAsked how green taxes are spent, the Ministry of Environment directed questions to the country\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency, which directed questions to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance declined to comment despite repeated questions. A review of the country\u2019s 2017 budget proposal did not yield information about where green tax revenue is allocated.Among concerns voiced by residents of Guraidhoo are a monsoon season that has become more erratic and intense, and degradation of the reef system, which acts as a natural buffer against rising seas. There are also problems with erosion \u2014 which residents attribute to storm surges \u2014 harbor modifications and even shore protection practices on other islands.Gazing out toward the island of Kandooma, which is separated from Guraidhoo by a thin channel of water, Mr. Solih said he believed part of the erosion problem could be attributed to sand dredging at the nearby Holiday Inn Resort.\u201cErosion on this island is very much connected to the development work done on the resort,\u201d he said. \u201cKandooma is a coral rock island, not a sand island like you see now. They dredged sand and pumped sand and reclaimed the beaches. After that, erosion became a big problem here.\u201dAt the resort, Mohamed Shahid, a marine biologist who oversees shore protection projects, said sand dredging was not eroding Guraidhoo\u2019s shore, but he acknowledged that the relationship between the islands had occasionally been frosty.\u201cWe have had a lot of discussions with the local authorities on that side,\u201d he said, adding that Guraidhoo improperly disposes of garbage, which affects the resort. \u201cWe try to be diplomatic. We help them and they help us kind of a thing.\u201dOn a recent tour of the Holiday Inn, Mr. Shahid was enthusiastic about technology used to protect Kandooma. Apart from using a dredging machine, which he estimated cost several hundred thousand dollars, concrete sea walls have been erected at certain points near the beach.In total, Mr. Shahid said the operating budget for putting shore protection in place at the resort most likely surpassed $1 million.On a recent afternoon, a group of men with weather-beaten skin from the Guraidhoo council lounged on the beachfront, chewing areca nuts and discussing the next week\u2019s agenda.Hussain Yameen, 26, the council\u2019s wiry president, said it had been difficult to compromise with the resort, because, in part, he believes its work has approval from the Environmental Protection Agency. But his face brightened when asked about future projects on the island, saying he hoped Guraidhoo would have shore protection by the end of this year.\u201cRight now, we are trying to get some approval from the government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a plan on developing this island. The whole island will be protected.\u201dNear the water, Mohamed Shareef, 37, who lives in a beachfront house with six members of his family and 18 renters, was less optimistic about his chances of staying put.As water has crept closer to his home, occasionally lapping at steps leading up to the porch, islanders have begun stacking chunks of concrete from demolished buildings and pieces of broken tile along the shore to create a makeshift sea wall.Mr. Shareef said discussions of conservation on Guraidhoo should not be limited to guesthouses, which are typically built closer to the shoreline.\u201cIf another five or so feet of beach erodes, the waves will be inside my house,\u201d he said, pointing out toward the spot, over a plain of turquoise water, where a helipad used to be. \u201cIf the government wants to do something, it should not be because tourists are now coming to this island.\u201dMohamed Junayd contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "How to Avoid Stress When You\u2019re Moving", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byOne night last month, while I was in the midst of moving out of the house where I had lived for nearly a decade, I found myself trying to make dinner with two pans, one fork and one knife \u2014 the only things I had not yet packed that were useful.To distract myself from this sorry state, I turned on an episode of \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d and saw a father and son suddenly thrown into moving mode. A house flipper had knocked on their door and offered them cash to get out ASAP. But they were shown calmly putting random items into boxes that didn\u2019t look as if they had been salvaged from a grocery or liquor store \u2014 as were most of my boxes \u2014 after which they stopped to have a leisurely heart-to-heart talk.\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d I yelled at my iPad, which was on top of the TV tray where I would eat while sitting on a paint-splattered folding chair, since I had just sold my dining-room set on Craigslist.The move was one of the most stressful experiences of my life, in part because of all the moving parts involved \u2014 I had sold my house much more quickly than expected and needed to find a rental and storage on short notice \u2014 but also because moving isn\u2019t something most of us do very often.Richard S. Citrin, an organizational psychologist and a writer of \u201cThe Resilience Advantage,\u201d said: \u201cWe build routines to make things as efficient as we can. When we move, we do something very foreign to us.\u201dWe don\u2019t have a routine for hiring a mover. We don\u2019t have a routine for how to pack the dishes or bed linens. We just don\u2019t have a routine for upending our lives.It all \u201ctakes a lot of mental and physical energy, and that expenditure of energy is very exhausting,\u201d Mr. Citrin said.Whether you\u2019re paying friends with pizza and a six-pack, or hiring a company to handle packing and moving, the process still takes time \u2014 and typically much more time than you anticipate.When Amanda Goldman-Petri and her family moved from Conroe, Tex., to Bradenton, Fla., in 2015, they went through three movers.The first company gave them a quote and, on moving day, showed up late and doubled the charge. She fired them. The second left half the family\u2019s stuff behind and sent an invoice for more than the quoted price. \u201cWe, of course, refused,\u201d Mrs. Goldman-Petri said. \u201cThey then held our items hostage in a warehouse.\u201dMrs. Goldman-Petri then hired a third moving company to pick up their items from the warehouse. She said they overmeasured (and overcharged), and broke some items.She said that if she ever hired movers again, she would check the company on the Transportation Department website.Mrs. Goldman-Petri said her family had moved a few times before, but this was their first move across state lines. \u201cWe weren\u2019t educated on the difference between local versus national movers, so didn\u2019t expect it to be an issue,\u201d she said.The next time they moved (from their rental into a home they bought last year), they did it themselves.I thought negotiating a sale price for my house with buyers would be the toughest part of the process. Not so. My broker and the buyer\u2019s broker were in constant contact about everything, from what repairs I would make to whether or not the buyer wanted to buy any of the furniture in the house.My broker ended up being a shoulder to lean on, and sometimes to cry on.(The financing hiccup involved the buyer\u2019s deciding to switch from a conventional mortgage to one through the Federal Housing Administration, which meant another appraisal. This could have moved back the closing date. But I had already signed a lease for my next place that started on the scheduled closing day, which could have meant that I\u2019d have to pay both a mortgage and a lease at the same time. Fortunately, none of the feared upheaval came to pass.)\u2018\u2018Anytime you have been living in a place, memories are there,\u201d Mr. Brown said, adding that you should be able to rely on your broker for almost anything during the process (mine also helped me find a plumber to fix two faucets and a contractor to replace broken window panes). The only thing a broker should not give, Mr. Brown said, is legal and accounting advice.In some places, like where I lived in southern New Jersey, buyers and sellers don\u2019t bring lawyers into the process. In New York City, though, a lawyer will almost always be involved.For co-ops, being approved by the board can be another hurdle, Mr. Heller said. Buyers should seek co-op approval as soon as possible, especially if they want to close their deal in June, for example, and the board meets only twice a year.Deals can still be scuttled on the last day \u2014 or wind up costing someone more money. When John Shabe and his wife, Tracey Randinelli, did the final walk-through of the home they were buying in South Orange, N.J., in 2001, the place was broom swept, \u201cbut you definitely saw little piles of dirt on the kitchen floor where they didn\u2019t use a dust pan to pick it up,\u201d Mr. Shabe said. That was just the start: they also found food in the refrigerator, rolls of paintings and canvases in the basement, and oil drums loaded with junk in the garage.The couple didn\u2019t feel as if they could back out of the deal because their things were already loaded onto the moving truck. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to not move because of this,\u201d Mr. Shabe said, so they asked for a credit at the closing to pay for junk removal, which in the end cost double what they expected.One bright spot: In sorting through what the previous owners left behind, they found a print by Walt Kelly, the cartoonist of the comic strip \u201cPogo,\u201d rolled up and left behind. They had it appraised and framed, and it still hangs in their home. (The 2004 appraisal was $300.)Because my house went into contract just a week after I listed it and the deal closed in two months, and I was still paralyzed with grief over losing my dog, I moved most of my stuff into a storage unit, and myself into a furnished, short-term rental in Cape May, N.J.After signing what seemed like 10,002 papers to release a home I had loved to someone else, I got into my old Jeep Wrangler and drove, white-knuckled, through snow and howling wind to the condo. I dumped my duffel bag and backpack in the living room and promptly realized that the sheets I brought didn\u2019t fit the supplied bed.I still haven\u2019t completely unwound, and I haven\u2019t 100 percent unpacked either \u2014 I\u2019m writing this at a kitchen counter with my laptop on top of an old dynamite crate that used to hold my paper recycling.At the end of my two-month lease, I\u2019ll have to figure out what\u2019s next. At least I won\u2019t have to worry about a buyer changing his financing this time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hey, Bo. Nice to Meet You, Rocky. Welcome to the Mayor\u2019s Race.", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byOne candidate does not have a party. Another is $50,000 in the red, more than 18 months after first declaring a quixotic run for mayor. Two more have names that are familiar in Democratic political circles but little in the way of broad support.And the most recent does not have a New York City address, and may end up in federal court trying to get one.The race to become the next mayor of New York City is, for the moment, increasingly a contest between Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat newly invigorated by the conclusion of state and federal investigations into his campaign fund-raising that found no criminal wrongdoing, and Paul J. Massey Jr., a well-funded Republican hopeful.But beyond the klieg lights and chyrons of their million-dollar campaigns are more than a dozen other New Yorkers \u2014 and one real estate developer from San Diego \u2014 who have set their sights on City Hall. Although the outlook for most of them is not good, and several have done little more than file the necessary paperwork with the city\u2019s campaign finance board, others may have a shot at shaking up \u2014 if not actually defeating \u2014 the campaigns of the de facto front-runners.Chief among them is Bo Dietl, a frequently profane retired police detective, former television personality and lifelong Republican who tried to re-register as a Democrat to run in the 2017 primary but filed the paperwork incorrectly and ended up outside both parties. He has raised about $390,000 in contributions, coming in a distant third after Mr. de Blasio (whom he calls \u201cBig Bird\u201d) and Mr. Massey (whom he has described as \u201cMelba toast\u201d).\u201cTwo of the party leaders in the Republican party want to meet with me,\u201d Mr. Dietl said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m an independent, but if the Republicans want to give me the line, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\u201cThis guy Massey is a nice guy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he doesn\u2019t have the horses to run against de Blasio.\u201d Mr. Dietl, 66, said he could still do as many push-ups as years he had been alive.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anti-de Blasio feeling out there,\u201d Mr. Albanese said.\u201cNo matter where I go, people say, \u2018It\u2019s great that you\u2019re running,\u2019\u201d Mr. Avella said.And, as of Thursday, there was suddenly Roque De La Fuente, a millionaire developer from San Diego who ran for president in 2016 as a Democrat but may run as a Republican in New York. Why does he want to be mayor? \u201cHe wants to be president of the United States,\u201d his campaign manager, Rey Olsen, said. New York City mayor is arguably the next best job in politics, he added.Mr. De La Fuente\u2019s desire to run may be real, but his first problem is that he does not live here. Mr. De La Fuente, also known as Rocky, was rejected by the management of an upscale Fifth Avenue hotel and apartment building, the Sherry-Netherland, after he tried to buy an apartment there, his campaign said. If elected, he would have to establish residency in the city before election day.Mr. Olsen said that the building management had \u201crefused to interview\u201d Mr. De La Fuente because he is Hispanic (his parents were born in Mexico), and that the candidate had vowed to sue in federal court. Michael Ullman, an executive vice president at the Sherry-Netherland, declined to comment.The prospect of a well-heeled new candidate entering the Republican race could further complicate efforts by party leaders to avoid a primary and focus attention on Mr. de Blasio.\u201cThat just helps the Democrats,\u201d said Edward Lurie, former executive director of the state Republican Party. \u201cYou want to take on the main event, and this is going to be a side show. It uses up resources, when the resources should be used to go after the other side.\u201dSome county leaders have expressed openness to \u2014 even eagerness at \u2014 the idea of Mr. Dietl as a Republican candidate. (Another prominent Republican candidate, Michel J. Faulkner, a Harlem pastor and former Jets player, has already spent far more than he has raised since declaring his run in 2015.)\u201cI find Bo Dietl, when he is speaking in a group, is charismatic,\u201d said Adele Malpass, the chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party. \u201cHe is interesting. Whatever that \u2018it\u2019 is, he kind of has it.\u201d She added, \u201cHe has a lot of potential but no strategy.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s raised a ton of money without a party: Can you imagine if he was the candidate against Bill de Blasio?\u201d Michael Rendino, the Bronx Republican Party chairman, said of Mr. Dietl. \u201cPaul Massey\u2019s spending makes everybody a little nervous.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Massey\u2019s campaign said: \u201cPaul\u2019s campaign is in the lead position, with record fund-raising, as well as the experience required to win. Paul has made it very clear that like building his successful business, he is building an infrastructure that can win.\u201dAt the end of the interview in his office, where model airplanes hang from the ceiling, Mr. Dietl got down on the floor by his desk, his 9-millimeter Glock handgun visible in a holster on his waist, and almost silently performed 66 push-ups.An earlier version of this article misstated when Roque De La Fuente would need to establish residency in New York City. It would need to be before election day, not before taking office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Others Die, Tontine Investors Win", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byRetiringThat is part of the macabre appeal of the tontine, a 350-year-old investment vehicle that fell into disfavor more than a century ago but is now getting fresh consideration as a way to help people receive steady income in retirement.Tontines became popular in 17th-century Europe, largely to help governments raise money to fight wars. A group of people would invest equal amounts in a fund run by the government, and in turn would draw an annuity \u2014 an annual payment \u2014 until they died. The annual payments of surviving members increased as others died, and the last one standing wound up with the entire dividend. Upon that last investor\u2019s death, the arrangement terminated.They were once common in the United States, too, but fell into obscurity after an embezzlement scandal early in the 20th century.Now some financial advisers and academics like Professor Milevsky hope to revive tontines, making use of current technologies and management skills to help fill a yawning gap in retirement financing.For an investor, a tontine resembles a simple low-fee annuity, with regular lifetime payments. Yet unlike an annuity, the longer you outlive others in the pool, the more you collect, Professor Milevsky said.He added that a tontine can pay a higher yield than an annuity because of its relative simplicity of structure: \u201cI think that the yield element is an important component of why we would like to bring them back.\u201dProfessor Milevsky is in the vanguard of what could be called a backward-looking cabal of financial specialists who suggest that this antiquated investment model may address modern challenges. Longevity risk \u2014 the danger of outliving one\u2019s money \u2014 is near the top of their list.\u201cLongevity risk in society is a big threat, and tontines could be part of the solution,\u201d said Bruno Caron, an actuary at A. M. Best, an insurance rating company based in Oldwick, N.J. With a tontine, after all, if you live longer than everybody else, you collect more money.Before joining A. M. Best last year, Mr. Caron tried to start a venture called Survival Sharing to offer a tontine-inspired investment that pooled people with similar age, gender and health status. But the atypical product never made it past the planning stages.It was \u201cdifficult to navigate through the different mazes of various financial institutions, even when we dealt with members of top management,\u201d Mr. Caron said.Tontines were once quite common. The investment takes its name from Lorenzo de Tonti, an exiled Neapolitan banker living in France, who in 1653 conceived a plan to replenish the royal treasury, depleted by the Thirty Years\u2019 War.His proposal fell flat, largely because the notion of gambling on human life rubbed religious-minded French parliamentarians the wrong way. He ended up in the Bastille after publicly criticizing the government\u2019s decision, and died around 1684.Over in America, Alexander Hamilton proposed a Congressional tontine to pay off Revolutionary War debts in 1790. (Thomas Jefferson squelched the plan.) And in 1793, the founders of the New York Stock Exchange settled into their brand-new digs on the northwest corner of Wall and Water Streets: the Tontine Coffee House, named for the business deal that paid for the structure\u2019s handsome bricks and mortar.In early tontines, it was perfectly legal for an adult to name a child as beneficiary of the tontine dividends. And because children may outlive adults, this may have seemed like a smart strategy. But child mortality was high back then, and, according to Professor Milevsky\u2019s research, there were instances of young nominees dying only to have annuitants falsely identify another child in their place.\u201cThe administration of tontines was a headache in a quill-and-paper environment,\u201d said Kent McKeever, director of the library at Columbia Law School, who has written about the history of tontines.Nonetheless, by the turn of the last century, nearly half of American households were saving for retirement via \u201ctontine insurance,\u201d a riff on the original tontine, introduced by Equitable Life (now AXA) in 1868. The product split premiums between traditional life insurance policies and an investment pool with deferred dividends paid out to survivors after 20 years.Popular culture embellished the tontine\u2019s nefarious reputation. Works by Agatha Christie, Robert Louis Stevenson and P. G. Wodehouse all featured tontine members plotting to kill one another in hope of a big payoff.Lingering legal questions need to be resolved, according to today\u2019s tontine enthusiasts. \u201cI do believe it\u2019s going to take regulatory approvals to make it happen,\u201d said Jonathan B. Forman, a tax law professor at the University of Oklahoma. He envisions 10-year tontines that he calls \u201cSurvivor Funds,\u201d but said that squaring such a product with existing regulations would require time and effort.\u201cState insurance laws could be a problem, state gambling laws could be a problem, and you probably want a lot more certainty about the federal tax laws as well,\u201d Professor Forman said.\u201cIn essence, the blockchain is helping to keep both parties honest through transparency,\u201d he said by email.Mr. McKeever, who will turn 65 in September, said he would prefer a simple investment like a tontine to an annuity, which can be quite complicated.\u201cYou get thrown 30-, 40-, 50-page documents explaining some kind of annuity using this particular background, and 12 different kinds of investments that feed into it, and your eyes gloss,\u201d he said. By comparison, he added, \u201cthe tontine is unbelievably simple \u2014 you can explain it in two pages.\u201dWhile the financial services industry has not embraced tontines, some of Mr. Caron\u2019s colleagues at the Society of Actuaries in Schaumburg, Ill., have begun warming to them, according to Dale Hall, the group\u2019s managing director of research.The group\u2019s pension section \u201cis currently researching the mechanics and feasibility of introducing tontines into today\u2019s market,\u201d Mr. Hall said by email, adding that \u201can understanding of tontines\u201d is pertinent for today\u2019s actuaries.Among those who would welcome a tontine revival is Elliott Weir, owner of III Financial, a boutique financial planning business in Austin, Tex., that primarily serves widows and women who have been divorced.\u201cWomen live longer than men,\u201d Mr. Weir said, \u201cso some line of product like the tontine could give them a chance for current income, with the potential for greater income down the road.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Firm Takes Stake in U.S. Investment Bank Cowen", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 As China looks to spread its economic influence around the world, it is taking a bigger interest in financial companies, a move that could raise scrutiny in the era of President Trump.For Cowen, the deal brings an injection of cash and debt financing and the promise of better access to the Chinese market. CEFC gets a ready-made springboard into high finance in the United States.It is the latest example of surging amounts of Chinese investment targeting overseas companies, especially American ones. Chinese firms made 173 deals targeting American businesses in 2016, according to data compiled by the research firm Dealogic, for a total value of $67.8 billion, more than the total for the six previous years.But the strategy is not a sure bet. Previous attempts by Chinese companies to penetrate American financial services have come under regulatory scrutiny or struggled to generate hoped-for financial returns, though Cowen\u2019s chairman, Peter Cohen, said he viewed his deal as \u201cpretty benign\u201d from a regulatory standpoint.The two companies said in a statement that they wanted to use complementary areas of expertise and geographical focus to expand Cowen\u2019s core equity, research and investment banking businesses.Cowen executives said that because the deal involved only a minority stake and was focused on financial services, not normally seen as a sensitive industry, they were confident it would pass muster with American regulators.\u201cWe\u2019re not a defense contractor or technology business or chip maker,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in a telephone interview from Shanghai. He said because CEFC would take a minority stake, the management of Cowen would retain \u201ccomplete autonomy in the day-to-day running of the business.\u201dCEFC has risen rapidly in Chinese energy and finance \u2014 two industries dominated by government interests \u2014 since it was founded in 2002 by Ye Jianming. Currently the firm\u2019s chairman, he started the company when he was still in his 20s.CEFC, which is privately held, is No. 229 on the Fortune Global 500 list of the world\u2019s biggest companies, with revenue of over 220 billion renminbi, or $33 billion, in 2015 and over 30,000 employees.Mr. Ye was also the chairman of the China Energy Fund Committee, a unit of CEFC China Energy. The committee organized a series of conferences on energy and military affairs in Hong Kong several years ago, attracting well-known retired American admirals and generals, as well as hawkish senior officers from the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Familiar Names at the Store Want You to Stay With Them, Too", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byItinerariesInside a Brooklyn warehouse that has been converted to office and design space are the seeds of a new type of collaboration between the hospitality and retailing industries.There, West Elm, a division of Williams-Sonoma that sells modern furniture and accessories online and in nearly 90 stores nationwide, has created model hotel rooms. Next year, it expects to begin opening boutique hotels in five cities, including Detroit, Charlotte, N.C., and Savannah, Ga.\u201cIt\u2019s more-approachable travel coming to life,\u201d said Peter Fowler, vice president for hospitality and work space at the company. Room furnishings will be similar to those in stores, but are expected to be more durable to withstand repeated cleaning.Mr. Fowler said the company was also looking to create a network of local artists at each location who would display their work at the hotels.The hotel business is diversifying. More travelers are seeking homey surroundings at Airbnb and HomeAway and turning to boutique hotels for their non-cookie-cutter designs. (According to STR, a hotel research firm, domestic occupancy rates in boutique hotels rose to 75 percent in 2015 from 67 percent in 2010.) That is one reason some retailers and designers see an opening for their hotel concepts.At the same time, traffic has declined at retailers with brick and mortar stores, forcing them to look for new ways to sell their wares.\u201cAs online channels steal business from retailers, hotels provide a retailer with a unique, direct and immediate environment to interest consumers,\u201d Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Travel Group, said in an email.Travelers, particularly leisure travelers, are also shoppers. According to the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group in Washington, shopping was the second-most popular activity among leisure travelers, after visiting relatives.Still, retail hotels are in their infancy and can be a high-risk and expensive undertaking. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as people check in and you clean the room,\u201d said Bjorn Hanson, a professor of hospitality and tourism at the Tisch Center of New York University.But, he added, opening a hotel creates a halo effect. \u201cThe brand has a whole new sense of importance.\u201dWestin also sells its Heavenly Bed at Pottery Barn, a separate Williams-Sonoma division. Linens and bedding are available at Nordstrom.\u201cIt was driven by customer demand,\u201d Brian Povinelli, senior vice president and global brand leader for Westin. Since 2000, he said, the brand has sold 100,000 mattresses and 175,000 pillows, worth some $150 million.The convergence of hotels and merchandise started, perhaps unsurprisingly, at luxury properties. Almost two years ago, Baccarat, a French crystal manufacturer, opened a 50-story building with a hotel and apartments across the street from the Museum of Modern Art, six blocks from its Manhattan flagship store.Crystal designs are displayed in public areas. Guests can order from the display and have their purchases shipped to their homes, saving time and a trip to the retail store. Select guest room entrances exhibit art inspired by crystal pieces.\u201cIt allows the guests to interact with the brand in their experiences in the hotel,\u201d said Hermann Elger, managing director at the property.Stephani Robson, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell, said retail companies that open hotels had to work with companies that had hotel experience. \u201cYou need partners and financing,\u201d she said.Bulgari, for example, uses the Marriott reservations system, but does not participate in its loyalty program.Tommy Hilfiger, whose designs include apparel, luggage and linens sold at Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and online, purchased the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach in 2014 and is developing it in conjunction with the Dogus Group, a Turkish conglomerate. Mr. Hilfiger is scouting a second location in Los Angeles.The symbiosis between the two industries makes sense to him. \u201cRetail and hospitality are both dealing with disruption,\u201d Mr. Hilfiger said.Although his name will not be identified with the property, he said he planned to create a line of Raleigh products that would include home and bath goods, fragrances, shampoos, sun creams and beach attire sold only at the property. \u201cIt has to be special and exclusive,\u201d he said.Design hotel properties are likely to be small. West Elm properties are expected to range from 100 to 200 rooms. Mr. Hilfiger is anticipating 88 rooms. Ms. Robson, of Cornell, said about 120 rooms were \u201cthe sweet spot,\u201d requiring only two elevators and providing sufficient revenue while keeping expenses low.As projects move ahead, municipal regulations may affect them. Restoration Hardware trademarked the name RH Guesthouse and applied to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Department of Buildings to convert a building in the meatpacking district that is designated a landmark. The site has active permits requiring review by the landmark commission and the local community board.The company filed another application with the Department of Buildings in late June for interior renovations and a proposal to use the building as a hotel. That application was not complete by the time the plan was ready for review and was disapproved. Restoration Hardware may resubmit the application if it wishes to proceed with the plans. The company had no comment.Current West Elm customers are not sure what to expect. Danielle Lundberg, a photographer in Northern Virginia, said that she appreciated the West Elm aesthetic but that her decision to stay at a property would not be limited to considering furnishings.She prefers hotels that accept pets and said she would evaluate star ratings and prices, then whittle down a selection. She is also guided by neighborhood and parking.\u201cBoutique hotels feel a little more personalized,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the exact same room as everyone else.\u201dSusan Chancey, a stylist and designer in Asheville, N.C., said she had purchased West Elm pieces for clients and her stepdaughter. She said the ambience at a hotel was important to her.Ms. Robson said she expected that West Elm was hoping to reach beyond existing customers. \u201cA brand like West Elm can signal \u2018our brand is experiential\u2019 \u2014 reinforce positioning for customers not familiar with the brand,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Trump in White House, His Golf Properties Prosper", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It is a golden age for golf \u2014 at least as far as the Trump Organization is concerned.\u201cThe stars have all aligned,\u201d Eric Trump, who as executive vice president of the Trump Organization oversees all its golf properties, said on Thursday morning, while sipping an iced tea at the restaurant inside the Trump International Hotel before appearing at a promotional event for the Memorial Day tournament. \u201cI think our brand is the hottest it has ever been.\u201dWhat he did not mention at the news conference, while the cameras were rolling, is the product placement of incalculable value that is helping boost the Trump Organization\u2019s golf courses: his father.It is \u201csynergy\u201d to be sure, for the Trump family and its golf enterprise. Eric Trump says the company has invested more than $1 billion in the golf course business since 2005 and has seen a recent surge in revenue because of the continued rising fortunes on Wall Street, which is always good for this high-end game, as well as the unprecedented attention that the brand is receiving.\u201cYou might call it corruption-tinged synergy,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a liberal nonprofit group. \u201cIt is yet another effort by the family business to cash in on the presidency.\u201dEric Trump defended the overlap, saying it was nothing unusual. \u201cBush arguably brought name recognition to Crawford, Texas,\u201d Eric Trump said on Thursday, noting that George W. Bush had a ranch there that he frequented. But when pressed \u2014 Mr. Bush derived no commercial benefit from his ties to Crawford \u2014 Eric Trump then offered a different defense.\u201cThe American people elected a businessman,\u201d he said, adding that to his father the golf courses are \u201chis home\u201d and the fact that they are for-profit enterprises is secondary.For Mr. Trump, who ridiculed Mr. Obama for playing too much golf when he was in office, the sport is more than a pastime; it is potentially good for his business. And he has been noisily and passionately promoting his golf properties in every corner of the typically staid golf community for more than a decade.In 2022, Bedminster is scheduled to host one of golf\u2019s most prestigious men\u2019s major championships, and he has forcefully \u2014 and so far unsuccessfully \u2014 lobbied the sport\u2019s foremost national governing body, the United States Golf Association, to award its most prized tournament, the United States Open, to a Trump golf course.As early as 2001 he began buying golf courses, and snapped up several in the years after the financial crisis. He typically buys clubs and then spends millions renovating them \u2014 and then defies golf conventions.At the same time, several golf courses in the Trump catalog have commanded respect for their impressive layouts and substantial challenges, and because they are routinely in spectacular condition. A few have climbed into annual rankings of top 100 courses nationally or worldwide.Mr. Trump has for years been the chief promoter of his golf empire. His face, and adept golf swing, have graced the cover of countless golf publications. Until last year, Mr. Trump regularly beseeched prominent golf writers and the editors of top golf magazines to play with him at his courses, offering to whisk them off on his private jet to Scotland.Though Mr. Trump has said the company\u2019s golf resorts have been a roaring financial success, running golf courses is not easy, and an economic downturn or even a rainy summer can hurt the bottom line.It is impossible to know how much money Mr. Trump\u2019s courses actually make. The Trump Organization is privately held and it has not released any detailed financial information on them. Mr. Trump has not released his tax returns, which would also shed light on the courses\u2019 profitability.What little information has been released does not paint a full picture. Take Mr. Trump\u2019s resort in Doral, Fla., which he bought in 2011 with financing from Deutsche Bank. On the financial disclosure forms he was required to file as part of his bid for the presidency, he said that course had revenues of more than $50 million in 2014.Long before Mr. Trump was mixing golf and politics, he was well known for doing business on the links.Mr. Trump brought up one such game at a meeting last month of top corporate executives, pressing Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, to share a story about a game they played years ago at one of Mr. Trump\u2019s courses.\u201cJeff actually watched me make a hole in one; can you believe that?\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House meeting, adding, \u201cI was the best golfer of all the rich people.\u201dAn article on Friday about the Trump Organization\u2019s golf courses misidentified the tournament that activists want moved from Trump National Bedminster in New Jersey to a new location. It is the U.S. Women\u2019s Open, not the United States Open.Bill Pennington contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Workers in Mexico and Merchants in Malaysia Suffer.", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Rising interest rates in the United States are driving money out of many developing countries, straining governments and pinching consumers around the globe.Supported byCIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ, Mexico \u2014 Francisca Hervis Reyes and her family have persevered on the border, working in factories more than 1,300 miles from their hometown. They remained even as deadly warfare between drug cartels turned this city into one of the most dangerous on the planet.Like millions of other people from Southeast Asia to Africa to Latin America, Ms. Reyes and her family are absorbing the consequences of a major shift playing out in the global economy.By mandate, the Fed is answerable to the people of the United States.When times are lean and businesses are reluctant to hire, the Fed makes money more available by nudging down rates. When times are good and concern builds about elevated prices, it cools things off by lifting rates and tightening credit.Yet in reality, the Fed is the central banker to the world.The dollar is the money used most widely as the repository of savings and as the currency for trade. When the Fed lowers rates, it makes the dollar less attractive, encouraging investors to seek rewards elsewhere. When the Fed lifts rates, investors switch gears, yanking capital and selling off other currencies.\u201cEvery time the peso goes down, we can afford less and less,\u201d Ms. Reyes said on a recent evening, as pale desert light gave way to chilly darkness. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about going back to Veracruz. People are leaving the factories and going back to their towns.\u201dThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third consecutive quarter.The Fed forces can be traumatic, especially in less affluent places.More than $259 billion poured into developing countries the next year, according to the Institute of International Finance, a trade association. From 2010 to 2015, the annual capital flows to those places averaged $328 billion.\u201cThe effect of interest rate increases on emerging countries is surprisingly strong,\u201d said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, an international trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing.\u201dMost economists assume the rate increases expected this year will play out far less dramatically. The Fed has telegraphed its plans, giving investors time to prepare. Many emerging countries have amassed larger reserves of dollars, giving them ammunition against a drop in their currencies.Still, some countries are already showing strains.Within the investing world, the peso functions as a proxy for all developing countries \u2014 the thing to bet against when sentiments go negative. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the first port of call for anyone who thinks something bad is going to happen to emerging markets,\u201d said Mark Weisbrot, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. \u201cMexico is vulnerable.\u201dChinese leaders have long nursed fears about an uncontrolled exodus of cash.Allen Zhang, an electrician who works at a coal mine in the mountains of central China, lives in a modest house on the edge of Jincheng, a gritty city whose population has roughly quadrupled over the last quarter-century, to about 500,000.Mr. Zhang has sought to supplement his $290-a-month pay by satisfying new demand for housing. He has tapped into his savings and used his handyman skills to add six rooms to his family home, renting the new quarters out to factory workers.A buyer recently offered $350,000 for the house \u2014 a sum equivalent to what Mr. Zhang would earn in the mines over a century. He turned it down.\u201cI want more,\u201d he said.These are the expectations confronting Chinese officials as the Fed makes it more difficult to keep money inside the country.During the 1990s, China ignored lectures from Washington on the merits of opening up capital markets. When the Asian financial crisis arrived in the late 1990s and investors pulled money out of the region, many economies were leveled. China suffered little, claiming vindication.In the face of the Fed, China retains formidable powers to support the value of its currency. It is sitting on some $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, money it can use to buy its currency in world markets.\u201cMoney in China cannot get out without going through a lot of hoops,\u201d said Zhu Ning, an economist at Tsinghua University.For Vincent Lo, a billionaire real estate developer, such hoops amount to an operational problem.Mr. Lo has long raised financing for projects in China by selling bonds in Hong Kong and Singapore. Before new controls, his companies had over $2 billion worth of renminbi sitting in bank accounts in mainland China \u2014 more than enough to pay his debts coming due outside the mainland.But once China began imposing more limits on the movement of money, his cash and his debts were on different sides of the divide.Mr. Lo has raised $500 million in recent weeks by selling dollar-denominated bonds in Singapore.\u201cI don\u2019t want to get hit with not having the foreign currency to pay,\u201d he said. \u201cI might just get a couple hundred million more.\u201dA year ago, the lights were burning brightly for Vivy Yusof, a prominent Malaysian entrepreneur. So brightly that, on an episode of her reality show, she joked, \u201cI\u2019m Kim Kardashian.\u201dMs. Yusof is at once a symbol of what has gone economically right in Malaysia and, with the Fed now raising rates, how much could go wrong.She is part of a group of tech-savvy business leaders who have emerged as Malaysia tries to evolve beyond its traditional dependence on selling commodities like palm oil and petroleum.Economic growth has been flagging, a reality playing out across Southeast Asia as the region adjusts to China\u2019s slowdown. China is not buying commodities like it used to.Even before the Fed\u2019s move, global investors were fleeing. Foreigners once owned more than half of Malaysia\u2019s local bonds, but have sold off 17 percent of their holdings since August. Their nervousness grew in November as Malaysia imposed controls on the movement of money.Malaysia\u2019s currency, the ringgit, has lost 8 percent against the dollar in the last year. For Malaysia\u2019s consumers \u2014 and for companies that serve them \u2014 imports are getting more expensive.Ms. Yusof sells hijabs and other clothing, catering to cosmopolitan Muslims with a taste for distinctive patterns. Some of her garments are made in China. When the dollar rises, her profit margins are squeezed. And though online sales are brisk, business at her three mall stores has begun to slow.\u201cWe used to do a lot better,\u201d she said.Southeast Asia\u2019s leading budget airline, AirAsia, based in Malaysia, is preparing for worse. Its biggest costs are in dollars \u2014 fuel and jet leases. Yet most revenue is in local currencies, meaning that the airline is taking in less just as it must spend more.AirAsia has increased its hedging \u2014 basically, insurance against whipsawing markets \u2014 to three-quarters of its dollar-based fuel costs, from about half. It hopes to raise $1 billion and reduce debt by selling an airline leasing business.AirAsia\u2019s founder and chief executive, Tony Fernandes, has been lobbying the Malaysian government to cut the fees it charges for airport slots. \u201cI\u2019m going around seeing varying cabinet ministers saying, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get your costs down,\u2019\u201d he said.Across Asia, in a trendy Istanbul neighborhood along the Bosporus, shopkeepers complain that their sales have been savaged by the plunge in the Turkish lira, which has lifted their prices for imported sporting goods, luggage and clothing.The chaos of a recent spate of terrorist attacks seems increasingly a memory, as college students have returned to the neighborhood of Kadikoy. But foot traffic is having little impact on the till.\u201cThere is no decline in number of customers,\u201d said Serdar Celik, who runs a luggage store that specializes in foreign brands. \u201cBut sales fell by 25 percent compared to last year. Prices rose by 20 percent for almost everything in the last month.\u201dIn Mexico, Francisca Hervis Reyes has no way to cut her own costs, beyond putting less food on the table.Born in southern Mexico, where her parents were farmers, she headed north nearly three decades ago, to the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, in a reach for upward mobility. The borderlands were buzzing with factories known as maquiladoras \u2014 plants that assemble components for American manufacturing operations. Soon, Nafta would fertilize more.Ms. Reyes, 47, began making upholstery for car seats. Her wages purchased fresh fruit and meat. She hired a nanny to look after her three daughters.These days, she makes auto parts that go into transmissions, earning 162 pesos per day, or about $8.40. Her husband earns 149 pesos per day \u2014 about $7.75 \u2014 making fuses for electrical boxes.But as the peso has surrendered roughly one-fourth of its value over the last five years, their living standard has deteriorated.Throughout Mexico, the weak peso has been lifting prices for everything from cars to cooking gas to tortillas. As of February, prices were rising at an annualized pace of nearly 5 percent, Mexico\u2019s highest rate of inflation in seven years.Mexico\u2019s central bank has been steadily lifting rates to protect its currency in the face of a possible trade war with the United States. With the Fed adding pressure, many analysts expect Mexico\u2019s central bank to deliver a fresh rate increase this month.Chicken, beef, milk and vegetables have all risen in price, with many of these items imported from the United States. Ms. Reyes\u2019s family subsists mainly on beans and pasta.She pointed toward a bodega across a patch of gravel from her house. \u201cEggs are twice the price they were six months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been buying less.\u201dShe used to send money back to her family in Veracruz, where one of her sisters is blind. Not anymore.Inside the concrete-block home she shares with her husband, their three daughters and three grandsons, the ceiling is stained from leaks. The walls are crumbling. Two windows are boarded up and held together by masking tape, having been damaged by a rock fight between two gangs.As the family prepared to share a lone queen-size bed, positioning their bodies sideways to maximize space, they had no heat to cut the 44-degree chill.\u201cWe use blankets,\u201d Ms. Reyes said, \u201cand what love we have.\u201dPeter S.

{"Headline": "Corporate Japan Is on Foreign Buying Spree. Toshiba Shows Pitfalls.", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Toshiba of Japan had big dreams for global expansion when it bought the American nuclear company Westinghouse 11 years ago. To make them come true, it seemed willing to pay almost any price.At $5.4 billion \u2014 double initial estimates \u2014 the amount Toshiba paid to take control of Westinghouse took many aback. Japanese companies were known for splurging on foreign deals, then coming to regret it. Toshiba was put on the defensive from the start.\u201cI want to make this an example of a successful foreign acquisition,\u201d said Toshiba\u2019s president, Atsutoshi Nishida, who was all too aware of corporate Japan\u2019s shaky deal record. He insisted Toshiba had paid the \u201ccorrect price.\u201dYet corporate Japan\u2019s buying binge has only intensified. Overseas acquisitions have doubled in value over the past three years, as declining business prospects at home propel previously inward-looking companies into foreign markets, where more famous names like Toyota and Honda have already made their mark.The problem? Too many Japanese deals are duds, specialists in mergers and acquisitions say.Some deals done years ago are now swamping Japanese companies with red ink. The failures point to a lack of accountability at the companies \u2014 and could portend more stumbles to come.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that they have no other choice, that the only way to grow is though foreign acquisitions,\u201d said Hideaki Miyajima, a professor in the commerce department of Waseda University in Tokyo. Desperate deal making, he said, is a natural response to problems in Japan\u2019s economy \u2014 but one that can all too easily backfire.\u201cWhen the president says \u2018We\u2019re buying,\u2019 subordinates see it as their job to get a deal done, no matter what,\u201d Professor Miyajima said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s too expensive, no one stops it.\u201dKnown for splurging on trophy assets in the 1980s, Japanese companies today are buying up foreign names for a different reason: Their country\u2019s population is shrinking and aging, and consumers are no longer spending the way they used to. Department store sales and supermarket sales have declined. Beer sales have fallen by nearly half since 2001.Desperate for new customers, Japanese businesses spent more than $100 billion on foreign takeovers in 2016, according to Dealogic, which tracks deal data. That was close to a record; measured in yen rather than dollars, it was the most ever.Executives hope the investments will generate faster growth and higher profits down the line. But inexperience, recklessness and weak oversight by corporate boards have led to past missteps.\u201cOften there\u2019s no one on the board who can oppose the president,\u201d said Nobuo Sayama, a former investment banker who has advised both Japanese acquirers and foreign targets. \u201cAs a result, companies pay absurd amounts of money, or they mismanage the acquisition afterward.\u201dToshiba is hardly alone.Kirin, the beer maker, bought a string of breweries overseas, including Brazil\u2019s second-largest brewer, Schincariol, for a total of $3.9 billion in 2011. Last month, it sold the business to Heineken for $700 million.The sale followed heavy write downs. \u201cIt was gut-wrenching, but we had to drain the wound,\u201d Kirin\u2019s chief executive, Yoshinori Isozaki, said in 2015 after booking a $1 billion loss on the investment. He added: \u201cOverseas strategy is very difficult.\u201dRakuten, Japan\u2019s biggest e-commerce site, wrote off most of its 2010 purchase of a French online retailer last year. Marubeni, a major Japanese trading house, wrote down its 2013 acquisition of the Gavilon Group, an American grain trader.Many takeovers fail. And it is difficult to say exactly how much Japanese companies overpay for their targets, since valuations can be subjective and information on smaller deals is not always disclosed.Still, Japanese buyers do seem unusually generous. According to Dealogic, from 2014 to 2016 they paid 40 percent more on average than their target companies were valued by stock markets. That compares with a 29 percent premium paid by American acquirers in comparable deals.Bain & Company, a merger advisory firm, found that Japanese buyers ended up writing down the value of an acquisition or selling it under financial pressure in around 40 percent of cases \u2014 an unusually high rate. Junya Ishikawa, a partner at Bain, said bosses often leapt at what they saw as \u201cgame-changing, once-in-a-lifetime deals\u201d and ended up in over their heads.And at sprawling conglomerates like Toshiba, whose chief executives rise through the ranks and serve for only a few years, bosses control mountains of cash and feel they must use it quickly to create a legacy.\u201cShareholders ask executives why they\u2019re holding on to so much cash, and they say they\u2019re thinking about M&A deals,\u201d said Mr. Sayama, now a professor at Hitotsubashi University. \u201cThen investment bankers come calling with proposals.\u201dOn Friday, Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, said Westinghouse needed to decide by the end of this month whether to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. Toshiba faces a March 27 deadline to publish its latest assessment of its finances, and what happens to Westinghouse will be crucial. If Toshiba misses the deadline, it could be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.Toshiba declined to comment on any deliberations, saying it was a matter for Westinghouse and American authorities, but it did say on Tuesday that it was \u201cactively considering\u201d a sale and other strategic options for the unit.In seeking to build nuclear power plants in the United States, Toshiba was working hand in hand with the Japanese government, which has been keen to develop new markets for Japanese infrastructure technology. Tokyo offers low-interest financing, in the form of loans and loan guarantees from the state-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation, to companies including Toshiba that take on such projects. Critics say government support can lead companies to ignore economic risks.The bank declined to comment on loans to specific companies.Toshiba sought to resolve its Westinghouse problem by buying an American construction company, Stone & Webster. The company is a contractor on two Westinghouse nuclear-power projects, in South Carolina and Georgia, that are years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.Satoshi Tsunakawa, Toshiba\u2019s president, said at a news conference last month that Toshiba had approved the acquisition in the hope that, by taking direct control of Stone & Webster, Westinghouse could reduce cost overruns. Instead, the takeover made things worse: Stone & Webster was facing billions of dollars in liabilities.Mr. Tsunakawa said Toshiba was investigating how Westinghouse and its advisers failed to spot the liabilities when deciding how much to offer Stone & Webster\u2019s owner, the engineering group Chicago Bridge & Iron Company.Mr. Tsunakawa did little to rebut another common criticism of Japanese acquirers \u2014 that they rely too much on outsiders\u2019 assessments of what businesses are worth, without doing hard-nosed examinations of their own.\u201cC.B.&I. gave us the documentation,\u201d he said, \u201cand we believed it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of Atsutoshi Nishida, an executive at Toshiba at the time it bought Westinghouse. He was president, not chairman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Platform Companies Are Becoming More Powerful \u2014 but What Exactly Do They Want?", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyDuring a February ride in San Francisco, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was recorded arguing with and eventually berating an Uber driver from the back seat of his car. The driver, who had been working with the company since 2011, accused Kalanick of undercutting drivers of high-end cars like his, plunging him into bankruptcy. Kalanick responded with a lecture about the basic economic logic of his company: Soon, the supply of luxury cars on the app would be reduced, causing demand to increase. Besides, he went on, if the company hadn\u2019t added a lower-priced tier, it would have been beaten by competitors. This did not satisfy the driver, which seemed to enrage Kalanick, who erupted into a moralizing tirade. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own [expletive],\u201d he said, before leaving the car.Uber, like so many other successful tech companies in 2017, is a \u201cplatform business,\u201d one built around matchmaking between vendors and customers. If successful, a platform creates its own marketplace; if extremely successful, it ends up controlling something closer to an entire economy. This is intuitive in a case like eBay, which connects buyers and sellers. Airbnb, too, resembles an age-old form of commerce, connecting property owners with short-term lodgers. TaskRabbit and Fiverr connect contractors with people looking to hire them. Some of the largest platforms are less obviously transactional: Facebook and Google connect advertisers with users, users with one another, software developers with users. But while the transactions that happen on their platforms largely take a different form \u2014 taps, shares, ads served and scrolled past \u2014 the principles are essentially the same, as are the benefits. These businesses are asset- and employee-light, low on liability and high on upside. They aspire to monopoly, often unapologetically, and have been instrumental in rehabilitating the concept. (The logic is seductive and often self-evident: Facebook is more useful if everyone is on it, therefore everyone should be on Facebook.)Predictably, platforms have long been intoxicating to investors. They\u2019ve also been the subject of rapturous popular business writing. In their 2016 book \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms,\u201d the economists David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee cast the subject in revolutionary terms, calling for a \u201cnew economics\u201d to account for businesses that are \u201ctransforming economies\u201d around the world, \u201cmaking life easier and better for billions of people\u201d \u2014 the sort of broad and ideological claim previously reserved by economists for capitalism as a whole.Amid the cheerleading, a comprehensive criticism of the platform model has been slow to emerge. Nick Srnicek\u2019s \u201cPlatform Capitalism,\u201d published in December, tries to situate the rise of platforms in a broader history of capitalism and to project those lessons forward. Srnicek recasts a few features of platform businesses as potentially problematic. Among them is their tendency to metastasize from transaction enablers to, with sufficient success, participation gatekeepers. A food-delivery app like Seamless begins its life with promises of liberation, connecting customers with nearby restaurants, taking care of payments and eliminating phone calls. But in the cities where it has been most successful, its customer base becomes too big to ignore, even for restaurants that struggle to afford its steep commissions. In other industries, the stakes are much higher. An insurgent Airbnb feels as if it\u2019s enabling new types of transactions between previously unconnected people. A dominant Airbnb might come to resemble something between a superintendent and a landlord for millions, not to mention a force reshaping cities in its image.Platform companies have themselves hired economists to help conceptualize and manage the economies they\u2019ve created. Google, Airbnb, Uber and Amazon have aggressively recruited professors and researchers to help understand what, exactly, they have on their hands, and how to expand, regulate and exploit it. Within a rigidly structured platform like Uber, for which the company sets prices, the economic problems are somewhat akin to those of a command economy: How low can we push the cost of a ride before drivers stop participating? (Quite low, for now.) How do we deal with sudden increases in demand? (Surge pricing, controversially.) How might new drivers be both induced to join the platform and more deeply compelled to stay? (Through the introduction of vehicle-financing programs and short-term loan services.)Platforms are, in a sense, capitalism distilled to its essence. They are proudly experimental and maximally consequential, prone to creating externalities and especially disinclined to address or even acknowledge what happens beyond their rising walls. And accordingly, platforms are the underlying trend that ties together popular narratives about technology and the economy in general. Platforms provide the substructure for the \u201cgig economy\u201d and the \u201csharing economy\u201d; they\u2019re the economic engine of social media; they\u2019re the architecture of the \u201cattention economy\u201d and the inspiration for claims about the \u201cend of ownership.\u201dBut the tensions that platforms like Uber create with their customers, their workers and the world that surrounds them will soon become harder to ignore as these companies foment economic and social change, the consequences of which will increasingly be thrust into spectacular display. The Kalanick video was a P.R. nightmare not just for Uber but also for the platform economy in general, posing grand questions about the world it promises, or threatens, to create. The zeal for platforms, combined with the technology industry\u2019s internalization of their merits and inevitability, will push them into areas where the tensions they create become starker and the ideologies they carry become more apparent.Nowhere is that ideological dimension more clear than in the Kalanick video from February. Driver and founder sat inches apart, alienated from each other by the system over which one presides and within which the other toils: the founder explaining to the driver how the platform works and must work; the driver appealing to this person for better pay. It resembles nothing more than one man remarking on the rain while the other thinks, \u201cDon\u2019t you control the weather?\u201d Platforms seek total control even as they abdicate responsibility. In other words, they\u2019re perfect.For now, the tensions that platforms can breed have been obscured \u2014 or at least ignored \u2014 in large part because platformized labor has arrived first in sectors where employment was already widely precarious and contract-based, like taxi driving. As the model expands, these tensions may become more visible as workers with more political and social capital are subjected to them. The recent history of platforms, however, has been defined by the failure of all but a few smart or lucky people to imagine just how successful and powerful they can be.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

He was subsequently put under house arrest, pending a trial.The Bank of Portugal has accused Mr. Salgado and other officials of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo of mismanagement and concealing information when they sold debt to investors without disclosing existing losses.The collapse of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was a setback for Portugal just months after the country emerged from a \u20ac78 billion, three-year bailout financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.Advertisement"}

He said he wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 \u201cthat A.C.A. is terrible,\u201d he told Schumer \u2014 which was an obvious nonstarter for the incoming minority leader. He also said he wanted a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, a trillion dollars sounds good to me,\u2019\u2009\u201d Schumer told me. But to get Democrats on board, he warned, three conditions had to be met. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it with these tax breaks,\u201d he said. Second, he could not \u201ccut the programs we care about \u2014 Medicare, education, scientific research \u2014 to pay for this. It\u2019s got to be new spending.\u201d Finally, the bill had to preserve existing environmental and labor protections. \u201cI said, \u2018To do that, you\u2019re going to have to get half your party really mad at you.\u2019\u2009\u201dSchumer, as he saw it, was calling Trump\u2019s bluff. \u201cDonald Trump ran as an anti-establishment populist \u2014 against both the Democratic and Republican establishments,\u201d he told me. Whether or not he had meant it, the Democrats could try to hold him to it. On the several occasions that Trump called Schumer in the weeks after the election, Schumer argued that he could try to govern as a hard-right conservative, but \u201cAmerica is not a hard-right country,\u201d and there would be electoral consequences.It might not have been the strongest card to play, but Schumer did not have a strong hand. The election in November left the Democrats stripped of power at every level of federal authority. Schumer would now possess the only means they had of exerting even limited influence over Trump\u2019s agenda: a Senate Democratic caucus that, while several seats shy of a majority, was large enough to make life complicated for Senate Republicans. But that could happen only if the Democrats formed a united front \u2014 and it was unclear whether they could, or even wanted to.The 2016 election was not just an electoral crisis for the party but also an existential one, more severe than any that the Democrats had experienced in decades. The party had glided through the campaign with a sense of destiny: In July, Schumer breezily remarked that \u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\u201d Then Hillary Clinton lost to a candidate who revived a strain of nativist, nationalist politics that had been dormant in the Republican Party for at least a generation, and who won in part on the ballots of Barack Obama voters in traditionally Democratic strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin. \u201cI sleep like a baby,\u201d Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, told me. \u201cAnd I can sleep anywhere \u2014 on the road, on the floor, in my kid\u2019s bed jammed up against the wall.\u201d But on election night, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but I stayed up all night. I was, mentally, totally unprepared. At some level, you do have this \u2014 \u201d he trailed off and was silent for a moment. \u201cYou do start to question whether you know the country as well as you thought.\u201dThe Democratic primaries and caucuses, meanwhile, had left the party sharply divided. Clinton lost 22 states to Bernie Sanders, Vermont\u2019s independent and self-identified socialist senator, whose out-of-nowhere challenge had stirred a grass-roots excitement that Clinton\u2019s campaign conspicuously lacked and acrimoniously split the Democratic Party\u2019s centrist and left-leaning contingents \u2014 the latter of which viewed the Obama years as a missed opportunity to fight economic inequality, reorient trade policy and rein in Wall Street. Clinton might have won the popular vote, but in a way, this only amplified the confusion: about whether the party needed to transform or simply tinker; whether it needed to move to the right or to the left; whether the voters who were willing to vote for a candidate who said the things Trump said could be won back at all.Among the Democrats who appeared to share Klain\u2019s postelection view was Harry Reid, Schumer\u2019s predecessor as minority leader, who would be retiring in December. Reid and Schumer, then Reid\u2019s deputy, were an effective team for years in the Senate, partners in a long-running good-cop-bad-cop act. Schumer was known as a sharp-elbowed partisan during his 18 years in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate he had become an avatar of the gabby aisle-crossing bonhomie that had historically characterized the upper chamber. \u201cYou know, I get along,\u201d Schumer told me. \u201cI\u2019m in the gym in the morning, I\u2019m talking with Thune, and Lamar, and Cornyn all the time,\u201d he said, referring to the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn. \u201cI\u2019m friends with them. They attack me, I attack them. We understand that.\u201dThis was the old way of the Senate \u2014 one that began to fade in the late 1970s as the ideological consolidation of the parties accelerated, reducing their need and taste for compromise. By the time Schumer arrived in 1999, four years after the Newt Gingrich-helmed Republican revolution, it was fast becoming an anachronism, with meals in the senators\u2019 bipartisan dining room giving way to one-party caucus lunches. By the time Reid became minority leader, amid the scorched-earth polarization of George W. Bush\u2019s second term, it was all but gone.Reid, like his Republican counterpart, McConnell, was one of the rare politicians who seemed to genuinely not care if people liked him or not. He was known for his blunt-instrument floor speeches, sandbags of verbiage delivered with minimal theatrics and less ambiguity of purpose. It was in this mode that he took to the Senate floor, a week after the election, and drew a line.Senate Democrats had tried for years to pass the kind of infrastructure bill Trump had suggested, Reid reminded his colleagues, only to run up against Republican opposition. \u201cIf Trump wants to pursue policies that will help working people, Democrats will take a pragmatic approach,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also have other responsibilities.\u201d He made clear that the price of Democratic cooperation should be Trump\u2019s dropping of Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive chairman who ran his campaign and whom Trump named as his chief White House strategist two days earlier.\u201cIn his first official act, Trump appointed a man who is seen as a champion of white supremacy as the No. 1 strategist in his White House,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAs long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office,\u201d he added, \u201cit will be impossible to take Trump\u2019s efforts to heal the nation seriously.\u201dSchumer, who began holding weekly dinners with the Big Five after the election, believed it was best to allow these senators to cooperate with Trump as necessary. But according to members of Reid\u2019s staff at the time, Reid (who declined to comment) worried that, given Trump\u2019s lack of interest in policy detail and disregard for ethical conflicts, even well-intentioned legislative compromises could prove to be politically costly \u2014 that an eventual backlash against the president would also fall upon Democrats who gestured toward working with him. \u201cReid didn\u2019t want to validate the assumption that this incompetent blowhard could get a bill to the floor in the first place, which has proved to be a struggle for Trump so far,\u201d Adam Jentleson, at the time Reid\u2019s deputy chief of staff, told me.Democrats were also still deeply divided over whether it was even possible to navigate 2017 without resolving the ideological and policy differences that fractured the party in 2016. At a closed-door meeting of the Democracy Alliance \u2014 a network of high-rolling Democratic campaign donors \u2014 at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington the week after the election, Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered an emotional address, excoriating the party for losing its way. One attendee paraphrased her speech to me: \u201cPeople want someone to fight for them \u2014 that\u2019s why they voted for Donald Trump. He might not actually do it, but he said he would fight for them. On trade, in American politics, we\u2019ve gotten where we either look like we\u2019re all about free trade without any empathy for people who have lost their jobs, or we\u2019re rabid nationalist-protectionists. We need to build a policy in between. In 2016, we did not come out clear. When we are clear about what we believe, when we fight for people, we\u2019ll win.\u201d To beat pugilistic right-wing populism, maybe you needed pugilistic left-wing populism.It was a minor fight, but an illuminating one. From one perspective, Warren\u2019s move looked quixotic at a time when the party had bigger problems. From another, it was an argument for survival: Whatever unity the Democrats could manage would be worthless without settling what, and who, the party stood for.The Twitter account that first circulated the blueprint belonged to Ezra Levin, then a 31-year-old associate director for federal policy at an antipoverty nonprofit and one of the document\u2019s authors. Shortly after graduating from college, Levin was hired by Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman representing Levin\u2019s hometown, Austin, Tex., and he was working at Doggett\u2019s office on Aug. 1, 2009, when the congressman went to meet his constituents at a Randalls grocery store in South Austin. At the time, Democrats were trying to maneuver the Affordable Care Act through the House of Representatives, and organizers of the nascent Tea Party movement decided to mount a show of force at the town halls that representatives typically held in their districts during the August recess.As Doggett spoke outside the Randalls, a large crowd of demonstrators gathered, armed with DON\u2019T TREAD ON ME flags, signs assailing \u201csocialized health care\u201d and, in one case, a large poster of Doggett\u2019s face augmented with devil horns. \u201cThey chased him out into the parking lot,\u201d Levin told me recently. When Doggett tried to leave, the crowd surrounded his car.For the congressional staff members who experienced the uprising that August, the lessons of the Tea Party were mostly tactical, and unambiguous. Representatives live in fear of the wrath of their constituents, but also at a remove from it; the legislative process is complicated, blame is easily distributed and Washington is far away. There is an adage on Capitol Hill that five letters from the district about a bill is cause for alarm, and 10 is a full-blown emergency. By those standards, a couple hundred Tea Partyers besieging their elected officials in person was a borderline apocalypse.Republicans had in recent decades outperformed Democrats at this kind of dispersed, ground-level activism. This was in part because the party was more geographically distributed than the Democrats, who were increasingly concentrated in urban areas and interior suburbs. But Democrats had also historically relied heavily on unions and urban party machines to reach voters \u2014 a support apparatus that receded sharply by the late 20th century. The Republicans, who never had such luxuries, assiduously cultivated their own grass roots \u2014 an effort whose success has contributed to the deep erosion of the Democrats\u2019 presence in state legislatures (down 23 percent) and governor\u2019s mansions (down nearly 45 percent) since 2008.The most combustible Tea Party town halls were confrontations with Democrats, like Doggett, whose positions on the A.C.A. stood little chance of changing. But these representatives weren\u2019t really the intended audience; Republicans were. The shaky, hand-held videos posted to YouTube \u2014 the first real recognition, in American politics, of the platform\u2019s potential as a stage for agitprop theater \u2014 and looped endlessly on Fox News were a message to wavering Republicans that obstruction would be rewarded and compromise would be punished. \u201cThey were really smart on strategy,\u201d Levin told me: \u201cFocus on your local members, and be defensive in nature.\u201d Perhaps most important, \u201cThey understood that \u2018No\u2019 was a complete sentence.\u201d\u201cIndivisible\u201d was a bullet-pointed pr\u00e9cis of the tactics the document\u2019s authors had seen work against them \u2014 a guide to getting to \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusion that the resistance will defeat every piece of Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Levin told me. The Tea Party lost many battles, including its biggest: \u201cObamacare was passed. Dodd-Frank did pass. Lloyd Doggett did vote for health care. But it did slow down and water down legislation. We didn\u2019t get card check for unions. We didn\u2019t get cap and trade. We didn\u2019t get a lot of things.\u201dIf the Indivisible Guide was a blueprint for a movement, it was an unusual one, bearing little resemblance to liberal or left-wing movements of the past. It called for no ideological remaking of the Democratic Party, no housecleaning of the establishment, no throwing-out of the bums \u2014 or at least not the Democratic ones. Its authors weren\u2019t political outsiders; they were members of Washington\u2019s mainstream Democratic professional class. The document presented not just a strategy for standing up to Trump but also an argument for sidestepping the party\u2019s most divisive internal conflicts. It offered a way of thinking about resisting the Trump administration that set aside the debate over what kind of party the Democrats should be. \u201cThis is not a panacea,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cnor is it intended to stand alone.\u201d It was not a policy agenda, and that was the point. \u201cThe Tea Party took root in 2009, focused on fighting against every proposal coming out of the new Democratic administration and Congress. This focus on defense rather than policy development allowed the movement to avoid fracturing. Tea Party members may not have agreed on the policy reforms, but they could agree that Obama, Democrats and moderate Republicans had to be stopped.\u201dBy the week after Inauguration Day, however, rallies were happening nationwide every Tuesday and had acquired an angrier edge. Trump was issuing a flurry of executive orders: reduced regulations on manufacturing, a pledge to disassemble the Affordable Care Act, advancements of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, the end of federal funding for \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal authorities in detaining people suspected of immigration-law violations \u2014 and the go-ahead to build his long-promised United States-Mexico border wall. Then, on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 27, the White House announced it was immediately blocking all travel to the United States by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries.The following afternoon, when a crowd of 10,000 gathered to protest in Manhattan\u2019s Battery Park, the first person in line to address the demonstrators, after the rally organizers, was Chuck Schumer. Taking the microphone, Schumer led the crowd in an old standby of a chant \u2014 \u201cA people united will never be divided!\u201d \u2014 and, somewhat tentatively, raised his fist.A couple near where I was standing, next to the stage, started laughing. It was a strange thing to see: Schumer was at the barricades, but Schumer was not really a barricades kind of guy. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is life and death for so many people,\u201d he intoned, and waved his arm in the direction of the Statue of Liberty, glinting in the distance over his shoulder. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is that beautiful lady in the harbor \u2014 and what America is all about.\u201dSchumer\u2019s presence at the rally suggested just how quickly, and definitively, the politics of the moment had been settled. In the week since the Women\u2019s March, Trump\u2019s executive orders had confirmed liberals\u2019 worst fears of his intentions and the helplessness of congressional Democrats to stand in his way. And by the end of that week all four cabinet appointees under consideration \u2014 Mattis; Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly; Mike Pompeo, director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations \u2014 sailed through their confirmation votes with no serious opposition.Schumer, in particular, had become a target of outrage. He had not only declined to rally his caucus against the cabinet nominees, but he had also voted for all four of them himself. As he was speaking, I heard a burst of effusive applause and cries of \u201cSenator! Senator!\u201d coming from behind me. I turned and saw, gliding through the scrum in the direction of the stage, the bald dome of Cory Booker\u2019s head. He was beaming, obliging fans with high-fives and back slaps. By some measures, Booker\u2019s voting record in the Senate placed him a couple of clicks to the right of Schumer. But Booker voted no on Kelly and Pompeo, and Schumer did not. Booker was at the airport protests the night before, and Schumer was not.\u201cMy middle name is Ellis \u2014 Charles Ellis Schumer,\u201d Schumer was saying. \u201cI was named after Uncle Ellis, who was named after Ellis Island. I named my daughter\u2019s middle name Emma, after Emma Lazarus, and what she said 100 years ago that\u2019s emblazoned on that beautiful statue \u2014 \u201d\u201cVote no on Sessions!\u201d a handful of people around me were chanting now. Jeff Sessions, Schumer\u2019s Senate colleague, would be up for a confirmation vote as attorney general the following week.\u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore \u2014 \u201dAfter Schumer yielded the stage to Gillibrand \u2014 \u201cShe voted no!\u201d another woman near me shouted approvingly \u2014 he started making his way through the crowd, right into what happened to be a particularly dense pocket of his detractors. \u201cPut \u2019em up, everybody!\u201d he said, grinning, offering his hands for high-fives. \u201cPut \u2019em up for our immigrants!\u201d\u201cVote no, Senator,\u201d someone yelled. \u201cVote no!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m no on DeVos,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cNo on Tillerson. No on Mulvaney. No on Carson. No on Mnuchin. No on all of them!\u201d (He had, in fact, already announced he was voting against Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Mick Mulvaney \u2014 the prospective secretaries of education and state and head of the Office of Management and Budget, respectively.)\u201cWhy did you confirm Haley and Mattis?\u201d someone demanded.\u201cGrow a spine, Chuck!\u201d a gray-haired, trimly mustachioed man screamed, practically in Schumer\u2019s ear, his voice cracking: \u201cGrow a spiiiiiiiine!\u201d A scruffy young man, perched in the crook of a tree, began leading a chant: \u201cGrow a spine, Chuck! You must obstruct!\u201dSchumer is one of those politicians who seem to feed on the attention of a crowd, even a largely hostile one, and he pressed on gamely, smiling and shaking hands, pointing in the direction of the occasional familiar face: \u201cHey Dave, nice to see you!\u201d He was almost out to the street, the crowd around him thinning, when a middle-aged woman in a \u201cpussy hat\u201d called out, in a Brooklyn accent nearly as thick as Schumer\u2019s, \u201cWhat about the first four votes?\u201dSchumer stopped, a hint of a smile on his face, as if intrigued by the specificity of the harangue. \u201cWould you have voted against Mattis?\u201d he asked.\u201cEverything they do.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the only one who came out against torture.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s a defensive vote?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo we\u2019re going to keep figuring out who\u2019s a relief?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no \u2014 all the other bad ones, we\u2019re going against.\u201d He swept off up the block with his aides, a man trying to figure out how to be reasonable in deeply unreasonable times.The Democrats called for an all-night marathon debate of DeVos\u2019s nomination leading up to the vote on Feb. 7. It wasn\u2019t a filibuster \u2014 Reid had done away with those for cabinet nominees in 2013 \u2014 but a kind of sit-in: an effort to draw attention to the vote in hopes of further overloading the Senate office buildings\u2019 phone lines and nudging off the fence one of several Republican senators who had been identified, perhaps wishfully, as potentially persuadable. It was also an unsubtle challenge to Senate Democrats: the first moment since the airport protests for the party to stand up and stand together.As they held the floor Monday night and through the early hours of Tuesday, the senators stood in front of the C-Span cameras and read off messages from constituents, urging them to send more to their Republican colleagues before the noon vote. By Monday evening the hashtag #HoldTheFloor was trending on Twitter, accompanied by emoji of praying hands, by inspirational quotes, by photos of Nelson Mandela or of Hodor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dAfter an hour, the camera cut away, and a mildly disheveled-looking Tim Kaine ambled onto the floor to take his turn. \u201cTimmy!\u201d Schatz exclaimed. \u201cAre you going to speak for, like, an hour without notes?\u201d Kaine grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve got three pages,\u201d he said.\u201cFourteen Democrats voted for Mike Pompeo,\u201d Ezra Levin, the Indivisible Guide co-author, told me. \u201cThis was a man who slandered Muslims, was open to torture, and 14 Democrats voted for him! That\u2019s why you saw people outside Dianne Feinstein\u2019s office, outside of Schumer\u2019s office, Amy Klobuchar\u2019s office. The base wants them to stand on principle. In the two weeks between Pompeo and DeVos, there were massive protests. And zero Democrats voted for DeVos. Pompeo was an awful pick; DeVos was an awful pick. The thing that changed was not the degree of their awfulness, it was that people stood up.\u201dBut even as a sort of guarded optimism set in among many Democrats, there was a gloom among the party\u2019s left flank that appeared nearly as thick as it was in November \u2014 a sense that the party, buoyed by the easy gratification of opposition, was punting on resolving difficult questions, at its own peril. Just before visiting Schumer, I went to see Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office. In a couple of hours, the Vermont senator\u2019s colleagues would be gathering in Senate dining room to share a meal \u2014 a bipartisan tradition before presidential speeches to Congress. But Sanders did not intend to be among them. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to skip the dinner tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in a very convivial mood. I don\u2019t want to pretend. These are very, to my mind, frightening times.\u201dI asked him if he thought the Democratic Party knew what it stood for. \u201cYou\u2019re asking a good question, and I can\u2019t give you a definitive answer,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly there are some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo. They would rather go down with the Titanic so long as they have first-class seats.\u201dWhen I met Warren a few weeks later, I asked her about the speech, and whether the postelection unity that Trump provided the Democratic Party made her ambitions to reform it easier or harder to realize. \u201cI think it has reminded Democrats we need to run on our values,\u201d she replied, parrying the question. \u201cBecause our values are more in line with most of America.\u201d If you squinted at the bodies packing the streets and the town halls, though, the picture looked an awful lot like the recent past: Here were people drawn together in defense of liberal immigration and refugee policies, reproductive rights, civil liberties and preserving Obama\u2019s policy legacy, and in opposition to a president who was moving against all those things. These were last year\u2019s arguments, only louder. If Trump, as president, seemed unable to let go of his 2016 campaign, the Democrats seemed like they were acting out an improved version of their own \u2014 the crowds bigger and more unified, the stakes more clearly understood.\u201cThere\u2019s more enthusiasm, more energy, more passion now than there was at any point in the 2016 campaign \u2014 which is both heartening and discouraging, all at the same time,\u201d Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, told me. \u201c\u200bI think that\u2019s what a lot of us are seeing and feeling. And we\u2019re trying to figure out the right way for us to respond to it.\u201dFor now, the question was how far \u201cNo\u201d could carry the Democrats. The Indivisible Guide, in the three months since Levin first posted the Google Doc, had birthed the organization he and his colleagues had not intended to start, with Levin as the executive director. It had registered more than 5,800 local affiliate groups, at least two in each of the country\u2019s 435 congressional districts. In February, Priorities USA, which raised $192 million to support Clinton in 2016, announced it was reorienting itself to support grass-roots organizing \u2014 including an investment in online advertising driving people to the Indivisible Guide\u2019s website listing congressional members\u2019 town halls.Schumer, meanwhile, was planning to lead the Democrats against Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, forcing the Republicans to find 60 votes or get rid of the filibuster. If Republicans tried to gut federal funding for Planned Parenthood in a forthcoming budget bill, he told me, he was perfectly willing to filibuster that too. \u201cI think McConnell and Ryan know they can\u2019t shut down the government,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re in charge now.\u201dAnd Schumer, precisely no one\u2019s idea of a revolutionary, was now, at least in a narrow constitutional sense, the leader of the resistance. On my way out of his new office, I noticed a green marble fireplace and asked him if he\u2019d used it yet. \u201cOh, man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite perk. I live in Brooklyn \u2014 I never had a fireplace. I\u2019m learning to start fires.\u201dAn article on March 19 about the growing opposition movement within the Democratic Party misstated Hillary Clinton\u2019s Manhattan location on election night.

{"Headline": "How \u2018Consumer Relief\u2019 After Mortgage Crisis Can Enrich Big Banks", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byIn every multibillion dollar settlement with a big bank that peddled faulty mortgage securities, a major provision has been a requirement that the bank provide \u201cconsumer relief.\u201dGoldman Sachs, which is not in the business of making home loans, is seeking to meet its obligation to provide $1.8 billion in consumer relief by buying up tens of thousands of distressed mortgages at discounted prices from Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage firm, and then hiring outside firms to rework them.Then there is Deutsche Bank, one of the last of the global banks to settle with federal and state authorities in the United States. The bank, which agreed in January to pay a $3.1 billion civil fine and provide about $4.1 billion in consumer relief, is in a predicament similar to Goldman\u2019s because it does not originate mortgages.The German bank, like Goldman, has the option of going out and buying distressed mortgages from Fannie Mae or the Department of Housing and Urban Development and then either slashing the total amount of debt owed or reducing monthly payments for borrowers.But Deutsche Bank negotiated another path to meeting its consumer relief obligation: In some instances, the bank can get credit for lending money to other firms \u2014 even hedge funds and private equity firms \u2014 that already are in the business of buying soured mortgages with an eye toward revamping them.One criticism of consumer relief settlements \u2014 especially those involving Goldman and Deutsche Bank that effectively empower them to buy mortgages or provide loans to other firms \u2014 is that they come with a profit incentive.Ira Rheingold, executive director of National Association of Consumer Advocates, said the consumer relief requirements in the mortgage settlements were, in essence, creating public policy through enforcement measures. And that, he said, is an imperfect solution.\u201cDo I love this is the way we are now making public policy that Goldman and Deutsche will be able to comply with consent orders for wrongful behavior and then engage in practices that may make them money?\u201d Mr. Rheingold said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel great.\u201dBut, he acknowledged, \u201cthere is some real social utility to it.\u201dStill, Deutsche Bank faces a hurdle in finding takers among hedge fund and private equity firms because those firms might be required to provide documentation of their efforts.In all settlements, a decision to award a bank credit for providing consumer relief to a borrower is determined by an independent monitor. Deutsche Bank\u2019s monitor is Michael J. Bresnick, a partner with the law firm Venable in Washington who is a former federal prosecutor. Settlement monitors, who issue periodic progress reports, have a good deal of latitude in determining whether a bank is in compliance with the terms of the consumer relief provisions.The rub could come if Mr. Bresnick asks a hedge fund or private equity firm to provide him documentation of its efforts in working with borrowers, which could be a deal-breaker given the penchant for secrecy among the billionaire money managers who run these loosely regulated firms.Deutsche Bank could still make it attractive enough for hedge funds and private equity firms by providing dirt-cheap financing. For now, it is hard to know because the bank is still in the process of determining exactly how it will comply with the consumer relief portion of its settlement.Mr. Bresnick is not expected to issue his first progress report until summer.A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment on its plans for complying with the consumer relief requirement.Goldman, which has bought more than 22,000 loans from Fannie Mae since settling with federal authorities in April 2016, had been buying soured mortgages for at least a year.Christina Pretto, a spokeswoman for Lone Star, declined to comment on possible talks with Deutsche Bank, but added that as \u201ca matter of general principle, we are committed to working closely with families to enable them to remain in their homes.\u201dCaliber is also one of a handful of firms writing so-called nonprime mortgages: loans to borrowers with spotty credit histories that are nonetheless considered substantially better than the subprime mortgages that helped fuel the financial crisis.Financing from Deutsche could be important to Lone Star, which until now has largely fueled its mortgage operation with a combination of investor equity, the issuance of bonds backed by nonperforming loans and a $482 million loan from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to Caliber.As for Goldman, it has been buying mortgages through a two-decade old corporate entity called MTGLQ Investors, a reference to mortgage liquidation that describes some of its past activities.Today, most of the soured mortgages that MTGLQ is buying from Fannie Mae are being outsourced to mortgage servicing firms like Ocwen Loan Servicing, Rushmore Loan Management Services and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, which work with borrowers to revamp the mortgages.In all, Goldman has bought delinquent mortgages with unpaid balances totaling more than $5 billion. Most of those loan pools have been bought at prices ranging from 70 cents to 80 cents on the dollar, according to Fannie Mae.In an interview on Wednesday, he said that it was not surprising that Goldman \u201cwas more active\u201d in buying mortgages since the settlement.Mr. Green, who also served as the monitor in mortgage settlements with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, noted that no credit was given for foreclosures.That said, Goldman, which for now is holding onto the mortgages it buys, is beginning to accumulate foreclosures \u2014 an inevitable result of working with borrowers who have not made mortgage payments for many years.Over the past two years, MTGLQ has taken possession of and resold 731 homes, with most of the sales taking place in 2016, according to RealtyTrac, a foreclosure research firm. Most of the homes resold by the Goldman subsidiary have been in Florida, Illinois and New Jersey.Those home sales have totaled about $121 million for the firm, RealtyTrac says.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Bringing Cholera to Haiti, U.N. Can\u2019t Raise Money to Fight It", "Date": "2017-03-19", "News": "Supported byWhen the leader of the United Nations apologized to Haitians for the cholera epidemic that has ravaged their country for more than six years \u2014 caused by infected peacekeepers sent to protect them \u2014 he proclaimed a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to make things right.Other countries have provided additional sources of anti-cholera funding for Haiti outside the trust fund, most notably Canada, at about $4.6 million, and Japan, at $2.6 million, according to the United Nations. Nonetheless, the totals received are a fraction of what Mr. Ban envisioned.In a letter sent to member states last month, Mr. Ban\u2019s successor, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, asked for financial commitments to the trust fund by March 6. He also appeared to raise the possibility of a mandatory dues assessment if there were no significant pledges.The deadline came and went without much response.Mr. Guterres has not stated publicly whether he intends to push for a mandatory assessment in the budget negotiations now underway at the United Nations. Privately, however, diplomats and United Nations officials said he had shelved the idea, partly because of strong resistance by some powerful members, including the United States.Diplomats said part of the problem could be traced to simple donor fatigue, as well as to many countries\u2019 reluctance to make financial commitments without certainty that the money will be used effectively.The donor challenge was acknowledged by Dr. David Nabarro, a United Nations special adviser who rose to prominence running its mobilization to fight the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and who has been leading its fund-raising efforts for Haiti as he seeks to become the next director general of the World Health Organization.Ross Mountain, a veteran United Nations aid official who is its senior adviser on cholera in Haiti, said that a number of ideas concerning the financing were under discussion. And, he said, while \u201c$400 million is not a very large sum, considering the circumstances, we are all very aware about the competing demands.\u201dMr. Mountain also conceded that \u201con the financial side, we have not moved further ahead.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s new United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, who has called the cholera crisis \u201cnothing short of devastating,\u201d did not respond to requests for comment about the funding problem. But in her Senate confirmation testimony in January, Ms. Haley said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to make this right with Haiti, without question, and the U.N. is going to have to take responsibility.\u201dStudies have traced the highly contagious disease to sloppy sanitation that had leached fecal waste laced with cholera germs from latrines used by the Nepalese peacekeepers into the water supply.Advocacy groups that had been somewhat heartened by Mr. Ban\u2019s words have grown increasingly anxious not only about the lack of money, but also about the lack of clarity in how the \u201cmaterial assistance and support\u201d part of the plan, which represents half of the $400 million goal, will be used.Lawmakers in the United States critical of the United Nations\u2019 response in Haiti have also put pressure on the organization.\u201cWhile the U.N. has admitted to wrongdoing and promised to create a fund to provide restitution to the people of Haiti victimized by cholera,\u201d Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said in a statement last week, \u201cthey have failed to make good on these promises.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Angela Merkel Save the West? Don\u2019t Count on It", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 The crisis of Western liberalism just seems to get deeper: first Brexit, then the election of Donald Trump. Last December, a far-right figure came within a whisker of entering the imperial palace in Vienna, and Italy\u2019s young technocratic prime minister resigned after losing a referendum on constitutional reform. Far-right parties now lead the polls in forthcoming elections in the Netherlands and France.Ms. Merkel\u2019s self-effacing, steady political style is certainly the polar opposite of Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic egotism, but for her advocates she stands for much more than just propriety and decorum. She represents an unwavering commitment to human rights and free trade and to a host of rules-based international institutions, like the European Union and NATO and the World Trade Organization.If the future of Western liberalism rests on Ms. Merkel\u2019s shoulders, then it really is in trouble. She has often spoken in support of European and Western unity, but her actions have done little to strengthen them. Moreover, it\u2019s not clear how deep her ideological commitment to liberalism really is \u2014 or, for that matter, whether she has any ideological commitments at all.To understand Ms. Merkel\u2019s ambivalent liberal legacy, we must start with economics. Under her leadership, Germany has steadily performed well \u2014 at the expense of other European countries. Within the zero-sum economy of the eurozone, Germany has enjoyed huge balance-of-payments surpluses, selling machine tools and cars to consumers around the Continent. France, Italy and other former exporters, meanwhile, have fallen behind.The eurozone works for Germany because it provides a mechanism for turning German economic might into a depoliticized, anonymous set of macroeconomic rules. This was why the Greek crisis of 2015 was so traumatic for Germany and why Ms. Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, were unforgiving in their treatment of Greece.The Greek government and, in particular, its finance minister at the time, Yanis Varoufakis, tried to transform the shadowy and technocratic meetings of the eurozone finance ministers into public arguments about the causes of the crisis. This changed Germany\u2019s de facto running of the currency union into something much more sinister, where what is good for Germany is not good for Europe as a whole.But even if Germany has succeeded at the expense of Europe\u2019s poorer countries, Ms. Merkel is no nationalist. Pragmatism and opportunism alone drive her decisions, and retaining power is her primary goal. This has been her approach to politics at home during her nearly 12 years in office: She has taken the sting out of German electoral politics by adopting key policies promoted by other parties. In the space of just weeks in 2011 she reversed her policy on nuclear energy, adopting the Green Party\u2019s longstanding pledge to eradicate Germany\u2019s reliance on nuclear power. She has done something similar on the national minimum wage, a key Social Democrat Party policy that she has made her own.When it comes to the international liberal order, this attitude means that collectively agreed-to rules don\u2019t count when weighed against German public opinion. Just look at Ms. Merkel\u2019s handling of the European refugee crisis. In August 2015, she declared that all Syrian refugees stuck in the Balkans and Southern Europe were welcome in Germany. A cause for celebration for supporters of more open borders, Ms. Merkel\u2019s decision was arguably a unilateral breach of European asylum law.As ever with the German chancellor, it is difficult to know her motives. Perhaps she was overcome by a desire to help desperate people. More likely, she was attempting to rehabilitate Germany\u2019s battered image. Her decision to open Germany\u2019s borders came only a few weeks after she had thrown her weight behind a new bailout agreement with Greece that imposed on the Greek people a pitiless schedule of debt repayments and led to an outpouring of anti-German sentiment in many parts of Europe.Whatever her motivations, her welcoming spirit didn\u2019t last long. In the course of 2016, faced with growing domestic opposition, Ms. Merkel shifted the focus to closing borders and deporting asylum seekers. As many as 70 percent of asylum seekers arrived in Germany without documentation, and Ms. Merkel\u2019s government has turned its attention to expelling those it feels have no right to stay.Will Ms. Merkel defend the Western liberal order against the onslaught of Donald Trump when she visits Washington this week? Of course she won\u2019t. She may not go as far as holding his hand \u2014 but she will strike a deal with Mr. Trump that is good for Germany and good for her electoral fortunes at home. That is what she has always done, and it would be absurd to expect her to do anything different.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Questioning Whether de Blasio Will Learn From a Teachable Moment", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio occasionally lectures his staff about what he calls teachable moments \u2014 mistakes they or others have made that provide an opportunity for reflection and a change of course.But when federal and state prosecutors this week raised serious questions about his ethics while saying that his actions, including on behalf of campaign donors seeking favors with the city, did not rise to the level of a crime, Mr. de Blasio declared it a vindication. And he said nothing would change in the way his administration operated.\u201cI think it is normal for an elected official to receive concerns from people and pass them along for an agency to assess,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday, referring to federal prosecutors\u2019 assertion that he had contacted city agencies on behalf of contributors. \u201cThat\u2019s how we have done things, that\u2019s how we will continue to do things.\u201dOne former senior prosecutor said the bar had been high all along for proving a criminal case, given that campaign contributions are legal and neither Mr. de Blasio nor his aides had personally profited from the transactions. But that is different from being given a clean bill of health, the former prosecutor said, declining to comment on the record about his former colleagues\u2019 case.Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University, said de Blasio \u201cshould be thankful that the U.S. attorney decided as they did.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe question is not whether he did something wrong or punishable, the question is whether this is a habit you want to continue.\u201dOne former aide to Mr. de Blasio, Karen Hinton, came to his defense. Ms. Hinton said she expected that the mayor would make adjustments in how he handles donors. \u201cI think he will make changes because he will not want to find himself in this situation ever again,\u201d she said.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising activities and the actions he may have taken on behalf of donors have been the target of multiple federal and state investigations for more than a year. The investigations have created a distraction, fostered a bunker mentality in City Hall and hampered the mayor in pursuing his agenda. On Thursday, federal prosecutors and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said they had decided a criminal case could not be brought against the mayor or anyone in his inner circle.Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor of public policy at the City University of New York, said that the mayor was right when he said on Thursday that most New Yorkers were focused on their daily concerns rather than the details of the investigations into his fund-raising.\u201cBut he should care about it,\u201d said Mr. Viteritti, who has interviewed Mr. de Blasio for a book about him. \u201cIt has to do with the integrity of the political system.\u201dMr. Viteritti said that in the absence of an indictment, he did not think that the ethics concerns raised by prosecutors would hurt the mayor\u2019s re-election bid. Although he noted that Mr. de Blasio was now running on his own record rather than against the record of his predecessor.\u201cLast time he ran against Bloomberg,\u201d said Mr. Viteritti, referring to the former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. \u201cThis time he\u2019s running against himself.\u201dDespite that, Mr. de Blasio insisted that prosecutors had absolved him and disagreed with the \u201ccharacterizations\u201d of his actions by prosecutors.\u201cMy staff and my colleagues and I have acted in a manner that was legal and appropriate and ethical throughout,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been confirmed by the results of this investigation.\u201dThat provoked strong reaction from the mayor\u2019s critics, who were quick to ask whether Mr. de Blasio had learned from the yearlong investigation.\u201cNarrowly avoiding indictment for most people would be a teachable moment,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, who was an aide to Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cIt does not appear to be the case with him.\u201dMr. Tusk has been one of the mayor\u2019s most visible critics and had been trying to recruit a viable candidate to challenge his re-election. But after the prosecutor\u2019s announcement, he said a second term seemed all but assured for Mr. de Blasio.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who often clashes with the mayor, echoed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s desire to put the matter behind him. But he did so with a twist of the rhetorical knife typical of their rivalry, highlighting problems that the mayor has struggled to control.\u201cI think what\u2019s good is we can actually talk about issues that matter to people now, and government, and we have a lot of them in this city,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said at the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade. \u201cWe have to be talking about homelessness, which is at an all-time high, housing, et cetera, civil rights abuses that are going on at Rikers Island.\u201dEven without a slate of strong opponents, this year\u2019s election means that there are political considerations at play in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s public response.\u201cIf he says, \u2018I\u2019m going to change,\u2019 that\u2019s an admission of guilt,\u201d said Ed Lurie, a former executive director of the New York State Republican Party who works as a political consultant. \u201cTo the average voter this is inside politics. What they care about is getting their kids to school.\u201dHe said that the ethical shadings of elected officials were much harder for voters to grasp than something as clear cut as an indictment, adding, \u201cWithout an indictment you and I can debate all day what is ethical and what isn\u2019t ethical. He doesn\u2019t have to change anything.\u201dBut Mr. Lurie said that the ethical questions raised by prosecutors could hobble Mr. de Blasio\u2019s national ambitions by soiling his reputation among Democratic Party insiders.On Friday, Mr. de Blasio engaged in the usual mayoral duties on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, marching in the parade on Fifth Avenue. Then, his conscience and schedule apparently clear, he boarded a plane for Florida.But unlike one earlier this month, this Florida trip was not to raise money for his re-election. He would have no official events, his spokesman said. Instead, the mayor would be catching a spring training game of his beloved Boston Red Sox.Jacey Fortin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dearth of I.P.O.s, but It\u2019s Not the Fault of Red Tape", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe confirmation hearing last week for Jay Clayton, who has been nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, focused on the continued sluggishness of the market for initial public offerings. Senators pushed the nominee to do something, anything, to revive it.The problem is that there is no magic wand \u2014 including deregulation \u2014 that can fix the decline.The problems were recently documented in a research note by Credit Suisse titled \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks.\u201d The bank documented that the total number of companies listed on the United States stock market plummeted by nearly half, to 3,671 last year from 7,322 in 1996.Such shrinkage has prompted hand-wringing for over a decade. At Mr. Clayton\u2019s hearing, at least five senators brought it up, pointing to the regulatory burdens on companies going public.There\u2019s only one problem with casting regulation as the villain: There\u2019s not much evidence for it.Moreover, the JOBS Act has done nothing to revive the market for small companies, those with a market capitalization of under $75 million. They still number less than a handful each year.And while fingers get pointed at regulation like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the number of initial public offerings fell off the cliff in 1996 \u2014 years before either bill was passed. So there must be something more here.Those who have examined this issue have come up with a number of possible reasons.The Credit Suisse paper also brings up this theory, noting that mergers are the major cause for companies to be delisted from a stock exchange. It appears that this deal activity has spread to the private markets, co-opting the process of taking companies public.For example, Cisco Systems purchased AppDynamics on the eve of its market debut. And acquirers seem willing to pay top dollar in these instances, as research and development by many large corporations now consists largely of acquiring smaller, usually private, companies.This is aptly illustrated by the buying sprees of Google and Facebook, which took candidates to go public \u2014 like Instagram, Nest, Waze and WhatsApp \u2014 out of contention.In 1996, average proceeds for an initial public offering were $85.7 million, and 54 percent of these offerings were considered small, with a market capitalization below $75 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 2014, however, average proceeds were $186.4 million and only 4 percent of offerings were small.The market for new issues has moved toward liquidity and bigger stocks. Mutual funds prefer making big investments rather than small ones for liquidity and administrative purposes \u2014 lots of small investments simply require more people and more monitoring.A third possibility is that companies simply no longer need the public market. The private markets are more efficient, and financing is readily available from venture capitalists and banks.There are even markets and mechanisms that exist not only to allow for financing, but to allow for selling employees\u2019 and founders\u2019 shares in private markets. In addition, the JOBS Act allowed companies to expand the number of shareholders and still be private, a change that encouraged companies to remain private.There are other theories. One of these notes that the 1990s saw a surge in I.P.O. activity and that we are just back to what the activity was in the 1970s and \u201980s. Who is to say what is a normal market?Another possible reason is that companies are shying away from the public markets to avoid shareholder activism, short-termism and the glare of public scrutiny.Yet the growing use of dual class shares and staggered boards by new companies, measures that help founders retain control, argues against this need. And they are tools that can be used by any company \u2014 even Shake Shack went public with dual-class stock.The bottom line is that while there might be rational reasons to reduce regulation on capital raising \u2014 to make it easier and less expensive \u2014 we are kidding ourselves if we think that simply deregulating will bring back initial public offerings.The task is much harder. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, could help build an infrastructure for buying small company offerings. Allowing mutual funds more latitude to buy illiquid small investments and to change their compensation structures if they do would be a big step.Then there is the argument that maybe we shouldn\u2019t do anything, given how hard it will be. The idea behind the public markets is to provide capital funding. But if the private markets are now efficient and capable of providing even less expensive capital at lower cost, maybe we should be fine with the current state of affairs.Still, that overlooks the fact that for most of us, our retirement money is in the public markets. We should be worried about all of this money flowing into a smaller and smaller group of companies.One answer is to allow mutual funds to invest more in private companies. Already 26 mutual fund groups had $11.5 billion invested in late-stage companies in 2016, according to Credit Suisse.That\u2019s one answer, but that will result in yet more intermediaries. The better solution is to push more companies to the public markets. Deregulating is one thing, but the real work will require more innovative thinking from market regulators. That\u2019s your homework, Mr. Clayton.On a personal note, I\u2019ve been writing the Deal Professor column for DealBook for over nine years now, and this will be my last column before I take an extended sabbatical to work on other projects.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

Their presence often annoyed the Continent\u2019s more authoritarian-minded leaders, who regard many of the groups to be irritants at best, and threats at worst.Traditionally, United States administrations of both parties have promoted the spread of democracy and stubbornly defended these advocacy groups. But Mr. Trump has said he will not press America\u2019s political system on other countries and has embraced some of Europe\u2019s far-right leaders. He also has criticized the European Union and made disparaging remarks about some democratic principles \u2014 including his frequent criticism of the news media.For populist leaders like Mr. Orban, who has steadily steered Hungary toward so-called illiberal democracy, this new tone from the White House is regarded as a major opportunity.\u201cThey see it as a historical moment,\u201d said Jozsef Peter Martin, executive director of Transparency International\u2019s Hungary branch. \u201cThe geopolitical situation has changed.\u201d\u201cOrban has talked about the Trump era being a new international opportunity for Hungary,\u201d said Marta Pardavi, co-founder of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, which gets about 30 percent of its funding from Soros-backed foundations. \u201cHe said it was a gift to us.\u201dGergely Gulyas, a vice president of Hungary\u2019s governing party, agreed that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory had created a geopolitical climate more attractive to Hungary\u2019s current leaders, but he cautioned against seeing that as the decisive reason for the crackdown.\u201cI think we would have done this even if Hillary Clinton had won,\u201d he said.He and other supporters of the Hungarian government say the outcry by civil society is a vast overreaction to what is simply a common-sense attempt to force the organizations to be more \u201ctransparent\u201d \u2014 effectively turning the language of the advocacy groups against them.But shortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Fidesz leaders immediately renewed their attacks on \u201cforeign-funded\u201d N.G.O.s, as the new villains were groups sponsored by Mr. Soros, while also proposing new legislative restrictions. Fidesz officials have not unveiled their proposals but say they intend to create a registry of such organizations and force them to disclose their financial details. Some officials have proposed forcing local N.G.O. leaders to disclose their personal finances.\u201cIt is only about transparency,\u201d Mr. Gulyas said. \u201cThis is a debate that is taking place around the world. An important debate about the future of democracy.\u201dBut advocacy groups say it is more about harassment and intimidation. Stefania Kapronczay, executive director of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, which gets over half its funding from Soros-backed organizations, said Hungarian officials were \u201ctesting the waters\u201d to see \u201cwhat they can get away with.\u201d New restrictions would have a \u201cchilling effect,\u201d she said.\u201cSome small N.G.O.s just quit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe willingness of people to cooperate with us decreases.\u201dBorn in Budapest in 1930, Mr. Soros and his Jewish family survived the Nazi occupation with false identity papers. He eventually became a Wall Street financier and ultimately made billions through his own hedge fund, Soros Fund Management. He established the Open Society Foundations as an umbrella group for his philanthropy and has given more than $12 billion to date. His philanthropic work promotes democracy, government accountability and freedom of expression \u2014 and, he has said, is driven by his memories of life under the Nazis.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t come up with a better enemy figure today,\u201d said Jan Orlovsky, director of the Slovak branch of the Open Society Foundations. \u201cGeorge Soros brings up all of the stereotypes we have lived with all our lives \u2014 about Jews, bankers and, in Slovakia, also about Hungarians.\u201dChris Stone, the president of the Open Society Foundations, described the governmental crackdowns as \u201ca campaign by government leaders who are impatient with the institutions of democracy.\u201dMacedonia, struggling to form a new government in the debris of a two-year political crisis, has taken perhaps the most forceful anti-Soros stance. The Stop Operation Soros campaign pushes the idea that international pressure \u2014 from N.G.O.s and Western governments \u2014 forced the recent fall of the right-wing government of Mr. Gruevski, who hopes to return to power.\u201cWe believe that, in these murky times, it is really important to take away the mask of the so-called civic organizations and to clearly reveal their political goals and actions, as well as their financing,\u201d said Nenad Mirchevski, a founder of the movement.In Poland, against a flare-up of anti-Soros statements, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said her government intended to create a new body to coordinate state funding for all nongovernmental organizations. In Slovakia, a far-right-wing party proposed forcing \u201cforeign-funded\u201d N.G.O.s to register with the government. That effort did not succeed, but that did little to slow the tide of anti-Soros speech.\u201cAnd we are only at the start of the story,\u201d said Laszlo Majtenyi, director of the Eotvos Karoly Institute in Budapest, a Soros-founded organization, and a left-wing coalition candidate for president in April. Once the government has stigmatized the groups as \u201cforeign-funded,\u201d he said, future crackdowns will be easier.And there is always the chance that authoritarian governments will feel emboldened enough to simply toss out the offending organizations.\u201cThis is where European democratic values will be defended,\u201d said Goran Buldioski, director of the Open Society Initiative for Europe. \u201cIn Hungary and Poland, not in Western Europe. Democracy is more than just the ballot box, and it is more than something that happens every four years.\u201dA reporting credit on Thursday with an article about a crackdown on nongovernmental organizations in Central and Eastern Europe, especially those financed by the American billionaire George Soros, omitted a contributor.

{"Headline": "Kansas Supreme Court Says State Education Spending Is Too Low", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byThe Kansas Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the state\u2019s spending on public education was unconstitutionally low, dealing a new blow to Gov. Sam Brownback, who is facing a rebellion from his own Republican Party over his trademark tax-cutting doctrine.In a unanimous ruling, the court said black, Hispanic and poor students were especially harmed by the lack of funding, pointing to lagging test scores and graduation rates. The justices set a June 30 deadline for lawmakers to pass a new constitutional funding formula, sending them scrambling to find more money to pay for a solution.This is the second time in about a year that Kansas\u2019 highest court has ruled against the state\u2019s approach to paying for schools, just as Mr. Brownback finds himself wrestling with growing budget deficits and as his relations with fellow Republicans have deteriorated to new lows.Mr. Brownback, who has made cutting taxes and shrinking government the centerpiece of his administration since taking office in 2011, championed the largest tax cuts in state history, turning Kansas into a national testing ground for his staunchly conservative philosophy. But the state has since struggled with gaping deficits, and patience has run thin, even among some former allies.Just last month, the Republican-dominated Legislature approved a tax increase that would have raised more than $1 billion to help narrow the budget gap \u2014 a bold rejection of Mr. Brownback\u2019s vision. In the end, the governor vetoed the measure, and he barely survived an override attempt. The school funding ruling now adds yet another layer of fiscal trouble for Kansas and political tumult for Mr. Brownback.She added that lawmakers now had to prepare to find a legislative solution \u2014 with or without the governor. \u201cWe just have to dig in and figure out how to solve this problem,\u201d she said.The court did not specify how much more money was needed for the state\u2019s schools, but finding any could prove difficult. Current budget deficits reach into the hundreds of millions.Mr. Brownback, who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election next year, has faced plunging approval ratings and increasingly criticism from the moderate wing of the Republican Party. In a statement, he acknowledged that some students in Kansas had not received a suitable education, calling for a new funding formula to \u201cright this wrong.\u201d\u201cThe Kansas Legislature has the opportunity to engage in transformative educational reform by passing a school funding system that puts students first,\u201d Mr. Brownback said. \u201cSuccess is not measured in dollars spent, but in higher student performance.\u201dHe made a pitch for schools outside of the public education system, suggesting that parents \u201cshould be given the opportunity and resources to set their child up for success through other educational choices.\u201dSchool funding consumes about half of Kansas\u2019 budget, and its political salience cuts across party lines. Kansas prides itself on its public schools, and, in many small towns, the high school serves as a community anchor. The right to a suitably funded education is enshrined in the state Constitution.The current lawsuit was prompted by a slide in education financing that began after the recession under Mr. Brownback\u2019s predecessor as governor, Mark V. Parkinson, a Democrat.But the school funding mechanism has been litigated in Kansas courts for years, and there are sharp regional distinctions in how the issue is viewed. In the affluent Kansas City suburbs, where test scores are high, many want to preserve special taxes that benefit their local school districts. In rural and urban parts of the state, where incomes are lower and academic performance sometimes lags, plans to provide more per-student funding for minorities and poor students have greater resonance.\u201cThose kids are not able to get the time they need to learn the things that they need to learn to be successful,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said.In its ruling, the court detailed statistics that showed African-American and Hispanic students, as well as poor students and those learning the English language, lagging behind their peers academically.Cynthia Lane, the superintendent of public schools in Kansas City, Kan., where more than 80 percent of students come from low-income households and qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, said lawmakers needed to make special provisions for disadvantaged children in the new funding plan.\u201cFor a decade, we have been cutting support \u2014 we have been offering less tutoring, less support, less enrichment,\u201d said Dr. Lane, whose school district was one of the four plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court. \u201cSo this ruling today gives me great hope that we can start talking about our aspirations, not just worrying about protecting where we are.\u201d\u201cWhat you see in Kansas you see in states across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNamely, that there is an achievement gap between poorer kids and more well-off kids, and between white students and students of color.\u201d\u201cI do think that this Legislature is much more interested in funding education,\u201d Mr. Tallman said. \u201cI think the election results suggest that voters are seeing problems with our funding system that they want to address.\u201dFor now, Mr. Brownback has shown a willingness to use a veto pen, leaving it uncertain whether lawmakers can agree on a new school funding plan by the June deadline, and whether they can raise enough revenue to support it.\u201cYou have enormous political will in Kansas to make the changes necessary,\u201d Mr. Ward, the Democratic lawmaker, said, \u201cand any politician obstructing that does it at their own peril.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Bets on Sensitive U.S. Start-Ups, Worrying the Pentagon", "Date": "2017-03-22", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 When the United States Air Force wanted help making military robots more perceptive, it turned to a Boston-based artificial intelligence start-up called Neurala. But when Neurala needed money, it got little response from the American military.So Neurala turned to China, landing an undisclosed sum from an investment firm backed by a state-run Chinese company.Chinese firms have become significant investors in American start-ups working on cutting-edge technologies with potential military applications. The start-ups include companies that make rocket engines for spacecraft, sensors for autonomous navy ships, and printers that make flexible screens that could be used in fighter-plane cockpits. Many of the Chinese firms are owned by state-owned companies or have connections to Chinese leaders.The deals are ringing alarm bells in Washington. According to a new white paper commissioned by the Department of Defense, Beijing is encouraging Chinese companies with close government ties to invest in American start-ups specializing in critical technologies like artificial intelligence and robots to advance China\u2019s military capacity as well as its economy.The white paper, which was distributed to the senior levels of the Trump administration this week, concludes that United States government controls that are supposed to protect potentially critical technologies are falling short, according to three people knowledgeable about its contents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWhat drives a lot of the concern is that China is a military competitor,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who is familiar with the report. \u201cHow do you deal with a military competitor playing in your most innovative market?\u201dThe Chinese deals can pose a number of issues. Investors could push start-ups to strike partnerships or make licensing or hiring decisions that could expose intellectual property. They can also get an inside glimpse of how technology is being developed and could have access to a start-up\u2019s offices or computers.Trump administration officials and lawmakers are raising broad questions about China\u2019s economic relationship with the United States. While the report was commissioned before President Trump took office, some Republicans have called for tighter regulation of foreign takeovers by giving a broader mandate to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Known as Cfius, the committee reviews foreign takeovers of American companies, but critics say that its scope does not include smaller deals and that it has other weak spots.Ashton B. Carter, former secretary of defense under President Barack Obama, had tapped Mike A. Brown, the former chief executive of Symantec, the cybersecurity firm, to lead the inquiry into the Chinese investments, according to two of the people aware of the white paper\u2019s contents.A spokesman for the Department of Defense said it \u201cwill not discuss the details or components of draft internal working documents.\u201dNeither the high-tech start-ups nor their Chinese investors have been accused of wrongdoing, and experts said much of the activity could be innocent. Chinese investors have money and are looking for returns, while the Chinese government has pushed investment in ways to clean up China\u2019s skies, upgrade its industrial capacity and unclog its snarled highways. Proponents of the deals said American limits on technology exports would still apply to American start-ups with Chinese backers.Still, some start-ups \u2014 especially those making hardware rather than money-drawing mobile apps like Snapchat \u2014 said Chinese money was sometimes the only available funding. But even a company struggling for money can ultimately come up with a big breakthrough.Chinese investors have a bigger appetite for risk and a willingness to do deals fast, said Neurala\u2019s chief executive, Max Versace.To demonstrate his software\u2019s capabilities to the Air Force, Mr. Versace said, Neurala used its software on a ground drone from Best Buy to make it recognize and follow around the service\u2019s secretary, then Deborah Lee James, during a meeting.\u201cWe were told by the secretary of the Air Force, \u2018Your tech is awesome, we should put it everywhere,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNo one followed up.\u201dAmerican military officials have \u201cfigured out a very good way to give $10 billion to Raytheon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to give a start-up $1 million to develop a proof of concept? That\u2019s still very, very hard.\u201dMr. Versace of Neurala said the company took pains to ensure that the Chinese investor had no access to its source code or other important technological information.To address concerns that it was not tapping innovations from start-ups, the Pentagon in 2015 set up a group called Defense Innovation Unit Experimental to enable investments into promising new companies. While at first it struggled, in 2016 it helped carry off a barrage of deals. The unit also prepared the white paper.In May 2015, Haiyin Capital also invested an amount it did not disclose in XCOR Aerospace, a Mojave, Calif., commercial space-travel company that makes spacecraft and engines and has worked with NASA. XCOR did not respond to requests for comment.About the fund\u2019s investments, Mr. Wang said, \u201cWe strive to get a portion of research and development moved back to China so that we can avoid China being only a low-end manufacturer.\u201d Haiyin Capital did not respond to a request for comment.Quanergy did not respond to requests for comment. Its investors also include foreign automakers and South Korea\u2019s Samsung.Kateeva\u2019s chief executive, Alain Harrus, said that while investors in Silicon Valley had begun looking more at hardware companies, raising big rounds for capital-intensive technology can be tough. Kateeva ultimately raised money where its customers were, in China and South Korea. Mr. Harrus said he believed more should be done in America to figure out the best way to nurture and fund core next-generation technologies.Ken Wilcox, chairman emeritus of Silicon Valley Bank, said in the past six months he had been approached by three different Chinese state-owned enterprises about being their agent in Northern California to buy technology, though he declined.\u201cIn all three cases they said they had a mandate from Beijing, and they had no idea what they wanted to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just any and all tech.\u201dAn article on March 23 about Chinese firms\u2019 investments in United States companies specializing in technology with potential military applications referred incorrectly to entities that invested $9.9 billion in Silicon Valley tech start-ups in 2015. Chinese companies participated in funding rounds worth that amount; Chinese investors did not make up the total $9.9 billion.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On \u2018Brexit,\u2019 It\u2019s Divorce First, Trade Talks Later, E.U. Tells U.K.", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Britain must agree to pay its bills and to protect millions of Europeans living in Britain before reaching a new trading relationship with the European Union, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Friday.Side-by-side divorce and trade talks \u201cwill not happen,\u201d Mr. Tusk said at a news conference in Malta. Divorce has to come first, he said, and he warned that the negotiations could be \u201cconfrontational.\u201dHe also wrote: \u201cAfter more than 40 years of being united, we owe it to each other to make this divorce as smooth as possible.\u201dThe words were tough, but unsurprising: For months, since Britain voted in a June 23 referendum to leave the bloc, Brussels has insisted that the terms of a future trade agreement would not be negotiated until the terms of the divorce were clear.That was in keeping with the tough talk coming from Germany, the bloc\u2019s most influential member, this week. On Friday, the finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, told a newspaper in the country that, while both sides should strive to minimize the damage, \u201cthere are no rights without obligations\u201d and that Britain would have to leave the single market if it refused to abide by the European Union\u2019s principles.That followed a statement on Thursday by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany that rejected a demand put forth by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain that talks on the withdrawal be conducted in tandem with discussions about economic relations.\u201cThe negotiations must first clarify how we will disentangle our interlinked relationship,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cOnly when this question is dealt with can we \u2014 hopefully, soon after \u2014 begin talking about our future relationship.\u201dIn laying out the European Union\u2019s terms for the exit negotiations \u2014 which still must be approved by leaders of the 27 remaining nations \u2014 Mr. Tusk essentially presented the bloc\u2019s response to Mrs. May\u2019s opening move. Mr. Tusk said the 27 leaders would determine when there had been \u201csufficient progress\u201d to start discussing Britain\u2019s future trade arrangements.The terms, nonetheless, represent an early setback for Britain. The draft guidelines outline a \u201cphased approach\u201d that the European Union will require Britain to follow before talks about any deal on access to the European single market of more than 500 million consumers.The terms also signaled how Britain was losing control over developments in Europe by giving Spain an effective veto over whether any deal applied to Gibraltar, the rocky outcrop that has long been the subject of an acrimonious sovereignty dispute between London and Madrid. Spain had pressed to insert language on Gibraltar into the guidelines and succeeded because Britain did not have a say in the drafting, European Union officials said.Market access is a British priority that took on added urgency this week, as Mrs. May\u2019s formal notification on Wednesday started a two-year clock to reach an agreement. That time constraint limits British leverage in the negotiations because it would face a welter of tariffs and customs barriers if a deal is not struck during that period.The guidelines will come into effect if national leaders approve them at a summit meeting on April 29. Michel Barnier, a former foreign minister of France, is then expected to take over day-to-day negotiations with the government in London.The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.Mr. Barnier has said that he wants to wrap up talks by October 2018 to enable the European Parliament and member states to assess the results and allow terms for a transition to be agreed on. Although there is legal scope to extend the talks beyond March 2019, when the two-year statutory period expires, such a step would need unanimous approval from the 27 remaining countries.Ms. Merkel and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France have insisted that London first agree on how to protect the rights of more than about three million expatriates in Britain, and more than one million British citizens living in Continental Europe, and on the amount of money Britain owes to cover its commitments as a member of the bloc.European officials underlined the need to safeguard the rights of expatriates by referring to them in the opening paragraphs of the nine-page guidelines. The document also said there should be a \u201csingle financial settlement\u201d of Britain\u2019s commitments but did not give a figure.Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland has called for steps to preserve a peaceful coexistence with Northern Ireland, where there will be a new land border with the European Union. European officials said \u201cflexible and imaginative solutions will be required\u201d to maintain peace and avoid \u201ca hard border\u201d between Ireland, a European Union member, and Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom.Britain is the first country to leave the bloc. The procedure for the separation, known as Article 50, has never before been used. Striking a deal will be fiendishly complex, and there are hazards for both sides.European leaders do not want Britain to enjoy the same benefits that it has as a member of the bloc, such as unfettered access to the vast European Union single market. Yet they are extremely wary of Britain turning itself into a low-tax haven with weakened regulations that would undercut European neighbors.Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, a member state that has some of the closest economic ties with Britain, said that \u201csecuring a fair and level playing field is the main objective.\u201dAnother challenge for European leaders is to maintain unity. Populist politicians have bolstered their following by blaming the European Union for high unemployment in countries like Greece and for failing to prevent an influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa.France holds the first round of presidential elections in late April. Marine Le Pen, the anti-European Union leader of the right-wing National Front, has called for a referendum on leaving the bloc. For now, Emmanuel Macron, who is pro-Europe, is leading the polls.The European Parliament also has a final say over any deal reached with Britain. Lawmakers could veto any agreement that they find too generous or that they view as failing to guarantee the rights of citizens of European Union countries already in Britain to continue living and working there.\u201cOne thing is clear for us,\u201d Manfred Weber, a German who is a powerful conservative lawmaker at the European Parliament, said this week. \u201cCherry picking is over for the United Kingdom, and we will defend the interests of the 440 million E.U. citizens when negotiating with the U.K.\u201dStephen Castle contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At BlackRock, Machines Are Rising Over Managers to Pick Stocks", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byScore one for the machines.The largest fund company in the world, BlackRock, has faced a thorny challenge since it acquired the exchange-traded-fund business from Barclays in 2009.These low cost, computer-driven funds have exploded in growth, leaving in the dust the stock pickers who had spurred an earlier expansion for the firm. The rise of passive investing \u2014 exchange-traded funds, index funds and the like \u2014 has revolutionized the investment world, providing Main Street investors with greater opportunities at lower fees while putting pressure on even Wall Street\u2019s biggest money managers.Now, after years of deliberations, Laurence D. Fink, a founder and chief executive of BlackRock, has cast his lot with the machines.On Tuesday, BlackRock laid out an ambitious plan to consolidate a large number of actively managed mutual funds with peers that rely more on algorithms and models to pick stocks.The initiative is the most explicit action by a major fund management firm in reaction to the exodus of investors from actively managed stock funds to cheaper funds that track every variety of index and investment theme.Some $30 billion in assets (about 11 percent of active equity funds) will be targeted, with $6 billion rebranded BlackRock Advantage funds. These funds focus on quantitative and other strategies that adopt a more rules-based approach to investing.\u201cThe democratization of information has made it much harder for active management,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview. \u201cWe have to change the ecosystem \u2014 that means relying more on big data, artificial intelligence, factors and models within quant and traditional investment strategies.\u201dAs part of the restructuring, seven of BlackRock\u2019s 53 stock pickers are expected to step down from their funds. Several of the money managers will stay on as advisers. At least 36 employees connected to the funds are leaving the firm.While BlackRock is proceeding gradually, in many ways the new plan is a direct attack on the cult of the brainy mutual fund manager, popularized in the 1980s and 1990s by Peter Lynch, a stock-picking wizard at the fund giant Fidelity.Today, asset managers like Pimco, Franklin Templeton, Aberdeen and, of course, Fidelity continue to make the case that their bond and equity managers can outsmart the broader market \u2014 and charge a premium price for doing so.Since 2009, however, as the performance of these funds has suffered, millions of investors have rejected this proposition, abandoning their expensive mutual funds for better-performing funds that track various indexes at a fraction of the cost.Now the biggest fund companies are Vanguard, the indexing pioneer, and BlackRock, which together oversee close to $10 trillion in assets.BlackRock, with its fleet of iShares E.T.F.s, has certainly benefited from the investor revolution \u2014 one that threatens to disrupt the mutual fund industry in the years ahead.Still, the monster in the mutual fund room by far has been Vanguard, which, via index funds and exchange-traded funds, has had historic inflows.Last year, for example, $423 billion left actively managed stock funds and $390 billion poured into index funds, according to Morningstar. Of that amount, Vanguard captured $277 billion, nearly tripling the amount that went to its nearest rival, BlackRock.Mr. Fink has always professed to be agnostic as to whether a client bought a no-frills exchange-traded fund tracking low volatility stocks or an expensive mutual fund investing in small United States companies.Let the client choose has long been his mantra.Left unsaid has been the reality that at his root Mr. Fink is now a true believer in systematic investing styles that favor algorithms, science and data-reliant models over the stock picking smarts of individual portfolio managers.And since last year, BlackRock\u2019s dyed-in-the-wool stock pickers have worked in the same division as its quants. These managers, many of whom have Ph.D.s, might buy (or sell) Walmart\u2019s stock on the basis of a satellite feed that reveals how many cars are in its parking lots as opposed to an insight gleaned from the innards of the retailer\u2019s balance sheet.Just about any interview or conference call with Mr. Fink bears this out: Invariably, the conversation comes around to technology, with scant mention of what the firm\u2019s stock pickers are doing.But simply going all-in on machine-driven passive investing over active has not been an option for Mr. Fink. While the assets of the firm\u2019s actively managed stock funds have shrunk to $201 billion today from $208 billion in 2009, the business is still very profitable for BlackRock, representing 16 percent of total revenue.According to data from Morningstar, only 11 percent of BlackRock\u2019s actively managed equity funds have beaten their benchmarks since 2009. Since 2012, $27.5 billion has left BlackRock actively managed mutual funds, per Morningstar data.The new push, which is being overseen by Mark Wiseman, a top executive at Canada\u2019s top pension fund whom Mr. Fink hired last year to revamp his equity business, highlights strategies in which a portfolio manager makes big bets on a select group of stocks.Still, there is no mistaking the larger message: Expensive, actively managed funds looking to make a mark picking United States stocks must adapt to the new realities at BlackRock.Take BlackRock\u2019s Large Cap Core fund, which invests in big American companies. Since 2009, the fund\u2019s assets have halved, to $1.5 billion, trailing the index by 1.3 percent over the last three years.The fund\u2019s lead manager will be replaced by three portfolio experts from BlackRock\u2019s quantitative investing team, where all varieties of computer models are crunched in pursuit of stock picking ideas. Fees will also be halved.Of course, none of these moves are likely to immediately halt the outflows of the past years. In fact outflows are likely to increase, as few investors want to stick with a fund undergoing an existential makeover.But as Mr. Fink and his new equity deputy see it, it is better to take the pain now than later.\u201cThe old way of people sitting in a room picking stocks, thinking they are smarter than the next guy \u2014 that does not work anymore,\u201d Mr. Wiseman said. \u201cThese are stormy seas for active managers, but we at BlackRock are an aircraft carrier, and we are going to chart our way through these seas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yet there is one threat of inequality that is widely feared, and that has been debated for thousands of years, which is that inequality can undermine governance. In his fine book, both history and call to arms, Ganesh Sitaraman argues that the contemporary explosion of inequality will destroy the American Constitution, which is and was premised on the existence of a large and thriving middle class. He has done us all a great service, taking an issue of overwhelming public importance, delving into its history, helping understand how our forebears handled it and building a platform to think about it today.As recognized since ancient times, the coexistence of very rich and very poor leads to two possibilities, neither a happy one. The rich can rule alone, disenfranchising or even enslaving the poor, or the poor can rise up and confiscate the wealth of the rich. The rich tend to see themselves as better than the poor, a proclivity that is enhanced and even socially sanctioned in modern meritocracies. The poor, with little prospect of economic improvement and no access to political power, \u201cmight turn to a demagogue who would overthrow the government \u2014 only to become a tyrant. Oligarchy or tyranny, economic inequality meant the end of the republic.\u201dSome constitutions were written to contain inequalities. In Rome, the patricians ruled, but could be overruled by plebeian tribunes whose role was to protect the poor. There are constitutions with lords and commoners in separate chambers, each with well-defined powers. Sitaraman calls these \u201cclass warfare constitutions,\u201d and argues that the founding fathers of the United States found another way, a republic of equals. The middle classes, who according to David Hume were obsessed neither with pleasure-seeking, as were the rich, nor with meeting basic necessities, as were the poor, and were thus amenable to reason, could be a firm basis for a republic run in the public interest. There is some sketchy evidence that income and wealth inequality was indeed low in the 18th century, but the crucial point is that early America was an agrarian society of cultivators with an open frontier. No one needed to be poor when land was available in the West.The founders worried a good deal about people getting too rich. Jefferson was proud of his achievement in abolishing the entail and primogeniture in Virginia, writing the laws that \u201claid the ax to the root of Pseudoaristocracy.\u201d He called for progressive taxation and, like the other founders, feared that the inheritance of wealth would lead to the establishment of an aristocracy. (Contrast this with those today who simultaneously advocate both equality of opportunity and the abolition of estate taxes.) Madison tried to calculate how long the frontier would last, and understood the threat to the Constitution that industrialization would bring; many of the founders thought of wage labor as little better than slavery and hoped that America could remain an agrarian society.Of course, the fears about industrialization were realized, and by the late 19th century, in the Gilded Age, income inequality had reached levels comparable to those we see today. In perhaps the most original part of his book, Sitaraman, an associate professor of law at Vanderbilt Law School, highlights the achievements of the Progressive movement, one of whose aims was taming inequality, and which successfully modified the Constitution. There were four constitutional amendments in seven years \u2014 the direct election of senators, the franchise for women, the prohibition of alcohol and the income tax. To which I would add another reform, the establishment of the Federal Reserve, which provided a mechanism for handling financial crises without the need for the government to be bailed out by rich bankers, as well as the reduction in the tariff, which favored ordinary people by bringing down the cost of manufactures. Politics can respond to inequality, and the Constitution is not set in stone.What of today, when inequality is back in full force? I am not persuaded that we can be saved by the return of a rational and public-spirited middle class, even if I knew exactly how to identify middle-class people, or to measure how well they are doing. Nor is it clear, postelection, whether the threat is an incipient oligarchy or an incipient populist autocracy; our new president tweets from one to the other. And European countries, without America\u2019s middle-class Constitution, face some of the same threats, though more from autocracy than from plutocracy, which their constitutions may have helped them resist. Yet it is clear that we in the United States face the looming threat of a takeover of government by those who would use it to enrich themselves together with a continuing disenfranchisement of large segments of the population.Sitaraman reviews many possible correctives, including redistribution to reduce inequality; better enforcement of antitrust laws; campaign finance reform to break the dependence of legislators on deep pockets; compulsory voting; and restrictions on lobbying, including the possibility of \u201cpublic defender\u201d lobbyists to act on behalf of the people. I would add the creation of a single-payer health system, not because I am in favor of socialized medicine but because the artificially inflated costs of health care are powering up inequality by producing large fortunes for a few while holding down wages; the pharmaceutical industry alone had 1,400 lobbyists in Washington in 2014. American health care does a poor job of delivering health, but is exquisitely designed as an inequality machine, commanding an ever-larger share of G.D.P. and funneling resources to the top of the income distribution.Perhaps the least familiar and most intriguing policy proposal that Sitaraman discusses is the idea of reviving the Roman tribunate: 51 citizens would be selected by lot from the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution. They would be able to veto one statute, one executive order and one Supreme Court decision each year; they would be able to call a referendum, and impeach federal officials.Such a proposal seems fanciful today, but so is campaign finance reform, or greater redistribution. Yet we do well to remember Milton Friedman\u2019s dictum that it takes a crisis to bring real change, so that our job in the meantime is to develop alternatives to existing policies that are ready for when \u201cthe politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\u201d There will surely be no lack of crises in the days to come.Angus Deaton, a professor emeritus at Princeton, was awarded the Nobel in economic science in 2015.Advertisement"}

No, he has reservations about last month\u2019s election for student body president at his alma mater, Texas A&M University.The process, overseen by the school\u2019s Student Government Association, at best \u201cmade a mockery of due process and transparency,\u201d Mr. Perry wrote. \u201cAt worst, the S.G.A. allowed an election to be stolen outright.\u201d\u201cThe election appeared to demonstrate a commitment to treating every student equally, judging on character rather than on personal characteristics,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, a closer review appears to prove the opposite.\u201dInstead, Mr. Perry said, the title belongs to Robert McIntosh, who is the son of the Republican fund-raiser Alison McIntosh.In a statement, Amy Smith, a Texas A&M spokeswoman, said Mr. Perry\u2019s long commitment to the university was appreciated, but that his criticisms were unexpected.\u201cWe were surprised that he weighed in on the university student body election and respectfully disagree with his assessment,\u201d Ms. Smith said.Mr. Perry, who was sworn in as energy secretary on March 2, argued that the commissioner and court acted inappropriately and that the administration should have intervened and notified the Board of Regents of the alleged intimidation.In the op-ed, he described those allegations as \u201ca series of dirty campaign tactics\u201d and argued that the court was overly harsh in its ruling on the glow stick violation.\u201cThe desire of the electorate is overturned, and thousands of student votes are disqualified because of free glow sticks that appeared for 11 seconds of a months-long campaign,\u201d he wrote. \u201cApparently, glow sticks merit the same punishment as voter intimidation.\u201dAs a result, Mr. Brooks\u2019s presidency will be tainted by the perception that it is illegitimate, Mr. Perry suggested.He also argued that the Student Government Association and administration would have acted differently if Mr. McIntosh were not a straight, white male.\u201cThe outcome would have been different if the victim was different,\u201d he wrote.Ms. Smith, of Texas A&M, disagreed.\u201cTo suggest that the same decision of disqualification would not have been made if the roles were reversed is to deny the Texas A&M of today where accountability applies to all,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cBobby Brooks, in this role, represents all students of all backgrounds. I know that he takes this responsibility seriously and we look forward to working with him.\u201dOn Thursday, lawyers for Mr. McIntosh said in a statement that he planned to investigate the disqualification, citing possible violations to his civil, due process and religious rights. In a legal filing, they raise concerns that he may have been disqualified for being a \u201cheterosexual, white, Christian male.\u201dMs. Keathley declined to comment, while Mr. Brooks and Ms. James did not respond to requests for comment.Advertisement"}
