{"Headline": "In Snap\u2019s I.P.O., Evidence of Bankers\u2019 Strategy", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorSnap\u2019s bankers deserve more than the commissions they will receive for a successful, perhaps flawless, initial public offering.Not bad for a pair of twentysomethings. (Yes, be jealous \u2014 what did you do in the first half of your 20s besides drink beer?)The key to a successful I.P.O., after all, is to get that first-day pop, as Facebook learned to its chagrin in 2012. And Snap\u2019s shares will most likely rise on Thursday even after exceeding the previous range.The bankers played another tried-and-true trick: limit the supply. Only about 19 percent of Snap\u2019s total share float was offered, and a quarter of that amount was sold subject to a one-year lockup. Snap\u2019s remaining capital needs were filled by a $1.2 billion loan from the same bankers underwriting the offering.Finally, Snap played off the simple laws of supply and demand and the strange world of internet valuations. There are only a few big internet companies around, and when one goes public, investors pounce.Here, internet valuation does not depend upon silly things like revenue or, heaven forbid, earnings, but prospects. One way (and there are many ways) to think about this, is the chance that Snap has to hit a certain valuation reflected as follows:Basically, Column 1 is the chance of meeting the valuation in Row 2. You can then value this chance by multiplying column 1 by row 2. So if Snap has a 1 percent chance of reaching a valuation of $100 billion, the value of that chance is $1 billion.That is the price a rational investor with a taste for risk would pay for that chance. Someone without a taste for risk would prefer paying for a 99 percent chance of getting $1 billion which would be valued at $1.01 billion.In this chart, the valuation of Snap is $22.8 billion if you add up the value of all the chances. But the chance of Snap being worth below its pricing valuation of $24 billion is 64 percent.Yet if you are basing this on the prospect of Snap, the valuation set on Wednesday for Snap is a rational bet for a risk taker. You can play with the numbers, but you get the idea that the bigger company you think this might be, the more it adds to the current, risky valuation.And Snap is all about prospects and risk. It will depend on doing something no other social network has done \u2014 which is to invent another product equally successful.So far, Snap has done only ephemeral pictures well. There is yet to be a verdict on its Spectacles, though they will probably go the way of Google Glass, a brief novelty.The bet in Snap as it exists today is in preserving and growing the core business, which already may be plateauing, and finding a new business. Can that happen? The chance of it achieving that is how the valuation works.In this regard, Snap is not Facebook or Twitter, the two most used comparisons. Facebook\u2019s core business was growing at the time of its I.P.O. and has continued to grow since, while Twitter was valued by investors based on what they thought about growth in its main business.For Snap, investors have ignored some big warning signs. In addition to the possibility of declining user growth, there is also the inability of Snap to gain traction outside the United States or outside its core young demographic. And that Instagram and WhatsApp (under the Facebook umbrella) are emerging as real competitors.Then there is the governance issue. The company has chosen to keep all control with its co-founders and gives no vote to the shares held by the public. So in some ways, Snap is more like Shake Shack or Fairway with a touch of Theranos, than it is like Facebook or Twitter.I could, of course, be all wrong about this. There is a chance that Snap will be the next Facebook, churning out products the teenage set loves for the next nine decades of Mr. Spiegel\u2019s life. In a year or two, we should have a good sense of Snap\u2019s direction, and when we do it will be a test not just of the internet I.P.O. model but corporate governance as well.In the meantime, Snap will likely spur more internet market debuts \u2014 after all, there is a drought of them \u2014 as bankers sell this good result to push clients out.And that is really what the Snap offering is about: good deal-making and salesmanship by its bankers at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.Congratulations, of a sorts, are due.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "A MacGyver of Slow-Cooked Meats at Franklin Barbecue", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review15 PhotosAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 \u201cHow much brisket are you having?\u201dNobody reaches the front of the line accidentally. If you haven\u2019t managed to work out how much brisket to buy when you get there, you are beyond my help.I won\u2019t blame you, though, if you double your order after the man with the knife cuts off a little block of meat and hands it to you. Look at it, the way it shades from nut-brown at the inside to cherry-jam around the border to black at the crust, stained by carbon and stubbled with coarse pepper. Smell it while the steam is still carrying the smell of burning post oak. Taste it, the way it combines the fat-bathed richness of fresh beef with the tight focus of meat cured by salt and smoke. Still want just half a pound?Other considerations come into play, like the elasticity of your stomach and your taste for pork, smoked sausage and turkey. But brisket is the foundation on which Franklin Barbecue was built, brisket as it is seasoned and barbecued by Aaron Franklin, the chief pitmaster and an owner.He got better. By 2009, when he began selling meat from a white-and-aqua-blue 1971 Aristocrat Lo-Liner trailer he\u2019d bought for $300, he had moved far upscale from the cheap supermarket brisket of his first experiments. And when he moved to an actual structure, painted to look like an overgrown version of that trailer, his brisket was already famous.What Mr. Franklin had stumbled across in his backyard was a craft in which, for both the maker and the consumer, the financial barrier to entry was low and the opportunity for connoisseurship was ample. These are the two chief prerequisites of any successful hipster food business, and Franklin Barbecue set off a new-traditionalist barbecue movement across the country.One of Mr. Franklin\u2019s apostasies from old-school central Texas barbecue technique is wrapping meat midway through smoking to keep it from drying out. All his products are noticeably juicy; the turkey is helped by a quick dip in a pan of butter and juices. He swaddles brisket in butcher paper, which lets some steam out. Other meats are sealed inside aluminum foil. I wondered if this was the reason the marbling inside the brisket was more appetizing than the fat on the pork ribs and pulled pork, which could be a little wet and squishy.Much of the fat simply yields a glossy liquid that makes a delicious sauce for the lightly smoky pulled pork. The smoke works its way more thoroughly into the ribs, which become a firm and chewy pig candy, and into the sausages. Franklin Barbecue isn\u2019t famous for its sausages, which are custom-made by a nearby butcher. They are glorious, though, loaded with pepper and garlic and enough beef fat to make the wrinkled surface of the casings sparkle. Within the next few days, they will be ground and stuffed on site.As for the turkey, it is so mild that it will probably be of surpassing interest only to those who don\u2019t eat beef or pork who\u2019ve been dragged along by brisket-crazed friends. Vegetarians may find some comfort in the fine vinegared slaw of purple cabbage or the potato salad, made in the creamy style that I hope to find at every picnic. They will run from the pinto beans, which are supplemented by odds and ends of meat scraped from the butcher block.Near the cash register are palm-size pies wrapped in plastic, with old-fashioned crusts. Lemon chess pie had a citrus tartness that the Key lime pie was missing, and I admired the way the bourbon-banana pie compressed childhood and adulthood in a single dessert.Finally, I\u2019d point out that the line at Mr. Franklin\u2019s restaurant is not Mr. Franklin\u2019s fault, except insofar as he is responsible for cooking meat that people sacrifice entire mornings for. The line is a function of popularity and the way Texas barbecue is sliced (on the spot) and sold (by weight).Franklin Barbecue also goes out of its way to offer customers standing outside what you might call palliative care. A dozen or so folding chairs are kept in a corral under the stairs for early birds. Although the main entrance is locked until 10:59 a.m., another door is opened so the faithful can use the restrooms or buy drinks.An employee will walk down the line several times in the morning, selling canned beer from a cooler (Franklin stocks beers from some of the city\u2019s best breweries) and trying to estimate when the meats will run out. This is an imprecise science, involving people\u2019s best guesses for what they\u2019ll order when they get inside.On my first visit, I was right in the middle of the parking lot, and was told there was a chance I\u2019d miss out on pulled pork. That was incorrect, I\u2019m happy to say.Franklin Barbecue doesn\u2019t have to be so humane. Employees could probably stand on the roof pouring hot lard over customers\u2019 heads without driving too many people away. Once you start thinking about how much brisket you want, it\u2019s hard to leave.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutor Pushes for Indictment of South Korean President in Samsung Scandal", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A special prosecutor in South Korea asked state prosecutors on Monday to indict President Park Geun-hye on bribery charges, saying that Ms. Park and her secretive confidante conspired to take $38 million in bribes from Samsung, one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies.The inquiry resulted in the indictments of 30 people, including several former aides to Ms. Park, on criminal charges, including the abuse of official power. But the prosecutor could not bring any charge against Ms. Park because she is protected from indictment while in office.His mandate now over, Mr. Park said he was leaving the task of indicting Ms. Park once she is out of office to state prosecutors.Ms. Park\u2019s presidential powers have been suspended since the impeachment vote in December. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether she should be reinstated or formally removed from office. Even if she resumes the presidency, her five-year term ends in February, after which she can face criminal charges.On Monday, Ms. Park\u2019s lawyer, Yu Young-ha, rejected the special prosecutor\u2019s findings, saying his investigation was \u201cpolitically biased\u201d and \u201clacking in fairness.\u201d He called the bribery allegation \u201can absurd fiction.\u201dBut on Monday, Mr. Park, the special prosecutor, who is not related to Ms. Park, said his team found enough evidence that Ms. Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, conspired to collect bribes from Samsung.Mr. Lee offered the bribes in return for political favors from Ms. Park, most notably government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that helped him inherit corporate control of the Samsung conglomerate from his incapacitated father, Lee Kun-hee, the prosecutor said.Acting on Ms. Park\u2019s order, her aides forced the government-controlled National Pension Service, a major shareholder at the two Samsung companies, to vote for the merger, though it was opposed by many minority shareholders and devalued the pension fund\u2019s own stocks there, the prosecutor said.On Monday, Samsung denied the special prosecutor\u2019s findings.\u201cSamsung has not paid bribes nor made improper requests seeking favors,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cFuture court proceedings will reveal the truth.\u201dWhile blackballing unfriendly artists, Ms. Park\u2019s office ensured that pro-government civic groups received special favors, he said.It asked the Federation of Korean Industries, which lobbies on behalf of Samsung and other big businesses, to provide $5.9 million for those groups between 2014 and 2016, the special prosecutor said. Some of those groups, like the right-wing Korea Parent Federation, have held noisy protests in downtown Seoul calling the critics of Ms. Park \u201ccommies.\u201dBesides Samsung, scores of other South Korean companies were found to have made payments to two foundations controlled by Ms. Choi. But on Monday, the special prosecutor did not recommend further actions against them, and state prosecutors had earlier said that those companies were coerced to donate and were not engaged in bribery.Ms. Park has repeatedly denied any legal wrongdoing, insisting that she was framed by hostile political forces and that she was not aware of any criminal conspiracy by Ms. Choi. She said she only let Ms. Choi edit some of her speeches and run her personal errands.On Monday, the special prosecutor said Ms. Park and Ms. Choi had 573 phone conversations between April and October last year using cellphones issued under borrowed names. Of these calls, 127 took place between September, when Ms. Choi left for Germany, and October, when she returned home to be arrested.On Monday, the prosecutor said a cosmetic surgeon gave Ms. Park at least five simple face-lifting operations at her residence between 2013 and 2016. Even unlicensed people visited her there to give her nutritional shots and help her with kinesiotherapy and reiki, a form of traditional healing. But investigators could not find evidence that such things took place on the day of the ferry disaster.Advertisement"}

Eitel spent the past 18 months as a top lawyer for a company facing multiple government investigations, including one that ended with a settlement of more than $30 million over deceptive student lending.Today, Mr. Eitel \u2014 on an unpaid leave of absence \u2014 is working as a special assistant to the new secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, whose department is setting out to roll back regulations governing the for-profit college sector.The Education Department says Mr. Eitel has conferred several times with its ethics officer to avoid conflicts. But it says he is not precluded from having a voice on general issues and regulations that affect the for-profit college sector.Ethics experts said Mr. Eitel\u2019s position, which has not been announced publicly, could nonetheless bump up against federal rules involving conflicts of interest and impartiality, particularly given his position as a vice president for regulatory legal services at Bridgepoint Education Inc., an operator of for-profit colleges, during federal investigations into the company.Mr. Eitel, an Education Department lawyer under President George W. Bush, has been a stalwart critic of federal regulation of both for-profit colleges and K-12 education under the Obama administration.A department spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Mr. Eitel is part of a \u201cbeachhead\u201d team, paid staff members who are temporarily helping to lead federal agencies as the Trump administration gets up and running but do not require Senate confirmation.The spokesman said Mr. Eitel would recuse himself from policy decisions or discussions related to Bridgepoint and another former employer, Career Education Corporation. While on unpaid leave from Bridgepoint, the spokesman said, Mr. Eitel has also volunteered to recuse himself from weighing in on the department\u2019s \u201cgainful employment\u201d regulation, which is intended to hold career schools accountable for their job placement records and is particularly despised by the industry.The spokesman would not comment on the prospects for a longer-term role for Mr. Eitel, who served as deputy general counsel from 2006 to 2009. Some jobs he could potentially be a candidate for, such as general counsel, would require Senate confirmation.Mr. Eitel did not respond to repeated requests for an interview, and Bridgepoint declined to comment on his work and status at the company, citing privacy concerns.Even former employees without direct financial ties are subject to impartiality rules when they join the government. They are supposed to avoid doing anything that \u2014 in the eyes of a \u201creasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts\u201d \u2014 creates \u201cthe appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards set forth,\u201d and are advised to bring any potential conflicts to the agency\u2019s ethics officer.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that there\u2019s a fast-moving revolving door between the Education Department and the industries that it regulates,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, former assistant director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a former special adviser to the secretary of education. \u201cThis is a bipartisan problem.\u201dFor-profit higher education has repeatedly been tarnished by scandal. But since the election in November, stocks in the sector have soared \u2014 Bridgepoint\u2019s has climbed more than 40 percent \u2014 as President Trump\u2019s White House has made clear that it is undertaking a campaign to slash government regulations. Ms. DeVos and other administration officials have indicated that they do not plan to continue President Barack Obama\u2019s regulatory crackdown on career-training colleges.Last week, the Education Department extended the deadline for vocational schools to appeal the agency\u2019s application of the gainful-employment rule. That provision has been criticized by the industry as unfairly taking aim at colleges focused on helping the most disadvantaged students.While many graduates credit for-profits for their training and better employment prospects, other students complain that deceptive marketing persuaded them to enroll and to take on staggering debt for programs that failed to deliver promised skills and jobs.Bridgepoint \u2014 a publicly traded company that operates Ashford University and University of the Rockies, enrolls roughly 50,000 students, and primarily offers online degrees \u2014 has come under frequent scrutiny by federal and state watchdogs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Blockchain: A Better Way to Track Pork Chops, Bonds, Bad Peanut Butter?", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byFrank Yiannas has spent years looking in vain for a better way to track lettuce, steaks and snack cakes from farm and factory to the shelves of Walmart, where he is the vice president for food safety. When the company dealt with salmonella outbreaks, it often took weeks to trace where the bad ingredients came from.Then, last year, IBM executives flew to Walmart\u2019s headquarters in Arkansas to propose a solution: the blockchain.As Mr. Yiannas studied their pitch, he said, \u201cI became increasingly convinced that maybe we were onto the holy grail.\u201dThe blockchain \u2014 the buzzy, bewildering technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin \u2014 is starting to be applied to real-world problems like tracking pork chops, shipping containers and footwear with a speed and security not currently possible. The IBM-Walmart partnership is one of the biggest practical tests to date.At its heart, blockchain simply refers to a bookkeeping method that \u201cchains\u201d together entries so that they are very difficult to modify later. It provides a way for large groups of unrelated companies to jointly keep a secure and reliable record of their transactions.IBM is trying to position itself at the forefront of the heated competition for practical uses of this arcane idea. Walmart is just one of 400 IBM clients testing it out, and IBM now has around 650 employees dedicated to the technology.Yet success is far from assured.\u201cWe believe with 100 percent certainty that it\u2019s going to matter,\u201d Mark Russinovich, the head of Microsoft\u2019s blockchain efforts, said of the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of where\u2019s its going to matter and how it\u2019s going to matter.\u201dIt was Bitcoin that first caught the attention of IBM researchers, and everyone else.Bitcoin, born in 2009, represented a novel idea in the financial world. Unlike, say, dollars or yen, Bitcoins are virtual tokens, unaffiliated with any nation. Anyone can open a wallet and receive Bitcoins \u2014 without providing any identifying information \u2014 and transactions are recorded on a universal ledger that is visible to everyone.Drug dealers have embraced its relative anonymity. And people who live in countries that strictly control their financial systems, like China and Venezuela, have used Bitcoin to store their money beyond the watchful eye of the government.But while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin\u2019s underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into \u201cblocks,\u201d and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction \u2014 a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact.In 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM.\u201cI was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM.But a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM\u2019s central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology.They explained that this was about more than just a currency \u2014 it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it.\u201cThat was the \u2018aha\u2019 for me,\u201d Mr. Krishna said. \u201cThis was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.\u201d He called it \u201ca technology that can change the world.\u201dThere are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers.But blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information.A few months after Mr. Krishna\u2019s aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM\u2019s top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities \u2014 or threats \u2014 to IBM\u2019s business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, gave the green light to.She turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, \u201cYou run with this,\u201d he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months.Her hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM\u2019s eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software.But growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers.IBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, \u201cThe first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.\u201dAfter getting Ms. Rometty\u2019s push on the blockchain, the IBM team\u2019s first move was to make its software \u201copen source,\u201d meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM\u2019s bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology.It was the chairman of IBM Europe, Erich Clementi, who personally pitched the concept to the top technology executive at Maersk. Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe.For Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships \u2014 instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities.While the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world.What\u2019s more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year.Maersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved \u2014 including Maersk and government authorities \u2014 could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged.The first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California.The difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it\u2019s unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system.\u201cYou need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,\u201d said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult part.\u201dIBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark.Not everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach.Many technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains \u2014 like the one being built by IBM \u2014 are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin\u2019s success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM\u2019s.That could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, \u201cit still concentrates power in a handful of entities,\u201d said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems.IBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come.But the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project.\u201cThey have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,\u201d Mr. Behlendorf said. \u201cWe are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.\u201dBut IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. \u201cThis is the most well-thought-out project in the space,\u201d said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor.Now all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work.At Maersk, Mr. Stausholm said it could take five or even 10 years for that to happen, given all the partners \u2014 manufacturers, customs officials and farmers \u2014 that need to come together. \u201cI really do believe in it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how fast it will be able to take off.\u201dAt Walmart, Mr. Yiannas is more optimistic. His company has already completed two pilots with IBM \u2014 moving pork from Chinese farms to Chinese stores, and produce from Latin America to the United States \u2014 and he is confident a finished version can be put together within a few years. \u201cI think this is our one best hope for getting it right,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Booming Markets Are Telling Us About the Global Economy", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe stock market reached yet another new high on Wednesday, the latest development to make a mockery of what savvy economic commentators thought they knew about the world.Consider how things looked one year ago. The world economy seemed hopelessly trapped in a cycle of low growth and inflation. Markets recoiled at the mere possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. Populist political insurgencies seemed to threaten yet more financial market chaos.Now, interest rates and inflation forecasts have risen substantially from last winter\u2019s lows; financial markets are shrugging off \u2014 or even rallying at the possibility of \u2014 imminent Fed rate increases; and it is all taking place during Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency.An economy that seemed locked in some form of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d or \u201cnew normal\u201d is at long last showing some signs of being in something closer to an \u201cold normal.\u201d The United States manufacturing sector is showing strength, and the broader mix of market and economic data from around the world in the last few months also points to a world where a vicious economic cycle isn\u2019t looking quite as scary and may even be ending.There can be no assurance that this pattern will continue, and there are some things to worry about on the horizon, not least that the Trump administration could follow through on some of its threats to disrupt global trade and diplomatic relations. Long-term interest rates remain low by historical standards across most of the world, suggesting that global bond investors aren\u2019t fully buying into a return to stronger, more consistent growth.But the pivot since Election Day is huge. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is up 12 percent since Nov. 8, the London FTSE 100 index reached a new high Wednesday, and other global markets have grown nicely in that span. Ten-year Treasury bonds now yield 2.45 percent, up from 1.85 percent on Election Day, suggesting investors believe higher growth and inflation are more probable than had seemed likely just four months ago.Much of the buoyant optimism on Wall Street is driven by investors\u2019 expectations of corporate tax cuts and deregulation under the Trump administration. But there is also some real improvement in the economic data underneath the shifts, reflecting economic forces that have been underway for years. And this resetting of expectations is evident in market data beyond the always erratic stock market.For years, a theory that the major world economies were stuck in a pit of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d had gained hold \u2014 the idea that low economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and weak productivity growth were all reinforcing one another in a vicious cycle.There\u2019s hardly enough evidence to toss that theory aside, but there are many reasons to think things are now looking up.For example, bond market prices now suggest that investors foresee consumer price inflation in the United States at 2.03 percent a year over the coming decade \u2014 consistent with the 2 percent inflation the Fed aims for. It only recently reached that level, however, after being as low as 1.2 percent in February 2016. And it\u2019s not just the United States. Similar measures of inflation expectations have risen in Germany, Britain and other advanced economies.Fed watchers interpreted that to mean that an interest-rate increase could be on the way in mid-March, just three months after the last increase in December. Yet that did nothing to slow the 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 on Wednesday, and may even have contributed to it, as a sign of the Fed\u2019s confidence in the economy.A year ago, hints that the Fed would move quickly with rates would have sent markets into a tailspin. As 2016 began, Fed leaders were expecting to raise rates four times in that year, plans that helped send the stock market plummeting and measures of economic pessimism soaring. Then they backed off and only raised rates once.Conventional economic theory predicts that if a government tries to increase deficits at a time of full employment, the results will be some mix of higher inflation and higher interest rates, crowding out investment.So if tax cuts, more military spending and other Trumpian policies add to deficits at a time the economy is already running at full blast, rising prices and rising rates are exactly what we would expect to see.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bridgewater Associates, World\u2019s Biggest Hedge Fund, Shakes Up Leadership", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byRay Dalio, the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, is stepping down from its day-to-day operation as he continues to struggle to find a successor to run the firm, known for its unusual culture of \u201cradical transparency.\u201dReferring to Mr. Rubinstein\u2019s departure, Mr. Dalio said they \u201cmutually agree that he is not a cultural fit.\u201dCraig Mundie, a former co-executive chairman who introduced Mr. Rubinstein to Bridgewater executives, resigned at the end of last year, said two people with direct knowledge of the firm who were not authorized to speak publicly. He and Mr. Rubinstein remain advisers to the firm.Mr. Dalio\u2019s announcement is the latest sign of turmoil at the top of Bridgewater, which manages money for more than 300 pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors. Last year, Greg Jensen, one of Mr. Dalio\u2019s longtime lieutenants, who was viewed as his heir apparent, was suddenly stripped of his role as co-chief executive amid reports of a power struggle.Both men denied there was any rift, and Mr. Jensen remains at the firm as co-chief investment officer.With the latest move, Mr. Dalio will not be going far \u2014 he will remain chairman and co-chief investment officer \u2014 and it is not clear how much authority he will be willing to yield. Over the years, the firm has developed a corporate philosophy that resembles a cross between a religion and something of a cult.Mr. Dalio named David McCormick, the firm\u2019s president, as co-chief executive with Eileen Murray, who has been a longtime member of Mr. Dalio\u2019s management committee.Some in the industry were encouraged by the announcement.\u201cWe are seeing a peaceful transition of power, usually a positive indicator,\u201d said Putri Pascualy, managing director and credit strategist at Pacific Alternative Asset Management.\u201cNonetheless,\u201d she added, \u201cthe real test is over the next few years, on whether the firm can outlast its founder.\u201dBridgewater has had a frenzy of hires, departures and promotions in recent years, and several prominent executives have suddenly left the firm after short tenures. In 2010, Julian Mack, once a top executive at the consulting firm McKinsey, and Tony Murphy, a former top executive in the Americas for HSBC, left after less than six months on Bridgewater\u2019s executive committee, according to an internal document seen by The New York Times.Other prominent hires were removed from the management committee not long after they joined the firm.A due diligence report for Bridgewater investors from the end of 2011 detailed how Joe Parsons, hired away from GE Capital in 2010, left Bridgewater\u2019s management committee a year after joining the firm. Mr. Parsons left the hedge fund altogether in 2014. Something similar happened with James B. Comey, a former United States deputy attorney general, whom Mr. Dalio hired from Lockheed Martin in 2010 as general counsel. Mr. Comey left Bridgewater\u2019s executive committee in 2011 and left the firm in early 2013. He was subsequently nominated by President Obama to become director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Turnover at Bridgewater is not confined to the management ranks. It is estimated that as many one-third of employees at Bridgewater leave within the first two years because they have difficulty with its unusual culture, which focuses on a book of philosophical underpinnings penned by Mr. Dalio called \u201cPrinciples.\u201dBridgewater, which employs about 1,500 people, most at its secluded corporate campus in Westport, Conn., is widely known for videotaping all employee meetings and encouraging debates on many topics, even some as mundane as what kind of yogurt to stock in the employee dining area.Mr. Dalio has made no secret that life at his firm is not for everyone.\u201cSome people absolutely hate it, and some people could never work anywhere else,\u201d Mr. Dalio said at a hedge fund conference in Manhattan in September.Most of the firm\u2019s employment contracts contain stringent two-year noncompete clauses, and employees are required to sign nondisclosure agreements that often limit the ability of former employees to discuss their time at the firm.An email sent to Mr. Rubinstein seeking comment was answered by an email from a Bridgewater spokesman, who said, \u201cJon asked me to decline on his behalf.\u201dIn his letter on LinkedIn, Mr. Dalio said the moves were part of Bridgewater\u2019s 10-year transition strategy in preparation for the day when he would step down. That strategy involved creating a management committee with multiple members in what it has called a \u201cplanful transition from a founder-led boutique to a professionally managed institution.\u201dHe added, \u201cAny organization run by a 60+ year old that says that it isn\u2019t in transition is either na\u00efve or disingenuous.\u201dBridgewater operates three main investment funds. Last year, its All Weather Fund II was up 12.8 percent, its Optimal fund was up 7 percent, and its Pure Alpha II fund was up 2.4 percentMr. Dalio is well known for popularizing the kind of investment called risk parity, which seeks to protect clients from losses when stocks or bonds sell off. The strategy relies heavily on investing in bonds using leverage. The firm has written many white papers on the topic and posted them on its website.Mr. McCormick, the firm\u2019s president, who was Treasury undersecretary for international affairs under President George W. Bush, was said to have been considered for several jobs in the Trump administration. He met with President Trump shortly after the election.Ms. Murray had a run-in with top executives that culminated in an investigation into an incident involving her and another employee and whether she had lied about her conversations with that employee. Interviews conducted in the investigation, which was led by Mr. Comey, were videotaped and widely seen by employees at the firm and came to be known as \u201cEileen Lies.\u201dAn article on Thursday about a leadership shake-up at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates misspelled, in several instances, the surname of a former Apple executive who also left Bridgewater. He is Jon Rubinstein, not Rubenstein.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Are Up 5 Percent Under Trump. So How Long Will the Rally Last?", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byStocks have marched higher and higher \u2014 up 5 percent since President Trump took office six weeks ago \u2014 and the rally has become one of his favorite boasts. And there is plenty of economic data to justify the ebullience.So why are some hedge fund managers bracing for a sell-off?It\u2019s all in the details.The economic indicators are certainly heartening, the managers say, and Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious policy agenda \u2014 which includes a market-friendly triad of top priorities in rolling back regulations on businesses, overhauling corporate taxes and spending $1 trillion in infrastructure projects \u2014 looks encouraging, too.That is, if the policies come to pass as they have been described.If deep cuts to regulations and a tax overhaul are pushed off to next year, for instance, or if no clear plan emerges anytime soon to rebuild the nation\u2019s physical structures, there is plenty of room for disappointment.\u201cThe stock market may be currently expecting a best-case scenario for policy implementation,\u201d Alan Fournier, the founder of the multibillion-dollar hedge fund Pennant Capital Management in Summit, N.J., said in an interview shortly before the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 21,000 for the first time, on Wednesday.A closer examination of what it would take to put into effect Mr. Trump\u2019s initiatives, like a proposal to impose new import taxes, suggests that market participants might be overly excited, Mr. Fournier added.\u201cA lot more skepticism\u201d exists in currency and bond markets, said Mr. Fournier, who looks at the prices of those assets, rather than at stocks, when he needs a powerful gut check. He declined to discuss his current investments in detail.The market chatter in recent days has been similarly skeptical.In interviews with more than a dozen money managers in the past week, nine senior investment managers or hedge fund executives predicted that a market decline of at least modest size was likely to occur in the near future.Protecting the stocks, bonds and other positions that money managers hold from unexpected market moves in either direction is their business. It is the very essence of hedging and is critical to preserving investor capital.Some of those money managers are using options \u2014 trades that give their initiator the right, but not the requirement, to buy or sell stocks in the future \u2014 to bet that the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index will fall 1 to 2 percent in the coming weeks. Such positions can be cheap to build and can lock in favorable prices if the market declines.Others, like the Chicago investment firm Citadel, which is known for its aggressive risk management, are adding the effects of Trump policy implementation to their lists of factors that could create market volatility, company officials say. (One example: a meaningful rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul that would improve the share prices of banks and related companies.)A number of the money managers interviewed are looking at online betting websites that allow participants to place wagers \u2014 offbeat as they may be \u2014 on whether Mr. Trump will be impeached before the end of his current term as one indicator of popular perception that could depress stocks in the coming months or years.At Paddy Power, an Irish competitor running hundreds of markets related to the Trump presidency, the implied probability of impeachment was 40 percent. Other betting opportunities ranged from the likelihood of a third Trump divorce before the end of his presidency to the chance that Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would share a Nobel Peace Prize.\u201cOur customers are so interested in Trump that we\u2019ve created, basically, a microsite dedicated to him,\u201d said Lee Price, a Paddy Power spokesman.Of course, some are dubious about those markets, too.The idea of using a theoretical Trump impeachment as a reason to hedge investments is \u201cthe stupidest theory I\u2019ve ever heard in my life,\u201d said Peter DeCaprio, a founder of the $900 million hedge fund company Crow Point Partners in Hingham, Mass., \u201cbecause the odds of it happening are next to zero.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis is why people hate Wall Street. We\u2019re paid to evaluate risk and make investments in risky markets. That\u2019s it.\u201dSome funds have made hedging against risk their primary aim. Known as tail risk investment vehicles because they are on the lookout for highly unlikely market moves, they buy instruments like options and other insurance policies that can pay out when prices move in unexpected directions.\u201cHistoric valuations and record complacency in today\u2019s markets make them extremely vulnerable to shocks, regardless of who is in office,\u201d Mark Spitznagel, the chief investment officer of the Miami-based Universa Investments, one of the best-known tail risk funds, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe current low cost of protection makes a tail hedge an easy decision for asset holders, who are all exposed to the inevitable and increasingly dangerous unwind.\u201dMr. Spitznagel recommended the use of S.&P. options known as puts, which are the right to sell that index at a future point in time at previously determined prices.Other investors, like Citadel, are awaiting further details on events, like a possible government crackdown on drug prices that could hurt pharmaceutical stocks or the lifting of portions of Dodd-Frank that could help financial stocks, that could affect specific sectors.But without knowing more about how such policy measures will look, many hedge fund managers say it is hard to do more than simply wait until they can read the fine print.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans for Single-Payer Health Care", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byWithout a viable health care agenda of their own, Republicans now face a choice between two options: Obamacare and a gradual shift toward a single-payer system. The early signs suggest they will choose single payer.That would be the height of political irony, of course. Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Tom Price may succeed where left-wing dreamers have long failed and move the country toward socialized medicine. And they would do it unwittingly, by undermining the most conservative health care system that Americans are willing to accept.Let me take a step back to explain how we got here and how the politics of health care will most likely play out after last week\u2019s Republican crackup.Trump seemed to understand this during the campaign and came out in favor of universal coverage. Once elected, though, he reversed himself. He turned over health care to Price, a surgeon and Georgia congressman with an amazing record, and not in a good way.Obamacare increased coverage in two main ways. The more liberal way expanded a government program, Medicaid, to cover the near-poor. The more conservative way created private insurance markets where middle-class and affluent people could buy subsidized coverage.Now, think about the political message this would send to Democrats: It\u2019s not worth expanding health coverage in a conservative-friendly way, because Republican leaders won\u2019t support it anyway.Politics aside, private markets in many areas of the economy have substantive advantages over a government program. They create competition, which leads to innovation and lower prices. But private markets in medical care tend to be more complicated and less successful.So if voters like government-provided health care and Republicans are going to undermine private markets, what should Democrats do? When they are next in charge, they should expand government health care.They should expand Medicaid further into the working class. They should open Medicare to people in their early 60s. They should add a so-called public option to the private markets. They should push the United States closer to single-payer health insurance.

{"Headline": "Saudi Aramco I.P.O. May Merit a Social Engineering Discount", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsSaudi Aramco is in danger of undermining its own cash call.The state-owned oil giant is preparing the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering, targeting a valuation of $2 trillion \u2014 almost six times the value of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company, Exxon Mobil. Yet concurrent plans to pump cash into what could prove to be a series of white elephants should have investors arguing for a discount.Aramco is sometimes described as a state within a state. To understand why, consider its planned $4.4 billion investment in a new energy-focused industrial area in the country\u2019s Eastern Province, reported by Reuters on Tuesday. Such attempts to create more jobs for young Saudis are one of two main pillars holding up the economic plan laid out by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last year. Similar schemes, which aim to bolster local manufacturing and attract foreign investment, are scattered across the desert kingdom.There are two problems. First, they have so far failed to tackle joblessness: Youth unemployment is high and comparable to rates in poor sub-Saharan African countries at 30 percent of the work force, according to World Bank figures. Spending on imports fell by just 2 percent in 2015 despite decades of investment in domestic industrial capacity.Second, the employment drive potentially makes the other pillar \u2014 raising as much as possible from the sale in Aramco shares \u2014 trickier. The company already lacks publicly accessible detail on its finances. If it also plans to periodically write off billions of dollars on city-building experiments, investors should be factoring that into the valuation.Aramco\u2019s work force is still only about two-thirds the size of its international peer Royal Dutch Shell, which has 93,000 employees. Hence it may not display all the bloated inefficiency characteristic of state-dominated groups.But if it persists with quixotic social engineering, investors will start with the $2 trillion valuation and apply a white elephant discount.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the Shareholders? Not at These Shareholder Meetings", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byFair GameCompanies can use technology to be open and transparent with their stakeholders, or they can deploy it to go underground. Now, as this year\u2019s shareholder meeting season begins, investors are taking aim at directors whose companies use technology as a shield against accountability.At issue is the increasingly common corporate practice of holding annual meetings that offer only online participation for shareholders. A change in Delaware law in 2000 allowed companies incorporated there \u2014 which include a majority of American public companies, and two-thirds of the Fortune 500 \u2014 to conduct their annual shareholder events remotely. Other states also allow such meetings, but some, including Massachusetts and New York, do not.Virtual meetings, some investors say, cede far too much control to corporate managers during the sole event each year when they must look owners in the eye and listen to their views. Managers presiding at virtual-only confabs, critics say, can cherry-pick which shareholders\u2019 questions to answer and prevent investors from communicating one on one with management.Shareholder meetings may seem like highly ritualized events that only pretend to offer meaningful interactions between companies and the investors who own them. But it is undeniable that these events are the only time each year when investors can direct questions to company officials and air their praise or grievances.Many of the companies limiting their meetings to the virtual world are small, and switched because shareholders rarely attended their in-person events. But e-meetings are also rising among companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index that have throngs of interested shareholders. Last year, 14 of these companies held online-only meetings.Scott M. Stringer, comptroller of New York City and overseer of city pension funds with $170 billion in assets, hopes to stop this trend. His office recently began communicating with companies that held online-only meetings last year and whose shares the pension funds own. If they continue down this path, he said, the comptroller\u2019s office will recommend the pensions vote against the election of all directors sitting on corporate governance committees at the companies.I asked Catherine Butler, a Duke Energy spokeswoman, why the company had switched to a virtual-only meeting. She said Duke was doing so in part because other companies were. The major reason: \u201cWe have a worldwide shareholder base, and we want to make sure the majority of shareholders have the ability to participate,\u201d she said. The company\u2019s response to Mr. Stringer\u2019s office made the same case.Of course, a hybrid meeting would also allow Duke\u2019s shareholders around the globe to participate. But never mind that.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the great markers of American enterprise \u2014 whether you own one share or one million, you can speak at a company\u2019s annual meeting,\u201d Mr. Stringer said in a statement. \u201cExcept now, in this interconnected world, companies are using technological tools to whittle away at investors\u2019 rights and hide from accountability. If boards shirk this responsibility, share owners should join us in holding them accountable.\u201d\u201cHybrid meetings allow shareholders to show up and participate any way they want to,\u201d Mr. Lutin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to make it a pure virtual meeting other than to control the communication, and if that\u2019s the purpose, that\u2019s not consistent with annual meeting requirements.\u201dInvestors have tried other methods to slow the e-meeting trend. Last fall, Mr. Smith hoped to put forward a shareholder proposal at Comcast, the media company, recommending that it have a hybrid meeting rather than just an online version. But Comcast received permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to exclude the proposal from its proxy, so shareholders will not be voting on it this year.Halie O\u2019Shea, a United Natural Foods spokeswoman, said that after the 2012 meeting, the company moved to the hybrid model. \u201cThe company has high regard for Mr. Smith and is responsive to stockholders\u2019 views and concerns,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe proposal which Mr. Smith spoke in support of at the 2012 annual meeting was ultimately implemented by our board.\u201dUnited Natural Foods did the right thing. But given that a growing number of companies seem to like what virtual-only meetings offer, withholding votes from their directors may be necessary to slow the trend. Individual investors who suspect that their companies are using e-meetings to armor themselves against shareholders may want to withhold votes as well.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dole Case Illustrates Problems in Shareholder System", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe share ownership system in the United States is fraying. And while its shortcomings have been largely behind the scenes, now they are going to cost some innocent shareholders money.Former Dole shareholders will receive $2.74 a share \u2014 a nice chunk of change in addition to the $13.50 a share originally paid in the deal. Still, because of the shareholder ownership system, some of those Dole shareholders may not get that money.The reason is that while shareholders think they own the shares they buy, they don\u2019t in a sense.That may come as a surprise to those who check their online brokerage accounts daily or see traders on a floor of an exchange reacting to price movements. A market that in many ways is open and transparent is underpinned by a system of share ownership that can be anything but.Share ownership in the United States is conducted through the Depository Trust Company, which was formed after the back-office scandal of the early 1970s. At that time, trading volume on Wall Street became too much to handle, and brokerage firms were swamped by paperwork, falling months behind.The idea was to freeze ownership of company shares in one place. Now, when Apple or Microsoft look at their share register they see only the Depository Trust Company. When trading occurred, brokers would now transfer shares among accounts at the trust company. The brokers hold the shares on behalf of customers who were the ultimate beneficial owners.The result was that the Wall Street firms could now more easily track shares by having to deal only with themselves and the Depository Trust Company. Companies were taken out of the process.Because shareholders are actually only beneficial owners, lots of odd things can happen.For example, instead of executing a trade in the market, a broker may just transfer shares among clients and mark the trade as a sale. (The broker is still required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to get the best price.)Alternatively, if a person wants to short a stock by borrowing it and selling it in the market \u2014 betting that the stock price will drop \u2014 the broker may \u201clend\u201d your shares without you knowing it.These issues have been brought to the forefront by the Dole case. In the settlement, 4,662 people and entities claimed 49,164,415 shares at $2.74 per share.There is just one problem: Dole had only 36,793,758 shares outstanding.These are probably not false claims. They go directly to the problems with the share ownership system.The first problem is that the Depository Trust Company sometimes doesn\u2019t keep track of shares. When this happens, it puts a \u201cchill\u201d on the shares, meaning that it stops tracking them because of established procedures for the final three trading days up to the closing of a merger.Instead, the money in a merger is simply paid to the brokers who are supposed to filter it down to the investors. Usually this works, but apparently in the Dole buyout, there may have been some problems with this process.The bigger problem, however, is the shorting issue. Normally, when someone shorts shares, they borrow them and then sell them. When the short position is closed, the investor buys back the shares and restores them to their lender.In a merger, the shorting party simply pays the merger consideration.There seemed to have been many shorts in Dole. Expectations that the company would obtain a higher sale price lifted Dole\u2019s shares above the terms of the buyout offer.Other investors were apparently skeptical that would happen, and more than 2.9 million shares were shorted on the last day that the trust company tracked the trading of Dole shares.For good measure, the judge, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery, noted that \u201cit bears noting for future merger cases that the problems raised by short sales and trades during the three days before closing appear endemic to the depository system and hence likely infect every claims process.\u2019\u2019In other words, this happens every time. It became a problem in the Dole settlement only because with so much money being paid out, more shareholders than usual took the trouble to submit a claim.But there is not enough money. When short sellers borrowed shares they sold them to other shareholders in the market. Under the ruling, those third parties who unknowingly bought shares that were shorted will now not be paid. Instead, the holders of the shares that were lent out will be paid. Those who bought shorted shares will be left to look to the shorters.The Dole settlement highlights that as our capital markets become ever more complex, share trading and ownership are getting harder track. But in an age when computing power is cheap, why can\u2019t we keep track of shares?But is that really necessary? The system might be fixed just by adding some computing power to better trace shares. Of course, this would require the people who control the plumbing of the markets to invest millions and millions of dollars in improvements.Alas, there is no profit to be made on an upgrade. This is an area where the nation\u2019s chief market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, needs to step in.But even this will not solve the shorting issue. When you sign up with your broker you are signing up to short shares, whether you like it or not. People are then buying shares without your knowledge.This is a problem that the brokerage firms have created, and hopefully they will fix. At a minimum, they need to stand behind the shareholders here. After all, they helped create this mess.The Deal Professor column on March 22, about a Delaware court case over shares of Dole Food, described incorrectly the capabilities of the Depository Trust Company, which provides clearing and settlement services to the stock market. The trust company does in fact have the ability to track the ownership of shares; it is not the case that the trust company does not track the shares because it is too hard or too expensive to do so. (In the case of cash buyouts like that of Dole, regulatory processes and practices dictate how payment is made on settled positions and unsettled trades.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Murano\u2019s Glass Jewelry: All in the Family", "Date": "2017-03-24", "News": "Supported byMurano, the island of glassblowers across the lagoon from here, is known for producing vases and glasses with swirls of color and ornate chandeliers found in tony hotels and homes. But some businesses on the crowded little island also produce high fashion jewelry found on runways and in exclusive social settings around the world.These are not the machine-made trinkets imported from Asia that tourists find in Venice\u2019s souvenir shops, but rather inventive designs produced from quality materials. Two of the companies best known for such creations have a typically Italian approach: They are keeping alive traditional craftsmanship by applying it to new designs, while keeping it all in the family.The Attombri brothers, Daniele and Stefano, are using the last stocks of a glass bead no longer in production to create jewelry often of sculptural proportions for the catwalks of Dolce & Gabbana and Romeo Gigli, and for fashionable women who view jewelry as art.Their neighbors on Murano, the Sent sisters, Susanna and Marina, are using their grandfather\u2019s glass factory to invent new techniques in bead making. They are turning the results into jewelry collected by, among others, Yumiko Ando, the wife of the architect Tadao Ando, and Monica Armani, a well-known interior designer in Milan. The glass sculptor Dale Chihuly also has bought pieces \u2014 perhaps the ultimate accolade of one glass master for another.When Costantini stopped production about 20 years ago, the Attombri brothers bought the remaining stock. Born just outside Venice, in Mestre, and both trained as architects, the brothers decided to honor their city\u2019s heritage and let their artistic sides go wild.The result: An Attombri piece may contain thousands of minuscule beads, each as small as a grain of sand, laboriously strung on wire rather than the cotton threads traditionally used in jewelry, in multiple strands, or fashioned in the shape of the moon or the sun, more resembling a piece of sculpture than jewelry. A woman could hang the pieces on a wall rather than on her body to equally striking effect.The Costantini site, the size of a two-car garage, stands amid Murano\u2019s warren of canals. It holds some 900 crates, each filled with beads of a different color and size: Bin 882 is filled with deep red corallo beads; bin 778, ambra; 261, mandarino; 115, lapis.There are still significant amounts of some beads, and dipping a hand into a bin containing them is like shoving it into a big sack of rice. Others, however, are scarce. There is only about a half-pound remaining of a pure blue of the kind Andrea della Robbia might have used. \u201cI can make 10 necklaces out of it, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Daniele Attombri said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done.\u201d There are only 300 of one bead that combines blue with yellow, \u201cand it\u2019s mine,\u201d he said.Stefano Attombri said the business was selective. \u201cSometimes big companies ask us to make a production for their department stores, but we can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have to go to China or the Czech Republic for the beads, and we are allergic to them. They\u2019re made by computers: Every bead is the same.\u2019\u2019At Costantini\u2019s, the beads were made a different way. Glass was heated so that tiradors, or master stretchers, could stretch the hot balls of glass into narrow tubes, as if they were making taffy. The tube was then cut by hand into beads, so no two were ever alike.In Venice, the Attombri brothers turn the beads into high fashion jewelry, working in their boutique under the colonnade rimming the Rialto market. Using a technique they invented, they string beads onto metal strands by hand, using the long traditional needles of the beading trade, each slender as a hair.Creating exciting new three-dimensional shapes is key to them, the result of their architectural training. They make a good team: Stefano Attombri enjoys working with the beads while his brother is more interested in the metal, incorporating it as a design element into each piece. \u201cOur work is different from anyone else,\u201d Daniele Attombri said, as his brother worked on a beaded collar that would take 60 hours to complete.They also have created beaded lamps, chandeliers and curtains, and will open a store in the spring to showcase them. The jewelry sells for 180 to 1,000 euros, or $195 to $1,085. The furnishings range from \u20ac450 to \u20ac10,000 and are sold in their boutique, as well as at galleries in Japan.Says Susanna Sent of her sister: \u201cWe are opposite. Marina is calm, reflective and slow, but she astonishes me with fresh solutions.\u201d Says Marina of Susanna: \u201cMy sister is fast in suggesting new ideas and dealing with changes. We are like a car: I am the brake and she is the accelerator.\u201dSusanna Sent said the glass business runs in the family. \u201cFor both of us, glass is a very familiar material,\u201d she said. \u201cOur grandfathers from both sides of our family, our mother\u2019s and our father\u2019s, were glass workers.\u201cOur father inherited the business,\u201d she said. \u201cWe grew up in a family that was always talking about glass. We always had beautiful glasses for the table.\u201dBut the sisters were intent on making jewelry, so they put the knowledge gained around the dining table to work on a new direction for the family business. \u201cOur father gave us lots of freedom,\u201d Marina Sent said. \u201cWe could play and experiment with the glass.\u201d And they did.The sisters used the traditional techniques their family employed to make objets d\u2019art and vases, a process that involves sanding and polishing and decorating the glass, and applied it to making beads. They invented some new techniques, like mixing oxygen with gas, which allowed them to create a bigger bead and statement jewelry unlike what the women stringing beads by the lagoon had been making for centuries. The Sents continued experimenting, mixing existing colors to create new shades, their own versions of purple and teal.\u201cMaking beads became a passion,\u201d Susanna Sent said, explaining that when they used their father\u2019s fishing line to string their big, bold new beads in unexpected colors, friends wanted the results for themselves, and the Sents added jewelry to the family business.One of the Sents\u2019 signature styles comes from a technique they invented that has since been copied: a necklace that looks like a cluster of soap bubbles. They also use glass in other unexpected ways, creating scarves and lampshades while continuing the family tradition of making objets d\u2019art. To their mind, there is no difference between past and present, as they carry on the tradition. \u201cWe like when people consider our jewelry as an objet,\u201d Susanna Sent said. \u201cIt is the most beautiful congratulations we can receive.\u201dPrices for the jewelry range from \u20ac30 to \u20ac500. The jewelry is sold in the three Sent shops in Venice and Murano, as well as the shops of modern art museums in New York, San Francisco and Tokyo, and in boutiques and galleries around the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Has Gone So High, It\u2019s a Problem", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIt\u2019s a nice problem to have, but it\u2019s still a problem.Stocks have soared so high that a cautious person might start worrying about oxygen supply.In January, the Dow Jones industrial average reached 20,000 for the first time. It crossed the 21,000 mark on March 1, and while it slipped on Thursday and then had a late surge on Friday, it still seems to have plenty of power left in it.That means that if you\u2019ve been in the market for a while, you are likely to be perching on a mountain of profits. Should you stay where you are and hope for further gains, or is it time to declare victory and move your money to safer ground? That\u2019s an eternal question, one that returns whenever the market rises spectacularly. The answer depends, of course, on your analysis of two very different issues: the current situation in the markets, and the one in your own life.The raw numbers for the stock market are astonishing: Even without counting dividends, the Standard & Poor\u2019s index has risen more than 6 percent since New Year\u2019s Day, nearly 20 percent in the last 12 months and roughly 250 percent since the start of the bull market in March 2009.Market history shows how remarkable that performance is.The current bull run is now the second longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group, a research firm. It is surpassed in duration only by one that ran from December 1987 to March 2000.In terms of strength, it ranks third, well behind that 1987-2000 bull market, which had an eye-popping gain of 582 percent, but not very far from one that lasted from June 1949 until August 1956, in which the market rose 267 percent.In a telephone conversation, he said that while some of the market\u2019s recent action has been very strong \u2014 \u201ca huge move\u201d upward on Wednesday after President Trump\u2019s speech to Congress, for example \u2014 the stock market\u2019s path since 2009 has generally \u201cbeen a series of slow, grinding moves\u201d with little evidence of irrational exuberance.Clearly, though, market fundamentals are less auspicious than they were eight years ago, when stocks had been battered in the ferocious downturn of the great financial crisis, and investors with foresight and audacity could buy at rock-bottom prices.For example, one widely followed metric, the price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 which tells you how much money is being paid, on average, for $1 of corporate earnings \u2014 has become much less favorable. It has climbed to 22, well above its five-year average of 18.2, according to data from Bloomberg. Consider that in February 2009, the ratio plummeted to 12.1, a paltry level reflecting widespread fear that both corporate earnings and stock prices would plunge. That moment was a turning point for the market, which has surged upward ever since. It may not be at a peak now, but investors are inhaling rarefied air, whether they know it or not.Yet it can be argued, as Mr. Birinyi does, that corporate earnings are rising, the economy is expanding nicely, and investors have been reacting fairly cautiously, keeping valuations within reasonable, if not optimal, bounds.The increasing likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase would have been a problem a year ago, Mr. Birinyi said, but it is a positive portent at this stage, because it signals that the central bank is convinced that the economy is in good shape and will keep expanding.That said, he also warned that in the current market, restraint and agility are important. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go all in on stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be careful.\u201dMr. Birinyi sits in front of a terminal all day, trading individual stocks whenever the prices tell him it makes sense to do so, which most people couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t attempt. \u201cWe get out of a stock if the price is no longer right,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will buy it again when it\u2019s better. We\u2019re ready for whatever happens.\u201dMost of us aren\u2019t steady stock traders, and need to be prepared for downturns in other ways. And if little is accomplished in Washington to fulfill investor expectations \u2014 or if there is an external shock, such as an international crisis \u2014 the market could fall sharply, Mr. Birinyi acknowledged. Furthermore, if the economy falters in such situations, the long rally in stocks could end violently.But even if you\u2019re a very long-term investor, it\u2019s smart to take inventory. If, for example, you will need a chunk of your portfolio for a down payment on a house or to pay a tuition bill or to replace a roof or buy a car, you may want to liquidate some of it now, congratulating yourself on your gains. In addition, even if you don\u2019t need to use the money, selling securities that have incurred losses may be a good move, Mr. Birinyi said. Losses will offset gains when it\u2019s time to pay your taxes, and many investors these days are fortunate in having plenty of gains.In any case, it is surely wise to make sure, after a remarkable run in the stock market, that you will be able to handle a sharp downturn when it eventually comes. Personally, I\u2019ve salted away my savings in broad stock and bond indexes with money that I don\u2019t expect to need for years, and I\u2019m careful to limit my own stock allocation. I don\u2019t ignore the market. I examine it daily, and if I become convinced that it is shaky, I will reduce my own holdings \u2014 and say so \u2014 but haven\u2019t taken much off the table lately. We all have to live with our own choices. I\u2019m choosing to celebrate but also to be very careful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eton Park to Shut Down as $3 Trillion Hedge Fund Industry Faces Turmoil", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byA well-known money manager is shutting down his firm after a year of disappointing results \u2014 the latest sign of turmoil in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry.Eric Mindich, 49, was once a Wall Street wunderkind, becoming the youngest ever partner at Goldman Sachs more than 20 years ago. He launched Eton Park Capital Management in 2004, expanding it to manage as much as $14 billion.But on Thursday he said he was throwing in the towel. In a letter to investors reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Mindich said a mix of challenging market conditions and Eton Park\u2019s poor performance had led to the decision. The firm\u2019s assets under management have fallen by half since 2011.\u201cA combination of industry headwinds, a difficult market environment and, importantly, our own disappointing 2016 results have challenged our ability to continue to maintain the scale and scope we believe necessary to pursue our investment program,\u201d Mr. Mindich wrote.At the same time, state pension funds led by the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System are dumping their hedge fund portfolios, contending many strategies are too complex and costly \u2014 especially at a time when many firms are underperforming.Eton Park, based in Manhattan, will begin returning its roughly $7 billion in capital to investors, and anticipates returning about 40 percent of its outside money by the end of April.The decision by Mr. Mindich to close the firm comes after a tough year in 2016, when Eton Park\u2019s returns were down about 9.4 percent. So far this year, the fund\u2019s performance has been flat.The firm sent out the letter on Thursday after notifying its roughly 120 employees of the decision to close.Over all, 2016 was one of the worst years for hedge fund closures since the financial crisis, with hundreds of smaller funds closing because of poor performance, investor redemptions and complaints about high fees.In all, 1,057 hedge funds closed or were liquidated in 2016, compared with 729 openings, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc. The number of active hedge funds is at its lowest level since 2012.In a sign of the industry\u2019s continuing struggles, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index \u2014 a broad measure of hedge fund performance \u2014 was up just 2.23 percent for the year at the end of February, compared with a roughly 5 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 during that time.One of the larger hedge funds to shut down last year was Perry Capital, the firm founded by Richard C. Perry, another Goldman alumnus. And one of the notable small hedge fund closures was Eaglevale Partners, a firm co-founded by Marc Mezvinsky, the son-in-law of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\u201cEton Park is in good company,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cOver 1,000 funds returned their investors\u2019 money over the last year, including star-power funds.\u201dMr. Mindich and his wife, Stacey, a theater producer, are prominent philanthropists. In 2015, the couple made a $15 million gift to fund public service initiatives at Harvard. They have also donated to Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York to support children\u2019s health research.Mr. Mindich made his name as a fast-rising star on Wall Street, heading up Goldman\u2019s arbitrage desk at the age of 25. In 1994, at 27, he became Goldman\u2019s youngest partner ever and was a leader of the firm\u2019s equities arbitrage business.The arbitrage desk at Goldman, under the tutelage of Robert Rubin, who would leave Goldman to become Treasury secretary in 1995, spawned a number of hedge fund managers, including Mr. Mindich, Mr. Perry and Daniel Och, founder of Och-Ziff Capital Management.Mr. Mindich was seen as a Wall Street wunderkind when he started Eton Park. The firm started with about $3.5 billion in capital and at the time was among the biggest and splashiest hedge fund launches.And for many years, the firm posted solid returns, investing heavily in stocks, bonds and derivatives. One of the hedge fund\u2019s best years came in 2013, when it returned 22 percent. In 2008, one of the worst years for hedge funds, Eton Park lost 10 percent, but that was far better than most other firms fared.The firm grew to manage about $14 billion, and opened offices in London and Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "There Are No Perry Mason Moments in Insider Trading Cases", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchA powerful claim in a criminal case is the defense lawyer\u2019s proclamation of the client\u2019s innocence, exemplified by the near-perfect record of the fictional defense lawyer Perry Mason getting the real perpetrator to break down on the witness stand and confess to the crime.White-collar crime prosecutions have no shortage of innocence claims, but figuring out whether the defendant committed a crime is much more difficult because these are quintessentially offenses of the mind, revolving around intent and knowledge. It is a fine line between guilt and innocence when no one disputes what happened while everything depends on what the defendant understood and intended.The trial of William T. Walters on insider trading charges now taking place in Federal District Court in Manhattan is a prime example of how difficult it will be to figure out whether a defendant is not guilty of a white-collar crime. He is a world-renowned gambler who has been prosecuted four times before on different charges but never convicted.Mr. Waters is accused of trading on information he received from Thomas C. Davis, a former chairman of the board of Dean Foods who was also a consultant in an activist campaign involving Darden Restaurants. Mr. Davis is cooperating in the case, claiming that Mr. Walters gave him disposable cellphones \u2014 one nicknamed the Bat Phone \u2014 and that they used code names for companies, like Dallas Cowboys for Dean Foods, to cover up passing along confidential information.To explain the trading, Mr. Berke asserted that Mr. Walters used the skills he developed as a gambler by picking stocks much the way a poker player scopes out an opponent based on \u201ctells,\u201d or \u201clittle clues that are not obvious.\u201dThis is similar to the mosaic theory offered by the hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam when he was charged in 2009 with multiple counts of insider trading in Federal District Court in Manhattan, claiming that the information he received was just one tidbit among a wealth of data he put together to decide whether to buy or sell a stock. The jury rejected the defense by finding him guilty and he received an 11-year prison sentence.The defense of Mr. Walters is a claim that he has a better account for his trading that does not involve inside information, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Mr. Davis was one of his tells in assessing the companies for an investment. Is that really a claim of innocence or an alternative explanation that raises enough doubt for the jury to return a not guilty verdict?Jurors are not asked to decide if a defendant is innocent, despite the defense lawyer\u2019s appeal that the client did nothing wrong. The only issue in a criminal prosecution is whether the government introduced sufficient evidence to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.There has been a significant amount of publicity about wrongful convictions in which defendants have been exonerated after spending years in prison for crimes they did not commit. Many of these cases involve DNA evidence showing conclusively that the perpetrator was not the defendant, while others involved confessions extracted by the police through high-pressure interrogations that were shown to be false.The core of these innocence cases involves a misidentification, not a claim that a crime did not take place. Thus, in ordinary street crimes the identity of the perpetrator is paramount, and typical defenses involve an alibi or questions about whether the victim properly identified who committed the offense.In closing the investigation, Mr. Kim noted \u201cthe particular difficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit,\u201d indicating that the conduct came close to the line \u2014 well short of any declaration of innocence.In insider trading cases, jurors have often been unwilling to credit assertions of innocence when the trades were particularly well-timed and quick profits raise suspicions that confidential information must have been used.The jury chose not to accept the assertion of innocence, but that does not necessarily mean a defendant like Mr. Schulman will desist from a claim that he did nothing wrong. Many insider trading defendants continue to proclaim their innocence long after a guilty verdict.Whether white-collar defendants are innocent can never truly be known because these crimes are not susceptible to the type of proof that would definitively exonerate a person, making it almost impossible for there to be any Perry Mason moments of vindication. There is no DNA that can establish conclusively what was in a defendant\u2019s mind at the time the conduct took place, so professions of innocence based on a lack of intent can never be proved \u2014 or disproved.Advertisement"}

It elated Wall Street institutions eager for a prominent initial public offering when few had surfaced for months.The company has entranced investors despite a litany of red flags, like enormous losses that are expected to persist for years, a slowdown in its once-vaunted user growth rates, and an ownership structure that gives Snapchat\u2019s founders control for decades to come.Some analysts have already shown skepticism about the newest publicly traded tech giant. One, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, says the share price should be $10, far below the company\u2019s offering price of $17, which itself was above the initial range predicted. Snap faces competition from larger companies and the challenge of a slow-growing user base, he said.Boosters of Snap\u2019s prospects argue instead that Snap has the potential to become less like Twitter and more like its biggest rival, the $395 billion Facebook. These supporters point to some of the company\u2019s obvious strengths: the 158 million people on average who used Snapchat each day by the end of 2016; the roughly 18 times a day that those users opened the app on average; the $404 million in sales that it collected last year, up from nothing three years ago.For now, investors appeared to focus on the positive. Snap raised $3.4 billion in its market debut, the most by an American tech company since Facebook\u2019s initial offering in 2012, according to data from Renaissance Capital. It was the first significant tech stock sale since at least December. And the 44 percent pop in its stock price was the biggest enjoyed by a company of a billion-dollar I.P.O. since Twitter\u2019s debut in 2013. More than 217 million shares traded on Thursday, as some investors bought and others cashed in, exceeding the number of shares Snap sold in the I.P.O.For investors in other still-private unicorns \u2014 a term for start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 the immense success of Snap\u2019s deal highlights the appetite for a tech darling, even if the company still bleeds money. Count Uber, Spotify and Airbnb within that group.\u201cThe sound you\u2019re hearing today after the Snap I.P.O. is the happy snapping of fingers of money-losing unicorns and their investors,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. \u201cIt looks like Snap has set the path to monetization.\u201dIn countless meetings during a two-week roadshow with investors, Snap executives sought to rebut some of the biggest concerns about the company\u2019s prospects. Slowing growth toward the end of last year stemmed from problems with the service\u2019s Android app. Competition from Facebook, which openly copied some of Snapchat\u2019s signature features at Instagram, would do little to dent user enthusiasm.Unlike newly public companies that seek to celebrate their first day of trading on the stock markets, Snap kept its festivities largely confined to the New York Stock Exchange. The company\u2019s top executives and board members gathered there for a closed-door breakfast, where guests were presented with pins in the shape of Snapchat\u2019s ghost mascot.Major I.P.O.s of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992.But by the time Snap\u2019s shares opened for trading at $24 each \u2014 which was later in the morning \u2014 the company\u2019s top executives had disappeared from the floor, heading to the nearby offices of one of the banks involved in the public offering, Goldman Sachs, to watch the opening.

{"Headline": "Helping Your Children Plan for Retirement, Even as You Plan for Yours", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byWhen I started my first full-time job after college, the last thing I cared about was what kind of retirement benefits I was offered. This was from a combination of typical youthful self-absorption and a vague sense that through pensions (which my father had) and Social Security, things would just work out.That is fairly common but not necessarily wise. We all know saving early means saving more, but the trick is how to discuss that without boring or panicking your children.Here are some strategies to give your children a head start: If they are young, talk to them about money and savings in a way they will understand and find fun. Ten years ago, Jennifer Carole, a single mother in Santa Cruz, Calif., decided to buy stocks for her daughter (7 at the time) and her daughter\u2019s three friends, letting them choose companies they recognized, like Target, Kraft and Heinz.That was just part of an overall strategy to ensure that her daughter, Katie, understood choices: that buying a fancier car, for example, meant less money put aside for college or retirement.\u201cMy mom lives around the corner, and she knows Grandma can\u2019t do a lot because she\u2019s on a fixed income,\u201d said Ms. Carole, a marketing consultant, in reference to her daughter. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to have the financial responsibility I have for my mother.\u201dKatie Carole said that she plans to start putting small amounts aside for retirement right after college.\u201cIt\u2019s been a huge influence seeing how my mother handles money and how my grandmother did it differently,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen my mom save strategically and invest, and she is so much more secure.\u201d As soon as your children start earning taxed income through summer or after-school jobs, you can open a Roth IRA for them. Roth investments use after-tax dollars, not pretax dollars, as traditional IRAs do, so they are perfect for people who do not need to worry about offsetting their taxes, said Mari Adam, a financial planner with Adam Financial Associates.Those who are 50 or younger can put in an annual maximum of $5,500 in a Roth, but in most cases, there is no minimum needed to open one, and money can be withdrawn at any time without a penalty.And a way to sweeten the pot is to offer a parental match.\u201cMy son, Mac, is just turning 16, and that\u2019s how I plan to approach it,\u201d said Art Lundgren, a financial planner with Garrett Investment Advisors in Minneapolis. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018You put in half, and I\u2019ll put in half.\u2019\u201dI will strongly suggest to my sons that they open an account, as they can do it with last year\u2019s earnings before April 15.Since children typically think their parents know less than nothing, one option, if you have a financial planner, is to outsource and set up an appointment for your children after they graduate from high school or college.Bonni and Mitchell Tandet of Hillsboro Beach, Fla., have used Ms. Adam as their financial adviser for years, so when their daughters started having financial questions, they sent them to her.\u201cWe feel that\u2019s the best gift,\u201d said Ms. Tandet, a retired dental hygienist whose daughters are now 28 and 31. \u201cAnd now that one daughter is engaged to be married, when she and her fianc\u00e9 were visiting from Boston, they met with Mari.\u201dMs. Carole agreed, saying she suggested that Katie meet with her financial planner when she started driving, since \u201cmore money would be leaving the house faster.\u201dOne of the most important tips comes from Mr. Updegrave of RealDealRetirement.com: Drill into your children that the more that retirement savings can be put on autopilot through automatic paycheck deductions, the better. He suggested 10 to 15 percent be put into such savings every payday. \u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable target,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t do that, start with a lower amount and add a percentage point each year, or a quarter of your raise.\u201dHe also urged parents not to make investing sound overly difficult or something only an expert could do.\u201cThe financial services message about investing is, \u2018It\u2019s complicated, but we\u2019re here to help,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that complicated.\u201dAnd take it easy. Talk to your children, but \u201cbe careful not to overdo it,\u201d Mr. Updegrave said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to bring stuff up, but you don\u2019t want your teenagers to drift away every time you come up, thinking, \u2018Here\u2019s a lecture from the geezer.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Remember When Appalachia Wasn\u2019t Trump Country", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byOpinionI am a liberal from West Virginia. That didn\u2019t used to be unusual. I remember when the people of the state were liberal, and what liberalism meant for their lives.In 2016 a majority of West Virginia\u2019s voters supported Donald J. Trump, and many expressed outright hatred of Barack Obama. But when I was last active in the state\u2019s politics, in 1960, the state was a leader in desegregating schools in response to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. John F. Kennedy won the state by a wide margin, and I was one of an overwhelming majority of Democrats elected to the state\u2019s House of Delegates \u2014 along with a handful of Republicans. Today that tiny minority is the majority.So how did we get from there to here?The year 1960 was part of what I call the Roosevelt era, a period that lasted roughly from 1933 until 1965. It was characterized by a politics and an ethos of generosity. It began with individual acts of generosity during the Depression where mothers, barely among the haves themselves, fed the hungry men who came to their kitchen doors. It flowered as Americans supported a government that gave both jobs and hope to the down and out and enacted New Deal laws that helped make incomes more equal than they had ever been.The average man was respected, even a cultural hero. Will Rogers, one of the nation\u2019s most-beloved figures at the beginning of this era, called himself an old country boy. My father, a lawyer, called himself a common man, as did many of his friends. The result was that progress toward income equality was accompanied by significant progress toward racial and religious equality. Widespread anti-Semitism as the era began greatly diminished by 1965, and anti-Catholicism, meaning anti-Irish and anti-Italian prejudice, almost totally disappeared. The greatest advances in legal equality for blacks since Reconstruction culminated in the Voting Rights Act of 1965.But when the average American feels looked down on, his interests minimized or ignored, he can not only become less generous, he can also sometimes become downright ugly.Nineteen sixty-five was the year everything began to change. First, there was Vietnam. Opposition to the war tended to divide the country along class lines, with the college-educated elite avoiding service and the fighting and dying left to the average man.I was against the war but worried about the class division. It seemed to me that too many members of the educated elite not only felt they were morally superior to those who supported the war but even began to feel a snobbish disdain toward the less sophisticated in matters ranging from not attending the right schools to not knowing about wine or, horror of horrors, wearing polyester suits.Though many Trump voters are, like West Virginia\u2019s coal miners, economically distressed members of the working class, there are also a large number who are comfortably fixed but may not have attended the right schools. The one thing that unites the two groups is resentment of the elite\u2019s snobbery and moral superiority, which they define as political correctness. Many rich Republican and libertarian members of the elite are also snobs, but Rush Limbaugh and Fox News have convinced Trump voters that the snobs are all from the liberal elite.In the late 1960s, the civil rights movement turned in part from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s appeal to the golden rule to a more aggressive, fist-shaking assertion of black power \u2014 \u201cIf America don\u2019t come around,\u201d the activist H. Rap Brown declared, \u201cwe\u2019re going to burn it down\u201d \u2014 that scared the average white American. And when those same whites saw the education of their children affected by what they regarded as the social experiment of busing, inflicted on them by the liberal elite, you could see them beginning to move toward conservatism and a reawakening of the prejudice that Dr. King\u2019s nonviolence had made so much progress toward overcoming.This growing cultural antagonism was heightened by the gun control movement that grew in the late 1960s in the wake of the assassinations of Dr. King and the Kennedy brothers \u2014 a liberal push that came just as violent crime was increasing and many people felt the need to arm themselves to defend their homes, a fear that was not widely acknowledged by the liberal elite. Similarly, when the anti-abortion movement arose in response to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, liberals were reluctant to acknowledge the moral choice involved in abortion. As the years went on, the same liberals who scorned the failure of climate-change deniers to accept scientific evidence were themselves reluctant to face the scientific evidence of the early viability of a fetus.In each of these cases, the liberal position is on the whole the right one, but the failure to understand the legitimate concerns of the other side causes anger and resentment.For me, the most maddening failure of the liberal elite was that too many of its members became indifferent to the declining share of corporate income devoted to wages. By the early 1980s, you could see clear evidence of their growing interest in accumulating wealth for themselves, of their focus on corporate profits that would pay them dividends and increase the value of their stocks; \u201cWall Street Week\u201d soared to popularity on PBS \u2014 it was the \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d of its time. Profits have increased since 1980, yet wages have stagnated.It is not going to be easy for liberals to win back red states like West Virginia. Rush Limbaugh, Fox News and Donald Trump have been too successful in encouraging ugly feelings like the senseless hatred of Barack Obama. But liberals can start on the road back if they stop wounding themselves, advocate fair play for all, and instead of looking down on Trump voters as a bunch of boobs and bigots, listen to their concerns. If we don\u2019t listen, how can we persuade?Charles Peters, the founding editor of The Washington Monthly, is the author of \u201cWe Do Our Part: Toward a Fairer and More Equal America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap Prices I.P.O. at $17 a Share, Valuing Company at $24 Billion", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byMillennials, those 14 to 35 years old, may be as exuberantly hyped a demographic as any in recent memory.That generation has now helped power one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited stock market debuts in recent memory, making billionaires of the founders of the disappearing-message service Snapchat.Investors, attracted by Snapchat\u2019s hold on its millennial users \u2014 who check the app on average more than 18 times a day \u2014 flocked to the initial public offering, pushing the parent company, Snap Inc., to a valuation of nearly $24 billion.The stock sale sets Snap up as the most valuable American technology company to go public since Facebook nearly five years ago. And it may herald a coming wave of unicorns \u2014 technology start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by private investors \u2014 that are expected to hit the public markets in the next few years.Snap\u2019s offering was priced on Wednesday at $17 a share \u2014 a dollar more than the previously expected pricing range. The pricing came on a day when the stock market surged to another high, fed by raised expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. Shares of the social media companies Facebook and Twitter also rose.Those buying into Snap\u2019s offering did so even as warning signs have flashed over the company, based in California. It lost more than $500 million last year, and its explosive user growth appears to have hit a speed bump. And in a decision that has angered some large investors, the shares will have no voting rights, leaving control in the hands of the company\u2019s founders, who can retain that power for years even after leaving Snap.Yet when Snap begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, under the ticker name SNAP, it will command a lofty valuation multiple even richer than that of Facebook, which earned $10 billion last year.The question beyond this week is whether Snap will prove to be like mighty Facebook or embattled Twitter.Much has been riding on Snap\u2019s offering, including expectations that it will lift a moribund market in new stocks. In going public, Snap has leapt ahead of other technology darlings like Uber, Airbnb and the data-analysis provider Palantir.After a nearly two-week road show for investors that spanned the country and stretched to London, demand for Snap shares proved robust. Bankers for the company received orders totaling more than 10 times the number of shares up for sale.With a market value of almost $24 billion, including unvested stock options and grants, the company is now setting itself up with little room for error.Throughout the presentations to investors, Snap executives and their advisers kept the emphasis squarely on the promise of what first seemed like a technological lark. Instead of focusing on the core product of disappearing messages, Snapchat instead represents a new way of consuming content, largely produced by its users \u2014 laid alongside a fast-growing advertising business.At the end of 2016, Snap reported an average of 158 million active daily users. Revenue totaled about $404 million for the year, up from zero in sales three years ago. The company believes sales could reach $1 billion this year.Snap has come a long way from its beginnings in a Stanford dorm room as a service used largely by young people enamored with sending their friends pictures and video that self-destructed after seconds.Based in the fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice, the company has since introduced ways for users to broadcast \u201cstories\u201d about their days to wider audiences and pioneered the use of computer-generated lenses that transform those users into dogs or Taco Bell tacos.Now, Snap is trying to convey even greater ambitions.In the prospectus for its stock sale, the service declared itself a \u201ccamera company.\u201d So far that has included selling Spectacles, camera-equipped sunglasses that let users upload 10-second videos directly to Snapchat, which briefly captured the fancy of the tech cognoscenti. And Snap has worked on prototypes for products like drone-mounted cameras.But Mr. Spiegel and his fellow shareholders are still hoping that investors will help lift their company to Facebook-type heights. Since Mr. Zuckerberg took his business public just under five years ago, Facebook\u2019s shares have climbed more than 254 percent.The cautionary tale is that of Twitter, which celebrated a lofty stock market debut in 2013, only to have its share price tumble amid questions about its ability to grow. Twitter\u2019s stock is down about 62 percent from its initial public offering, and the company has had to fend off questions about whether it can remain an independent and publicly traded business.Analysts also raised the specter of lower growth with Snap, given that the company\u2019s user growth slowed last year.Then there is the copycatting of Snapchat\u2019s most recognizable features, from its Stories to its animated lenses and filters. Chief among the imitators is Facebook, whose Instagram service has forthrightly adopted those elements. Even smaller social networks like Medium, a blog-posting service, have rolled out similar offerings.Executives contended during the investor presentations that Snapchat\u2019s slowdown was largely due to technical issues with its Android app. And they argued that the bigger issue to look at was engagement, or, put another way, how much its audience loves the app.And Snap, under Mr. Spiegel, has argued that it will continue to roll out innovations.Regardless of whether Snap soars or sinks, its offering will significantly enrich its earliest investors, notably Mr. Spiegel and the company\u2019s other founder, Robert Murphy.With 227 million shares each, the two men are each worth more than $3 billion on paper, well ahead of their 30th birthdays.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Market Dip Bucks a Streak of Trump-Inspired Optimism", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byIt had been one of Wall Street\u2019s more confounding streaks.Until Tuesday morning, the stock market\u2019s benchmark, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, had gone 64 consecutive trading days without declining more than 1 percent at any point in a trading session.Making the streak even more remarkable, such extraordinary composure from investors had occurred in a period of political volatility as fresh controversies dogged the Trump White House and Europe braced for elections in France and elsewhere on the Continent.This optimism was tested Tuesday as the major market indicators ended down more than 1 percent, led by a sell-off in financial stocks.\u201cThere is a saying that the market makes fools of us all,\u201d said Charlie Bilello, director of research at Pension Partners, an investment advisory firm. \u201cAnd that is true here because we have been in one of the most peaceful, calm periods in the history of the stock market.\u201dThe question now is whether, after months of mostly ignoring political headlines, investors will weigh the possibility that problems with repealing the Affordable Care Act and the uproar over the Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties with Russia could weaken the president\u2019s ability to pass market-friendly laws.On Tuesday, the S.&P. 500 closed down 1.24 percent, its sharpest daily decline since October. At 161 days, it was the longest period between closing declines of 1 percent or more in the index since June 1985.In terms of intraday trading, the period without big drops in the index was the longest since 1962, beating by a wide margin the previous record of 34 days in mid-1995.For the day, the narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended down 1.14 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index finished off 1.83 percent.Large financial stocks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase led the way down on Tuesday as investors began to show concern that President Trump\u2019s daily political battles might harm his ability to push through an ambitious economic agenda. The S.&P. financials index had its biggest fall since late June, in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.The value of the dollar slipped against the euro and other major currencies.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.41 percent, generally an indication that investors were selling riskier assets and piling into safer securities like government bonds.Since November, the stock market rally has been fueled by expectations that President Trump, helped by Republican majorities in the House and the Senate, would be able to push through tax cuts, roll back regulations and kick-start a round of government-backed infrastructure spending.No signs indicate those expectations have fundamentally changed. A one-day, 1.24 percent decline three months into one of the better starts to an investment year in recent memory is no indication that a correction could be imminent, market specialists said.And many observers remain convinced that the combination of fiscal stimulus, a strong economy and low but gradually rising interest rates will remain a powerful lure for investors.\u201cThis will be the first time since the mid-1960s that the federal government may provide a positive impulse to an economy that is at full employment,\u201d said Bob Miller, a senior bond investor at BlackRock.Because interest rates are so low, a round of rate increases from the Federal Reserve is not likely to harm growth assets like stocks, Mr. Miller said.It has been precisely this type of optimistic outlook that has kept the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX \u2014 also known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge \u2014 at such historically low levels.Low volatility readings are generally seen at the end of an economic expansion as confidence, wages and markets rise in unison.Such is the case now, Mr. Bilello said, which ought to be a warning to investors that good times do not last forever.\u201cThis would be the ninth straight year that the S.&P. finishes the year higher than the year before,\u201d Mr. Bilello said. \u201cAnd if you combine that with very high valuations, it means that investors should expect more volatility going forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Money-Losing Snap Could Be Worth So Much", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Common SenseTesting the upper limits of valuation, Snap\u2019s investors are betting on the kind of rapid growth that few, if any, companies have ever achieved.Supported byBy now, even most of us over 35 \u2014 old age, by Snapchat standards \u2014 are aware of the photo sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial America.Even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that self-destruct, or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow, turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts, you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $34 billion.At that price, Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook \u2014 not to mention such internet stalwarts as Google, Amazon and even Netflix \u2014 look like bargain-basement \u201cvalue\u201d stocks.Snap \u201clooks tremendously overvalued to me,\u201d said Brian Hamilton, a co-founder of Sageworks, a financial analysis and valuation firm.Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Snap as a \u201cfield of dreams.\u201d Even with rosy growth forecasts, \u201cat $22 billion, we\u2019re looking at a stock trading at five to eight times estimated revenues in 2020,\u201d he said before the valuation rose even higher. \u201cThe only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba, and they have massive scale. And both of them are profitable.\u201dMajor I.P.O.s of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992.So let\u2019s be generous and ignore profit. How about revenue? Snap said it generated $404 million in sales in 2016. A valuation of $34 billion is about 84 times revenue.That\u2019s six times as high as Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio, which is 14. It\u2019s 14 times as high as Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which trades at just over six times revenue. Amazon trades at a mere three times. Even high-flying Netflix trades at seven times.Compared with Snap, however, those are mature companies, whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as they\u2019ve aged. As Mr. Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry Gold put it in a recent note to clients: \u201cThere is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all. The sky\u2019s the limit and history is not a guide.\u201dTo justify a valuation of even $25 billion, \u201cyou have to make some very lofty assumptions,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cThey would need to grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent, which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly.\u201d He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the history of American business.But let\u2019s ignore revenue, too. This is social media, after all, where \u201cdaily active users\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d are the coins of the realm.And $1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for Snap. At $34 billion, each of Snap\u2019s daily active users is worth $215, six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for Instagram.As of January, Instagram reported 300 million daily active users. At $215 each, the Instagram app alone would be valued today at $64.5 billion.These are static numbers, and what Snap is selling investors is growth. According to Snap\u2019s prospectus, Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016, about the same as the year before. If it can pull that off again next year, it would reach an impressive 234 million users, though still short of Instagram.The Snapchat story \u201cis all about growth,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about economics.\u201dBut Snapchat\u2019s growth slowed sharply in last year\u2019s fourth quarter \u2014 just about the time Instagram started its own version of Stories, a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos. It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters.By comparison, 150 million Instagram users are now using its Stories feature. That\u2019s already nearly as many as Snapchat\u2019s entire user base.Maybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user, even if its user base doesn\u2019t grow all that much. It\u2019s currently generating an average of $5.83 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebook\u2019s North American average of $12.81, the MoffettNathanson analysis notes, suggesting plenty of room to grow.But even doubling revenue doesn\u2019t get Snap close to a Facebook valuation.There are, of course, superhigh revenue and user-growth assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuation.Still, very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels (and I looked for some). The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as $30 billion. But that\u2019s based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of $3.8 billion in 2018.Mr. Gold said some investors were buying into the I.P.O., but not to hold Snap for the long term. \u201cPeople are saying they\u2019ll wait for a valuation that\u2019s truly astronomical, and then take the other side of the bet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run into trouble over the next few quarters.\u201dDespite many of its somewhat juvenile features, at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate, substituting images for language. \u201cSnapchat has built a better mousetrap,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s engaging, and it\u2019s fun, especially for young people.\u201dThat\u2019s a story that obviously appealed to investors starving for the next hot social media company. Whether they\u2019ll want to cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains to be seen.\u201cThis looks and smells like Twitter to me,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time, if ever, before they see any meaningful appreciation.\u201dAbout the best Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Gold could come up with: Snap\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t \u201cpatently crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Motors: A Brand Is a Terrible Thing to Waste", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBut any benefit of the $2.9 billion sale is worrisomely short-term, an unwelcome skid away from the passenger-car technology. Any gain for G.M. in selling off the divisions known for building some of its most sophisticated small- and medium-sized passenger cars is outweighed by the real hazard to the corporation\u2019s longer-term health as well as that of the world\u2019s population, who most clearly don\u2019t benefit from greater emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants associated with larger, less fuel efficient cars. Along with G.M.\u2019s decision to join other car companies that have pleaded for a rollback of pending fuel economy regulations, the sale raises the question of how much G.M. learned from previous energy crises and its 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout.But if anything seems shortsighted about the sale, it is the self-inflicted loss of passenger- and small-car engineering smarts that Opel represents. With the Trump administration\u2019s avowed intention of rolling back Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards and frontal assaults on the Environmental Protection Agency and other air-quality regulators, G.M. has seemingly forgotten all the earnest statements it made back in 2009 when it was seeking a federal bailout. Back then, it just couldn\u2019t wait to get the Chevy Volt into production, and it promised it was going to be a responsible partner in cleaning up the environment it helped pollute. Now it wants to sell more gas-guzzling Chevy Suburbans, which are so much cheaper to make and more profitable to sell than ordinary-size Chevy Cruzes and Buick Regals that, well, they just can\u2019t help themselves.The last time gas prices soared, G.M.\u2019s lack of competitive passenger cars helped, along with a failing economy, push it into bankruptcy. And giving up on Opel (whose models are rebadged as Vauxhalls for the British market) is a big step in the direction of not having competitive passenger cars. Opel is a key center of G.M. excellence, competing with high credibility in the tough German market, where cars with superior safety, economy and driving dynamics are expected, unlike in the United States and China. In Opel therefore one finds what is arguably G.M.\u2019s finest assemblage of experience, knowledge and smarts in the world of passenger and small car design. Many of today\u2019s most dynamic G.M. passenger-car offerings \u2014 its best Buick sedans, for instance \u2014 are rebadged Opels. Moreover, the loss figures claimed for Opel and Vauxhall in Europe don\u2019t account for the revenue generated by these vehicle designs worldwide when sold under G.M. nameplates.Walking out on Europe and its European workers may be a recipe for short-term profit, but in the long term it could sting. The nativist impulse to quit the world\u2019s third-largest car market may suit the mood in Washington. But as G.M. ought to know by now, it\u2019s easier fixing a brand than starting a new one.Jamie Lincoln Kitman, a lawyer, is the New York bureau chief for Automobile Magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Immigration Crackdown Is Great for Private Prison Stocks", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byStrategiesNightmarish as the last two months have been for immigrants threatened by detention or deportation, it has been a marvelous time for two companies that stand to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.The worse the news for immigrants and their lawyers, the better it has been for the two companies. When a member of the Trump administration issues a memo or executive order, gives a speech or tweets about the crackdown on immigrants, shares of the two companies rise: Since the election, CoreCivic\u2019s stock price has climbed 120 percent, and Geo\u2019s has gained 80 percent.Already in 2017, CoreCivic is up about 30 percent; Geo has gained about 20 percent. \u201cWe are strongly opposed to the Trump administration policies on immigration,\u201d said Carl Takei, staff lawyer for the A.C.L.U.\u2019s national prison project. \u201cBut those policies are great for these companies.\u201dInvestor expectations that the actual business of incarceration and detention will expand under Mr. Trump have fueled their levitating share prices. \u201cIt looks as though Geo and CoreCivic have several years of sharp growth ahead of them,\u201d said Michael Kodesch, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. \u201cBased on that, they still look undervalued.\u201dIn her August memo, Ms. Yates said the private prisons \u201ccompare poorly to our own bureau facilities\u201d on financial grounds, adding that they lagged in rehabilitative services like educational programs and job training. Ms. Yates also pointed out that the federal prison population had begun to decline, thanks to revised sentencing guidelines and other reforms.But in a terse refutation of the Obama administration, Mr. Sessions said the Yates memo had \u201cimpaired the bureau\u2019s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system. \u201cTherefore,\u201d he said, \u201cI direct the Bureau to return to its previous approach.\u201d That reversal helped bolster the prison stocks.\u201cThe deportation crackdown is doing very good things for these companies,\u201d said Terry Dwyer, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors. \u201cOn a personal level, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth, but I guess business is business.\u201dWhen the companies\u2019 executives reported earnings in February, it was too early for hard numbers on how the shifts in United States policy were affecting their companies\u2019 bottom lines, but their excitement was evident.What the country is seeing, he said, is \u201creally an escalation of capacity need for all three federal agencies as a result of the president\u2019s new executive orders.\u201d Geo, he said, is prepared to help meet those needs.Mr. Zoley spoke in detail about the probable impact of one change ordered by Mr. Trump, the end of the so-called catch-and-release program. Under that effort, as Mr. Zoley put it, \u201cAs people were caught illegally crossing the border, they were held very temporarily and just let go instead of being detained.\u201dMr. Zoley said the federal government had been conducting \u201ca national canvassing of the available capacity of the entire country to help assist ICE in this new, expanded, more aggressive border security program.\u201dThe beauty of this, for Geo, is that it could expand its business in three ways. Initially, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement will need more places to detain immigrants \u201cbecause the border patrol will catch the individuals and then send them to an ICE facility,\u201d Mr. Zoley said.But that\u2019s only part of the picture. \u201cSubsequently, there will be a need by the U.S. Marshal Services for those people that have committed criminal acts and need to be detained for adjudication,\u201d he added.And further down the line, Mr. Zoley said, the federal prisons will need to incarcerate \u201cthose people who have been sentenced and need to serve their time.\u201dGeo has room to detain roughly 5,000 additional people, said Mr. Kodesch, the Canaccord Genuity analyst. And if the company is able to fill that capacity, it will mean a hefty increase in its earnings.Both Geo and CoreCivic are real estate investment trusts, and Mr. Kodesch estimated that the detention surge could result in an increase in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of $50 million, or more than 12 percent. CoreCivic has about 8,700 \u201cidle beds,\u201d he said, and if it manages to fill them, it would mean an increase of $76 million in Ebitda, a gain of about 20 percent.Eventually, the companies could also build prisons and detention centers, Mr. Kodesch said.Mr. Takei of the A.C.L.U. pointed out that the president\u2019s various policies have a \u201ccountervailing impact\u201d on the companies. Apprehending more people increases the supply of detainees, while deporting them more rapidly reduces that supply. \u201cObviously, the A.C.L.U. will fight for these people\u2019s rights and make sure there is due process,\u201d he said. This could slow the pace of deportations and, ironically, help the companies.The prison companies are intimately tied to the government, and major setbacks for the Trump administration could derail them. For now, though, the market loves them.Advertisement"}

Certainly, there were analysts pointing out that it looked overvalued.Caterpillar, a manufacturer of heavy equipment, has been dogged by accusations that it slashed its domestic tax bill by shifting corporate profits from the United States to a subsidiary in Switzerland.A 2014 congressional investigation concluded that a scheme to move cash between the company\u2019s subsidiaries cut its United States tax bill by $2.4 billion over 13 years. A report from the investigation said that Caterpillar worked with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, now PwC, to use sham transactions to transfer $8 billion in profits to a Swiss subsidiary from 1999 to 2012.The transfers were not legitimate business transactions, but done solely to take advantage of a lower tax rate.The 2014 inquiry did not draw conclusions about whether Caterpillar had broken the law, but it appears to have piqued the interest of federal investigators. Caterpillar later received a grand jury subpoena for documents related to these transactions and it said Thursday that the search warrant was related to the investigation into its tax practices.Masayoshi Son, the billionaire technology entrepreneur who promised President Trump 50,000 new jobs in the United States, has grand plans for Sprint.The billionaire and his financial advisers are considering several possible major deals for Sprint, the struggling wireless operator that he controls through SoftBank.One possible deal is a tie-up with T-Mobile U.S., Sprint\u2019s closest competitor.

{"Headline": "Gripes About Obamacare Aside, Health Insurers Are in a Profit Spiral", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byStrategiesOver the last few years, big managed care companies like UnitedHealth Group have contributed to the furor over the fate of the Affordable Care Act by saying that important parts of it are fundamentally flawed.But Obamacare hasn\u2019t been a curse for the managed care companies. Over all, based on their share performance, it has been something of a blessing.Since March 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, the managed care companies within the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 UnitedHealth, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana and Centene \u2014 have risen far more than the overall stock index. This is no small matter: The stock market soared during that period.The numbers are astonishing. The Standard & Poor\u2019s stock index returned 135.6 percent in those seven years through Thursday, a performance that we may not see again in our lifetimes. But the managed care stocks, as a whole, have gained nearly 300 percent including dividends, according to calculations by Bespoke Investment Group.UnitedHealth, the biggest of the managed care companies, with a market capitalization that is now more than $160 billion, returned 480 percent, dividends included. An investment of $100 in the company\u2019s stock when Obamacare was signed into law would be worth more than $580.50 today.\u201cIf Obamacare has been bad for the managed care stocks, why have they performed so well under it?\u201d asked Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cAnd do they really need to be rescued by Congress?\u201dThe answers are complex but boil down to this: Basically, several analysts on Wall Street and in Washington said, the underlying businesses of the big managed care companies have actually done extremely well under Obamacare. They have run into some problems but are hardly in need of a rescue.The companies have notched profits \u2014 from expansion of Medicaid, for example, and from services aimed at cutting medical costs \u2014 while learning how to insulate themselves from parts of the law that have crimped their income. They have diversified, earning money from businesses that include data management, outpatient clinics and surgical services, as well as traditional health insurance.\u201cThe successful managed care companies, and UnitedHealth in particular, have figured out how to prosper in almost any environment \u2014 and to insulate themselves from issues that become a problem,\u201d said Gary Claxton, director of the health care marketplace project for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to health care policy. \u201cThey are making a lot of money from government programs like Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 and they are likely to keep doing so,\u201d he said, regardless of what happens in Washington.UnitedHealth, the industry bellwether, has reduced its exposure to what was its biggest problem in Obamacare: money-losing insurance that it sold in public exchanges to individuals, who often received government subsidies.With those kinds of problems, you might think that the stock market has looked with disfavor at UnitedHealth and its competitors, and that investors have been counting on Congress to repeal Obamacare and replace it within something more palatable for the insurers.But that assumption, which I made before looking at the performance of the companies\u2019 shares, couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.UnitedHealth has bolstered its position, first by abandoning those profit-sapping exchanges wholesale. That move may have troubled the stock market, because it may seem to suggest that the company was giving up on what had been an important growth opportunity.But a second maneuver, an accounting one, helped its standing in financial markets immensely, said Sheryl Skolnick, director of United States equity research for Mizuho Securities. In November 2015, UnitedHealth made an adjustment on its balance sheet, setting aside an initial \u201cpremium deficiency reserve\u201d of $200 million for expected losses in those marketplaces.Those losses have cumulatively swelled to more than $1 billion, Ms. Skolnick said, but because they have been segregated in the company\u2019s accounting, and because the company has been leaving those markets, investors have been able to easily assess the company\u2019s value \u201centirely separately from the problems it\u2019s had with the exchanges,\u201d she said. Other managed care companies have made similar provisions.Wall Street has rewarded companies like UnitedHealth for steadily increasing profits in other businesses, and generally hasn\u2019t penalized them much for the public exchange losses, Ms. Skolnick said.In Ms. Skolnick\u2019s view, the Affordable Care Act could indeed use some modifications, but the fundamental problem with the public exchanges is one of \u201cadverse selection,\u201d in which relatively sick people have occupied an outsize part of those markets, making it difficult for insurance companies to come up with profitable pricing. But the root cause is that the \u201cmandate,\u201d the requirement that everyone buy health insurance, is too weak, she said, not too strong. The House legislation would make matters worse by imposing a surcharge for people who have let their insurance lapse. \u201cI think that\u2019s weaker,\u201d she said.There are plenty of good things in Obamacare for these companies. The expansion of Medicaid has been a boon for them, said Lance Wilkes, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cIt\u2019s not a high-margin business for the managed care companies, but it\u2019s a steady one and it has been a growing one,\u201d he said. The companies offer insurance to low-income residents in various states under Medicaid, he said, while Medicare plans for older people have also been a growth area.Mr. Claxton of the Kaiser Family Foundation said, \u201cAs the baby boom population ages, people are leaving their workplace health care plans, which have been steady and profitable for the managed care companies but aren\u2019t growing, and going on Medicare in big numbers, and companies like UnitedHealth see this as an opportunity.\u201dThe Strategies column last Sunday,19 about how the stocks of managed care companies within the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index have fared since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, misstated, at one point, the surname of a director of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to health care policy. He is Gary Claxton, not Clarkson.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chinese-Backed Dam Project Leaves Myanmar in a Bind", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byAUNG MYIN THA, Myanmar \u2014 For six years, Daw Kaw Bu has waited to return to the village she was forced to leave to make way for a dam that has yet to be built.\u201cI pray to God to let me work on my own land again,\u201d she said on a recent afternoon, sitting outside the wood-shingled home in Aung Myin Tha, where she was resettled in early 2011.She may get her answer soon, when a government-appointed commission makes a recommendation on the fate of the $3.6 billion, Chinese-financed Myitsone Dam.The decision is a daunting test for Myanmar\u2019s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who risks angering China, the region\u2019s economic powerhouse, if she cancels the project, or the public if she lets it go forward.Analysts say the commission\u2019s report would provide her the political cover to kill an unpopular white elephant that she inherited from Myanmar\u2019s former military government.But getting out of the deal would be difficult. If her government cancels the project outright, it could have to repay some $800 million that the state-owned Chinese developer says it has already spent on the project.If Myanmar offers China other dam projects in return, a compromise her government has floated, they are likely to impinge on disputed ethnic areas where they could threaten the peace talks she has championed since her political party came to power last year.The Myitsone Dam is among the largest of many Chinese-financed energy and mining projects approved by the military junta that ruled Myanmar until 2011. It is especially contentious because it would be the first dam to cross the Irrawaddy River, the mythic cradle of civilization for Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Burman majority.But perhaps the most incendiary objection was that under the deal struck by the ruling generals, 90 percent of the dam\u2019s electricity could go to China. As protests spread to Myanmar\u2019s cities, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s revered pro-democracy leader at the time, spoke out against the dam.The decision, widely seen as a victory for the forces of democracy, shocked Chinese officials and businessmen. Many remain incredulous that the dam was delayed at all in a country that needs more electricity to power its fast-growing economy.Although the contract has never been publicly disclosed, details have leaked out over the years. A person who supports the dam and is familiar with the contract, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Myanmar was guaranteed 10 percent of the dam\u2019s electricity at no cost and could buy more on request.The government\u2019s 15 percent stake in the dam would earn it about $18 billion over a 50-year concession period, analysts and local news reports said.The Chinese developer owns the remaining 80 percent.One reason for that, experts say, is that there is no grid connecting the dam to Myanmar\u2019s major towns and cities.\u201cDoes Myanmar need electricity? Yes, for sure,\u201d said David Dapice, an economist at Harvard who has studied Myanmar\u2019s hydropower sector. \u201cDoes it need Myitsone? No. There are many other hydro sites that could be developed. And in the country\u2019s south, gas generation would be cheaper than transmitting hydro over long distances.\u201dCanceling the dam, however, would upset relations with China, Myanmar\u2019s biggest trading partner.Recognition is growing among Chinese officials and experts, analysts said, that the diplomatic and business strategies that worked well when Myanmar was ruled by generals are no longer viable.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned our lesson from focusing too much on the elites, and now we know that deals and agreements are not solid if they are not based on people-to-people relations,\u201d said Fan Hongwei, a Myanmar specialist at Xiamen University in China.Executives at the company declined a request for an interview. But in a written statement, Wang Qiyue, the project\u2019s general manager, said that the company would \u201clisten carefully and offer our practical advice\u201d to any new proposals from Myanmar officials.The dam would provide Myanmar \u201cits own cheap, renewable energy,\u201d he said, a better option than importing power or using more expensive or nonrenewable energy sources.Officials close to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi have said that negotiations were underway for Myanmar to pay China, or apply the money to other projects, if the dam is not built.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman, U Zaw Htay, said last year that as a compromise for not building the Myitsone Dam, she was prepared to offer the Chinese a series of smaller hydropower projects that are less of a threat to the environment.But Myanmar\u2019s best potential hydropower sites are all in conflict areas, said Tom Kramer, a researcher in Yangon at the Transnational Institute, a Dutch organization that studies ethnic issues in Myanmar. Approving new projects there, he said, could set off renewed fighting among the very armed groups that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is struggling to bring to the negotiating table as part of a fragile national peace dialogue.But whether the money is used to repay China or build alternative dams, it is not clear where Myanmar would come up with $800 million, a sum greater than its roughly $600 million health budget.On a recent afternoon near the site of the Myitsone Dam, there was no sign of Chinese workers or dam-building equipment. From the bank of the Irrawaddy, the only movement visible near the unfinished dam site was a slender fishing skiff that drifted lazily on the current.Residents of Aung Myin Tha, a nearby village where about 300 families were resettled, said it had some advantages, like the 16-bed hospital and roads built by the dam developer. But most families now have less farmland and diminished access to the Irrawaddy and traditional hunting grounds, and opposition to the dam remains strong.\u201cIf the Lady lets it happen, Kachin people will protest,\u201d said one villager, Daw Ja Khawn, using the popular moniker for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the whole country behind us, which will be easy because the whole country is already against it.\u201dDozens of families have taken matters into their own hands, moving back to their old villages, even though electricity was cut off there.\u201cI built my house to challenge the Chinese,\u201d said one, Daw Lu Ra, who was eating a freshly caught fish by candlelight at a restaurant overlooking the headwaters. \u201cEven if they told me to move again, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201dWai Moe contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.

{"Headline": "Trump Adviser Gary Cohn to Sell Stake in Chinese Bank Giant", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byThe White House economic adviser Gary D. Cohn is selling a significant holding in the world\u2019s largest bank \u2014 which happens to be in China \u2014 as he clears potential conflicts of interest to serve in his new role.The Chinese bank position appears to be the largest stock, private equity or hedge fund holding \u2014 apart from his shares in Goldman Sachs, where he was president \u2014 that Mr. Cohn will have to sell because of his new job. The timing of his initial purchase of the Industrial and Commercial Bank shares and of his planned sale are not clear.Neither Mr. Cohn, who is now the director of the National Economic Council advising President Trump, nor a White House spokeswoman responded to requests for comment. A Goldman spokesman referred questions to the White House.Mr. Cohn\u2019s holding in the Chinese bank are notable because the Trump administration has portrayed China as a threat to American economic growth.Richard W. Painter, who served as an ethics lawyer in the administration of President George W. Bush, said the sale of the Chinese bank shares made sense, given China\u2019s importance on the global economic stage.\u201cIf we get into a big spat with China, it is obviously going to have an effect on that bank economically,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cThere is no way you should be a senior adviser on economic or military policy, and have a big stake in a Chinese bank. That\u2019s an invitation for trouble.\u201dThe ethics documents issued to Mr. Cohn, known as certificates of divestiture, and a separate set issued to his wife, Lisa Pevaroff-Cohn, indicate that the couple will reinvest the proceeds of the Chinese bank stock sale and other asset sales into certain widely held assets, like Treasury bills or exchange-traded funds.The certificates of divestiture issued on March 8 are not a complete picture of Mr. Cohn\u2019s assets. They list only those that he and Ms. Pevaroff-Cohn will sell and then reinvest as a means of legally avoiding certain capital-gains taxes. Once the positions listed in the documents are liquidated, the couple will have 60 days to make the new investments.But the documents do provide a window into the assets that Mr. Cohn and his wife held at the end of his 26-year tenure at Goldman Sachs, from which he resigned in December.In addition to his stake in the Chinese bank, Mr. Cohn is selling roughly $216 million in Goldman stock, plus 18 other stocks, and plans to reinvest the proceeds.The other holdings include some major consumer brands, like the tobacco companies Philip Morris and Reynolds American, as well as the food company Kraft Heinz; and a passel of tech companies including Facebook, Twitter, Box, Intel, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Aside from Goldman, his holdings include only one other major United States bank, Bank of America. (Mr. Cohn is selling 9,174 Bank of America shares, valued at roughly $230,000.)Taken together, Mr. Cohn and Ms. Pevaroff-Cohn are selling small minority stakes in 11 private investment vehicles, including a group of Goldman Sachs-operated private equity funds, some of which were set up specifically for firm employees.Mr. Cohn\u2019s detailed ethics plan and personal financial disclosure statement, which would include further information about his income and assets, have not yet been made public.Mr. Cohn is not the only Goldman Sachs executive to invest in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. When he became Treasury secretary in 2006, the former Goldman chief executive Henry M. Paulson Jr. sold an individual position worth as much as $25 million in the bank, according to government documents issued at the time.Goldman itself held a sizable position in the Chinese bank for seven years, selling the last block of it to end the investment in 2013.Advertisement"}

She grunts and totters up to him, and they clack bills. He grabs a pebble, and they clack bills again; he drops the pebble and spears a twig. Clack, whistle, grunt, whistle. And suddenly, she backs away.Desperate, the male solemnly starts high-stepping again, displaying his beautiful teal-blue feet. But the courtship has fizzled, and when the female again lifts up a foot in response, it looks as if she\u2019s waving goodbye.It\u2019s dating time here for the blue-footed booby. Everywhere, dozens of times a day, the large, handsome seabirds are making their highly ritualized courtship display \u2014 one reason the boobies are among the most celebrated and beloved residents of this archipelago.They are also feeding voraciously and spectacularly, circling high over the water, alert for the slightest flicker of fish, and then freezing in midair for a fraction of a second before dropping headfirst onto their targets, like missiles falling from a plane.They squabble with one another over territory and nesting sites. They dodge parasitic frigate birds with red-balloon crops that pluck at the boobies\u2019 tails and try to force them to regurgitate freshly caught fish but mostly fail.On the Gal\u00e1pagos and on Isla Isabel, a Mexican national park south of the coast of Baja, blue-footed boobies have no real predators to fear or human hunters to shun, and as a result they live proud, public lives. That openness and accessibility, beyond captivating tourists, have proved a bonanza for scientists, too.Research teams from Mexico and the United States have followed populations of the long-lived birds for years, even decades, and they have gathered a wealth of insights into the deep nature of being Sula nebouxii: how boobies choose and lose mates, the shifting allure of fidelity versus adultery, the measured brutality of older siblings, the contingency of parental love and the reason behind the boobies\u2019 fetish for feet.\u201cThey\u2019re superfascinating animals and such a good research model,\u201d said David J. Anderson of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., who studies both the blue-footed booby and the related Nazca booby. \u201cThey let you move among them without minding too much. You try to do that with a continental bird or mammal \u2014 forget about it. But with these guys you see it all.\u201dNo matter how relentlessly the birds had been pecked at and bitten by older siblings, no matter how often food had been snatched from their beaks or how slowly they had grown, on reaching maturity the once-persecuted birds proved surprisingly confident, capable \u2014 unflappable. They were able to attract partners, repel rivals and raise families as successfully as their domineering peers.\u201cBullying in infancy does not make wimpy adults,\u201d Dr. S\u00e1nchez Macouzet said.And in new findings that will be published soon \u2014 and are enough to turn this working mother\u2019s feet cerulean \u2014 scientists have discovered that the key to a successful long-term booby partnership is the equitable sharing of nest duties year after year.Biparental care is the rule among boobies, but longtime mates have perfected the art of symmetry and turn-taking. They spend the same time brooding and feeding the young, and expend the same physical effort as seen in measures of blood cells and body mass.Such egalitarian couples, said Dr. S\u00e1nchez Macouzet, \u201chave reached the sweet spot of cooperation, compatibility and a willingness to avoid the exploitation of your partner.\u201dDr. Drummond and his colleagues have also identified another booby mating pattern that seems to work nearly as well as a stable long-term partnership and in some ways contradicts it: the May-December effect.For reasons that remain mysterious, Dr. Drummond said, booby couples in which one bird is young and the other old often have greater breeding success compared with pairs of the same age.\u201cThe advantage to the chicks was the same either way,\u201d Dr. Drummond said.\u201cLife is complicated,\u201d he added, \u201cand every year boobies are conjuring with several different variables when making their choice among partners.\u201dSomeone familiar? Someone new? Nonnegotiable: The feet must be blue.Blue-footed boobies are members of the family Sulidae, a group that includes about 10 species of gannets and boobies and is, by some analyses, part of the larger pelican order. The name booby is thought to come from bobo, the Spanish word for stupid or clown, a reference to the bird\u2019s awkward waddle.Blue-footed boobies can be found throughout the tropics and subtropics of the eastern Pacific. Though their overall population is not considered endangered, their numbers on the Gal\u00e1pagos have fallen since the 1990s, the result, scientists believe, of a local decline in the sardine stocks that the boobies need to breed.The birds are about the size of large sea gulls, with wingspans up to five feet. Adult females are about 20 percent to 30 percent heavier and stronger than males. Boobies stay close to home, and if given the chance, most will live and breed within a few dozen feet of where they were born.They often hunt small, schooling fish in flocks, each hitting the water at 60 miles per hour, its brain protected by specialized air sacs in the skull.In many birds, males are the fancy ones, their exaggerated, colorful features the result of generations of females\u2019 expressing their whimsical tastes in mates. Among blue-footed boobies, by contrast, males and females are both choosy about their partners, and one of the traits they fixate on is the relative blue-ness of a partner\u2019s feet.The optimal color, it turns out, is more of a turquoise.Analyzing the booby\u2019s blue feet, researchers have determined that the color is a result of both structural and pigmental components. The basic tone, a flat, purplish-blue, is set by an alignment of proteins stacked in the skin like spaghetti in a box that preferentially encage and emphasize blue light.But the birds\u2019 bodies modify that basic blue through diet, extracting bright yellow pigment from carotenoids in the fish they consume and concentrating it in their feet to create a dazzling aquamarine. Researchers have found that booby eyes are keenly sensitive to blue-green light, and for good reason: Foot tone turns out to be a revealing sign of health and hardiness.The calculus of daily life never stops. Boobies generally lay two eggs several days apart, and the older chick ends up with an enormous advantage over the second-born. In some booby species, like the Nazca, the difference is fatal.\u201cThe big one up and kills the little one, pushing it right out of the nest,\u201d Dr. Anderson said. The only hope for the second-born is if its sibling dies.Among blue-footed boobies, though, sibling violence is provisional. As long as the parents can regurgitate enough food for both, the older, bigger sibling tolerates the second hatchling.It will peck at the younger bird and demand chronic displays of submissive behavior, like facing away with its bill tucked down, but in good times it will let its sibling live.Should the body mass of the elder nestling decline to 80 percent of normal, however, \u201cit will increase the daily pecking of its sibling by 500 percent,\u201d Dr. Drummond said. The heightened abuse can be fatal.Just make it through your miserable childhood, beta booby, and you\u2019ll soon be high-stepping in style.Advertisement"}

Major investors like the pension fund behemoth known as Calpers have made it a part of their philosophy, even though the strategy has costs in lost investment opportunity. Last year, for example, Calpers re-endorsed its ban on tobacco stocks, though staff recommended the opposite.The concept has made its way to exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which have been popular with mom-and-pop investors because they are a low-cost, tax-efficient way to invest in a broad index \u2014 more often than not, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. As a category, exchange traded funds have ballooned in recent years, amassing $2.6 trillion. And the opportunity to create niche products seems to be boundless.\u201cThe minority are a success, and the majority are flops,\u201d said Ben Johnson, the director of E.T.F. research at Morningstar. \u201cIt\u2019s spaghetti slinging.\u201dThe new funds would hardly be the first religion-oriented investment products. An earlier group of funds tracking Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and, more generally, Christian, values came out in 2009 but folded in 2011 with just $2 million, Morningstar said.There are also the $790 million iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF and the $500 million iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF, which look for stocks of companies with good labor policies or sustainable and renewable products. There are also longstanding mutual funds, such as the $927 million Domini Impact Equity fund.The benefits off exchange traded fund investing \u2014 getting cheap exposure to a broad universe of stocks \u2014 can be diminished by eliminating companies based on subjective criteria. And academic studies have concluded that sin stocks perform better as a group than stocks of virtuous companies, at least before factoring in the extra risks to investing in companies that are frequent targets of litigation and boycotts.Greg Richey, who lectures on finance at California State University San Bernardino, developed a portfolio of 65 sin stocks and tracked them from 1996 to 2016, finding an average annual return of 11 percent.Once taking variables like litigation and boycott risk into account, the gains disappear, he said. Also, \u201cthe definition of vice keeps changing.\u201dPensions and other institutions are asking fund companies for ways to invest that avoid these risks, said Jay Jacobs, the director of research for Global X Funds, which has $4.5 billion under management.Last year, Global X introduced a fund that adheres to the values of the Roman Catholic Church, and it has taken in $87 million in assets, according to Morningstar. The idea came from conversations with clients that invest on behalf of Catholic groups and foundations, which follow the guidelines set out by the church, he said.This week, Inspire Investing, based in Hollister, Calif., introduced the two biblically responsible funds, a small- and medium-size company fund and a large-company fund called Inspire Global Hope Large Cap ETF.The large-company fund tracks an Inspire-created index of 400 companies it screened to match its investment criteria, which follow conservative Christian values, Mr. Netzly said.Shares of Berkshire Hathaway, whose chief executive, Warren E. Buffett, has been a major donor to Planned Parenthood, would not make the cut, he said. Nor would Apple, Mr. Netzly said, claiming that pornography can be purchased through iTunes.

It falls when investors think a growth-damaging \u201chard Brexit\u201d is more likely, and rises when they expect a more benign outcome.When the former occurs, the pound typically weakens and the domestically focused FTSE 250 index of midcap companies is apt to underperform the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies, which tend to be more global.Investors also tend to push up the cost of insuring against a British debt default relative to Germany, and compress the gap between the yields of two- and 10-year British government notes.As a result, the Breakingviews index fell sharply in the months after the referendum in June 2016, in which Britons voted to leave the European Union. The index has since clawed back some ground, though, not least because growth has proved far more resilient than most investors and policy makers expected.Yet the chances are that the gauge will fall in the months ahead.Mrs. May wants to clamp down on immigration from other countries in the European Union, but has so far been able to avoid tricky questions about what sort of trade restrictions others will want to impose. The economic price that Britain may pay will become increasingly clear now that negotiations can start.And even before any trade barriers are erected, growth could slow.

{"Headline": "A Physicist\u2019s Crash Course in Unpeeling the Universe", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Making theoretical physics accessible to the lay reader is no easy feat. The best popular science books welcome the novice while engaging and informing the more scientifically savvy. Compounding the author\u2019s challenge is the need to distinguish between speculation, ideas that might be verified in the future, and what is just fanciful thinking.In \u201cReality Is Not What It Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity,\u201d first published in Italy in 2014, the physicist Carlo Rovelli explains how he thinks about physics and his research on loop quantum gravity. He covers important ideas and developments, and readers with a basic curiosity about modern physics will find much to pique their interest. The book tours many of the crowd-pleasers of modern physics literature \u2014 quantum mechanics and general relativity, attempts at creating theories of quantum gravity and even time \u2014 as well as more speculative quantum gravity ideas. It is peppered with the usual names: Einstein, Newton, Plato, Aristotle, Democritus, Galileo, Dante and Lucretius.Rovelli explains that he wrote \u201cwith a particular reader in mind, someone who knows little or nothing about today\u2019s physics but is curious to find out what we know, as well as what we don\u2019t yet understand, about the elementary weave of the world \u2014 and where we are searching.\u201d This latest offering will attract readers to many important and relevant physics developments, some of which Rovelli presented in his earlier book, \u201cSeven Brief Lessons on Physics.\u201d He nicely conveys the magnificence of the changes in physicists\u2019 worldview that have emerged in the last century as well as ideas that motivate his more recent research.However, Rovelli takes on some challenging issues \u2014 and reality is not always the way that he sees it.The science as presented isn\u2019t always correct, and interpretations are misleadingly presented as facts. Explaining quantum mechanics, Rovelli says: \u201cElectrons don\u2019t always exist. They exist when they interact. They materialize in a place when they collide with something else. The \u2018quantum leaps\u2019 from one orbit to another constitute their way of being real: An electron is a combination of leaps from one interaction to another.\u201dStocks may not achieve a precise value until they are traded, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t approximate their worth until they change hands. Similarly electrons might not have definite properties, but they do exist. It\u2019s true that the electron doesn\u2019t exist as a classical object with definite position until the position is measured. But something was there \u2014 which physicists use a wave function to describe.At a time when people can disagree about the sizes of the crowds before their eyes, it should come as no surprise that they can disagree on scientific theories that are even harder to discern. But in today\u2019s toxic political climate, when deliberate ambiguity and \u201calternative facts\u201d stand in for knowledge, it\u2019s never been more important for scientists and academics to be accurate in their presentation of what we know. I admire Rovelli\u2019s goals, but they would be better served if he were more careful.\u201cReality Is Not What It Seems\u201d is \u201ca travel book,\u201d Rovelli writes, \u201cdescribing one of the most spectacular journeys that humanity has taken: a journey out of our limited and parochial views of reality, toward an increasingly vast understanding of things. A magical journey out of our common-sense view of things, far from complete.\u201d His many historical and philosophical digressions can be amusing, and anyone unfamiliar with the characters in the book will find much to enjoy here. Yet oversimplifications devalue these references too. It\u2019s a leap to say \u201cthe connection between problems posed by the scientists of antiquity and solutions found by Einstein and quantum gravity is, as we shall see, surprisingly close.\u201dWedging old ideas into new thinking is analogous to equating thousand-dollar couture adorned with beads and feathers and then marketed as \u201ctribal fashion\u201d to homespun clothing with true cultural and historical relevance. Ideas about relativity or gravity in ancient times weren\u2019t the same as Einstein\u2019s theory. Art (and science) are in the details. Either elementary matter is extended or it is not. The universe existed forever, or it had a beginning. Atoms of old aren\u2019t the atoms of today. Egg and flour are not a souffl\u00e9. Without the appropriate care, it all just collapses.Science provides a systematic method of building up from the measured and tested ideas and equations we agree on to realms that we don\u2019t yet understand because measurements are not yet sufficiently precise or are too far outside our limited perspective. If presented correctly, the scientific view of reality clarifies many of the spurious controversies we often encounter by separating what we know from what we are still trying to understand.The beauty of physics lies in its precise statements, and that is what is essential to convey. Many readers won\u2019t have the background required to distinguish fact from speculation. Words can turn equations into poetry, but elegant language shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of understanding. Rovelli isn\u2019t the first author guilty of such romanticizing, and I don\u2019t want to take him alone to task. But when deceptively fluid science writing permits misleading interpretations to seep in, I fear that the floodgates open to more dangerous misinformation.A great chef once told me that many of his most talented colleagues had at one point been smokers and, as a result, tend to use a bit too much salt. This turns out in any case to be what many palates prefer. \u201cReality Is Not What It Seems\u201d is a bit oversalted in an intellectual way. It isn\u2019t junk food. It\u2019s more akin to P.F. Chang\u2019s. Everything on the menu looks enticing and perhaps even a bit exotic, and the service and ambience are pretty good. But the end product, though tasty, isn\u2019t always as nourishing and sustaining as one might have hoped.Lisa Randall is a professor of theoretical particle physics at Harvard University and the author of \u201cDark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stocks are up 5 percent since the start of the year. And from the president on down, there\u2019s talk of a Trump bump.The only problem: The boom is apparent everywhere except in the economic data.It\u2019s not that the economy is stalling \u2014 far from it. But with the first quarter ending Friday, growth in the first three months of the Trump administration is looking much the way it did under President Barack Obama.In fact, experts see the gross domestic product in the quarter coming in at only about 1 percent, on an annualized basis \u2014 less than half the pace in the second half of 2016, and a far cry from President Trump\u2019s own 4 percent target.\u201cThere is a temporal disconnect,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere has been an incredible rise in sentiment, but the proof is in the pudding later.\u201dMs. Zentner expects growth of 1 percent this quarter, and considers recent data \u201csolid,\u201d but added that the big gap between expectations and reality \u201ccreates discomfort for economists and monetary policy makers.\u201d\u201cThe divergence is stunning,\u201d she added, drawing a distinction between \u201csoft data\u201d like consumer confidence and \u201chard data\u201d like retail sales.The pattern continued this week, when the Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence in March rose to its highest since December 2000. More hard data is expected Friday, when the Commerce Department releases new figures on personal income and spending in February.Wall Street, which surged in the months after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory on hopes of tax cuts and deregulation, is coming to grips with the fact that at least in the short term, the outlook remains restrained. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped on nine out of the last 10 trading days, the longest stretch of losses since 2011, albeit for a total decline of only 1.4 percent.One quarter is only a snapshot, and official government data on the gross domestic product for the period will not be out for another month. What is more, the American economy is expected to pick up some speed later in the year, especially if the White House and Congress can agree on a package of promised tax cuts and new infrastructure spending.Still, for all of 2017, the economy is expected to expand by roughly 2 percent, the rate of the recovery under Mr. Obama. The identical figures illustrate how much easier it is for a president to lift economic spirits, as opposed to actual growth rates.If tax reform and other legislation in Washington suffer the same fate as the bid to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s health care overhaul did last week, Ms. Zentner said, the Trump bump \u201ccould be built like a house of cards that comes crumbling down.\u201dPart of the problem is that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s Oval Office sessions with chief executives and the return of what the economist John Maynard Keynes termed \u201canimal spirits,\u201d corporate America is not investing heavily, at least so far, in new plants and equipment.At the same time, demand in many industries is growing only modestly, while a few sectors like retail chains are having to make painful adaptations to a rapidly evolving consumer landscape.Retail stores are top customers for Valdese Weavers, a century-old maker of high-end fabrics nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, but Michael Shelton isn\u2019t complaining.\u201cBusiness is better for us than it should be, because growth has been relatively flat for many of our customers,\u201d said Mr. Shelton, Valdese\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to find a few pockets of new business, so growth is in the low single digits. It\u2019s nothing robust but at least we\u2019re up for the year and we\u2019re happy about that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think politics or the election has affected our outlook,\u201d Mr. Shelton said. \u201cWhile many of our customers have seen a Trump bump in terms of their stock price, the industry hasn\u2019t seen an effect on retail traffic.\u201dOne additional factor holding back economic growth nationally \u2014 and in Burke County, N.C., where Valdese is based \u2014 is the proportion of Americans now in the labor force.Although unemployment in Burke County is half a percentage point higher than the national average, Mr. Shelton says finding workers with the technical skills Valdese needs is difficult.\u201cWe could train an undereducated person in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the textile industry has changed, and we need a higher level of competence in computers and math for specific skills.\u201d\u201cThe difference is larger than usual and is being driven by the fact that the New York Fed incorporates soft data into its tracking,\u201d said Ms. Zentner of Morgan Stanley.The government\u2019s estimate of gross domestic product is based on specific data points for economic factors like monthly retail sales, inventories, trade and other hard data, which also count more heavily in the Atlanta Fed\u2019s model.Whoever is right, most longer-term forecasts estimate growth for all of this year and 2018 to be in a range of 2 to 2.5 percent \u2014 again, largely in line with the pattern of the last eight years.\u201cSentiment has gotten stronger but business investment hasn\u2019t accelerated,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays. \u201cTo get it to translate to hard data, you\u2019d need new policies like tax cuts, tax reform, and a major increase in infrastructure spending.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life Agree to Merge", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byTwo big British financial firms, Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management, are joining forces, in a $4.7 billion deal that reflects the rising pressure on money managers that try to beat the markets.The deal would create a combined company with roughly 660 billion pounds of assets under administration at a time when investors are favoring low-cost index funds over portfolios that actively trade bonds and stocks. Actively focused firms like Aberdeen and Standard Life are facing increased competition from behemoths like the Vanguard Group and BlackRock that specialize in index funds.It often comes down to fees. Firms like Vanguard offer ultralow expenses on funds that try to match stock and bond benchmarks. Active managers typically charge more, with the goal of trying to beat the index, although they do not always live up to the promise.Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management said on Monday that they had agreed to an all-share deal to create Britain\u2019s largest asset manager, worth about $13.5 billion based on their stock market value. The transaction, in which Aberdeen investors would exchange their holdings for shares in Standard Life, valued Aberdeen at \u00a33.8 billion, or about $4.7 billion. Standard Life shareholders would own two-thirds of the combined company.The company has developed an expertise in emerging markets, but in recent years, investors have pulled back from that area. The company had \u00a310.5 billion in net outflows in its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December.Standard Life, which is based in Edinburgh, was founded in 1825 as a life insurance company and moved into dedicated asset management with the creation of Standard Life Investments in 1998. It has remade itself broadly as an investment company, buying asset managers and expanding internationally, while reducing the size of its insurance unit.Its biggest business is Standard Life Investments, followed by its pensions and savings business in Britain. Those two lines accounted for 95 percent of its operating profit last year.The combined company would be based in Scotland and use branding from both Standard Life and Aberdeen, the companies said. Standard Life\u2019s chairman, Gerry Grimstone, would serve as chairman of the combined company, while Simon Troughton, the Aberdeen chairman, would serve as deputy chairman. Mr. Skeoch and Mr. Gilbert would become co-chief executives of the combined company.The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Goldman Sachs and the law firm Slaughter and May are advising Standard Life. JPMorgan and Credit Suisse and the law firms Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Maclay Murray & Spens are advising Aberdeen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Briefly Tumble After Health Care Overhaul Falters", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byFor a time on Monday, one question appeared to haunt stock market investors from Tokyo to Manhattan: Will President Trump be able to live up to his promises to reduce taxes and cut regulation?Belief in such business-friendly, pro-growth measures has been driving a rally in stocks since the November election. But a weekend\u2019s worth of second-guessing over Washington\u2019s failure to move forward on health care legislation has injected some skepticism into the market.\u201cFriday\u2019s health care outcome was a reality check for investors,\u201d Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer at the Bessemer Trust, a $63 billion private investment company, said in an email.The market had seemed almost immune to political turmoil. For months, declines of 1 percent or more were unknown. Stocks sagged last week, however, amid signs of political obstacles to the replacement of the Affordable Care Act, and they opened sharply lower on Monday. The market recovered to end the day little changed.The health care legislation by itself had not been seen as of huge significance to the markets. But traders and longer-term investors said Monday that the bill\u2019s failure was worrisome. Corporate and individual tax changes, a $1 trillion infrastructure investment and other items on the Trump agenda that have goosed the markets may now prove illusory, they added.\u201cThe inability for him to pass health care reform casts doubt upon his ability to get large-scale tax reform passed,\u201d said Erin Browne, head of macro-investing for the O\u2019Connor hedge fund division of the Swiss bank UBS.Because the health care legislation was needed to help make tax cuts work within the current budget, the market is \u201cnow looking at either a much more modest tax reform or at tax cuts, which are certainly not going to be as economically beneficial,\u201d Ms. Browne said.Other markets suggested that many were unsettled by Mr. Trump\u2019s crash course in political science.The United States dollar, as measured by a Bloomberg index that tracks it against other major world currencies, fell to a level unseen since days after the president\u2019s upset victory in the election. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 which falls when more people buy the notes, often as they gravitate toward lower-risk investments \u2014 sank to its lowest levels in a month.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which fell as much as 1 percent on Monday, ended the day down just 0.1 percent. Since Election Day, the S.&P. 500 is up more than 9 percent.The narrower Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.2 percent lower for its first eight-session losing streak since 2011 and only the third such streak since 1990, the Bespoke Investment Group said.The Nasdaq composite index closed up 0.2 percent.Overseas markets were generally lower, with Tokyo down 1.4 percent and London off 0.6 percent.The truth, Ms. Patterson of Bessemer said in her email, is that \u201clegislation is a tricky, messy process.\u201dIn some corners of the market, that acknowledgment has had a particularly sobering effect. Certain sectors that had reached stratospheric levels of late on hopes of promised regulatory rollbacks and other propulsive policy measures are now tumbling to earth.Shares of Wall Street banks and other financial companies, which have benefited from Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to reconsider the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and are now down sharply since early March, are one example. Energy stocks, which have been harmed by the lack of detail on Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans and by falling oil prices, have also slid.One beneficiary of the failed health care bill? Hospital operators like HCA. Its shares surged more than 5 percent Monday.Some investors, of course, have simply decided to pocket the gains they have already earned in stocks. Others are liquidating positions to diminish their exposure to risk during a period many expect will remain volatile.Ms. Browne, for one, said she had sold out of certain positions in the last week and would keep the proceeds out of the markets for now.\u201cOver the shorter term, I\u2019m more cautious because I think the market needs to adjust to a potentially lower speed of the economy,\u201d she said.She added, however, that it was important not to overstate the meaning of the recent policy hiccups, saying, \u201cThe outlook over the medium to longer term is still quite strong.\u201dThe postelection rise in stock prices itself may have been the outlier event \u2014 not the recent retreat.Many traders have spent recent weeks watching for signs of market weakness, waiting for a trigger event that would cause an expected downturn of 1 to 2 percent. Some placed wagers in the market intended to pay off if stocks began a substantial slide. To them, the question was when, not if.Jason Ader, the chief executive and chief investment officer of the activist stock investment firm Spring Owl Asset Management, is taking the last week in stride.This pullback \u201cis warranted, healthy and normal,\u201d Mr. Ader said by email.\u201cIf the Trump administration\u2019s pro-business, pro-growth agenda hits a bump, the alternative isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d he added, given that the stock market has also been \u201cfavorably disposed\u201d at times of political gridlock as long as interest rates remain relatively low.Even with more interest rate increases expected this year, the cost of borrowing remains within a historically low range. Corporate earnings have been solid. Growth indicators in Asia and Europe, and in the United States, have been encouraging, all of which argues for continued optimism in the market.It may even be a good window in which to buy.\u201cAs long as the broader economic trends are intact, which we think they are, these sell-offs are usually a great opportunity for investors looking to put cash to work,\u201d Ms. Patterson said.An earlier version of a graphic with this article misstated the years represented. They are 2016 and 2017, not 2006 and 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-VW Chief Looks to Sell $1.2 Billion Stake, Creating Uncertainty", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byBADEN BADEN, Germany \u2014 Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, the scion of an automaking dynasty who dominated Volkswagen for two decades, is trying to sell his substantial indirect stake in the company to members of his extended family, which could create uncertainty in the aftermath of the carmaker\u2019s diesel deception.Mr. Pi\u00ebch, a former chief executive and supervisory board chairman at Volkswagen, was often a source of discord among the quarrelsome Pi\u00ebch and Porsche clans, which own more than 50 percent of Volkswagen\u2019s voting shares. His exit might make it easier for them to push through changes needed for Volkswagen to recover from an emissions deception that weighs heavily on the company.The tight control, through Porsche Automobil Holding, has led to criticism that the family has been too slow to make the changes in management and company culture that are needed to move beyond the scandal. Most of the rest of Volkswagen\u2019s shares are owned by the German state of Lower Saxony and the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, which tend to side with the family.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.But implicit in the disclosure on Friday was that Mr. Pi\u00ebch could sell his roughly 15 stake in the family holding company, valued at \u20ac1.1 billion ($1.2 billion), to an outsider if he could not agree on terms with his relatives. That could weaken the family\u2019s control of Volkswagen and create uncertainty about the company\u2019s direction.\u201cI expect that the family will not be able to raise the purchase price and that outside investors \u2014 for example from China \u2014 would come in,\u201d Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said in an email. \u201cThe Chinese would not pass up such a chance.\u201dWolfgang Porsche, a spokesman for Porsche family members, has told the German news media that the relatives would be willing to buy the stake. And even if they were unable to, he said in comments confirmed Friday by a spokesman for Porsche Automobil Holding, the family would not have a problem with a new outside shareholder.Word that Mr. Pi\u00ebch may sell his stake comes after a tumultuous week for Volkswagen that showed how much the emissions scandal continues to damage the company\u2019s reputation.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.During his long career at Volkswagen, Mr. Pi\u00ebch, 79, is credited with turning the Audi division into a luxury brand and rescuing Volkswagen from near bankruptcy in the early 1990s.A grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, the automotive pioneer who designed the Volkswagen Beetle, Mr. Pi\u00ebch was himself a formidable engineer and an iron-willed manager. After becoming chief executive of Volkswagen in 2003, he improved the quality and design of Volkswagen vehicles and made the company the largest carmaker in Europe by far.Since then, he has kept a low public profile. And despite remaining a major shareholder, he has had no discernible influence over management.An article on March 18 about a plan by Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, a former chief executive and supervisory board chairman at Volkswagen, to sell Volkswagen stock referred imprecisely to his ownership of those shares. It is an indirect stake, through a holding company that owns company shares, not a direct stake. The imprecision was repeated in a headline.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Caution Signals Are Blinking for the Trump Bull Market", "Date": "2017-03-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewDespite an eight-day losing streak that ended on Tuesday, the stock market has generally been buoyant in the opening weeks of the Trump administration. The bullish mood could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and lead to continuing gains for a while.Yet important measurements \u2014 some of which I developed \u2014 tell us that the market is quite expensive and that investor optimism is tinged with plenty of worry. None of this tells us where the market is going tomorrow, but it suggests that some caution is advisable, and that returns over the next decade or so are likely to be constrained.Consider first the evidence from what is often called the Shiller CAPE ratio.We found back then that averaging earnings over 10 years smoothed short-run or cyclical fluctuations, providing a better indicator of fundamental value. The CAPE ratio has successfully explained about a third of the variation in real 10-year stock market returns in United States history since 1881.This is the important point: In 1988, we found that CAPE had averaged about 15 since 1881. In years when CAPE was lower than that, subsequent 10-year returns for the stock market tended to be good. In years when it was higher, the 10-year returns tended to be bad.That\u2019s why today\u2019s CAPE is sending a troubling message. The ratio is now almost 30. Using monthly data, it has been higher only in 1929, when it reached 33, and in the few years around 2000, when it reached 44. In both instances, sharp market declines followed those very high readings. The current level of CAPE suggests a dim outlook for the American stock market over the next 10 years or so, but it does not tell us for sure nor does it say when to expect a decline. As I said, CAPE is useful, but it does not provide a clear guide to the future.Investor sentiment is another factor, and current readings also give us cause for concern.Valuation confidence in February was quite low. The only time it has been lower was in the years surrounding the market peak of 2000. In February, crash confidence was quite low too, though it has been slightly lower on a number of occasions since 1989. These two indicators might seem to confirm the apparent signal of the CAPE ratio: trouble ahead. They are certainly saying that investors aren\u2019t confident that current prices are reasonable or that the market is stable.But one metric went the opposite direction. One-year confidence is at a record high for institutional investors, and it is at the highest level since 2007 for individual investors. (That means, by the way, that in 2007, the eve of the Great Recession and financial crisis, most people had no clue that big problems were imminent.)It is hard to reconcile these results. One possible interpretation might be that respondents perceive a stock market bubble: They think valuations are high and there is a non-negligible probability of a crash. At the same time, they are hanging in because they think the Trump boom will probably last for at least another year.That doesn\u2019t provide much reassurance. The high fraction of our survey respondents who think that the stock market is unlikely to fall in the next year may simply reflect a failure of imagination about how a Trump bull market could suddenly end. There are scores of ways, of course. Just because people can\u2019t picture a big decline doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t react very badly if the market comes under real stress.Many people appear to believe that a business-oriented president will preside over a long stock market boom. At a glance, there appears to be some precedent for this, first with the 1920 election that brought in President Warren G. Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge (who took over when Harding died in 1923) and then with the 1980 victory of Ronald Reagan. These elections were followed by the Roaring Twenties of 1921 to 1929 and the Millennium Boom market of 1982 to 2000.But in both cases, during the initial election campaigns the economy was in recession and the CAPE ratio was extremely low \u2014 around 5 in 1920 and 9 in 1980.We are in a very different situation now. The economy has largely recovered from the last recession, and CAPE shows us that stocks are now relatively expensive.There is no clear message from all of this. Long-term investors shouldn\u2019t be alarmed and shouldn\u2019t avoid stocks altogether. But my bottom line is that the high pricing of the market \u2014 and the public perception that the market is indeed highly priced \u2014 are the most important factors for the current market outlook. And those factors are negative.We don\u2019t know where the market will go this month or this year. It could well rise a lot. But investors should not let themselves be tempted to bet aggressively on the Trump bull market.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Billionaire Investor Raises Stake in Tronc, and Feud With Its Chairman", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire doctor in Los Angeles, invested $70.5 million last May in what was then Tribune Publishing, the deal was viewed as not just an alliance between him and Michael W. Ferro Jr., the company\u2019s new chairman, but a commitment to journalism itself.Mr. Ferro and Tribune were trying to fend off a takeover by the Gannett Company, and Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s investment provided Tribune with some muscle. For Dr. Soon-Shiong, who grew up in apartheid South Africa, the move was also intended to help preserve a free press.\u201cI believe it is critical to our democracy and to our way of life that we have a strong, vibrant media and that it continues to function as the fourth estate,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.But the relationship between Mr. Ferro and Dr. Soon-Shiong soon deteriorated.As a public battle brewed between Gannett and Tribune, now called Tronc, Dr. Soon-Shiong became alarmed by Mr. Ferro\u2019s lavish spending, particularly for the use of a private plane, and his crass language, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Gannett abandoned its effort to buy Tronc for $18.75 a share in November.Since then, the clash between Mr. Ferro and Dr. Soon-Shiong has intensified.This month, Tronc removed Dr. Soon-Shiong from the slate of directors that shareholders will vote on at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April, meaning he will no longer serve on its board. Both men have also raced to increase their stakes in Tronc, which owns some of the country\u2019s most prominent papers, including The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune.This week, Dr. Soon-Shiong revealed in regulatory filings that he had increased his stake to 24 percent, nearly as much as Mr. Ferro\u2019s 24.8 percent stake, after buying 950,000 shares from the investment firm Oaktree Capital, a major Tronc shareholder.On Thursday, Tronc said it had agreed to purchase Oaktree\u2019s remaining 3.75 million shares in the company at a price of $15 a share, according to regulatory filings. Should Tronc sell itself within a year for more than $15 a share, the company would owe Oaktree the difference. (When Mr. Ferro, a brash Chicago entrepreneur, took a $44 million stake in Tronc last year, he paid $8.50 a share.)As part of the regulatory filing, Tronc also said it was increasing the cap on the stake that Mr. Ferro can acquire, from 25 percent to 30 percent. Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s cap remains at 25 percent.In a statement, a spokesman for Dr. Soon-Shiong said his client \u201cwas surprised to learn\u201d that Tronc was allowing Mr. Ferro to increase his stake beyond 25 percent. The spokesman added that Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s lawyers intended to \u201crequest his contract also be amended to allow his stake to also be increased to 30 percent from 25 percent.\u201dDr. Soon-Shiong was not aware of Tronc\u2019s purchase agreement with Oaktree, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.Tronc and Oaktree declined to comment.The purchase of Oaktree\u2019s stake, and Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s quick response, are only the latest salvos in the escalating feud between Mr. Ferro and Dr. Soon-Shiong. Dr. Soon-Shiong believes he is being removed from Tronc\u2019s board because he had become a thorn in Mr. Ferro\u2019s side, according to the two people, who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.Dr. Soon-Shiong had expressed concern at board meetings about how much Mr. Ferro was spending on the use of a private plane \u2014 according to a regulatory filing, Tronc spent $2.7 million to sublease an aircraft from Merrick Ventures, Mr. Ferro\u2019s investment firm \u2014 at the same time the company was laying off employees and talking about budget restrictions.Dr. Soon-Shiong was also angered by Tronc\u2019s purchase of nearly $250,000 in tickets for the Chicago Bulls, the Chicago Blackhawks and the Chicago Bears from Merrick, the two people said. He was given the wrong dial-in numbers for board meetings on occasion, one person said, and some meetings were scheduled at inconvenient times and when he was in South Africa.It is not clear what Dr. Soon-Shiong\u2019s long-term intentions are with Tronc \u2014 whether he intends to mount a bid for the entire company or wait to nominate a new slate of directors.Advertisement"}

Shares opened at $24 on Thursday and closed at $24.48, a 44 percent jump from the offering price the company had set.But industry analysts grew leery of the slowing user growth the app experienced last year.The initial public offering of Snap, which is based in Los Angeles, was the most eagerly awaited arrival since Twitter entered the market in 2013.In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said its app had 158 million daily users in its fourth quarter, up 48 percent from the prior-year period. But Wall Street has become skittish about future growth.The app\u2019s rate of user growth slowed during 2016, with just five million new users in the final quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the app had added 13 million.Snap blamed the slowing growth late in the year on technical problems, saying the launch of several products and the release of multiple updates had hurt the performance of its app.Social media companies have had mixed success since their initial public offerings. Where Facebook has soared, Twitter has struggled to find its way.Facebook, which debuted on Wall Street in 2012, has had its ad revenue and its user base grow quickly. Twitter, which had its initial public offering in 2013, has experienced stalling revenue growth, and since the return of its co-founder Jack Dorsey, the company has cut costs and shuffled its leadership.Twitter is now valued at $11 billion while Facebook is valued at $395 billion.Snap, upon its public offering, became more valuable than stalwarts like American Airlines, Macy\u2019s and Xerox.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valeant Bet Was a \u2018Huge Mistake,\u2019 Hedge Fund Chief Ackman Says", "Date": "2017-03-29", "News": "Supported byIt is rare that William A. Ackman, the brash activist investor, apologizes for anything. As a successful hedge fund manager, Mr. Ackman has made billions of dollars for himself and his investors with bold and counterintuitive bets.\u201cI deeply and profoundly apologize,\u201d Mr. Ackman added in an annual letter to investors.In May 2015, he said Valeant\u2019s acquisition strategy, which it was pursuing with Pershing Square\u2019s financial support, resembled \u201ca very early-stage Berkshire,\u201d referring to Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett. And late last year, he even held a four-hour marathon conference call to defend the company, taking swipes at the news media and those on Wall Street who he said relished \u201cbetting against him.\u201dBut the investment in Valeant ultimately led Pershing Square to double-digit percentage losses for two years in a row. After reaching a high of $257 a share in mid-2015, Valeant\u2019s share price plunged to $12.11 a share on March 13. That was the day when Mr. Ackman finally decided to throw in the towel and sell his firm\u2019s entire stake in Valeant, resulting in a $4 billion loss.In his annual letter to investors, released on Tuesday evening, Mr. Ackman took the blame for the bad bet, acknowledging that the investment had \u201cdamaged the record of success of our firm.\u201d\u201cMy approach to mistakes is that I personally assume 100 percent of the responsibility on behalf of the firm while sharing the credit for our success,\u201d he added.\u201cIn retrospect, we misjudged the prior management team, and this contributed to our loss,\u201d he said.In a separate letter, the board of Pershing Square Holdings, a publicly traded version of Mr. Ackman\u2019s hedge fund, reaffirmed its support for Mr. Ackman.\u201cThe lessons learned from the investment have been discussed at length in prior communications,\u201d Anne Farlow, the board\u2019s chairwoman, wrote in the letter.The board said it undertook a formal review of Mr. Ackman\u2019s performance last year, examining in particular his investment processes with regard to Valeant. In the end, Ms. Farlow said, the board concluded that it was in the best interest of the firm for Mr. Ackman to remain in charge of investments.It was not so long ago that Valeant was one of the favorite stocks among hedge fund managers. Mr. Ackman began buying shares in 2015 and has told investors that he bought the stock at an average price of $196 a share. Around the same time, Valeant began to draw scrutiny for its unusual accounting practices, and it quickly became a political lightning rod for its aggressive drug pricing policy.But Mr. Ackman stood by the company, joining Valeant\u2019s board together with another Pershing Square executive. They recruited 10 new directors, refinanced some of the company\u2019s $30 billion in debt and installed a new chief executive, Joseph C. Papa.None of this was enough to stop the company\u2019s unraveling. By the end of last year, Pershing\u2019s stake in Valeant had lost 19.2 percent of its value, contributing to the firm\u2019s overall loss of 13.5 percent for 2016. In 2015, Pershing Square Holdings lost investors 20.5 percent.In a concession for the poor performance, Mr. Ackman recently offered investors a new fee structure that would allow them to recover some of their losses before paying new performance fees. Like most other hedge funds, Pershing has charged investors 2 percent of overall assets under management for administration and 20 percent of any gain.Mr. Ackman struck a more positive tone for the year ahead, pointing to new opportunities and saying, \u201cWe are well positioned for a strong recovery.\u201d The firm sold its holdings in Canadian Pacific Railway and Zoetis, the former animal health care arm of Pfizer, last year, freeing capital to make new investments.And Ms. Farlow added that Pershing recently applied to move its public listing to London from Amsterdam, which would open the door to more investors if it were added to London\u2019s main stock index.Pershing Square Holdings was down 2.5 percent for the year as of Tuesday.An earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of overall assets under management that Pershing charges investors. It is 1.5 percent, not 2 percent.Advertisement"}

He was 79.His death, after a long illness, was confirmed by Mark Elieff, his stepson.\u201cHe started broadcasting the stock market at a time when you had to wait until the next morning to get a stock price unless you were a broker, and stock prices were reported in fractions, not decimals,\u201d said Tom Hudson, who became the program\u2019s anchor after Mr. Kangas retired in 2009.\u201cNightly Business Report,\u201d which eventually spread to 250 public television stations, was at one point the most-watched evening business news program in the country.

One day in 1998, when the show was being taped in Philadelphia, Ms. O\u2019Bryon recalled, Mr. Kangas sneaked out of the studio to play golf. As he was waiting at the tee, she said, a man came up to tell him that he recognized him from his TV reports. It was former President George H. W.

{"Headline": "Investor Carl Icahn Dragged Into Gambler\u2019s Insider Trading Trial", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byCarl Icahn, a billionaire investor and an unpaid adviser to President Trump, has been pulled into a high-profile insider trading trial taking place in federal court in Manhattan.Now prosecutors are pressing the judge to permit new evidence of potentially improper trading in shares of Clorox by Mr. Walters. The prosecutors allege that Mr. Walters could have made profitable trades in Clorox stock in 2011 based on tips he might have received from Mr. Icahn, his friend.Mr. Walters is on trial in federal court in one of the biggest criminal insider trading cases in years. He has been charged with pocketing profits and avoiding losses of more than $40 million in shares of Dean Foods. He stands accused of securing inside information from Thomas C. Davis, then the chairman of Dean Foods, who is now a key cooperating witness in the case.Mr. Walters, known as Billy, has denied any wrongdoing. He has faced charges on four other occasions that were mainly related to his sports gambling business, but he has never been convicted.Mr. Icahn, 81, has not been charged with any wrongdoing in the case, and prosecutors are seeking to admit the additional evidence solely to strengthen their case against Mr. Walters and undermine his defense.But Mr. Icahn\u2019s involvement in the trial \u2014 if by name only \u2014 has added additional drama to the proceedings.A cantankerous and outspoken investor, Mr. Icahn has long made headlines for his investing style, one that involves aggressively attacking the chiefs of some of the biggest companies in the United States.In a filing to Judge P. Kevin Castel on Friday, federal prosecutors said Mr. Walters had opened the door to new evidence when his lawyer, Barry Berke, told jurors that it was not uncommon for Mr. Walters to make \u201cbig bets\u201d of \u201ctens of millions of dollars at a time.\u201dProsecutors pointed to Mr. Walters\u2019s trading in Clorox shares in 2011, which had been previously reported. Federal authorities had also sought to introduce evidence of trading by Mr. Walters in shares of Apple in the summer and fall of 2013, which had not been previously reported, but they backed away from that during the hearing on Monday afternoon before Judge Castel.Judge Castel considered arguments from both sides as he deliberated whether to allow the jury to learn about the Clorox trades.\u201cTell me what you have here,\u201d the judge said. \u201cWhat are you going to show that it is more than smoke?\u201dThe prosecutors argued that introducing the Clorox trades would demonstrate a pattern of suspect trading by Mr. Walters.\u201cWe would like the jury to know that getting this sort of an edge, he has done it in other stocks as well,\u201d said Michael Ferrara, one of the prosecutors. \u201cWe\u2019d like to say there\u2019s some other suspicious trading as well.\u201dJudge Castel did not rule on the matter on Monday.Over the weekend, Mr. Berke filed a response saying the government\u2019s assertion was \u201cpure speculation\u201d and adding that prosecutors were seeking \u201cto have the jury draw legal conclusions that are simply wrong.\u201dWith regard to Mr. Walters\u2019s trading in Apple stock, Mr. Berke said the government was trying to implicate his client by revealing that he spoke to Mr. Icahn \u201cshortly before Mr. Icahn tweeted about his investment in Apple stock in August 2013.\u201dMr. Berke denied that there had been any such conversation, adding that even if the two had spoken ahead of Mr. Icahn\u2019s announcement, \u201cthere is no basis to suggest that would violate securities laws.\u201dInsider trading violations often turn on whether the person passing on a tip has breached a fiduciary duty. In the case of Mr. Icahn, it is not clear whether he breached any such duty.Jonathan Streeter, a lawyer for Mr. Icahn and a partner at Dechert, said in an emailed statement that Mr. Icahn \u201chas never done anything improper with respect to Clorox, Apple or any other stock.\u201dThis is not the first time that Mr. Icahn has been mentioned in this case.During jury selection, Mr. Icahn\u2019s name was on a list of people who could come up during the trial as a witness or as a person discussed during testimony.Mr. Icahn, who is not expected to testify, also came up briefly last week during direct testimony from Mr. Davis, who has pleaded guilty to supplying stock tips to Mr. Walters and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.A prosecutor asked Mr. Davis during his testimony whether Mr. Walters had ever made stock recommendations to him. Mr. Davis said that on one occasion, Mr. Walters had suggested a stock that Mr. Icahn \u201chad taken a position in,\u201d telling him, \u201cYou should think about buying it.\u201dMr. Davis added that Mr. Walters had said that Mr. Icahn was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about the stock, which was not named. Mr. Davis said he understood from Mr. Walters that he had a familiar relationship with Mr. Icahn, whom he referred to as \u201cmy friend in New York.\u201dColin Moynihan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Dearth of I.P.O.s, but It\u2019s Not the Fault of Red Tape", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe confirmation hearing last week for Jay Clayton, who has been nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, focused on the continued sluggishness of the market for initial public offerings. Senators pushed the nominee to do something, anything, to revive it.The problem is that there is no magic wand \u2014 including deregulation \u2014 that can fix the decline.The problems were recently documented in a research note by Credit Suisse titled \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks.\u201d The bank documented that the total number of companies listed on the United States stock market plummeted by nearly half, to 3,671 last year from 7,322 in 1996.Such shrinkage has prompted hand-wringing for over a decade. At Mr. Clayton\u2019s hearing, at least five senators brought it up, pointing to the regulatory burdens on companies going public.There\u2019s only one problem with casting regulation as the villain: There\u2019s not much evidence for it.Moreover, the JOBS Act has done nothing to revive the market for small companies, those with a market capitalization of under $75 million. They still number less than a handful each year.And while fingers get pointed at regulation like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the number of initial public offerings fell off the cliff in 1996 \u2014 years before either bill was passed. So there must be something more here.Those who have examined this issue have come up with a number of possible reasons.The Credit Suisse paper also brings up this theory, noting that mergers are the major cause for companies to be delisted from a stock exchange. It appears that this deal activity has spread to the private markets, co-opting the process of taking companies public.For example, Cisco Systems purchased AppDynamics on the eve of its market debut. And acquirers seem willing to pay top dollar in these instances, as research and development by many large corporations now consists largely of acquiring smaller, usually private, companies.This is aptly illustrated by the buying sprees of Google and Facebook, which took candidates to go public \u2014 like Instagram, Nest, Waze and WhatsApp \u2014 out of contention.In 1996, average proceeds for an initial public offering were $85.7 million, and 54 percent of these offerings were considered small, with a market capitalization below $75 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 2014, however, average proceeds were $186.4 million and only 4 percent of offerings were small.The market for new issues has moved toward liquidity and bigger stocks. Mutual funds prefer making big investments rather than small ones for liquidity and administrative purposes \u2014 lots of small investments simply require more people and more monitoring.A third possibility is that companies simply no longer need the public market. The private markets are more efficient, and financing is readily available from venture capitalists and banks.There are even markets and mechanisms that exist not only to allow for financing, but to allow for selling employees\u2019 and founders\u2019 shares in private markets. In addition, the JOBS Act allowed companies to expand the number of shareholders and still be private, a change that encouraged companies to remain private.There are other theories. One of these notes that the 1990s saw a surge in I.P.O. activity and that we are just back to what the activity was in the 1970s and \u201980s. Who is to say what is a normal market?Another possible reason is that companies are shying away from the public markets to avoid shareholder activism, short-termism and the glare of public scrutiny.Yet the growing use of dual class shares and staggered boards by new companies, measures that help founders retain control, argues against this need. And they are tools that can be used by any company \u2014 even Shake Shack went public with dual-class stock.The bottom line is that while there might be rational reasons to reduce regulation on capital raising \u2014 to make it easier and less expensive \u2014 we are kidding ourselves if we think that simply deregulating will bring back initial public offerings.The task is much harder. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, could help build an infrastructure for buying small company offerings. Allowing mutual funds more latitude to buy illiquid small investments and to change their compensation structures if they do would be a big step.Then there is the argument that maybe we shouldn\u2019t do anything, given how hard it will be. The idea behind the public markets is to provide capital funding. But if the private markets are now efficient and capable of providing even less expensive capital at lower cost, maybe we should be fine with the current state of affairs.Still, that overlooks the fact that for most of us, our retirement money is in the public markets. We should be worried about all of this money flowing into a smaller and smaller group of companies.One answer is to allow mutual funds to invest more in private companies. Already 26 mutual fund groups had $11.5 billion invested in late-stage companies in 2016, according to Credit Suisse.That\u2019s one answer, but that will result in yet more intermediaries. The better solution is to push more companies to the public markets. Deregulating is one thing, but the real work will require more innovative thinking from market regulators. That\u2019s your homework, Mr. Clayton.On a personal note, I\u2019ve been writing the Deal Professor column for DealBook for over nine years now, and this will be my last column before I take an extended sabbatical to work on other projects.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"Headline": "At BlackRock, Machines Are Rising Over Managers to Pick Stocks", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "Supported byScore one for the machines.The largest fund company in the world, BlackRock, has faced a thorny challenge since it acquired the exchange-traded-fund business from Barclays in 2009.These low cost, computer-driven funds have exploded in growth, leaving in the dust the stock pickers who had spurred an earlier expansion for the firm. The rise of passive investing \u2014 exchange-traded funds, index funds and the like \u2014 has revolutionized the investment world, providing Main Street investors with greater opportunities at lower fees while putting pressure on even Wall Street\u2019s biggest money managers.Now, after years of deliberations, Laurence D. Fink, a founder and chief executive of BlackRock, has cast his lot with the machines.On Tuesday, BlackRock laid out an ambitious plan to consolidate a large number of actively managed mutual funds with peers that rely more on algorithms and models to pick stocks.The initiative is the most explicit action by a major fund management firm in reaction to the exodus of investors from actively managed stock funds to cheaper funds that track every variety of index and investment theme.Some $30 billion in assets (about 11 percent of active equity funds) will be targeted, with $6 billion rebranded BlackRock Advantage funds. These funds focus on quantitative and other strategies that adopt a more rules-based approach to investing.\u201cThe democratization of information has made it much harder for active management,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview. \u201cWe have to change the ecosystem \u2014 that means relying more on big data, artificial intelligence, factors and models within quant and traditional investment strategies.\u201dAs part of the restructuring, seven of BlackRock\u2019s 53 stock pickers are expected to step down from their funds. Several of the money managers will stay on as advisers. At least 36 employees connected to the funds are leaving the firm.While BlackRock is proceeding gradually, in many ways the new plan is a direct attack on the cult of the brainy mutual fund manager, popularized in the 1980s and 1990s by Peter Lynch, a stock-picking wizard at the fund giant Fidelity.Today, asset managers like Pimco, Franklin Templeton, Aberdeen and, of course, Fidelity continue to make the case that their bond and equity managers can outsmart the broader market \u2014 and charge a premium price for doing so.Since 2009, however, as the performance of these funds has suffered, millions of investors have rejected this proposition, abandoning their expensive mutual funds for better-performing funds that track various indexes at a fraction of the cost.Now the biggest fund companies are Vanguard, the indexing pioneer, and BlackRock, which together oversee close to $10 trillion in assets.BlackRock, with its fleet of iShares E.T.F.s, has certainly benefited from the investor revolution \u2014 one that threatens to disrupt the mutual fund industry in the years ahead.Still, the monster in the mutual fund room by far has been Vanguard, which, via index funds and exchange-traded funds, has had historic inflows.Last year, for example, $423 billion left actively managed stock funds and $390 billion poured into index funds, according to Morningstar. Of that amount, Vanguard captured $277 billion, nearly tripling the amount that went to its nearest rival, BlackRock.Mr. Fink has always professed to be agnostic as to whether a client bought a no-frills exchange-traded fund tracking low volatility stocks or an expensive mutual fund investing in small United States companies.Let the client choose has long been his mantra.Left unsaid has been the reality that at his root Mr. Fink is now a true believer in systematic investing styles that favor algorithms, science and data-reliant models over the stock picking smarts of individual portfolio managers.And since last year, BlackRock\u2019s dyed-in-the-wool stock pickers have worked in the same division as its quants. These managers, many of whom have Ph.D.s, might buy (or sell) Walmart\u2019s stock on the basis of a satellite feed that reveals how many cars are in its parking lots as opposed to an insight gleaned from the innards of the retailer\u2019s balance sheet.Just about any interview or conference call with Mr. Fink bears this out: Invariably, the conversation comes around to technology, with scant mention of what the firm\u2019s stock pickers are doing.But simply going all-in on machine-driven passive investing over active has not been an option for Mr. Fink. While the assets of the firm\u2019s actively managed stock funds have shrunk to $201 billion today from $208 billion in 2009, the business is still very profitable for BlackRock, representing 16 percent of total revenue.According to data from Morningstar, only 11 percent of BlackRock\u2019s actively managed equity funds have beaten their benchmarks since 2009. Since 2012, $27.5 billion has left BlackRock actively managed mutual funds, per Morningstar data.The new push, which is being overseen by Mark Wiseman, a top executive at Canada\u2019s top pension fund whom Mr. Fink hired last year to revamp his equity business, highlights strategies in which a portfolio manager makes big bets on a select group of stocks.Still, there is no mistaking the larger message: Expensive, actively managed funds looking to make a mark picking United States stocks must adapt to the new realities at BlackRock.Take BlackRock\u2019s Large Cap Core fund, which invests in big American companies. Since 2009, the fund\u2019s assets have halved, to $1.5 billion, trailing the index by 1.3 percent over the last three years.The fund\u2019s lead manager will be replaced by three portfolio experts from BlackRock\u2019s quantitative investing team, where all varieties of computer models are crunched in pursuit of stock picking ideas. Fees will also be halved.Of course, none of these moves are likely to immediately halt the outflows of the past years. In fact outflows are likely to increase, as few investors want to stick with a fund undergoing an existential makeover.But as Mr. Fink and his new equity deputy see it, it is better to take the pain now than later.\u201cThe old way of people sitting in a room picking stocks, thinking they are smarter than the next guy \u2014 that does not work anymore,\u201d Mr. Wiseman said. \u201cThese are stormy seas for active managers, but we at BlackRock are an aircraft carrier, and we are going to chart our way through these seas.\u201dAdvertisement"}
