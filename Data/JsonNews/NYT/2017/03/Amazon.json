{"Headline": "Chickens Can Help Save Wildlife", "Date": "2017-03-18", "News": "Supported byThe idea that the humble chicken could become a savior of wildlife will seem improbable to many environmentalists. We tend to equate poultry production with factory farms, downstream pollution and 50-piece McNugget buckets.In much of the developing world, though, \u201ca chicken in every pot\u201d is the more pertinent image. It\u2019s a tantalizing one for some conservationists because what\u2019s in the pot there these days is mostly trapped, snared or hunted wildlife \u2014 also called bushmeat \u2014 from cane rats and brush-tailed porcupines to gorillas.So what do chickens have to do with this gruesome business? Assuming you could persuade governments to enforce laws against the hunting and selling of bushmeat, said David Wilkie of the Wildlife Conservation Society, you could not possibly make it work without providing an alternative source of protein. In many rural areas, particularly in Central and West Africa, wildlife is what there is to eat, accounting for up to 80 percent of protein in the diet \u2014 and 100 percent of the animal protein. Abruptly cutting off access to bushmeat could mean starvation.What really worries Mr. Wilkie and others are regional towns near the sources of wild animal meat that have quickly grown into cities and have no access to the commercial food supply chain. \u201cIf those towns don\u2019t have a source of protein,\u201d Mr. Wilkie said, \u201cit\u2019s dreadful for wildlife, but it\u2019s also dreadful for children.\u201d Even Kisangani, a major city in an inaccessible region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has become vulnerable, he notes, depleting fish for hundreds of miles up and down the Congo River. Bushmeat now comes from as far as a national park 200 miles away. That is, an essential food source for the city is already rapidly vanishing because of the relentless emptying of forests and water bodies.In the past, governments and nonprofit groups have tried to promote a practical alternative meat source through wildlife ranching, focusing on the same species targeted by the bushmeat trade. But those efforts have almost always failed, because wild animals make lousy livestock. They are often difficult to breed in captivity, and require too much food and time to reach market size. As a result, many wildlife farmers routinely restock from the wild, merely laundering the bushmeat trade.Chickens, though, have been subject to intensive domestication efforts over roughly 8,000 years, Mr. Wilkie said, and we know how to rear them cheaply and in quantity. The trick is to translate that knowledge to the small backyard flocks, generally kept by women, in rural villages everywhere.Such an effort is already underway, largely funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The focus, said Donald Nkrumah, a program officer there, is on providing more protein for chronically malnourished people and a means of economic independence for village women. It\u2019s not about saving gorillas. But those goals are not mutually exclusive. \u201cI grew up in West Africa. I know they are eating most of the wildlife,\u201d he said.The reason they are not eating chickens or eggs instead, Mr. Nkrumah said, \u201cis that African chickens don\u2019t grow very fast and don\u2019t lay many eggs\u201d \u2014 30 or 40 a year, rather than the 150 that would be possible with improved breeds. The chickens are also vulnerable to diseases like Newcastle virus, which can periodically kill off 90 percent of a village\u2019s flocks. Better breeds and a suitable Newcastle vaccine already exist to fix such problems. But big agriculture companies have little commercial incentive to push their products out to remote rural markets. What often happens instead, Mr. Nkrumah said, is that \u201csome NGO will get 10,000 chickens delivered to 1,000 households, write a beautiful report and everybody\u2019s happy.\u201d Until it all falls apart.Hence the ambition at GALVmed, one of the nonprofits funded by the Gates Foundation, is to establish a self-sustaining commercial enterprise with community health workers in parts of Africa and India trained to deliver the vaccine, and a complete distribution chain connecting them back to the manufacturer, with everybody earning a modest living along the way. Likewise, a company called EthioChicken now produces and vaccinates hatchlings, and sells them to a network of regional entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, who in turn sell them to village women at $1 or $1.50 each. The Gates Foundation is pushing the company to scale up to 20 million chickens a year, and Mr. Nkrumah does the math: $7 apiece for the males sold as broilers at three months, 150 eggs at 10 cents apiece over the course of the year, and $5 each when the spent hens are sold for meat. That could be a lot of money and protein for rural people who don\u2019t have much of either.Will that make a difference for wildlife? Chickens alone won\u2019t stop bushmeat hunting if countries are unwilling to discourage open sale of endangered animals in the marketplace. But in the 1980s, India combined enforcement of anti-hunting law with a program to make chicken far more widely available in rural villages. It wasn\u2019t a simple thing, said K. Ullas Karanth, a tiger researcher for the Wildlife Conservation Society in the Western Ghats. \u201cChickens had to be abundant, they had to be cheap, and people had to be able to afford them.\u201d But the eventual result was that hunting was no longer worth the risk of arrest in much of the country.Will it also work in Africa, Asia and other regions now eating their way down the food chain? As the human population grows at a rate that rapidly outpaces the ability of natural habitats to feed it, a better backyard chicken could be a real hope for people and wildlife alike.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Superstar Firms\u2019 May Have Shrunk Workers\u2019 Share of Income", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byBut in recent decades, that steady share \u2014 which includes everything from the chief executive\u2019s bonuses and stock options to the parking-lot attendant\u2019s minimum wage and tips \u2014 started to flutter. In the 2000s, it slipped significantly. Although the numbers have inched up in the last couple of years, labor\u2019s portion has not risen above 59 percent since before the recession.Some economists argue that technological advancements are to blame as employers have replaced workers with machines. Others point to trade powered by cheap foreign labor, a view championed by President Trump that particularly resonated among voters.Over the last 15 years, for example, labor productivity has grown faster than wages, a sign that workers are not being adequately compensated for their contributions. And some industries have fared worse than others. Slices of the pie going to mining and manufacturing narrowed the most, while service workers (including professional and business services) had the biggest gains.From manufacturing to retailing, giant companies have managed to gobble up a larger and larger share of the market.Think about the retail sector, where mom-and-pop stores once crowded the landscape. Now it is dominated by a handful of giants like Walmart, Target and Costco.\u201cThey\u2019re very sophisticated and efficient and they don\u2019t use as much labor,\u201d said Mr. Autor, who worked on the research with a team of economists that included David Dorn, Lawrence F. Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen.With efficiencies come advantages.Software platforms and online services, for example, may be expensive to install, but not so costly to expand. Technology can make it easier to exploit smaller competitive advantages. And there is no need for duplicate payroll, shipping or human resources departments.The idea of superstars vacuuming up a majority of goodies is perhaps more obvious on the individual level. Because of technology like cable and satellite television and the internet, music luminaries like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift or sports phenoms like LeBron James or Cristiano Ronaldo can reach a much larger audience and gain a greater proportion of the revenue generated.What was once true of pop stars can now be seen in more mundane industries. \u201cOver the past several decades, only the highest earners have seen steady wage gains,\u201d a report from the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers concluded late last year. \u201cFor most workers, wage growth has been sluggish and has failed to keep pace with gains in productivity.\u201dLarger companies tend to pay better than smaller ones, Mr. Autor and the other researchers say, and in the technology sector especially, salaries can be impressive. Workers there are sharing in the larger pie \u2014 there are just fewer of them to do so.The researchers examined six industries that account for 80 percent of private employment in the United States. In each one, they discovered \u201ca remarkably consistent upward trend in concentration.\u201d In manufacturing, for instance, the top four companies controlled 43 percent of sales in 2012, up from 38 percent in 1982. In finance, the figure grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, and in retail trade it went to 30 percent, from 15 percent.The faster concentration grew, the bigger the drop in labor\u2019s share.\u201cWhat\u2019s different about new superstar firms is they don\u2019t have the cadre of middle-class jobs for nonelite workers,\u201d said Mr. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard.\u201cThat\u2019s very worrisome,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe trend is going on in country after country.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the effect large companies may have had on a decline in workers\u2019 share of income misspelled the surname of an author of the study on such \u201csuperfirms.\u201d He is John Van Reenen, not Van Reenan.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Rare Venture Capitalist \u2014 Female and Retail-Focused", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kirsten Green had only dabbled in investing in start-ups before she began a venture capital fund in 2012. What she had instead was years of experience covering the retail business as an analyst on Wall Street.So Ms. Green, 45, parlayed that retail knowledge into her venture capital endeavors and used it to bring specialized advice to her companies. In one of her first moves as a venture capitalist, she was part of a $1 million investment into Dollar Shave Club, then a tiny company, which sells razors to consumers online. Later, she invested in Jet.com, an e-commerce start-up that was vocal about wanting to take on Amazon.Thinking about \u201cthe acquirers, the state of the public markets, how a business is being valued \u2014 that\u2019s an essential way to understand the overall ecosystem\u201d of start-ups, said Ms. Green, whose little-known venture firm, Forerunner Ventures, is based in San Francisco.That means the venture capitalists who nurtured those businesses can finally reap some cash. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re seeing more exits, and a stronger opportunity for exits, is a good thing,\u201d said Theresa S. Hajer, a managing director at Cambridge Associates, an investment advisory firm.Knowing when to sell a start-up or take it public remains as important as deciding to sell. Founders Fund, a venture firm started by the investor Peter Thiel, had put money into Stemcentrx, which makes a cancer-fighting drug. Last year, Stemcentrx agreed to sell itself to the drug maker AbbVie for $5.8 billion, an amount that generated returns exceeding the $625 million fund that Founders Fund had used to invest in the company.These 20 venture capitalists \u2013 the investors who unearth the tiny start-ups that turn into tomorrow\u2019s behemoths \u2013 are on the winningest streaks.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly important to generate realized returns, but the question is still when,\u201d said Brian Singerman, the Founders partner who oversaw the Stemcentrx investment and who is No. 5 on the list of top 20 venture capitalists.CB Insights put together the list using criteria such as the size of a return an investor was able to generate when his or her investments went public or were acquired. The firm focused on the performance of investors since 2009 for the list.Ms. Green is an unorthodox venture capitalist for several reasons. Apart from having never worked at a venture capital firm before starting her own in 2012, she is also a woman in a male-dominated field. (Of the top 20 venture investors this year, only two were women.) And unlike many generalist venture investors, who work in a range of areas, Ms. Green focuses specifically on commerce and other retail-related start-ups.Ms. Green\u2019s roots in retail run deep. She began her career as an accountant auditing retailers. In the late 1990s, she covered those companies as a stock analyst for Montgomery Securities, studying wonky measurements like customer traffic in retail locations and a store\u2019s profitability per square foot. She also observed the rise of brands like Abercrombie & Fitch, Coach and Ugg.\u201cRetail is now totally propelled by consumers and their needs,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can buy what they want in any way that they want it. That trend started a long time ago, and it has really changed everything.\u201dIn 2003, Ms. Green decided to jump from analyzing this shift to investing in it. For a time, she worked as a consultant to a private equity firm before turning to venture capital because of her interest in young companies. In 2010, she raised an angel investment fund to make one-off investments in companies like Birchbox, a cosmetics subscription service, and Warby Parker, an eyeglasses retailer, while she studied how to raise a venture fund.In 2012, Ms. Green raised a $40 million venture fund. The investment firm Cendana Capital contributed $10 million, despite the fact that she had never worked as a traditional investor or tech entrepreneur.\u201cWhen we talked to founders she had worked with, they all said that she had the best expertise and gave the best advice,\u201d Michael Kim, a managing partner at Cendana, said of Ms. Green.With that fund, Ms. Green helped lead a $1 million investment into Dollar Shave Club when the start-up was valued at just $5 million. She also joined the company\u2019s board.After Ms. Green invested in Jet.com in 2014, she chatted with Jet\u2019s executives almost weekly about matters including strategy and potential acquisitions, said Katie Finnegan, who was the online retailer\u2019s head of corporate development. Ms. Finnegan said Jet still consults with Ms. Green even after the company\u2019s sale to Walmart.Ms. Green has \u201ca real instinct for brands,\u201d said Rachel Blumenthal, the founder of the children\u2019s apparel start-up Rockets of Awesome, which sends subscribers a customized box of clothing for every new season. Ms. Blumenthal got to know Ms. Green from Warby Parker, which was founded by Ms. Blumenthal\u2019s husband, Neil.Ms. Green invested in Rockets of Awesome last year and has brought her opinions about consumer behavior to the start-up. At a recent company board meeting, Ms. Green argued that the online retailer\u2019s subscription box needed to remain distinct from its other packaging. Ms. Blumenthal agreed, saying that making the box \u201cthe crown jewel of the customer experience\u201d was the right decision because it was one of the most powerful ways to reach consumers and to learn about them.Ms. Green currently serves on more than 10 company boards, including for the men\u2019s clothing company Bonobos, the makeup brand Glossier and the women\u2019s vitamin company Ritual.As for exits, Ms. Green said she tells entrepreneurs that she expects them to take the companies public or sell to a buyer as soon as appropriate. Of the 30 companies in her first fund, eight have been acquired. In her second $75 million fund, which she raised in 2014, two companies have been acquired, including Jet.com.\u201cNow that people are bombarded with information, we are in a golden age where brands matter,\u201d Ms. Green said. \u201cI want to be part of this new era.\u201dAn article on Monday about the venture capital investor Kirsten Green overstated her investment in Dollar Shave Club. Ms. Green was one of the investors in a $1 million financing round for the company; she did not invest the entire $1 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Blockchain: A Better Way to Track Pork Chops, Bonds, Bad Peanut Butter?", "Date": "2017-03-04", "News": "Supported byFrank Yiannas has spent years looking in vain for a better way to track lettuce, steaks and snack cakes from farm and factory to the shelves of Walmart, where he is the vice president for food safety. When the company dealt with salmonella outbreaks, it often took weeks to trace where the bad ingredients came from.Then, last year, IBM executives flew to Walmart\u2019s headquarters in Arkansas to propose a solution: the blockchain.As Mr. Yiannas studied their pitch, he said, \u201cI became increasingly convinced that maybe we were onto the holy grail.\u201dThe blockchain \u2014 the buzzy, bewildering technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin \u2014 is starting to be applied to real-world problems like tracking pork chops, shipping containers and footwear with a speed and security not currently possible. The IBM-Walmart partnership is one of the biggest practical tests to date.At its heart, blockchain simply refers to a bookkeeping method that \u201cchains\u201d together entries so that they are very difficult to modify later. It provides a way for large groups of unrelated companies to jointly keep a secure and reliable record of their transactions.IBM is trying to position itself at the forefront of the heated competition for practical uses of this arcane idea. Walmart is just one of 400 IBM clients testing it out, and IBM now has around 650 employees dedicated to the technology.Yet success is far from assured.\u201cWe believe with 100 percent certainty that it\u2019s going to matter,\u201d Mark Russinovich, the head of Microsoft\u2019s blockchain efforts, said of the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of where\u2019s its going to matter and how it\u2019s going to matter.\u201dIt was Bitcoin that first caught the attention of IBM researchers, and everyone else.Bitcoin, born in 2009, represented a novel idea in the financial world. Unlike, say, dollars or yen, Bitcoins are virtual tokens, unaffiliated with any nation. Anyone can open a wallet and receive Bitcoins \u2014 without providing any identifying information \u2014 and transactions are recorded on a universal ledger that is visible to everyone.Drug dealers have embraced its relative anonymity. And people who live in countries that strictly control their financial systems, like China and Venezuela, have used Bitcoin to store their money beyond the watchful eye of the government.But while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin\u2019s underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into \u201cblocks,\u201d and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction \u2014 a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact.In 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM.\u201cI was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM.But a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM\u2019s central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology.They explained that this was about more than just a currency \u2014 it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it.\u201cThat was the \u2018aha\u2019 for me,\u201d Mr. Krishna said. \u201cThis was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.\u201d He called it \u201ca technology that can change the world.\u201dThere are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers.But blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information.A few months after Mr. Krishna\u2019s aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM\u2019s top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities \u2014 or threats \u2014 to IBM\u2019s business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, gave the green light to.She turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, \u201cYou run with this,\u201d he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months.Her hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM\u2019s eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software.But growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers.IBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, \u201cThe first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.\u201dAfter getting Ms. Rometty\u2019s push on the blockchain, the IBM team\u2019s first move was to make its software \u201copen source,\u201d meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM\u2019s bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology.It was the chairman of IBM Europe, Erich Clementi, who personally pitched the concept to the top technology executive at Maersk. Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe.For Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships \u2014 instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities.While the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world.What\u2019s more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year.Maersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved \u2014 including Maersk and government authorities \u2014 could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged.The first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California.The difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it\u2019s unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system.\u201cYou need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,\u201d said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult part.\u201dIBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark.Not everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach.Many technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains \u2014 like the one being built by IBM \u2014 are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin\u2019s success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM\u2019s.That could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, \u201cit still concentrates power in a handful of entities,\u201d said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems.IBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come.But the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project.\u201cThey have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,\u201d Mr. Behlendorf said. \u201cWe are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.\u201dBut IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. \u201cThis is the most well-thought-out project in the space,\u201d said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor.Now all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work.At Maersk, Mr. Stausholm said it could take five or even 10 years for that to happen, given all the partners \u2014 manufacturers, customs officials and farmers \u2014 that need to come together. \u201cI really do believe in it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how fast it will be able to take off.\u201dAt Walmart, Mr. Yiannas is more optimistic. His company has already completed two pilots with IBM \u2014 moving pork from Chinese farms to Chinese stores, and produce from Latin America to the United States \u2014 and he is confident a finished version can be put together within a few years. \u201cI think this is our one best hope for getting it right,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos\u2019s Moon Shot, Gets First Paying Customer", "Date": "2017-03-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jeff Bezos, the billionaire chief executive of Amazon, founded a rocket company as a hobby 16 years ago. Now that company, Blue Origin, finally has its first paying customer as it ramps up to become a full-fledged business.For Blue Origin, the relationship represents its evolution from an engineering-obsessed company into one that also seeks to make a profit eventually.The companies are part of a private sector space boom that has restored the United States\u2019 position in aerospace technology and exploration. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other international commercial space companies are also competing with the tech entrepreneurs for business and government customers.Mr. Bezos, true to his approach in business ventures, is looking far into the future.\u201cThe long-term vision is millions of people living and working in space,\u201d he said Tuesday during a speech at the Satellite 2017 conference in Washington.To make that happen, Blue Origin must take several intermediate steps, he said. It also needs to lower costs for launches by reusing rockets and other equipment, he added.We \u201cneed to get to a place ultimately where it is much more like commercial airlines,\u201d Mr. Bezos said.New applications for satellites, including broadband internet, mapping and other services, have fueled more demand. Analysts said private rocket companies would fill a need to get those satellites into orbit in coming years.Blue Origin\u2019s deal with Eutelsat is a \u201cdefinite statement to the industry that Blue Origin will be a viable commercial launch vehicle,\u201d said Carissa Bryce Christensen, the chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, a consulting firm.The large crowd to hear Mr. Bezos speak at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Tuesday illustrated renewed enthusiasm about the commercial space industry. Space has long been a pursuit of wealthy investors, and Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have captured the most public attention in recent years for their audacious visions. SpaceX is focused on reaching and inhabiting Mars. Blue Origin may be building a fleet of rockets to make deliveries to the moon and beyond.Mr. Bezos \u201cis investing because he wants to transform people\u2019s lives with space capabilities, but the expectation has always been that this will be a successful business,\u201d Ms. Christensen said.Those ambitions have many doubters who do not see how expensive rocket projects can become profitable. Even with a surge in satellite technologies and perhaps a growing space tourism industry, demand may not be sufficient to cover rocket companies\u2019 great costs for research, development and launches.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get anything done without getting the dreamers out there, but how do you translate those dreams into a profitable business? That\u2019s very tricky,\u201d said Henry Hertzfeld, a research professor at the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.Blue Origin, which has more than 1,000 employees, has improved its technology to carry bigger payloads. A few months ago, the company began to court customers, and Eutelsat emerged as an ideal partner because it had experience working with first-time launch vehicles, Mr. Bezos said.Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn rocket, named after the astronaut John Glenn, will be manufactured and launched at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It is expected to be completed in 2020 and will be used to carry one of Eutelsat\u2019s geostationary satellites. No financial details of the partnership with Eutelsat were disclosed. In a video, Mr. Bezos revealed details about the rocket\u2019s BE-4 engine and showed how it could carry 50 tons of payload and land on a moving sea barge.\u201cTheir solid engineering approach, and their policy to develop technologies that will form the base of a broad generation of launchers, corresponds to what we expect from our industrial partners,\u201d Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Mr. Bezos said he was approaching his space project with an abundance of patience.\u201cI like to do things incrementally,\u201d he said, noting that Blue Origin\u2019s mascot is a tortoise. With such high costs and risks with each rocket launch, it is important not to skip steps, he said.\u201cSlow is smooth and smooth is fast,\u201d said Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post and a clock that will keep time for 10,000 years. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this in every endeavor I\u2019ve been in.\u201dKenneth Chang contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Sit in a cafe, sip an ice-cold bottle of Tijuca beer and gaze at the sun setting over forest-shrouded ridges teeming with wildlife like sloths and howler monkeys.\u201cI\u2019ll bet you don\u2019t get this stuff in Ipanema,\u201d Pit\u00f3 said, joking about the legendary beach in Rio de Janeiro, the coastal city where I\u2019ve lived for six years.But for centuries, Alter remained a backwater, save for luring residents from the nearby city of Santar\u00e9m and the occasional adventurer.\u201cThe houses in the village swarmed with vermin; bats in the thatch; fire ants (formiga de fogo) under the floors; cockroaches and spiders on the walls,\u201d he wrote.Despite such misgivings, this place grew on Bates, who would let his mind wander on Alter\u2019s beaches after conducting research in the surrounding forest into animal mimicry that supported Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution.Winter wasn\u2019t the first thing that popped into my mind when I explored sun-drenched Alter on foot.\u201cWe feel at home in Alter,\u201d said Mr. \u00c1lvarez, explaining that he and his wife were supporting themselves by selling the jewelry they make. \u201cI think we\u2019re here to stay.\u201dThe writer and explorer Alex Shoumatoff was enthralled with Alter when he visited in 1977, describing it as \u201cthe first place I would head for when I finally gave up trying to fit into the modern world.\u201d\u201cThe day I arrived here I felt some very special energy, and I wasn\u2019t able to leave,\u201d said Marcelo Freitas Gananca, 49, who moved to Alter in 1998 from S\u00e3o Paulo. He owns Ararib\u00e1, a store selling an astonishing collection of indigenous folk art, including ceremonial masks, war clubs, drums and 20-foot-long blow guns.\u201cBut now the town is at a critical turning point where it could go in one direction or another,\u201d Mr. Gananca said, citing challenges like the lack of a sewage system, tensions with newcomers and the construction of garish new lodgings that reflect little of Alter\u2019s origins.In the face of such tests, I wondered what Alter would look like a few years from now. Along with the grumbling about so-called soybean barons from neighboring Mato Grosso State building villas here, some in Alter also insisted that they could forge a balance between tourism and sustainability.\u201cMaybe Alter is a meeting point where we can learn from each other,\u201d said Pit\u00f3, the Cumaruara guide. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the world need a place where people can slow down, put their hand in the water and feel the river\u2019s flow?\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I am stuck with my iPhone 5 because I have a keyboard attachment for it that turns it into a BlackBerry, and which I love because during fashion shows I file reviews on my phone and they can be 1,000 words long.

Are smartwatches ever going to be fashionable enough to replace normal watches?I am sure they will be at some point, but who knows when that will be.

Plus a Kindle is very good to take to shows, because I am lugging a heavy bag full of stuff all day, and it is light and takes up almost no room. And it gives me something to occupy my mind during the endless minutes I spend waiting for shows to start.What could be better about it?The light. Shows have very complicated lighting plans and sometimes that makes it hard to read.What is your children\u2019s favorite piece of technology and why?The favorite app for my 16-year-old and 14-year-old daughters are Snapchat and SoundCloud. That\u2019s because they can use Snapchat to connect with their friends and stay in touch with those that are far away, and SoundCloud because it is easy and a good way to find new music and fun remixes.For my 11-year-old son: Spotify, because he loves listening to music.Favorite piece of technology (from all of them): their iPhones.

{"Headline": "Miscue Calls Attention to Amazon\u2019s Dominance in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 There have been many opportunities to consider how crucial Amazon has become to the smooth operation of the internet over the past few years.Among the many consequences of the shutdown: Users of the business messaging service Slack couldn\u2019t upload files. Photos on the technology news site The Verge didn\u2019t display. Quora, a popular question-and-answer site, couldn\u2019t be reached.It was a rare fumble for Amazon in cloud computing, in which companies pay to run their online applications in data centers operated by big providers.Amazon\u2019s service interruption, though not nearly bad enough to spark a panic among customers, was viewed by some as a moment for reflection.\u201cIt really is a wake-up call to enterprises,\u201d said Craig McLuckie, a former Google technologist who is now chief executive of Heptio, a start-up that makes software tools for more easily moving applications between clouds. \u201cThey certainly need to understand to what level of dependency they have on a single provider.\u201dAmazon\u2019s error was still fresh in people\u2019s minds last week at the Google Cloud Next conference, a jamboree for the search giant to show off its seriousness in cloud computing. At the beginning of her keynote speech, Diane Greene, Google Cloud\u2019s chief executive, boasted about how reliable Google\u2019s cloud service was last year. Taking a jab at Amazon, she quipped that \u201cso far, 2017 looks promising, too.\u201dIt was part of a barrage unleashed by Google to persuade potential customers that they should piggyback on the $30 billion of infrastructure investment it had made over the years.\u201cWe\u2019re here for real; this is an incredibly serious mission,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cWe have the money, means and commitment to pull off a new platform of computation globally for everyone who needs it.\u201dBut even big customers Google showcased at its conference emphasized the importance of not relying exclusively on one company. Darryl West, global chief information officer of HSBC, said at the event that the bank used Google, Amazon and Microsoft for cloud services, noting that each company has its strengths.Paul Gaffney, Home Depot senior vice president of information technology, who also spoke at the Google event, said, \u201cAll of us have a role as consumers to drive competition so multi-cloud is a very important part of doing that.\u201dOne fear among businesses is that Amazon\u2019s dominance could lead to a new form of \u201clock-in,\u201d giving it huge leverage over customers because of the costs of switching providers. In the 1980s and 1990s, those costs helped Microsoft gain a seemingly unshakable grip on personal computing. Microsoft is betting that won\u2019t happen this time.\u201cThis won\u2019t be a winner-take-all scenario,\u201d said Judson Althoff, executive vice president of Microsoft\u2019s worldwide commercial business.Although they have become credible competitors to Amazon in the past few years \u2014 especially Microsoft \u2014 the newcomers to cloud computing have a long way to go. In the fourth quarter, Amazon accounted for 40 percent of the worldwide market for public cloud services, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft and 6 percent for Google, which was tied for third place with IBM, according to Synergy Research Group.Disruptions like the one in late February in what Amazon calls its simple storage service remain rare, especially in relation to comparable computing services operated privately by companies within their own walls. Even with the problem, which lasted for about four hours, the Amazon storage service was up and running more than 99.98 percent of the time in the United States and Europe over the last 90 days, according to CloudHarmony, a cloud measurement service owned by the technology research firm Gartner.Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, did not expect what transpired to cause a rush of companies to shift their cloud computing away from Amazon. She said it was highly unusual for companies to run the same application in more than one cloud because it introduced new complexities and costs.To avoid being knocked offline, companies can set up their applications to run in multiple regions, across the company\u2019s network of data centers. All of the big cloud providers offer volume discounts, the full benefits of which customers don\u2019t get to enjoy if they divide their use of cloud services among multiple providers.Still, there are some compelling reasons to use multiple providers, Ms. Leong said. Often companies rely mostly on Amazon for cloud service, while a specific development team inside the company familiar with Microsoft technologies will use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service.A few years ago, Hearst, the media company, was exclusively using Amazon for cloud computing, but later added services from Microsoft and Google, said Philip R. Wiser, Hearst\u2019s chief technology officer. He said some of the company\u2019s internal online services had been affected by Amazon\u2019s interruption, but nothing the public would have noticed.Because it\u2019s relatively early in the emergence of cloud computing, Mr. Wiser said he believed it was important to spread one\u2019s bets around.\u201cBeing multi-cloud as a company and having the skill and understanding of how to move between investments \u2014 that is an asset,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have that as a stated mission for all of our infrastructure team.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed to this story from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

If you pick a good stand-in, I\u2019ll bring you back a cool souvenir.This seems like a good idea; lots of people don\u2019t want to pay hundreds of dollars for cable but probably can\u2019t get all their entertainment from Netflix and Amazon. But I do wonder if that\u2019s a TV company pipe dream. Maybe cord cutters will switch entirely and never miss TV. Personally, I pay for cable and almost never watch it. It\u2019s like burning money every month.In all, it has not been a great week for Uber. But I have been saying that a lot lately.This reminds me of the time Zenefits, the high-flying human resources start-up, was found to have installed software to let its workers cheat on a licensing course. You know what happened at Zenefits after that? The C.E.O. had to resign, there were hundreds of layoffs, regulators began long-term investigations and imposed millions in fines, the company\u2019s valuation plummeted, and its long-term prospects are still in question.Or, hey, I just thought of another comparison. It\u2019s like when Volkswagen created software to pretend its cars had low emissions in testing, but they didn\u2019t actually.In other words: This is bad.So I\u2019m kind of a Snap bear \u2014 and no, that\u2019s not some sort of terrifying euphemism. I believe their marquee product, Snapchat, has some significant challenges in regard to growth, and their thesis of being a camera company is far from borne out. (I will admit, however, that I am waiting for my pair of Snap Spectacles to arrive in the mail.)How does that add up to a successful company?But since you\u2019ve cast yourself as the Snap bear, let me pretend to be the Snap bull. I think it could be a mistake to compare it to Twitter for a simple reason: Snap is visual and Twitter is not. Snap, I think, is thus a more faithful replacement of the world\u2019s most popular pastime: watching TV. The big opportunity for all consumer internet companies is the money that will flow from TV ads to digital ads, and I think Snap has a pretty good shot at capturing a huge slice of that market.I also wouldn\u2019t compare it to GoPro. Yes, Snap says it\u2019s a camera company, but we\u2019re taking it too literally. It\u2019s a camera company whose main innovation is camera software, not hardware. In this way it is a bit like Apple: Apple\u2019s physical phone hardware is in many cases on par with that of competitors, but the reason that Apple makes essentially all the profit in the smartphone business is that its software keeps people glued to iPhones. Snap, too, is investing in software that hooks you in, and its hardware will be secondary to that. This is very different from GoPro, whose software is at best forgettable \u2014 leaving it open to competition from low-end manufacturers.Anyway, have you decided what car service you\u2019re using to get to the airport?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Americans\u2019 History Suddenly Feels Less Retro", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byIf you love a good spy story, no doubt Tuesday you\u2019ll tune in for the latest in a gripping serial about Russian operatives using duplicity and \u201ckompromat\u201d to undermine American democracy.But once you\u2019re done watching the news, might I suggest \u201cThe Americans\u201d?Yeah, it\u2019s a cheap joke. But if television\u2019s best drama finally gets the buzz it deserves because evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election served as viral marketing \u2014 well, as Comrade Trotsky once said, \u201cThe end may justify the means as long as there is something that justifies the end.\u201dWhen the first season, in 2013, had Elizabeth and Philip bug the home of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, it seemed outlandish enough. A writer who suggested a successful black-op to help install Russia\u2019s preferred United States presidential candidate would have been laughed out of the room.In the light of today\u2019s headlines, this Cold War drama feels newly relevant \u2014 but also almost comfortingly small-scale.But the series\u2019 nuanced depiction of espionage as grinding emotional labor is still enthralling. Season 5, which begins Tuesday on FX, finds the Jenningses\u2019 entanglements deepening.Their teenage daughter, Paige (Holly Taylor), having learned that her parents are spies, is being groomed for the family business. She\u2019s also dating the son of their neighbor Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich), who happens to be an F.B.I. agent. (Philip also has a long-lost grown son, who unbeknown to Philip is wending his way to America for a surprise family reunion.)Philip and Elizabeth, meanwhile, have been assigned to befriend a Soviet defector who consults for the United States Agriculture Department. There\u2019s a grain shortage in the Soviet Union, and the Russians suspect American sabotage.This is hardly the first time these spies have had to create false intimacy: They\u2019ve made friends and betrayed them, had sex with contacts \u2014 Philip even married an F.B.I. secretary (Alison Wright) under another identity. Love, in \u201cThe Americans,\u201d is a kind of biological weapon.Over four seasons, \u201cThe Americans\u201d has used relationships as a window into geopolitics. For Elizabeth and Philip, whose very marriage was arranged by the state, there is no boundary between family and service. That\u2019s become true for Paige as well.Season 5\u2019s food-crisis story line inverts this dynamic by framing the Soviet Union as a kind of vast, dysfunctional family. If Mother Russia can\u2019t put food on the table, her children are bound to start asking questions. Sometimes, as with Elizabeth \u2014 the more militant of the couple \u2014 the impulse will be to defend and rationalize.Philip, on the other hand, loves his homeland, wants to believe in it, but can\u2019t deny the evidence. The Soviet Union is a massive country, he says: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we grow enough grain ourselves?\u201d He\u2019s a little like Paige \u2014 growing up, realizing his parents are complicated and imperfect.\u201cThe Americans\u201d has always had a built-in melancholy, partly because of the historical setting. We knew, after all, that Elizabeth and Philip, even if they were America\u2019s enemies, were fighting for a doomed cause.But how doomed was it? The election scandal, Russia\u2019s muscle flexing in Europe and, well, whatever is going on between Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump, inevitably make the series play differently.For instance, when \u201cThe Americans\u201d began, one would have assumed things would end badly for the Jenningses.

{"Headline": "Amazon Takes a Gamble on Middle Eastern E-Commerce", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAmazon, the $400 billion online retailer, is purchasing, cheaply, a curious trinket.Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, has always focused on long-term potential. That\u2019s a description that matches the Middle East. The region\u2019s population is expanding, mobile devices are omnipresent, and there are pockets of huge wealth \u2014 yet e-commerce is underdeveloped.Picking winners is not easy, however. Yahoo paid over $160 million in 2009 for the portal Maktoob, and later shut down essentially all operations in the Middle East. Yahoo also did not acquire what may have been the best parts of Maktoob \u2014 one excluded property being Souq.com.The region\u2019s many legal and economic jurisdictions, and a tendency to favor red tape and entrenched cartels, make it hard for even powerful newcomers like Uber to break in. At least anecdotally, delivery can also be unreliable in many countries.Souq has raised $425 million in funding since it was founded in 2005, according to CrunchBase; the last round valued it at around $1 billion. The sale to Amazon, at $650 million to $750 million, according to The Financial Times, shows how investor optimism can be checked by reality.But Mr. Bezos is not afraid of complex endeavors. E-commerce remains a tough business, getting payments and tax levies right can be convoluted, and no company has found a simple solution to the problem of delivering packages to all the people who want them. The extreme conditions of Souq\u2019s territory may mean the purchase will never really make financial sense.On the other hand, the outlay is pocket change for Amazon and could prove a useful testing ground for its global ambitions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No \u2018Inner City\u2019 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Just Overlooked Strengths", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byBig CityWhen I visited Ms. Lopez in her office to talk about what has changed in Brownsville and what hasn\u2019t over the past several years, she spoke about how disheartening it was to see constant attacks in the news media, ones she believes were then internalized by children who would see themselves as hopeless and without value. Her mission involves a deft finesse between showing children the larger world of affluence \u2014 she takes students to stores and restaurants in Park Slope and Williamsburg so that they might know how the salumi half lives \u2014 and inculcating in them a sense of investment in their own neighborhood, so they might aspire to do well but ultimately return to the place they were brought up and improve it.\u201cIf kids have access and exposure they can change a trajectory,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t know what to ask for until you know what there is to want.\u201d When Ms. Lopez takes the children through moneyed Brooklyn, they are consistently amazed that you can go to a store where the candy isn\u2019t behind plexiglass and eat in restaurants where you sit down and the food is actually brought to you.For years, residents of Brownsville have complained that there is virtually no such place in their neighborhood \u2014 nowhere to go to share a meal for a birthday or anniversary. This spring, a culinary institute that will train people who live in the area for food careers without charging tuition will open on Belmont Avenue with a restaurant conceived in part by the renowned Danish chef Claus Meyer. The restaurant is not intended as a place for 25-year-olds venturing over from Bushwick on the L train, but for people who live in the neighborhood, and the prices will reflect the market.The cafe has held at least one fashion show and invited local musicians to perform, and it holds classes in entrepreneurship. One of the most promising ideas generated from those classes, Pernell S. Brice III, Dream Big\u2019s executive director, told me, came from a woman who is trying to build, as he put, \u201cAmazon for prisons.\u201d Having had relatives in the system, and with expertise on what is needed and the special requirements of packaging prison shipments, the woman is devising a plan for a company that would offer inmates a catalog of things \u2014 books, shoes without any metal \u2014 that they would use while they are away.Mr. Lewis-Allen has been an important presence in the neighborhood, overseeing local students who designed a youth center from a shipping container, which will soon open on an empty patch of grass on Chester Street. He has developed a meme, too: #NotGentrification #JustGood.Not long ago he had a group of students survey residents about what they wanted on Belmont Avenue, which historically had been a major shopping thoroughfare. Overwhelmingly, he said, they wanted fewer churches and more places to sit and have coffee.The Big City column on the cover in some editions this weekend, about new business and community efforts in Brownsville, Brooklyn, misstates the ages of participants in Made in Brownsville, a nonprofit that gives young people exposure to creative careers. They are 14 to 24 years old, not 18 to 24 years old.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Push for Internet Privacy Rules Moves to Statehouses", "Date": "2017-03-26", "News": "Supported byNow that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers\u2019 online data. States have other ideas.Illinois legislators are considering a \u201cright to know\u201d bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates.Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers\u2019 locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in internet-connected devices like mobile phones, smart TVs and personal assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo.Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois \u2014 because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of state- and country-specific features to localize their effects.Congressional Republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also assert, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation.Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction.California and Connecticut, for instance, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like email, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees\u2019 social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants.\u201cMore and more, states have taken the position that, if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,\u201d said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said.States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle.In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking to roll back regulations, not create them.But federal blockage can create local opportunities.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts \u2014 not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,\u201d said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it\u2019s going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy.\u201d\u201cI think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,\u201d said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure.Mr. Hastings said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation.In an interview, Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating email lists or giving online support to customers.\u201cHiring attorneys to write privacy policies, coming up with terms of service \u2014 that will be a real burden for small businesses,\u201d he said.\u201cWe were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive,\u201d said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC. \u201cIt\u2019s important because the Trump administration is doing so much to roll back privacy rights, so there is going to be a huge shift to state lawmakers and state attorneys general.\u201dCecilia Kang contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sears and Its Hedge Fund Owner, in Slow Decline Together", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseHedge funds have been failing over the last year at the fastest rate since the financial crisis in 2008. Some crashed and burned after sudden reversals. Others quietly liquidated.Then there\u2019s Edward S. Lampert\u2019s ESL Investments. It hasn\u2019t failed, but may be setting a benchmark for slow, painful declines thanks to its outsize, long-term bet on two venerable retailers, Sears and Kmart.Sears said that the statement reflected a new, more stringent accounting rule, and that the company was in no imminent danger of bankruptcy. \u201cWe are a viable business that can meet its financial and other obligations for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Jason Hollar, Sears\u2019s chief financial officer.Still, coming after seven straight years of huge losses, the announcement seems a milestone on a road that has only one likely end.\u201cIt takes a retailer like Sears a long time to die,\u201d said Greg Melich, senior managing director and head of consumer research for Evercore, and the last Wall Street analyst still covering Sears. \u201cIt\u2019s been burning through over a billion dollars in cash every year. That\u2019s not sustainable.\u201dSears Holdings has long been ESL\u2019s largest investment, along with other Sears assets Mr. Lampert spun off, such as the struggling Lands\u2019 End. (The two holdings accounted for nearly half the fund\u2019s holdings at the end of the year, according to its most recent securities filings.) Sears Holdings shares were $162 in 2006; this week they were barely above $11.Few hedge fund managers have been as celebrated as Mr. Lampert in his heyday, which now appears to be the mid-2000s. Mr. Lampert was a Wall Street wunderkind, a Goldman Sachs intern whose intellect, ingratiating personality and prodigious work ethic attracted the patronage of some of America\u2019s most prominent and successful investors: Robert Rubin, Mr. Lampert\u2019s mentor at Goldman; Richard Rainwater, who invested for the billionaire Bass brothers before starting his own firm; and David Geffen, the billionaire entertainment mogul.Mr. Lampert was 25 years old and at the vanguard of the hedge fund movement when he founded ESL in 1988 with $28 million in seed money from Mr. Rainwater.No one compares Mr. Lampert to Mr. Buffett anymore. His high-profile investors are, for the most part, long gone. Mr. Tisch, who\u2019s also a director of Sears, is described as steadfastly loyal. Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert\u2019s roommate at Yale and now Treasury secretary, disclosed last year that he had a $26 million investment in ESL. (Mr. Mnuchin said he would divest the position.)Notably, a group of Goldman Sachs clients who had invested $3.5 billion in 2007 bailed out of the fund in 2013. Their exit \u201cpretty much says it all\u201d as far as investor confidence in Mr. Lampert goes, Mr. Melich said.Where did someone as smart, successful and hard-working as Mr. Lampert go wrong? His initial concept to combine two iconic but deeply distressed retailers \u2014 Kmart and Sears \u2014 initially appealed to many investors as a classic investment in undervalued, poorly managed assets in the Warren Buffett style. But Mr. Buffett doesn\u2019t personally manage his portfolio companies. Several former Lampert investors told me that Mr. Lampert\u2019s fundamental mistake was one common to many once-successful hedge fund managers: hubris, and the belief that investment prowess would translate into management skill.\u201cHe was a very successful investor before he took over Kmart and Sears,\u201d said Mark Cohen, former chief executive of Sears Canada and a professor at Columbia Business School, where he\u2019s the director of retail studies. (Mr. Cohen left Sears Canada before Mr. Lampert arrived.)\u201cHe seemed to think he was smarter than anyone in the retail business, but he had no idea how to run the company from Day 1,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cOne thing I teach is that core competencies are the basis for success or failure. Lampert had no experience in retail, and no management competency whatsoever.\u201dSears and other brick-and-mortar retail chains, of course, have been battered over the last decade by forces beyond Mr. Lampert\u2019s control, especially the rise of internet retailing. Mr. Lampert claims to have foreseen the trend. If so, he\u2019s had scant success carrying out a strategy to deal with it.His one consistent approach over the years has been to cut costs drastically. Initially, it seemed to work, increasing cash flow and earnings. \u201cThere\u2019s a philosophy to that,\u201d Mr. Melich said, but Sears \u201cgrossly underinvested in areas that proved to be very relevant to the future of merchandising, such as multichannel retailing.\u201dHe pointed to the contrast between Sears and Home Depot, whose shares have nearly tripled in the last five years, despite the internet and competition from Amazon.Mr. Lampert has shown more prowess as a financial engineer, and has seemingly squeezed Sears\u2019s once formidable assets for every penny of value through a continuing series of asset sales, spinoffs, dividend payouts and loans secured by Sears assets. Mr. Lampert has emphasized that because he is Sears\u2019s largest shareholder, his interests are aligned with other Sears shareholders.But the perception persists that many of these deals have benefited Mr. Lampert more than shareholders, since he\u2019s often on both sides of the transactions.Over the last two years alone, Mr. Lampert and ESL have extended Sears over $800 million in loans secured by Sears assets \u2014 nearly two-thirds as much as Sears\u2019s entire market capitalization of $1.2 billion. That makes Mr. Lampert and ESL the largest Sears creditors, giving them vastly different interests than most shareholders. (ESL Investments holds 48 percent of Sears Holdings\u2019s equity and 32 percent of its total long-term debt.) As creditors, they could end up owning Sears if it reorganizes in bankruptcy, while other Sears shareholders would be wiped out.Last month, Mr. Lampert and the Sears board agreed to pay $40 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit claiming that Sears\u2019s sale and lease-back of much of its most valuable real estate to a real estate investment trust \u2014 43 percent owned by Mr. Lampert and his ESL hedge fund \u2014 was a blatant conflict of interest that harmed Sears shareholders. Sears has denied any wrongdoing and said it had settled the suit merely to avoid \u201cprotracted litigation.\u201dMr. Lampert \u201chas stripped Sears of its assets,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the longest liquidation in retail history. His reputation in the retail community is that he\u2019s a financial pirate.\u201dLike most hedge fund managers, Mr. Lampert continues to get a management fee no matter how poorly the fund\u2019s assets perform.Still, Sears\u2019s travails and their impact on ESL\u2019s results have clearly taken a toll on Mr. Lampert\u2019s own fortunes. Although Mr. Lampert probably shows substantial gains on his original investment in Sears and Kmart, \u201che and ESL investors can\u2019t have fared very well over the past six or seven years,\u201d Mr. Melich said.Mr. Lampert remains one of the country\u2019s richest people. He owns lavish homes in Greenwich, Conn.; Aspen, Colo.; and Miami as well as a 288-foot yacht, Fountainhead, named after the Ayn Rand novel (Mr. Lampert is a devotee of the author). Last year Forbes ranked him tied for No. 309 on its annual list of the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $2.3 billion.But that\u2019s a billion-and-a-half dollars less than Forbes estimated back in 2006. Since then, Mr. Bezos has vaulted to No. 2 on the Forbes list, just behind Bill Gates, with a net worth of $67 billion. Had Mr. Lampert simply put his fortune in a stock market index fund rather than gaining control of Sears and Kmart, he would have fared far better.Through a spokesman, Mr. Lampert declined to comment.Even his critics concede that Mr. Lampert has been stubbornly consistent, refusing to throw in the towel on Sears even after years of deteriorating results. In a news release last week, he showed no signs of backing down, pledging yet another \u201cfundamental restructuring\u201d of Sears.His strategy? Cutting \u201cat least $1 billion in costs on an annualized basis.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated the management fee charged by ESL Investments.

But Jet failed to achieve profitability or emerge as a robust competitor.Many big companies have internal venture arms. And Walmart already has an internal research lab, @walmartlabs, that has focused on developing new e-commerce applications for the retailer.But Store No. 8 is the first incubator or investment arm of its kind at Walmart, which has a market value of $213 billion.The new venture takes its name from an early Walmart store, built in an old bottling plant, that the company founder Sam Walton used to try out new retail strategies.Store No. 8 is meant to foster relationships with entrepreneurs, particularly those in the fields of artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies.\u201cWe knew we needed to keep investing in the future of retail,\u201d Seth Beal, one of the principals of Store No. 8, said in a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure that we make the right short-term decisions but don\u2019t neglect the long term.\u201dMr. Beal, who was previously a senior vice president for global marketplace and digital store operations at Walmart, will be joined by Katie Finnegan, who led Jet\u2019s corporate development and has a background in fund-raising and mergers.\u201cWhen the mother ship is ready, we\u2019re sort of ahead of the eight ball,\u201d Ms. Finnegan said. \u201cOur goal is to have whatever we work on integrated into the mother ship.\u201dStore No. 8 is somewhat like corporate venture arms at other companies and will be charged with identifying emerging technologies that could prove useful. But rather than simply taking stakes in existing ventures, the new division is intended to help create new start-ups. It will also strike strategic partnerships with other promising young e-commerce companies.Along with incubating new ventures, Ms. Finnegan said, Store No. 8 will be able to draw on Walmart\u2019s resources to support any start-ups that it launches.\u201cWe\u2019re giving these portfolio companies the best chance for success,\u201d she said.Mr. Beal and Ms. Finnegan declined to comment on how much money Walmart would commit to the new venture, saying that Store No. 8 did not have a set goal for money to deploy in its investing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Internet Is Saving Culture, Not Killing It", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOne secret to longevity as a pundit is to issue predictions that can\u2019t be easily checked. So here\u2019s one for the time capsule: Two hundred years from now, give or take, the robot-people of Earth will look back on the early years of the 21st century as the beginning of a remarkable renaissance in art and culture.That may sound unlikely to many of us in the present. In the past few decades, we\u2019ve seen how technology has threatened the old order in cultural businesses, including the decimation of the music industry, the death of the cable subscription, the annihilation of newspapers and the laying to waste of independent bookstores.But things are turning around; for people of the future, our time may be remembered as a period not of death, but of rejuvenation and rebirth.Part of the story is in the art itself. In just about every cultural medium, whether movies or music or books or the visual arts, digital technology is letting in new voices, creating new formats for exploration, and allowing fans and other creators to participate in a glorious remixing of the work. This isn\u2019t new; from blogs to podcasts to YouTube, the last 20 years have been marked by a succession of formats that have led to ever-lower barriers for new and off-the-wall creators.But now something surprising has happened.In the last few years, and with greater intensity in the last 12 months, people started paying for online content. They are doing so at an accelerating pace, and on a dependable, recurring schedule, often through subscriptions. And they\u2019re paying for everything.You\u2019ve already heard about the rise of subscription-based media platforms \u2014 things like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify and Apple Music. But people are also paying for smaller-audience and less-mainstream-friendly content. They are subscribing to podcasters, comedians, zany YouTube stars, novelists and comic book artists. They are even paying for news.It\u2019s difficult to overstate how big a deal this is. More than 20 years after it first caught mainstream attention and began to destroy everything about how we finance culture, the digital economy is finally beginning to coalesce around a sustainable way of supporting content. If subscriptions keep taking off, it won\u2019t just mean that some of your favorite creators will survive the internet. It could also make for a profound shift in the way we find and support new cultural talent. It could lead to a wider variety of artists and art, and forge closer connections between the people who make art and those who enjoy it.\u201cWhat we want to do is change the entire financing mechanism that drives the production of content online,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cWe want to change how things are paid for and how the web runs. For us, it\u2019s a very, very big problem.\u201d\u201cI do think something has changed culturally,\u201d Mr. Conte said. \u201cThis new generation is more concerned with social impact. There\u2019s a desire to vote with your dollars and your time and attention.\u201dSome of that is happening in the news business, too. The New York Times and many other newspapers reported a surge in subscriptions after Donald J. Trump won the presidency last year.Huge content platforms have been criticized for the way they treat artists. Even if lots of people are paying for services like Spotify, critics say that it can be difficult for musicians, especially smaller and less-well-known ones, to make a sustainable living from the platform.Yet many artists are finding ways around these difficulties. Thanks to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, artists can now establish close relationships with their fans. They can sell merchandise and offer special fan-only promotions and content. And after finding an audience, they can use sites like Patreon to get a dependable paycheck from their most loyal followers.This sort of alternative arrangement isn\u2019t easy to pursue; it can take time, effort and skills in unusual dark arts (such as how social-media marketing works). But there are signs it is catching on: At the Grammys last year, the award for best new artist went to Chance the Rapper, who has famously, proudly rejected every offer to sign with a record label and even to sell any of his music.If there are difficulties in navigating the modern cultural business, there are upsides, too.\u201cI don\u2019t have to go out on the road and play in bars,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be a father and I can be a husband. This normalizes my career. It normalizes the career of being an artist, which has never been normalized.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Incisive Play About Hasidism, With Actors Who Lived It", "Date": "2017-03-12", "News": "Supported byAs a Hasidic Jew, she spent her childhood with eight siblings in the Yiddish-speaking and largely insular Satmar sect in Borough Park, Brooklyn. She had little knowledge of secular theater, film and television, which are frowned upon as sacrilegious.At 19, Ms. Weisz entered into an arranged marriage, but she opted for divorce after four years because of her increasing differences with the strict Hasidic way of life. She stunned her family and friends by leaving her Hasidic community to seek more opportunity. She attended college and eventually became an actress.Lately, she has found herself among other Hasidic exiles, speaking Yiddish and struggling with the strict rules of Orthodox Judaism.In the play, a Jewish brothel owner in early 20th-century Eastern Europe tries to keep his daughter unstained by brothel life. He soon begins to see her drifting away from the faith and into a forbidden lesbian relationship with a prostitute, played by Ms. Weisz.Ms. Weisz, now 32, is routinely brought to tears in rehearsals watching this distancing between father and daughter, especially since it evokes memories of having to explain to her parents that she was leaving the Hasidic religion and lifestyle.During certain parts of the play, Ms. Weisz said, the thought crosses her mind that \u201cthis is my family, and this was my scenario.\u201dThe play rekindles the pain even while reinforcing her decision to follow her own path, she said.Another prostitute is played by Malky Goldman, 29, an actress who uses Goldman as a stage name to avoid causing discomfort for her family. Like Ms. Weisz, she broke from her Hasidic background. Their castmates include three young male actors who also broke away from parochial, ultra-Orthodox lifestyles in Brooklyn.\u201cGod of Vengeance\u201d is the professional stage debut for the five Hasidic exiles. Having grown up speaking primarily Yiddish, they were natural choices for the play, which offers projected English subtitles for the audience.On a deeper level, their personal stories of shaking off the strong bonds of Hasidic life have helped them connect with the essence of their characters and the poignant themes of the play, said Ms. Weisz, who called her Hasidic upbringing \u201cmy background for my character.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a depth that we bring to the show,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have the complete break of losing your family, that loss. Nobody else can play it as intensely.\u201dBut that intensity has a price, with the play dredging up the anguish of becoming alienated from family and friends and abandoning the only life they had known.Even if they have achieved rapprochement with their families, the actors said, they would not bother inviting them to the show. After all, most Hasidic Jews would not attend even a tame secular play, much less one with forbidden themes and scenes involving Hasidic characters, they said. And relatives would be further offended knowing that the actors had grown up Hasidic.Ms. Weisz said her upbringing helped her employ the proper inflections, gestures and even Torah references onstage. It also helped her intuitively connect with the play\u2019s themes of religious hypocrisy, gender roles and forbidden sexuality.\u201cIt\u2019s something so visceral, no one can really, really get it the way we can,\u201d she said.Ms. Goldman agreed.\u201cWe have the back story of the community firsthand,\u201d Ms. Goldman said. \u201cIt goes straight to your heart, because you know these people. You\u2019ve been there.\u201dFor Shmully Blesofsky, 35, growing up in the Lubavitcher sect in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, allowed him to draw on characteristics from two Hasidic uncles: one a modest mensch, the other a swaggering figure who would cut a wide swath during prayer sessions at the Lubavitcher headquarters at 770 Eastern Parkway.The religious exiles have proved a welcome infusion for the New Yiddish Rep. Its founder and artistic director, David Mandelbaum, invited the five actors to join the company after meeting them at a theater workshop last summer.With members of the New Yiddish Rep almost all over 50, the company has been challenged by the decline of Yiddish, except in Hasidic strongholds in Brooklyn and some suburban pockets \u2014 populations that Hasidic guidelines generally forbid to participate in secular theater. But it has been encouraged by a niche revival of Yiddish study as a cultural phenomenon by non-Orthodox Jews and even gentiles.Despite growing up without theater experience, the five actors possess \u201cthe spirit of Yiddish culture, so we don\u2019t have to teach them that,\u201d Mr. Mandelbaum said during rehearsals with the cast and the director, Aaron Beall.The actors perform alongside Jewish and Gentile actors who learned Yiddish as adults. They include Caraid O\u2019Brien, an Irish-born actress who, after studying the Irish language, was introduced by Catholic nuns to Yiddish literature and went on to learn Yiddish.He noted that during the heyday of Yiddish theater on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side a century ago, many Jews defected from Orthodox families to be entertainers, including Al Jolson, as depicted in the film \u201cThe Jolson Story.\u201dMr. Baker said the new crop of actors could help lead to \u201ca reflowering of Yiddish culture\u201d with the help of a bridge between religious and cultural Jewry.During a rehearsal break, the five actors discussed going \u201coff the derech\u201d \u2014 or O.T.D. \u2014 an expression that uses the Hebrew word for path and refers to leaving the Hasidic religion and lifestyle. This includes moving out of neighborhoods that can have the feel of a 19th-century neighborhood in Eastern Europe.For actors who grew up in that environment, the century-old setting of the play does not feel that old, said Eli Rosen, 37, who plays a Torah scribe in the play.\u201cIn a way, the time is parallel, given how traditionally we grew up,\u201d said Mr. Rosen, who was raised in Borough Park and became a cantor and a lawyer before obtaining a divorce and leaving the Hasidic world.Mr. Twersky divorced his wife and left his Hasidic community in 2008, causing a seven-year breach with his parents. He went on to star in several independent films and land a role, as Mendel, in the Amazon series \u201cTransparent.\u201dWith a production that raises sensitive issues, the cast plans on holding panels after performances to provide perspective on the play and address questions it raises.Ms. Weisz said she had no problem discussing her current lifestyle as what she called a queer woman.Her upbringing still informs her art and fills her with a deep sense of responsibility to play Hasidic characters with the proper nuance because, Ms. Weisz said, \u201ceven though I left, this is my family \u2014 I love them.\u201dRegarding how Hasidics are portrayed onstage, she said, \u201cI want to make sure they\u2019re honored as human beings, and not caricatures.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As a non-Christian in a cathedral, she said, she tries to be polite, but sometimes she can\u2019t help herself.\u201cAt first, I was \u2014 and crying,\u201d she said. But that changed. \u201cWhen you are there, you kind of get used to it in a day or two. It\u2019s very weird. So it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, this is a new place we never got to before.\u2019 There\u2019s a certain excitement.\u201dEiko said she did not want the horror of Fukushima to dissipate. \u201cNow who has a nuclear button?\u201d she asked, referring to President Trump. But, she stressed: \u201cI\u2019m not a political activist. What I can offer is time and space to gather and reflect.\u201dFor Eiko, the cathedral is a place for exploration; her residency is a way to expose people to her art and a way for her to encounter them. In other words, it\u2019s not just a gig, but an opportunity for her to consider the direction of her work. And with Eiko\u2019s presence, the cathedral, which first appointed artists in residence in the early 1980s, is figuring out what a residency program could look like today.Mark McCloughan, a former student of Eiko\u2019s at Wesleyan University and now her dramaturge, likened her residency to a laboratory, but one that is unusual because it is so public. \u201cAll of these experiments have to happen in the context of the passing gazes of tourists and the people who are stumbling across it unexpectedly,\u201d he said.And there is the grandness of the cathedral itself. When Eiko performs in the vast space, she is aware of how tiny her body is. \u201cI become smaller in scale, not only the scale of the space, but of scale in time,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause this cathedral is human-made. It\u2019s not just the scale of how big it is, but it\u2019s more like people actually made this, and how did they do it? That is a history, and there is me again \u2014 this is me going not to the Japanese river, but to a totally different river, like the Amazon or something. I\u2019m really an outsider.\u201dSometimes after her impromptu performances, people recognize her from the photographs on display. Some even hug her. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s actually rather nice for people to see something strange,\u201d she said. \u201cI think life is better with some stranger. And I\u2019m an immigrant. I am not a citizen. Which is no big deal in the dance community, but perhaps it is in a tourist attraction like this. It\u2019s exciting to be on a new train.

That\u2019s a good attitude.I am perhaps the single composite regular \u2014 a little bit of all the women in the studio systems who were girl Fridays and very competent and able. She can hold her own with Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and she wants to have a future in the business. But it\u2019s 1962, so she\u2019s not in control of that for herself.I\u2019m not sure how far we\u2019ve come in 2017.It\u2019s funny \u2014 I have a very big fourth episode, and the first part of it we filmed before the election, and there was a lot of this stuff that was very tongue in cheek at the time: \u201cYou know, some guys don\u2019t like the idea of a woman in charge.\u201d Then we went back [the day after the election] to shoot the rest, and it had a whole different gravitas to it.You\u2019ve described the show as a very female-centric examination of aging in Hollywood.Susan Sarandon said that when she started, 40 was the cutoff, the hard line. That\u2019s it \u2014 roll over and die. And that\u2019s certainly been pushed, specifically by people like Ryan Murphy. He\u2019s a real champion of women. I think there were 15 roles in this show for women over the age of 40.Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys of \u201cThe Americans\u201d got awards love this year, though they didn\u2019t win.Whatever the competition is, it\u2019s not always the best person or the best work that wins. Meryl\u2019s only got three Oscars. It\u2019s clearly a flawed system. But I don\u2019t want to say anything here that\u2019s going to make sure I never get an award \u2014 because I really want one!How do you get those amazing eyebrows?They\u2019ve had this much attitude since I was 5 years old.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Her Memory Fading, Paula Wolfert Fights Back With Food", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported bySONOMA, Calif. \u2014 The first thing Paula Wolfert wants to make a guest is coffee blended with butter from grass-fed cows and something called brain octane oil. She waves a greasy plastic bottle of the oil around her jumble of a kitchen like a preacher who has taken up a serpent.Never mind that this is the woman who introduced tagines, Aleppo pepper and cassoulet to American kitchens, wrote nine cookbooks and once possessed a palate the food writer Ruth Reichl declared the best she\u2019d ever encountered.Ms. Wolfert, 78, has dementia. She can\u2019t cook much, even if she wanted to. Which, by the way, she doesn\u2019t.She learned she probably had Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 2013, but she suspected something wasn\u2019t right long before. Words on a page sometimes made no sense. Complex questions started to baffle her. Since she has always been an audacious and kinetic conversationalist with a touch of hypochondria, friends didn\u2019t notice anything was wrong. Doctors spoke of \u201csenior moments.\u201d\u201cWhat am I going to do, cry about it?\u201d Ms. Wolfert said in an interview at her home this month, the slap of her Brooklyn accent still sharp. After all, she points out, her first husband left her in Morocco with two small children and $2,000: \u201cI cried for 20 minutes and I thought, \u2018This isn\u2019t going to do any good.\u2019\u201dStill, her insatiable drive \u2014 which took her to live with the Beat Generation\u2019s most notable characters in Tangier in 1959 and then propelled her like a pushy anthropologist into countless kitchens around the world \u2014 seems to be working just fine. Ms. Wolfert has been collaborating with a writer on a biography to be published in April. Instead of seeking out recipes, she is eating to save her mind.Thus, the so-called bulletproof coffee she makes every morning and the squares of dark chocolate she eats after lunch, in the belief they will bolster her brainpower. In between, she eats a carbohydrate-free diet built on salmon, berries and greens, along with extracts of turmeric, cinnamon and eggplant.The diet draws on an amalgam of theories she has culled from deep internet research, her doctors, the other dementia patients she meets with every week and long conversations with friends and experts on FaceTime, her favorite place to chat.\u201cYou can talk for an hour and a half, and it doesn\u2019t cost you a dime!\u201d she said. (The Southern food writer James Villas, her good friend, lovingly calls her La Bouche \u2014 the Mouth.)She has happily lost 20 pounds. Friends say she looks remarkably good, younger even. \u201cTurning back the clock, turning back the clock,\u201d she chants cheerfully.Ms. Wolfert hasn\u2019t even eaten bread, a true love, in over a year. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a zombie.\u201dA whole murderers\u2019 row of great American chefs \u2014 Thomas Keller, David Kinch, Judy Rodgers \u2014 has said how much her work mattered. \u201cI have always treasured and loved the vigor of her passionate and intellectual approach to authenticity,\u201d Mario Batali said.Ms. Wolfert started cooking as a young bride, taking classes from the French instructor Dione Lucas, who was famous for her omelets. She became Ms. Lucas\u2019s assistant, then picked up some cooking jobs arranged for her by James Beard.Before food television and celebrity chefs, cookbook authors like her were the nation\u2019s gastronomic guides, traveling the cooking-school circuit like celebrities.She recently put up for sale some cookbooks from Ms. Wolfert\u2019s personal collection, which was deep and specific. A book on the polentas of Venice stamped with Ms. Wolfert\u2019s name is selling for $75.Next month, a book about Ms. Wolfert will debut with an origin story as unconventional as she is. \u201cUnforgettable: The Bold Flavors of Paula Wolfert\u2019s Renegade Life\u201d is a biography interwoven with about 50 recipes. The author is Emily Kaiser Thelin, Ms. Wolfert\u2019s former editor at Food and Wine, who has become as much a daughter as a biographer.In 2006, Ms. Thelin inherited the magazine\u2019s Master Cook column, which included contributions from Jacques P\u00e9pin and Jean-Georges Vongerichten. \u201cI always dealt with their assistants,\u201d Ms. Thelin said.But Ms. Wolfert called her and said, \u201c\u2018O.K., you\u2019re my editor and you need to know I can\u2019t write my way out of a paper bag.\u2019\u201dIn 2008, Ms. Thelin traveled to Morocco to write about Ms. Wolfert for the magazine. Young and intimidated, Ms. Thelin watched her in action. She likens the adventure to \u201ca trip to Kitty Hawk with the Wright Brothers.\u201dMs. Thelin left the magazine in 2010 and moved from New York to Northern California. The two women\u2019s friendship deepened, laced with long conversations about food, reality TV and politics. Ms. Thelin was toying with the idea of a biography. Then came the diagnosis. The biography seemed more important than ever.Ms. Wolfert, it seemed, was yesterday\u2019s news.The loving profile sometimes glosses over comments from critics (which Ms. Wolfert still has quite a sharp memory for). More than a few editors and cooks have found her demand for specific ingredients impossible, the way she delivers extensive knowledge of certain cuisines insufferable and her recipes so complex as to be unworkable.But Ms. Thelin, like many, is a true believer. \u201cI feel like every Paula recipe seems to pull the rug out from under you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think it\u2019s not going to work, but if you keep calm and follow the recipe it does.\u201dMs. Wolfert still has lessons to teach her acolyte. On a recent Saturday, Ms. Thelin spent the morning carefully blanching vegetables that would be seasoned with pancetta in a recipe Ms. Wolfert adapted from Michel Bras, a French chef whom Ms. Wolfert wrote about in 1987.Then they moved onto salmon, using Ms. Wolfert\u2019s master recipe, which calls for steaming the fish over a pan of hot water set in a roughly 250-degree oven. The fish cooks on a very thin pan until it\u2019s tender but juicy and still bright.Ms. Thelin pulled the fillet from the oven, considering how to cut the soft fish into portions. Ms. Wolfert said she should have done so before it was cooked, then took a pair of shears to the fillet. Ms. Thelin was surprised by how tidy the technique was. She never would have thought to use scissors.\u201cYou\u2019re still teaching me things,\u201d she said.She was so enamored of the book that she called Mr. Sercarz\u2019s New York spice store, La Boite, to order a few of his blends to sprinkle on the salmon at lunch.Most of them she couldn\u2019t taste, but one, a blend called cancale, stopped her. Salty and with a strong whiff of fennel and orange, it somehow broke through. She could taste it.\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d she said. \u201cIt reminds me of Morocco.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of one of Paula Wolfert\u2019s publishers. He is Dan Halpern, not Halperin.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byGalleriesThrough March 25. Kravets Wehby Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Manhattan; 212-352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com.This show delineates an impressive multiplicity of methods and subjects. Some works seem inspired by images of gorgeous black women, possibly lifted from magazines, doubling them symmetrically to imply an American present and an African ancestry.Others are enlarged from disturbing news photographs embedded in their surfaces, like the implicitly colonial scene of a black woman in traditional garb and a white man in \u201cVisit Azania\u201d (an ancient word for the southeastern region of Africa that was revived by black nationalists in South Africa during apartheid).Most impressive are several works in a forceful collage style that contrasts smooth and corrugated cardboard. It is first evident here in the stippled symmetry of the masklike \u201cPaternal Homage\u201d of 1971 and expanded upon with the addition of language in \u201cSoweto/So We Too,\u201d of 1979. Political posters, ancient mosaics, and indigenous textiles and fashion mingle here, fused by pride in being and joy in making. Fury, too.ROBERTA SMITHThrough April 23. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 170 Suffolk Street, Manhattan; 212-274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com.In his New York solo debut, \u201cAll New Women,\u201d the young German painter Leonhard Hurzlmeier explores relatively unfamiliar ground in the gap between abstraction and representation, pushing toward both illustration and pure geometry.One of his guides seems to be the elegantly abbreviated, hard-edge figuration devised between the world wars by the Russian-born French graphic genius known as A. M. Cassandre (1901-1968). But the images are enriched by fluency in modern art, especially Cubism and Picasso\u2019s two-faced heads, curvaceous Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter images and monumental beached nudes. While echoing L\u00e9ger\u2019s stylization, his figures fit the frame as meticulously as any Mondrian grid.Flattened yet statuesque, these agile Amazons are frequently in motion, their poses simplified by strong colors. \u201cBandy Mandy\u201d shows a large woman in purple with orange hair, crouching on skates against light blue. Her white hockey stick bisects the image diagonally; nearly all else adheres to right angles, except for the curves of breasts, elbow and rump. \u201cLeisure,\u201d which shows a woman in summer white riding a bicycle and accompanied by her dog, is divided by a series of horizontal lines and forms. And in \u201cRebellion,\u201d a running woman brandishes a banner of hot pink \u2014 the color of the day \u2014 whose curling corners echo those of her raincoat.Strength and monumentality can be scary. There is a definite dark side to the tiara-topped woman of \u201cRobber Baroness,\u201d who both wears and steals pearls, and the not-so-motherly prison guard of \u201cJailhouse Queen/The Provider,\u201d who regurgitates food to unclear purpose. Smaller works on paper, board and canvas are often as deft, and rendered more loosely.ROBERTA SMITHThrough April 2. Bodega, 167 Rivington Street, Manhattan; bodega-us.org.Neither attacking the notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d nor mining its craft-based, collaborative potential to revitalize art practice is a new idea, though both are still needed. But what makes this work so striking is how powerfully it brings out the ambiguous violence of all image-making, Ms. Yago\u2019s as much as Courbet\u2019s. The felt sheets start as rectangles, but the cutouts leave them distorted and fragile, as if the only way to mark a surface were to partly destroy it. The orange dye looks like blooms of rust, and the green like mold. And the bottom edge of \u201cThe Grain Sifters,\u201d under a long slit, hangs open like a grimacing lip.WILL HEINRICHThrough April 8. Koenig & Clinton, 459 West 19th Street, Manhattan; 212-334-9255, koenigandclinton.com.The final effect is disruptive and uncanny. Because of Ms. Faruqee\u2019s palette, her paintings feel weirdly spectral and photographic; because of the layered patterns, the surfaces appear to be moving at times.In the same way Seurat and Ms. Riley worked with color and pattern when the technologies of their time \u2014 like electric lighting for Seurat and television for Ms. Riley \u2014 were altering human vision and perception, Ms. Faruqee\u2019s work serves as an analog counterpoint to pixels and liquid crystal displays. She has created rigorous works that engage the eye, the body and the brain and make you think about how we perceive and process visual information today.MARTHA SCHWENDENERAdvertisement"}

There was no indication of foul play, according to the police in Virginia Beach.Live streaming of video game playing has become popular in recent years. The activity has taken center stage on sites like YouTube and Twitch, which has nearly 10 million daily visitors. Professional game streamers, who often combine the prowess of an elite player with the patter of a talk radio disc jockey, can sometimes make a living off these sites through advertising, subscriptions and other revenue sources.Yet would-be professional streamers typically endure a relentless grind to build an audience. Anytime they leave their computers, they risk having followers peel away to another channel. The resulting lifestyle is often unhealthy, requiring long sedentary periods with little sleep. Some gamers are fueled by junk food, caffeine and alcohol.The streaming lifestyle, like that of some other stationary professions, \u201cintuitively and medically seems such an unwise way to spend one\u2019s years,\u201d said Dr. James A.

First up on the agenda? \u201cSaving Washington.\u201dThat\u2019s the title of the inaugural exhibition \u2014 and fighting words, perhaps, to those who take a more fatherly view of the founding. Take heart, patriarchal patriots: It\u2019s a nod to Dolley Madison\u2019s famous rescue of a portrait of George Washington from the White House during the War of 1812, before the British arrived and burned the place.But it\u2019s also a metaphor for the complex ways that American women \u2014 well-born and ordinary, free and enslaved \u2014 helped, as the show\u2019s curator, Valerie Paley, put it, \u201cenact the Constitution on the ground.\u201dThe historical society opened its doors in 1804, and the founding period is what Ms. Paley calls the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the collection. The exhibition starts with an array of manuscripts, dueling pistols, imposing oil portraits and other objects arranged in a snug opening gallery Ms. Paley has nicknamed \u201cthe man cave.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the picture of the founding we\u2019re familiar with,\u201d she said. (Or mostly familiar with: Who knew that gentlemen periodically had their powdered wigs boiled?)From there, it opens into a more female-centric view of early America, highlighting the flesh-and-blood women who helped define liberty, freedom, democracy and other concepts so often depicted by allegorical female figures. The show puts famous women like Sarah Jay, the wife of John Jay, and Phyllis Wheatley, the first published African-American poet, alongside less acknowledged players. That the George III statue on Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan was torn down by an angry (male) mob and melted down for musket balls is well known. But who did the melting? The women and children of Litchfield, Conn.Which isn\u2019t to say this is a populist take that eschews elite glamour. The central figure is Dolley Madison, whose transformation of the just-built White House into a vibrant social space is paid clever tribute in a bells-and-whistles central gallery.Out with the \u201ccold, drafty place\u201d of patriotic austerity (as Ms. Paley put it) cultivated by the White House\u2019s previous inhabitant, Thomas Jefferson. Dolley Madison, the show argues, turned it into a place of cross-partisan conversation and civility, and threw the doors open to the broader public in her famous \u201cWednesday night squeezes,\u201d as one wag of the time put it.The installation brings a similar breath of fresh air to the stodgy period-room concept. Yes, there are teacups, silverware, jewelry and other decorous objects (not to mention a mannequin wearing one of Madison\u2019s elegant gowns and a beyond-\u201cpussy-hat\u201d headdress).But the mirrored walls and on-trend white-on-white palette \u2014 sprinkled with a dash of intense color from period paint and fabric sample books shown in one case \u2014 are more Elle Decor than Colonial Williamsburg. Giant cutouts based on photographs of costumed re-enactors are scattered around the room, evoking the guests (and enslaved servants) at the squeezes.There\u2019s a serious argument behind the stylishness: that women, despite their exclusion from formal politics, engaged in meaningful, informal politicking. It\u2019s driven playfully home by two touch-screen tables, where visitors can play an interactive game.At the men\u2019s table, a two-seater titled \u201cZero-Sum Game,\u201d you can engage in what the exhibit calls \u201cmale political combativeness\u201d over issues like trade or the need for a standing army. (Disclosure: This female reporter racked up big \u201chonor points\u201d but quit before she got killed in a duel.)At the other table, a mixed crowd engages in seemingly apolitical conversational thrusts and parries, getting things done in deeply partisan times while also reinforcing a sense of \u201cunity and civility,\u201d as Ms. Paley put it.\u201cWe wanted to use the table as a metaphor,\u201d Ms. Paley said, \u201cand ask, what\u2019s on or off the table at any given moment, politically? And what\u2019s under the table?\u201dA final room takes the story up through the mid-19th century, showing how a broader range of women jumped more directly \u2014 and collectively \u2014 into politics, powering various reform movements (temperance, abolition) and ultimately demanding political rights for themselves at the Seneca Falls Rights Convention in upstate New York in 1848.Dolley Madison died in 1849, having lived long enough to attend the groundbreaking of the Washington Monument in 1848, the same year as the Seneca Falls convention. (That aspiring phallic symbol is shown, still half-built, in a photograph from around 1860.)Also present at that groundbreaking was Elizabeth Hamilton, the widow of Alexander Hamilton, a onetime political opponent of James Madison.\u201cThey understood the power of symbolism,\u201d Ms. Paley said. \u201cAnd that included how important they themselves were as living symbols of the past.\u201dAn article on Friday about \u201cSaving Washington,\u201d an exhibition about early female patriots, at the New-York Historical Society, erroneously attributed a distinction to Thomas Jefferson. He was the first president to live in the White House from the beginning of his term, but not the first president ever to live there. (John Adams moved in at the very end of his term, in 1800, before being succeeded by Jefferson, in 1801.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Your Favorite Designer\u2019s Favorite Bookseller Fires Up a Printing Press", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 At 101 Wardour Street in Soho, where Elton John once ran Rocket Record Company, there is a small office library stacked with nearly every issue of Franca Sozzani\u2019s Italian Vogue; old copies of Lei and Per Lui; and books on 1970s photo-realist painting and ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging.Kanye West has been here (his security had to come around first to clear the space). So has Calvin Klein. So has virtually every top photographer and most top fashion designers, though discretion forbids Angela Hill and David Owen, the proprietors, from naming names.You may know Idea from its corners at Dover Street Market in New York or in London, where it has kept a concession in books and magazines for years. You may have seen its selections on shelves in other fashion stores: Bookmarc, Marc Jacobs\u2019s bookstore-boutique, in New York or Los Angeles, or, a few years back, at Kenzo in Paris.Idea is omnivorous in its aesthetic diet. Ms. Hill and Mr. Owen\u2019s recent passions include obscurities on English gentlemen\u2019s clubs, Japanese photographs of hippies in \u201970s Big Sur, bootleg D.I.Y. fanzines about River Phoenix and cult-film marketing materials.Idea began as a side project for Ms. Hill, who had worked as a photographer and stylist in the \u201990s, to profit from her collection of rare and vintage books. She began supplying a steady stream of them, first to Colette, the famous Paris concept shop, then to Dover Street Market. Eventually, Mr. Owen, a former journalist and copywriter, left his job in the music industry to join her full time. (He is responsible for the Idea voice, an omniscient narration of ongoing obsession.)When Instagram was introduced, they embraced it as an ideal platform for displaying and selling the volumes they snap up from all over the world. While only a small fraction of their 278,000 followers actually buy the books, with costs that can rise into the four figures for the rarest, Mr. Owen estimates they now get 500 inquiry emails a day, from executives and fashion students alike.\u201cEven if you\u2019re the Met, you still have to be the first one to contact them\u201d for an in-demand book, said Julie L\u00ea, the librarian at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute, who buys from Idea for the museum\u2019s library.It is commerce by way of appreciation.\u201cAll we really ever wanted to do was look at something that we thought was amazing and then show it to someone else, because we were so excited about it,\u201d Mr. Owen said. \u201cWe found that if we sold the book that we were so excited about at a profit, then we could get paid and run a company out of enthusiasm for sharing things that we really liked. That\u2019s not gone away at all.\u201dAs Idea\u2019s collaborator list grew (it now includes the photographers David Sims, Terry Richardson and Collier Schorr), larger brands began to notice. At the beginning of 2016, in what Ms. Hill describes as \u201copening the floodgates,\u201d Demna Gvasalia, at the height of the mania for his Vetements label, published a 304-page book of behind-the-scenes photos with Idea. Suddenly, the biggest brands, those that ordinarily would head for established art-book presses, were calling. Gucci tapped Idea for \u201cEpiphany,\u201d a book of photos by Ari Marcopoulos, which arrived that spring.\u201cNow we\u2019ve got books to do and meetings to have with all of the labels who are as big as Gucci,\u201d Mr. Owen said. \u201cBut it\u2019s about them finding something that works with us.\u201dThe Idea model is flexible enough to include the biggest players but also the lesser-known lights of the fashion system. When Ms. Hill approached Suzanne Koller, the respected but discreet co-founder of the twice-yearly magazine Self Service, to do a book, Ms. Koller was surprised. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the career of someone like Grace,\u201d she said, referring to Grace Coddington, the now-famous creative director at large of American Vogue. The result was \u201cRed Lips, Attitudes and Other Obsessions,\u201d a small, softbound zine of work from throughout her career, whose covers Ms. Koller, her assistant and her children hand-plastered with stickers for a gonzo touch. (\u201cIt\u2019s not like a Steidl coffee-table book,\u201d Ms. Koller said dryly.) It, like many of Idea\u2019s books, quickly sold out.Part of that is down to the small editions Idea produces: as few as 500 (in the case of Ms. Koller) or as many as 5,000 (in the case of Vetements). Mass production and mass acceptance are not the point. Its books are only sold directly or via a handful of selected stores. \u201cWe deliberately do not put an ISBN number on them because we don\u2019t want them getting on Amazon,\u201d Ms. Hill said. Editions this size can sell quickly, ego-boostingly, and completely as instant collectibles. They are also more affordable: the least expensive around $20, and the average around $60.If the books\u2019 rapid success is a boost to their creators, it also throws a shine on their buyers.It is a savvy move of Idea\u2019s to invite customers as well as creatives into its haloed orbit, essentially rewarding them for having the good taste to buy. In so doing, it taps into a truth not always acknowledged: That much of shopping is about validation; for books, no less than clothes or cars or jewelry, can be a powerful identifier.Mr. Owen identified two types of shopping: one for duties and tasks (\u201cyour groceries, renewing car insurance, horrible things\u201d) and one for self-expression. \u201cThat type of shopping is purely creative for people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe treat everybody as creative. That underpins everything that we do. We only understand people who are, basically. So we just talk to everyone that way, and it\u2019s like an automatic filter. People who just don\u2019t get it, who are really not in any way creative, are put off by us somehow.\u201dAnd those that do get it, appreciate it all the more.They include the heads of brands that have begun to hire Idea as a consultant, and the magazines that hire Idea to promote or distribute them, and, thanks to Instagram, the many more who like it literally. It has proven a good litmus test for what the base will go for, in addition to a source of ideas. When the ikebana manual got thousands of likes, Idea contacted its author \u2014 an octogenarian theater professor emeritus of art and design in Illinois \u2014 and got permission to run up a series of shirts with his images.\u201cIsn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cYou can get more likes on that than you can literally if you were allowed to put up a naked Kate Moss. You do better on flower arranging.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Money-Losing Snap Could Be Worth So Much", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Common SenseTesting the upper limits of valuation, Snap\u2019s investors are betting on the kind of rapid growth that few, if any, companies have ever achieved.Supported byBy now, even most of us over 35 \u2014 old age, by Snapchat standards \u2014 are aware of the photo sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial America.Even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that self-destruct, or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow, turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts, you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $34 billion.At that price, Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook \u2014 not to mention such internet stalwarts as Google, Amazon and even Netflix \u2014 look like bargain-basement \u201cvalue\u201d stocks.Snap \u201clooks tremendously overvalued to me,\u201d said Brian Hamilton, a co-founder of Sageworks, a financial analysis and valuation firm.Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Snap as a \u201cfield of dreams.\u201d Even with rosy growth forecasts, \u201cat $22 billion, we\u2019re looking at a stock trading at five to eight times estimated revenues in 2020,\u201d he said before the valuation rose even higher. \u201cThe only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba, and they have massive scale. And both of them are profitable.\u201dMajor I.P.O.s of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992.So let\u2019s be generous and ignore profit. How about revenue? Snap said it generated $404 million in sales in 2016. A valuation of $34 billion is about 84 times revenue.That\u2019s six times as high as Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio, which is 14. It\u2019s 14 times as high as Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which trades at just over six times revenue. Amazon trades at a mere three times. Even high-flying Netflix trades at seven times.Compared with Snap, however, those are mature companies, whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as they\u2019ve aged. As Mr. Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry Gold put it in a recent note to clients: \u201cThere is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all. The sky\u2019s the limit and history is not a guide.\u201dTo justify a valuation of even $25 billion, \u201cyou have to make some very lofty assumptions,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cThey would need to grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent, which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly.\u201d He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the history of American business.But let\u2019s ignore revenue, too. This is social media, after all, where \u201cdaily active users\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d are the coins of the realm.And $1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for Snap. At $34 billion, each of Snap\u2019s daily active users is worth $215, six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for Instagram.As of January, Instagram reported 300 million daily active users. At $215 each, the Instagram app alone would be valued today at $64.5 billion.These are static numbers, and what Snap is selling investors is growth. According to Snap\u2019s prospectus, Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016, about the same as the year before. If it can pull that off again next year, it would reach an impressive 234 million users, though still short of Instagram.The Snapchat story \u201cis all about growth,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about economics.\u201dBut Snapchat\u2019s growth slowed sharply in last year\u2019s fourth quarter \u2014 just about the time Instagram started its own version of Stories, a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos. It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters.By comparison, 150 million Instagram users are now using its Stories feature. That\u2019s already nearly as many as Snapchat\u2019s entire user base.Maybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user, even if its user base doesn\u2019t grow all that much. It\u2019s currently generating an average of $5.83 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebook\u2019s North American average of $12.81, the MoffettNathanson analysis notes, suggesting plenty of room to grow.But even doubling revenue doesn\u2019t get Snap close to a Facebook valuation.There are, of course, superhigh revenue and user-growth assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuation.Still, very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels (and I looked for some). The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as $30 billion. But that\u2019s based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of $3.8 billion in 2018.Mr. Gold said some investors were buying into the I.P.O., but not to hold Snap for the long term. \u201cPeople are saying they\u2019ll wait for a valuation that\u2019s truly astronomical, and then take the other side of the bet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run into trouble over the next few quarters.\u201dDespite many of its somewhat juvenile features, at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate, substituting images for language. \u201cSnapchat has built a better mousetrap,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s engaging, and it\u2019s fun, especially for young people.\u201dThat\u2019s a story that obviously appealed to investors starving for the next hot social media company. Whether they\u2019ll want to cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains to be seen.\u201cThis looks and smells like Twitter to me,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time, if ever, before they see any meaningful appreciation.\u201dAbout the best Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Gold could come up with: Snap\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t \u201cpatently crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low-Energy Intruder Hangs Out in a High-Tech Home", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "Supported byCrime SceneThe person who entered the apartment was not the one who was expected there, and as of that moment in February, a modern, Brooklyn version of \u201cGoldilocks and the Three Bears\u201d played out over a night and a day, the cold porridge and broken chair replaced by fast Wi-Fi and weed.Once upon a time, a 26-year-old software developer named Sam moved into an apartment in Williamsburg. That was about four months ago. He was traveling in Argentina on business in February, so he joined what has become a cottage industry in New York City, listing his home on a website for short-term rentals.On Feb. 22, he was contacted by a potential client: Meg from California, who wanted the place that very night. Short notice, but Sam, who asked that his last name be withheld because he was the victim of a crime, agreed for one reason.\u201cShe had excellent reviews,\u201d Sam recalled last week by telephone from Argentina. He quoted one: \u201cMeg leaves the place cleaner than when she found it.\u201d So he agreed and explained where Meg could find the keys.Sam keeps a motion-activated camera in his apartment trained on his front door when he is away. It is not hidden, and he said he told guests about it upfront, and invited them to unplug it if they wanted. It is one of several gadgets he owns, along with an Amazon Echo, the voice-controlled speaker and personal assistant.Hours after his exchanges with Meg, he received a picture sent by the camera, taken moments earlier. It showed a man, alone, entering the apartment with a duffel bag.Suspicious, Sam texted Meg: \u201cWere you able to get in?\u201dCame the reply: \u201cYes, Sam,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe already feel at home. LOL.\u201dSam was skeptical \u2014 \u201cI thought it was strange that he was speaking as though another person was with him,\u201d he said \u2014 but he let it go.All was quiet for a few hours. Then Sam received another alert from his camera, this one regarding its air-quality monitor, which detected an airborne foreign substance.\u201cThis guy is smoking weed,\u201d Sam said.At about the same time, Sam received yet another alert, from Amazon, seeking verification of his recent spoken-command purchase using the Echo \u2014 an iPhone 7.Sam texted: \u201cWhy are you ordering an iPhone on my credit card?\u201dAccording to Sam, the man replied: \u201cSorry, I was just curious.\u201d Sam gained access to the camera feed. \u201cHe was just doing weird stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWalking around naked.\u201d The man noticed the camera and turned it toward the wall, and, a while later, turned it back.Sam pulled up Meg\u2019s account information, he said, and noticed a cellphone number he had not seen before. He called, and Meg herself answered. He explained the situation.She looked at her account and saw trouble, Sam said. She told him that someone had used her account to book a recent string of back-to-back stays in apartments, and the apartment owners had reported damage, Sam said. Any negative feedback they may have written had not yet appeared.\u201cYou should call 911,\u201d Meg told him. \u201cI have no idea who is in your apartment.\u201dSam found he could not call 911 from Argentina, so he called his local police precinct in Greenpoint. It was around 2 a.m. on Feb. 23 in Brooklyn, and the officer who answered said there was nothing she could do, Sam recalled.\u201cA renter needs to be physically present to report a break-in,\u201d Sam said he had been told. (The police said last week that at that time, any dispute sounded civil in nature, and not criminal, because Sam had agreed to rent out his home.)In Williamsburg, the man was tucking himself in for the night, his sole companion Alexa, the name of the Echo\u2019s virtual assistant, who records every command that comes her way.\u201cHe turned off the music, turned off the lights,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHe asked Alexa for a bedtime story.\u201dSorry, Alexa replied. I don\u2019t have any audiobooks in Sam\u2019s library right now.In Argentina and feeling helpless, Sam turned to Facebook.\u201cSomeone broke into my apartment last night and is sleeping in my bed right now (creepy),\u201d Sam wrote.His friends responded: \u201cOMG.\u201d \u201cSorry this is happening bro.\u201d One offered to go to the building, call 911 and report an intruder.The next morning, the man awoke and, according to Sam, threw all his clothes in the washing machine. He took a picture of the gloomy scene out a window, the skyline shrouded in fog, and posted it on his own Facebook page. \u201cThis weather,\u201d it read in part, with no indication of where he was.Sam\u2019s friend arrived and called the police. Sam, about 5,500 miles away, watched his camera as officers arrived.\u201cThey opened the door and had their guns out,\u201d he said.The officers arrested the man in the apartment, and Sam posted a photo of him leaving in handcuffs. The police identified him as Amir Lewis, 21, of Crown Heights, Brooklyn. He was charged with burglary and trespassing. His lawyer declined to comment on Thursday.Sam returned to the country and his apartment on Friday and discovered a final indignity in the kitchen, one that would have been familiar to those three bears.\u201cHe baked a pizza,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHe cleaned out my fridge and freezer.\u201dThe End.Advertisement"}

Given the popularity of stationary home robotic systems like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home personal assistants as well as dozens of other internet-connected devices like doorbells, video cameras and even light bulbs, it appears that consumers are willing to trust that manufacturers are building adequate security into the products.It is common for manufacturers that do not have good security practices to not know how to deal with vulnerability reports. Most of them probably do not have a procedure in place to handle reports and neither to provide security fixes to customers.Robots are widely used in manufacturing. But they are largely systems like robot arms that do not have autonomous functions and cannot move around in the environment.There is a growing consensus that during the next decade, advances in artificial intelligence will make it possible for robots to move freely in unstructured environments. This will bring self-driving cars closer to reality and will also lead to a generation of machines that will operate autonomously in homes, offices and factories.The authors of the new report challenged the robotics industry, saying that not enough attention was being given to well-known security issues that have proved devastating for existing commercial computer networks.\u201cWe call it an internet-of-things with arms and legs and wheels,\u201d said Cesar Cerrudo, chief technology officer of IOActive. \u201cThe surface of attack is huge. Each robot has multiple ways it can be compromised.\u201dThe researchers said that robot makers were rushing their products to market without giving adequate consideration to security.\u201cVendors like to add features that please the public,\u201d said Lucas Apa, a senior security consultant at IOActive and one of the authors of the report. \u201cThey forget about important issues. Robots can have microphones and cameras; they can walk and they can grab objects. People don\u2019t realize the consequences of something that can grab an object or can hear or see you.\u201dThe report identifies security flaws in a number of robots, including NAO and Pepper home robots made by SoftBank Robotics; and manufacturing robots from Universal Robots and Rethink Robotics, two makers of robot arms that are intended to collaborate with human workers in assembly line applications. It also identifies flaws in small humanoid robots made by UBTECH Robotics and Robotis, and in robotics software developed by Asratec Corp.The report identifies seven different kinds of security issues, ranging from weak cryptographic systems and vulnerable default configurations to what security experts call authentication issues.In some cases, they noted that it was possible to control some robot functions without authentication.\u201cWe found key robot services that didn\u2019t require a username and password, allowing anyone to remotely access those services,\u201d the report said.One of the robot manufacturers identified by the report disputed the findings. Two of the criticisms leveled by the researchers actually involved \u201cfeatures\u201d added for research and education markets, according to Gil Haylon, a Rethink Robotics spokesman. He added that other vulnerabilities had been \u201cphased out\u201d in the latest software release for the company\u2019s Baxter and Sawyer robots, which are intended for light assembly operations.Universal Robots said it was looking into the issue raised by the researchers. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Critics on Climate Policy Hope Executives Can Sway Him", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byJeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric\u2019s chief executive, says climate change is real, a position at odds with the Trump administration.As a member of a White House manufacturing advisory council, he also has President Trump\u2019s ear. And environmentalists are counting on Mr. Immelt, and other executives close to the president, to use that access to argue for policies to combat global warming when the White House is rolling them back.\u201cMr. Trump says the business perspective is especially important, so hearing the business voice is critical,\u201d said Kevin Moss, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington.\u201cThe companies are demonstrating that it\u2019s in their business interest to take action on climate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more they\u2019re willing to say that and take action, the stronger the message comes across.\u201dThose hopes have become increasingly urgent as Mr. Trump \u2014 against the warnings of scientists, environmentalists and even the government\u2019s own research \u2014 has moved to nullify the Obama administration\u2019s efforts on climate change.In a joint statement after the order, a group of technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, urged Mr. Trump to stay the course.\u201cStrong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change,\u201d they said.That action also spurred Mr. Immelt to write a blog post to G.E.\u2019s 300,000 employees in which he criticized the rollback.Jennifer Friedman, a General Electric spokeswoman, declined to say whether Mr. Immelt intended to relay his thoughts to Mr. Trump personally. Many other companies also declined to commit their executives to intervening with the president on climate-related policies.But Ms. Friedman emphasized that Mr. Immelt was outspoken, and she cited G.E.\u2019s focus on clean energy, including Current, a subsidiary that focuses on products and services in energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage to large customers.\u201cHe\u2019s pretty out there and clear,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s his position in every conversation he has.\u201dA PepsiCo spokesman, Jay Cooney, said the company believes that \u201ccombating climate change is critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers and our world.\u201d Kevin Gardner of Walmart, said its environmental commitments were \u201cembedded in our business.\u201dThomas Hushen, spokesman for Campbell Soup, said the company supported \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in the Paris agreement and the continuation of low-carbon policies and investment in a low-carbon economy.\u201d Campbell\u2019s chief executive, Denise Morrison, participates in Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory council because \u201cwe believe it is important to have a voice on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees.\u201d Mr. Hushen said.Corporations, especially those with strong consumer brands, have been increasingly responsive to customer and shareholder concerns about climate change. And the global nature of their businesses means many of their customers are in countries where there is a greater acceptance of the science behind climate change, and the need to tackle it.Walmart, Intel, General Motors and Lockheed Martin \u2014 all of which have senior executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business councils \u2014 have signed on to the principles of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofit groups working to make corporate purchases of renewable energy easier. Last year, General Motors said it would generate or procure 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050.Dell, another company with the president\u2019s ear, says it expects to reduce the energy intensity of its products by 80 percent by 2020.\u201cIn many cases, I think businesses disagree with the administration,\u201d said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder resolutions to advocate for greater corporate environmental and social responsibility.\u201cPeople still care about climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cThe administration may not, but they do have consumers and employees and reputations to uphold.\u201dAn Intel spokeswoman, Katie Lewallen, said, \u201cRegardless of regulatory changes, we intend to continue our commitment to environmental stewardship, including working to fulfill the climate change pledge we made in 2015.\u201dEnvironmentalists also worry about the influence of companies that have opposed climate regulations. General Motors and Ford, for example, successfully advocated a review of stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution.Businesses are pushing for policies to fight climate change \u201cbecause of a well-balanced economic judgment of whether or not they should,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group.He added that sentiment among corporate executives had, after the 2009 global climate conference in Copenhagen, shifted away from the belief that fighting climate change would be too expensive.\u201cIn Paris, there was a very significant number of business leaders that had changed their minds and considered that it was going to hurt the economy if we don\u2019t do something,\u201d he said.Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Chairman at Paramount Pictures Faces an Arduous Task", "Date": "2017-03-27", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Viacom has turned to one of Hollywood\u2019s most seasoned and respected executives, James N. Gianopulos, to revive its faded Paramount Pictures operation.But some analysts worry that Paramount is already too far gone.Mr. Gianopulos, who turns 65 in April, will take over as chairman of Paramount on April 3, Viacom said on Monday. Mr. Gianopulos, the consummate Hollywood insider who is treasurer of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, previously ran 20th Century Fox.But any turnaround at Paramount is years away under the best of circumstances.Moreover, the few series that Paramount has are weakening. The last \u201cTransformers\u201d movie, released in 2014, took in 30 percent less in North America than its predecessor. (The next chapter, \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight,\u201d arrives in June.) Paramount\u2019s aging \u201cStar Trek\u201d film series hit a similar snag last year. Its \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise is anchored by Tom Cruise, and how long he can remain an action star is an open question.\u201cWe don\u2019t think Paramount has enough top-tier intellectual property to successfully dig its way out of the profitability hole it finds itself in,\u201d Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a recent report.Mr. Gianopulos worked at Paramount before. In the mid-1980s, he was the studio\u2019s senior vice president for business affairs and international operations. It was a boom time. In 1986, Paramount had five of the year\u2019s 10 top-selling films at the domestic box office, including \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d and \u201cCrocodile Dundee.\u201dBut the movie business has changed substantially. With streaming services like Amazon and Netflix as new competitors for leisure time and movie attendance in the United States flat, studios have veered toward extravagant, effects-driven films that can play on a global stage. Mr. Creutz estimated that 30 movies with budgets of $100 million or more will be released this year, seven more than in 2015.He added that Mr. Gianopulos would have \u201ca running start\u201d because of Paramount teams \u201cwho are right now exploring new ways to strengthen the studio and position it for success.\u201d A spokeswoman declined to make Mr. Bakish or Mr. Gianopulos available for interviews.Despite its challenges, Paramount retains signs of life. The studio\u2019s marketing and publicity departments are considered strong. Mr. Grey started a fledgling television production business that could grow into a profit center. And several coming movies could be hits, including \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d a science-fiction action drama set for release on Friday; and \u201cBaywatch,\u201d a raunchy adaptation of the lifeguard television series.In some ways, Mr. Gianopulos may take comfort in Paramount\u2019s long-term history: The studio has battled its way back from the brink before.In the early 1960s, hobbled by cost-cutting and the release of contract players after the forced sale of its theater chain, Paramount was nearly shuttered and sold for the real estate value of its lot. Instead, a new corporate boss, having little to lose, brought in a brash, untested producer \u2014 Robert Evans \u2014 to run the place. The result was a creative rebirth that led to seminal hits like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cChinatown.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recycled Rockets Could Drop Costs, Speed Space Travel", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported bySpaceX did something on Thursday that really hadn\u2019t been done before: launch a cheaper, partially-used rocket into orbit.The rocket, carrying a telecommunications satellite, launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.The recovered booster was ferried to port in Jacksonville. Company officials have not provided many details about the refurbishment. In January, the booster, securely held down, was test-fired at SpaceX\u2019s facility in Texas. It was then shipped to Florida to be prepared for launch.Adapting car dealer terminology, Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating office of SpaceX, has called the booster \u201cpre-flown.\u201d Martin Halliwell, the chief technology officer of SES, whose satellite is on top of the rocket, describes it as \u201cflight proven.\u201dThe used booster indeed worked just as well as a new one. \u201cWe just had an incredible day today,\u201d Mr. Musk said.It is cheaper than using a new rocket, potentially much cheaper.Until now, rockets have almost all been single-use. Once the fuel is expended, a rocket stage plummets to Earth, a quick demise for a complex machine that cost tens of millions of dollars to build.Mr. Musk has likened that to scrapping a 747 jet after one flight, which would make air travel impossibly expensive.We do not know. Ms. Shotwell, the SpaceX executive, has suggested launches with reused boosters could be discounted, to 30 percent off the usual $62 million price tag. SES asked for 50 percent off. Both SpaceX and SES are private companies, and they have not divulged the negotiated going rate, except to acknowledge there was a discount.Mr. Musk has suggested that rocket launches could eventually be much cheaper since the cost of the rocket propellants are less than 1 percent of the full-price ticket for a launch. So, if a rocket could be simply refueled like a jetliner for another flight, the cost of space travel could drop to a fraction of what it is now.But the stresses of spaceflight on reused boosters \u2014 like the rising mileage on a used car, sometimes called \u201cpre-owned\u201d in today\u2019s parlance \u2014 are much greater. The economics will depend on how many times a booster can be flown, and how much the individual expense will be to refurbish the booster \u2014 and particularly the engines \u2014 each time.NASA\u2019s space shuttles were the first real attempt at a reusable spaceship, but the shuttles proved more delicate than hoped, requiring an army of technicians to refurbish them between flights. As a result, they ended up to be more expensive, not cheaper, than expendable rockets \u2014 close to half a billion dollars a flight.From the start, SpaceX engineers designed the Falcon 9 boosters to be reusable. The engines can be fired many times, and the bottom of the rocket is shielded to protect against the heat of re-entry into the atmosphere.On the first Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX attempted to use parachutes to recover the boosters, but that failed. The company then turned to using the booster\u2019s nine engines to bring it down to a soft, precise landing. \u201cGrid fins\u201d and cold-jet thrusters on the booster are used to flip the booster and help steer it to its destination.Blue Origin, a rocket start-up from Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is also betting big on reusable rockets. It is starting smaller with its suborbital New Shepard spacecraft that is to take space tourists on short jaunts to space. (Blue Origin will be showing off New Shepard at a space conference next week.)New Shepard has already made repeated hops above 62 miles, the altitude considered the boundary of outer space. However, unlike Falcon 9, it has not and cannot accelerate to the speeds needed to orbit Earth.Older rocket companies like United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, have studied reusable rocket concepts in the past but concluded the trade-offs were not worth the benefits. For example, saving fuel for the booster landing reduces the amount of payload the rocket can take to orbit, and reusing rockets could raise the cost of building new ones, because fewer would be built.The United Launch Alliance is planning a bit of reusability for its next rocket, the Vulcan. But instead of landing the entire first stage, the plan is for the engine compartment \u2014 the most valuable piece \u2014 to eject and descend via parachute, and then be plucked out of the air by a helicopter.Blue Origin and SpaceX appear to be betting that cheaper launches will lead to many more flights into space, for commercial and tourism jaunts.NASA is currently developing the Space Launch System, which is to become the most powerful rocket ever, to take astronauts to deep space and eventually Mars. The booster stage, with four engines, and two additional boosters on the sides, will all be thrown away every launch.Daniel Dumbacher, a former NASA official who oversaw development of S.L.S. and now a professor at Purdue University, said the agency did study the possibility. But it concluded that the rocket\u2019s immense size and the small number of launches \u2014 one every year or two \u2014 were not worth the cost.SpaceX originally intended to recover Falcon 9\u2019s second stage, too. That is the piece that continues to lift the payload to space as the booster falls away. But the second stage goes much higher and faster, making it much more difficult to bring it back down in one piece. Given that it\u2019s a smaller, less expensive part of the rocket with one engine instead of nine, the company gave up that effort.Not directly. The Falcon 9 is far too small for interplanetary trips. Even the larger Falcon Heavy that SpaceX plans to start launching this summer is too small for taking people there. (SpaceX wants to use the Falcon Heavy to send a Dragon capsule without people to Mars in 2020.) But Mr. Musk envisions a gargantuan spaceship he calls the Interplanetary Transport System that will someday transport humans. That would be far too expensive to be thrown away, so he needs to solve the reusability problem.The satellite is SES-10, which will end up in a geostationary orbit to provide telecommunication services for Latin America. The satellite was deployed about a half-hour after launch.SpaceX\u2019s next launch for NASA, a cargo mission currently scheduled for May, will continue the reusability theme. The rocket will be entirely new, but the mission will reuse one of the capsules from one of the earlier cargo runs.Advertisement"}

Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, said at a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday.\u201cThis is not shoplifting,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is organized crime.\u201dThis week, investigators said they seized more than $1 million in stolen goods and over $7.7 million from the defendants, some of whom could face sentences of up to 25 years.Richard Rimbaugh, 64, of Manhattan, and George Athanasatos, 62, of Brooklyn, were accused of leading the ring. When investigators entered Mr. Rimbaugh\u2019s apartment to arrest him, Mr. Schneiderman said, they found piles of electronics and witnessed firsthand the arrival of a new delivery: five more packages of stolen merchandise.Mr. Rimbaugh, known as The General within the ring, requested specific items and resold them on Amazon and eBay, while Mr. Athanasatos, who was called the Field Marshall, closely managed the crime teams and issued credit cards to cover their travel expenses, according to Mr. Schneiderman.Mr. Athanasatos was also indicted on a separate charge of welfare fraud conspiracy.Mr. Schneiderman, whose Organized Crime Task Force led the investigation with support from state police, stood in front of an array of electronic equipment in unopened \u2014 if slightly battered \u2014 packages. Behind him was a map of the United States that he said was removed from Mr. Athanasatos\u2019 apartment. The map had colored stickpins that investigators said represented targeted stores.Those stickpins were not only clustered along the eastern corridor; they were scattered as far north as Minnesota, as far South as Texas, and as far West as California.The sprawling operation covered 28 states and was \u201cextremely sophisticated and complicated,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said. But the thefts themselves were decidedly low-tech.The lower-level operatives, the authorities said, walked into big-box stores with tailor-made denim vests full of hidden pockets. They used shortwave radios to listen in on security workers, and carried bulky electronic devices to deactivate security alarms.The ten-month investigation, \u201cOperation Sticky Fingers,\u201d used surveillance, wiretaps, security camera footage and financial records analysis. It gave the authorities \u201cthe best glimpse perhaps we\u2019ve seen in a very long time into how massive nationwide multi-million-dollar retail theft rings operate,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.New York police superintendent George P. Beach said in a statement that the operation victimized \u201cboth retailers and the public,\u201d and commended the work of the state police\u2019s Special Investigation Unit.The National Retail Foundation reported last year that organized retail crime is on the rise, and costs the industry $30 billion annually.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Billion Yahoo Accounts Still for Sale, Despite Hacking Indictments", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For sale: one billion Yahoo accounts, $200,000 or best offer. The passwords don\u2019t work, but the dates of birth, telephone numbers and security questions could still be useful to an adept cyberthief.The authorities were tight-lipped about their investigation of the 2013 attack, which is the largest known breach of a private company\u2019s computer systems. The 2014 hacking of Yahoo\u2019s servers is the second largest.\u201cWe\u2019re not willing to comment right now if there is a connection between the two investigations,\u201d Malcolm Palmore, who oversees the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s cybersecurity division in San Francisco, said on Wednesday in a brief interview after the government unveiled the indictments.But the two attacks share some common characteristics and may be linked in some fashion.Both of them involved highly skilled Russian hackers, according to cybersecurity experts who have studied the attacks. In both cases, the hackers had links to the Russian government. And in both cases, at least some of the data was used to send spam to Yahoo users.In 2012, he was indicted on three felony charges for hacking the computer systems of Zappos, the online shoe retailer owned by Amazon, and stealing information on as many as 24 million customers.In 2013, Mr. Belan struck again, hacking into Evernote and Scribd, two digital document storage services, according to a federal indictment filed against him that June. Law enforcement authorities arrested him in Greece later that year, but he posted bail and fled to Russia.The indictment against Mr. Belan filed this week is vague about how he and his three co-conspirators gained access to Yahoo\u2019s systems.Alex Holden, founder of Hold Security, a cybersecurity firm, said one prevailing theory in the industry was that Mr. Belan capitalized on the earlier breach. He said the person or people behind the 2013 intrusion probably sold, traded or were forced to share their access to Yahoo\u2019s systems with Russian intelligence services. The two Russian intelligence agents indicted in the 2014 breach are accused of using that access to conduct their own spying operation with the assistance of Mr. Belan and another conspirator in Canada.The Russian government has strenuously denied any involvement in any hacking of Yahoo\u2019s systems.Yahoo declined to comment on Friday, but pointed a reporter to a December statement about the 2013 attack. In that statement, the company said it had not been able to find the intrusion but that it was \u201clikely distinct\u201d from the 2014 one.A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. declined to comment on Friday.But during a briefing with reporters in San Francisco on Wednesday, F.B.I. officials said the intrusion into Yahoo\u2019s systems appeared to have begun with a spear-phishing attack, in which a Yahoo employee was tricked into disclosing information that allowed the attackers in.Although Yahoo security officials noticed a breach in 2014, they initially believed it was limited in scope, according to securities filings made by the company. Senior executives were aware of the attack in 2014 but failed to recognize its significance, the company said.Yahoo publicly disclosed the 2014 breach in September. It disclosed the larger, 2013 attack in December and forced all affected users who had not already done so to change their passwords.The database of one billion accounts was on offer for $200,000, which Mr. Holden, the Hold Security founder, called \u201can exorbitant amount of money.\u201d The asking price for a single address is $10,000.The sellers claimed to have continued access to Yahoo\u2019s systems. But when Mr. Holden, posing as a buyer\u2019s representative, asked them to prove their access by giving him data about two new accounts, they could not do so.Yahoo, for its part, has said that the security holes exploited by the hackers have been patched up.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Whitney\u2019s Humanist, Pro-Diversity Biennial Is a Revelation", "Date": "2017-03-16", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewSince moving downtown, the Whitney Museum of American Art has grown up, thanks to a larger, dashing new building, more ambitious exhibitions and new responsibilities brought by rising attendance and membership. No surprise, its biennial has grown up, too. Perhaps less expected: So has the art in it. This show\u2019s strength and focus make it doubly important at a time when art, the humanities and the act of thinking itself seem under attack in Washington.The show spotlights 63 artists and collectives working at the intersection of the formal and the social, and in this it announces a new chapter of so-called political art \u2014 though one already brewing in small museums, galleries and studios. Many of these artists confront such American realities as income inequality, homelessness, misogyny, immigration, violence, hatred and biases of race, religion and class. But they are equally committed to the artistic exploration of media and materials, and to the creation of bold and strange things to see and think about.Some of the breathtaking openness and diversity of contemporary art is evident in this show\u2019s participants and its range of media \u2014 from painting, which is plentiful and mostly but not entirely figurative, to digital and virtual-reality art. Nearly half are female, and half nonwhite; its demographics argue that not only do black lives matter (along with Hispanic, Asian, Muslim and immigrant lives), they are essential to our quality of life \u2014 physical, emotional, cultural, linguistic, economic, educational, environmental.Like Mr. Taylor, Ms. Lawson addresses the dangers, contradictions and cultural richness of living in America as a black person. She does so by extending the staged efforts of photo artists like Jeff Wall and Stan Douglas but with slightly smaller, more insistent color images. Showing black people at home, they imply the ties and tensions of family and friendship and smolder with quiet determination. The ambiguous \u201cSons of Cush,\u201d revolving around two men, a tiny baby and a fist full of cash, is as full of symbols as a Renaissance painting.Other efforts deserving attention include the bravura abstract paintings of Carrie Moyer, among her best, and the gritty figurative ones of Celeste Dupuy-Spencer. The choreographer Maya Stovall offers videos of modern dance on Detroit sidewalks, vividly juxtaposing art and life. Tuan Andrew Nguyen\u2019s video \u201cThe Island,\u201d an unlikely combination of fact and fantasy, revisits the tiny Malaysian island of Pulau Bidong, which sheltered tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees who fled their country in the 1970s and \u201980s. Pope.L\u2019s enormous room covered inside and out with a careful grid of embellished slices of baloney, embodies his usual sarcasm, even if the point about population breakdowns remains obscure.Oto Gillen\u2019s fugal video-slide show \u201cNew York, 2015 \u2014\u201d documents the denizens of our sanctuary city\u2019s public spaces \u2014 homeless people, food vendors, police officers, bike messengers \u2014 presenting a combination of striving and defeat (and surveillance). Providing contrast are shots of the luminous nocturnal beauty of skyscrapers under construction that will do nothing to succor the lives below. At the other end of the exhibition, Asad Raza\u2019s \u201cRoot sequence. Mother tongue\u201d brings brief respite: 26 young, often flowering trees facing the flickering light of the city.At a moment when a new president threatens to wipe out the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, this exhibition makes an exciting, powerful case for art. As seen here, art illuminates the diversity on which this country\u2019s greatness stands and \u2014 through its mysterious alchemy of beauty and reality, tragedy and joy \u2014 inspires us to think, know our better selves and fight back.A Hebrew prayer or blessing sung upon the lighting of the candles during Hanukkah.Twice.A total of 42, in installations by Rafa Esparza (5), John Riepenhoff (7) and Occupy Museums (30).38.About 11.It\u2019s a working classroom, set up by the Puerto Rican artist Chemi Rosado-Seijo to serve students of the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy on the Lower East Side.

The biggest independent film festival in the United States, held in January in a town whose big business is skiing, it\u2019s a rite of passage for both scrappy, small-budget filmmakers and Hollywood names seeking what was once called indie cred. Its frequently circuslike atmosphere is a well-known component of its notoriety.I admit there were several times during my stays in Park City in the years I covered the festival that I longed for a different way. On days when a current of warm air would turn the town\u2019s plentiful snow into wet mush I would carry around on my ankles from one screening to another, or when a car full of high-school students would flip me the bird en masse for the sin of walking into the parking lot they were leaving, I would think: Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could go to Sundance without actually leaving your town, or even your house? I dreamed of a festival perk by which films would be simulcast to screening rooms in Manhattan. After all, we do have the technology.

{"Headline": "Yelp Starts Tracking Gender-Neutral Bathrooms for Transgender Users", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "Supported byYelp, the crowdsourced website that offers reviews of everything from restaurants to stores to churches, is adding a new way to filter its results: by the availability of gender-neutral bathrooms.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve spoken out about social issues, but this is the first time that we have married doing something on our platform around the social justice support of the L.G.B.T.Q. community,\u201d said Rachel Williams, who leads the company\u2019s diversity and inclusion efforts.The gender-neutral bathroom filter is aimed at helping people who are transgender, who often report facing challenges in finding safe and suitable bathrooms to use.For now, Yelp is inviting users and business owners to identify establishments that offer locking, single-stall bathrooms that are available to individuals of any gender, with plans in the coming weeks to let users filter results based on that data, once enough is collected.Motivated in part by that decision, Yelp\u2019s product team prioritized the feature, piecing it together in four to five days, with the announcement coming just one week after the idea was proposed, Ms. Williams said.\u201cThis administration is moving pretty fast and so this happened, the Gavin Grimm case came up, and we wanted to capture the moment,\u201d she said.Yelp settled on the \u201cgender-neutral\u201d label \u2014 instead of alternatives such as \u201call-gender\u201d or \u201cgender-inclusive\u201d \u2014 after consulting with the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for gay rights, and others, she said.With its platform, the company may ultimately be able to assemble the largest directory of transgender-friendly bathrooms, but it is not the first to try.That directory was created by Emily Waggoner and her male transgender partner River Luck, who are North Carolina natives who now live in Boston. Inspired by a series of photos of transgender-friendly businesses shared by a friend online, the pair decided to create Safe Bathrooms Club.\u201cWe saw this via Instagram and thought \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to see those businesses on a map?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Waggoner, a user interface and user experience designer.The directory addresses a problem Mr. Luck faced most acutely during his transition over the last several years. With his gender identity at times ambiguous as he underwent hormone therapy, he found himself thrust into what felt like uncomfortable and dangerous situations.\u201cOn several occasions, we would have to leave where we were because it wasn\u2019t safe for me to use the bathroom there, and that was terrifying,\u201d he said.While Yelp\u2019s effort may overlap with theirs, Mr. Luck and Ms. Waggoner said they don\u2019t feel threatened. \u201cThe more ways that people can find a safe bathroom, the better,\u201d Ms. Waggoner said.Advertisement"}

Koh, the company\u2019s head of mobile devices, adding that Samsung was ready to start anew.The Galaxy S8 features a large 5.8-inch screen without adding bulk to the device. The company said it made room for the screen by reducing the size of the bezel \u2014 or the forehead and the chin \u2014 on the face of the device. Samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display.With the Galaxy S8, Samsung also rolled out its virtual assistant, Bixby, to rival Apple\u2019s Siri, Google\u2019s Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. Similar to previous virtual assistants, Bixby responds to voice commands.Time \u2014 and sales \u2014 will tell whether the Galaxy S8 will restore confidence in Samsung\u2019s smartphones. Last year, after the company received dozens of complaints about the Galaxy Note 7 overheating, and in some cases exploding, the company recalled the phones. But replacement phones continued to catch fire, and the company had to recall the devices a second time before killing the product altogether, sacrificing billions of dollars in revenue.Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research, said the Galaxy S8 could help Samsung recover as long as the product worked reliably.\u201cNote 7 definitely did some damage to the Samsung brand, especially for people who had little or no personal experience with Samsung devices,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as the S8 does well and doesn\u2019t suffer from any of the same problems, the memories of the Note 7 issues will fade and Samsung will recover well.\"Samsung last year also issued a separate recall for 2.8 million washing machines in the United States. The machines were prone to detaching from the washing machine chassis, posing a risk of injury.The Galaxy S8 will arrive in stores next month with a starting price of $750.Advertisement"}

Kmart, which has its own lengthy history beginning as a five-and-dime store in Detroit, became a major national presence in the 1960s as a big-box department store, with Blue Light Special discounts geared toward penny-wise middle-class Americans.But both brands were squeezed by Walmart Stores, with its heavy discounts, and Target, which sold affordable goods but with more design and flair. Both Sears and Kmart also suffered because they were in older shopping malls and neighborhoods. Online retailing, with the rise of the likes of Amazon, presented a more recent challenge.In February, Sears Holdings said it had started a restructuring program that it said would save $1 billion annually. The plan focuses on streamlining back-office corporate and support functions, tweaking product offerings and supply chain and looking for ways to reshuffle real estate.As of January, Sears Holdings said, it had 1,430 Sears and Kmart stores in the United States. By contrast, a decade ago it had about 3,800 stores in the United States and Canada.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "White House Echoes Tech: \u2018Move Fast and Break Things\u2019", "Date": "2017-03-08", "News": "Supported byAdventures in CapitalismLast summer, not long after Donald J. Trump secured the Republican nomination for president, his recently installed campaign manager, Stephen K. Bannon, met with top officials from the Republican National Committee to discuss management of the general election.Mr. Trump\u2019s staff had remained unusually small throughout the grueling primaries \u2014 a compactness, his advisers believed, that had given them a nimble edge. Now most Republican officials expected the Trump team to expand as it began to oversee the thousands of Republican staff members, state officials and consultants who would be ground troops in the coming political war.But when Mr. Bannon met with R.N.C. officials, he informed them that a major expansion was not going to happen.The Trump campaign, he said, intended to remain sparse and decentralized. Borrowing a Silicon Valley mantra from Facebook, he told his shocked listeners that \u201cyour job is to move fast and break things,\u201d according to a person who was present. \u201cFigure out what needs doing, and then just do it. Don\u2019t wait for permission.\u201dHis audience was surprised. Conventional political wisdom advocated a robust and elaborate campaign hierarchy.But Mr. Bannon demanded the opposite. Winning, he said, required tactics and ideas \u2014 like distributed decision making; quick experimentation and execution rather than thoughtful deliberation; learning from left-leaning advocacy groups and video game companies \u2014 that were drawn from the management playbooks of Silicon Valley start-ups.After that meeting, many thought Mr. Bannon\u2019s strategy was crazy, the person who was present said. Then Mr. Trump won the election. And now we can argue that Mr. Trump is, in many ways, the first genuine Silicon Valley start-up candidate and president.President Barack Obama may have embraced technology, weaponized social media and sought advice from the co-founders of Facebook and LinkedIn. But he was ultimately a traditional campaigner and manager. It is Mr. Trump\u2019s team who, surprisingly, have embraced the philosophy of disruption and the management styles of Silicon Valley, and who have sought to imitate the tactics that have powered companies like Uber and Amazon.\u201cTrump is the Silicon Valley candidate in every way except that the ideology is flipped,\u201d said Sam Altman, a prominent technology leader, chief executive of Y Combinator and a major Hillary Clinton donor. \u201cHe\u2019s an outsider. He took on a system he thought was broken and then disregarded the rules, he got to know his users well and tested his product early and iterated rapidly. That\u2019s the start-up playbook. That\u2019s exactly what we tell our start-ups to do.\u201dIt remains to be seen, however, whether Mr. Trump will successfully transition from a start-up to a mature commander in chief. Just as Uber and other young tech firms have stumbled while growing, so Mr. Trump seems, right now, in over his head at the White House.But understanding these early missteps \u2014 and how start-up thinking vaulted Mr. Trump into power \u2014 is important, because it gives us a lens into the strengths and weaknesses of management techniques that are increasingly being imitated by other industries around the world.Put differently, the president\u2019s success has demonstrated the strength of the start-up philosophy. But is it a good or a bad thing if Mr. Trump becomes the first political unicorn?But the fact remains that he is a prime example of the disruptive forces that the tech industry celebrates. At the most basic level, Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of technology \u2014 the millions of dollars he has raised through online donations, and his capacity to mobilize huge crowds through email and drive news through Twitter blasts \u2014 is crucial to his unexpected political success.And his team\u2019s embrace of Silicon Valley philosophy goes much deeper. As Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign gained steam, for instance, top officials began a dedicated effort to study the tactics of successful digital advocacy groups, particularly the left-leaning Moveon.org, as well as #BlackLivesMatter, to reverse engineer methods for rapidly mobilizing voters.His campaign also reached out to video game companies to learn how to make addictive content. During the race, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with Gabriel Leydon, founder of a company in Palo Alto, Calif., named MZ, previously known as Machine Zone, which created the highly popular games Mobile Strike and Game of War: Fire Age. Mr. Leydon, one of the biggest online advertisers, agreed to share insights about digital marketing tactics with the Trump campaign. (In a statement, MZ said it never formally worked for Mr. Trump.)The influence of start-up philosophy on Mr. Trump\u2019s team extends to day-to-day management. The campaign and the White House have looked to tech industry management techniques to empower staff members to start policy initiatives, to conduct rapid digital tests, and to push fund-raising and advertising campaigns without seeking authorization from senior officials.In contrast to the methodical Obama White House and the Clinton campaign, where tweets often needed approval from at least three officials before they were posted, members of the Trump team could dream up ads or email blasts almost without oversight. At its peak, his campaign was running 60,000 different online advertisements per day to see which phrases and images outperformed others.However, the most significant connection between Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley thinking is how thoroughly he embodies the \u201cdisruption thesis\u201d that has propelled so many emerging technology firms. Mr. Trump\u2019s team has deliberately worked to remove the traditional gatekeepers \u2014 the big donors, the political parties, the advocacy groups and the news media \u2014 that have, in the past, often determined political viability.A senior campaign official said the strategy \u201csidestepped the power brokers the same way Uber sidestepped taxi dispatchers,\u201d and asserted that politics as practiced by Mr. Trump was part of a revolution that started in technology and was now spreading to other industries and governments around the world.Yet, even by that measure, Mr. Trump, who attracted many first-time voters, and who was elected with a big boost from Americans without college degrees, seems to fit the bill.Which all presents a question: If the playbook was so successful in electing Mr. Trump, why is he stumbling now? Why has the Silicon Valley mentality failed to thrive in Washington?It might be that Mr. Trump simply needs to evolve to the next level of tech industry thinking. And, in fact, there is a ready playbook for how start-ups transition into mature firms. Google, for instance, began floundering when it reached about 200 employees. So the company\u2019s founders brought in a more established leader, Eric Schmidt, to \u201cbe a bit of chaperone, providing adult supervision,\u201d as Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, explained in 2001. When Facebook\u2019s work force hit 1,800 in 2008, its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, hired Sheryl Sandberg, a seasoned manager, as chief operating officer to rein in the firm\u2019s freewheeling, decentralized culture.We\u2019re seeing a similar shift in the White House. After Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban caused widespread confusion at airports and within federal agencies last month, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, put in effect a formal process for rolling out executive orders. When the president was preparing for his address to Congress last week, his team used a formal process to review the script. Republican leaders are pushing the White House to bring on more aides with prior governing experience. As at Facebook and Google, a hierarchy is being built.But for many within the technology industry, this new, more mature White House is cause for concern. \u201cI think most people don\u2019t want him to succeed at all,\u201d said Laszlo Bock, who until last year was a senior vice president at Google. \u201cNo matter how Trump manages the White House, what he believes in is the opposite of Silicon Valley values. We don\u2019t want him to learn from us.\u201dUltimately, say Silicon Valley luminaries, the world is changing thanks to forces beyond the control of any one industry. Technology companies aren\u2019t to blame for these shifts. They have merely seen and taken advantage of them faster than everyone else.It is not a question of whether campaign managers, politicians and leaders in other industries should mimic the technology industry, but rather a question of when they will realize that it is too late to resist.\u201cI think all of this \u2014 the current start-up revolution, Trump and lots of other things \u2014 is largely a consequence of the internet breaking down traditional barriers,\u201d Mr. Altman, the Y Combinator executive, wrote in an email. \u201cThis societal openness has some great consequences in my opinion, like the start-up boom of the last 20 years, and some bad ones, like Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Ambitions Unboxed: Stores for Furniture, Appliances and More", "Date": "2017-03-25", "News": "Supported byThe intimate audience of entrepreneurs and academics, attending an Amazon conference on robotics and artificial intelligence, chuckled. Later, Mr. Bezos posted a photo on Twitter of himself in the suit with a more menacing air, the robot\u2019s arms raised as if about to deliver a bone-crushing bear hug.For years, retailers have been haunted by the thought of Amazon using its technological prowess to squeeze them into powder. That battle has mostly played out on Amazon\u2019s home turf, the world of online shopping.Now the fight is coming directly to retailers on actual streets around the globe, where Amazon is slowly building a fleet of physical stores. And while most of the attention has been focused on Amazon\u2019s grocery store dreams, the company has a more ambitious collection of experiments underway.If those experiments work \u2014 and there is no guarantee of that \u2014 they could have a profound influence on how other stores operate. Over time, they could also introduce new forms of automation, putting traditional retail jobs in jeopardy. At the same time, locating those stores close to customers\u2019 homes could also help Amazon further its ambitions of delivering internet orders within hours.The company is exploring the idea of creating stores to sell furniture and home appliances, like refrigerators \u2014 the kinds of products that shoppers are reluctant to buy over the internet sight unseen, said one of several people with knowledge of the discussions who, in conversations with The New York Times, spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential. The stores would serve as showcases where people could view the items in person, with orders being delivered to their homes.These would not be your average Home Depots: Amazon has considered using forms of augmented or virtual reality to allow people to see how couches, stoves and credenzas will look in their homes, the person briefed on the discussions said.Amazon is also kicking around an electronics-store concept similar to Apple\u2019s retail emporiums, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions. These shops would have a heavy emphasis on Amazon devices and services such as the company\u2019s Echo smart home speaker and Prime Video streaming service.Overseas, Amazon is quietly targeting India for new brick-and-mortar grocery stores. It is a vast market, and one still largely dominated by traditional street bazaars where shoppers must wander from stall to stall haggling over prices and deliberating over unrefrigerated meat sitting in the dusty open air. Amazon\u2019s internal code name for its India grocery ambitions: Project Everest.It is possible that some of the store ideas will never see the light of day. Groups within Amazon are often encouraged to come up with zany initiatives (this is the company that popularized the idea of drone deliveries). Many ideas are chucked after deeper scrutiny by executives. Amazon declined to talk about any stores it has not announced publicly.\u201cWe are always thinking about new ways to serve customers, but thinking is different than planning,\u201d said Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman.Since the late \u201990s, pundits have asked when Amazon \u2014 the company Mr. Bezos founded on the premise that people would rather shop from the comfort of their screens \u2014 would finally start building stores. But Amazon executives saw plenty of opportunities in online retail and new ways to reach people, from creating digital book-selling devices like Kindle to building up the Prime membership service for getting faster deliveries and other benefits.\u201cWe want to do something uniquely Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can find that idea, and we haven\u2019t found it yet, but if we can find that idea, we would love to open physical stores.\u201dDespite Amazon\u2019s internet retailing success, over time it has become clear that there is a lot of shopping that people prefer to do in person. The most glaring example is groceries \u2014 the mother of all shopping categories, with about $770 billion for the supermarkets represented by the Food Marketing Institute, a nonprofit group that includes the majority of such stores in the United States.After pouring resources into an online grocery service, AmazonFresh, for almost a decade, the company has made only modest progress. According to people familiar with the workings of the company\u2019s grocery business, it has struggled to operate it profitably, leading to a slow rollout of the service in new locations.One big desire many customers have is that they want to see fresh fruits, vegetables and meat in person before buying them. The relatively high cost of home delivery \u2014 Amazon charges $15 a month for its Fresh service, on top of a $99 annual Prime membership \u2014 is another barrier.Online grocery delivery accounts for only about 3 percent of the market in the United States, though it is closer to 10 percent in Britain, said Randy Burt, a partner in the food and beverage practice of A. T. Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm. Mr. Burt said Amazon\u2019s growing interest in stores mirrored the conclusion that other online merchants with physical stores \u2014 the apparel seller Bonobos and the eyewear seller Warby Parker \u2014 had come to.\u201cI think they are recognizing, for certain things you can\u2019t digitize and replicate online all the experience one has in a store,\u201d Mr. Burt said. \u201cThe ability to create experiences is going to be critical for them to continue to get share.\u201dJoe Thompson, a former general manager in Amazon\u2019s retail business, sees physical retail as key to Mr. Bezos\u2019s outsize ambitions for the company. \"I can\u2019t help but feel that, in Bezos\u2019s mind, he wants to be the first trillion-dollar valuation company,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, who is now an executive at BuildDirect, an online home improvement store. To do that, he said, Amazon would have to \u201ccrack\u201d a couple of \u201ccompletely underpenetrated markets online.\u201dAmazon\u2019s current market value is bobbing around $400 billion.A growing number of established grocery retailers are experimenting with this \u201cclick and collect\u201d approach to shopping, including Walmart, Kroger and others. According to one person briefed on Amazon\u2019s plans, the company has been developing technology for automatically detecting when a customer pulls into the parking lot so orders can be brought to them more quickly.The retail industry has been captivated by Amazon Go\u2019s technology since the company unveiled the store late last year. The store uses a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to automatically detect the food items shoppers remove from shelves, so they can leave the store without visiting a cashier \u2014 the way customers do when they bolt from an Uber.\u201cAmazon is wonderful at frictionless commerce,\u201d said Timothy Laseter, a professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business.There have been glitches with the technology that Amazon engineers continue to work on, according to a person familiar with the operations. For now, only Amazon employees are allowed to use the store. Amazon previously said it would open Amazon Go to the public in early 2017.Amazon Go technologies like artificial intelligence are \u201cLatin for \u2018fire cashiers,\u2019\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Leonard N. Stern School of Business.\u201cI\u2019ve probably been in 30 boardrooms of retailers in the past year,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cI would say the No. 1 topic of conversation is Amazon.\u201dThat was too much, apparently, for Mr. Bezos, who became uncharacteristically feisty on Twitter, attacking the article by saying The Post\u2019s sources had \u201cmixed up their meds.\u201dBut a group within Amazon has explored another larger grocery store format, according to both a person familiar with the concept and to internal Amazon documents reviewed by The New York Times. The store could stock fresh produce, meats and other items in a public area of the store, while keeping frozen foods, cereals and other items traditionally found in the center of a grocery store behind a wall, in what would be a kind of small Amazon warehouse. Workers behind the wall, not robots, could quickly package orders for customers.While Mr. Bezos was known for coining the motto \u201cGet Big Fast\u201d in the early days of Amazon, the company\u2019s plans in physical retail could be better described as \u201cGet Big Slow.\u201d Some reports have said Amazon has discussed building up to 2,000 grocery stores. But that figure was floated mainly as a hypothetical to consider the impact on Amazon\u2019s supply chain, not as a goal that was under serious consideration, a person familiar with the discussions said.In addition to the two soon to open in Seattle, as many as five more AmazonFresh Pickup locations could open by next year, and the company hopes to expand Amazon Go to Britain and several cities in the United States in the same time frame, this person said.According to a person familiar with Amazon\u2019s India grocery efforts, the company hopes to open its first Indian grocery store in Bangalore. In a statement, Amazon said the company was excited by the Indian government\u2019s efforts to encourage foreign investment in a \u201cstronger food supply chain.\u201d\u201cWe have sought an approval to invest and partner with the government in achieving this vision,\u201d Amazon said.For Mr. Galloway at N.Y.U., the slow pace of Amazon\u2019s rollout of stores is a sign that it has not figured out physical retail yet, and that has surprised him. Five years ago, he believed Amazon would have hundreds of stores by this time.\u201cWhat appears to be clear is they haven\u2019t yet zeroed in on a format they\u2019re willing to massively scale,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a company that the moment it figures out something that works, it puts nuclear energy behind it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Funds Invoke Bible Values, Others See Intolerance", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "Supported byServing both God and money has long been an aim of fund companies that exclude \u201csin stocks\u201d of companies dealing in tobacco, guns, gambling and the like in their investments.The approach is squarely at odds with that of nearly all of corporate America.Ninety-two percent of the Fortune 500 companies include \u201csexual orientation\u201d in their nondiscrimination policies and 82 percent include \u201cgender identity.\u201d For the first time, half of Fortune 500 companies offer transgender-inclusive health care benefits, including for surgical procedures.\u201cThere are millions of people, including people of faith, for whom discrimination is not a biblical value,\u201d said Mark Snyder, the director of communications for the Equality Federation, a national advocacy group. \u201cBusinesses have been leading the fight for full equality over the last few years. L.G.B.T. people are part of the fabric of our nation. We have families, we go to work, we simply wish to be treated equally.\u201dBut he added, \u201cA company deciding to spend money and time to pursue a hard-line activist agenda that has nothing to do with their core business is a different issue, and is a waste of investor dollars.\u201dIssues investing \u2014 some call it \u201csocially responsible investing,\u201d which includes the \u201cE.S.G.\u201d (environmental, social and governance) style of investing \u2014 has been a hot business in recent years. Major investors like the pension fund behemoth known as Calpers have made it a part of their philosophy, even though the strategy has costs in lost investment opportunity. Last year, for example, Calpers re-endorsed its ban on tobacco stocks, though staff recommended the opposite.The concept has made its way to exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which have been popular with mom-and-pop investors because they are a low-cost, tax-efficient way to invest in a broad index \u2014 more often than not, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. As a category, exchange traded funds have ballooned in recent years, amassing $2.6 trillion. And the opportunity to create niche products seems to be boundless.\u201cThe minority are a success, and the majority are flops,\u201d said Ben Johnson, the director of E.T.F. research at Morningstar. \u201cIt\u2019s spaghetti slinging.\u201dThe new funds would hardly be the first religion-oriented investment products. An earlier group of funds tracking Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and, more generally, Christian, values came out in 2009 but folded in 2011 with just $2 million, Morningstar said.There are also the $790 million iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF and the $500 million iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF, which look for stocks of companies with good labor policies or sustainable and renewable products. There are also longstanding mutual funds, such as the $927 million Domini Impact Equity fund.The benefits off exchange traded fund investing \u2014 getting cheap exposure to a broad universe of stocks \u2014 can be diminished by eliminating companies based on subjective criteria. And academic studies have concluded that sin stocks perform better as a group than stocks of virtuous companies, at least before factoring in the extra risks to investing in companies that are frequent targets of litigation and boycotts.Greg Richey, who lectures on finance at California State University San Bernardino, developed a portfolio of 65 sin stocks and tracked them from 1996 to 2016, finding an average annual return of 11 percent.Once taking variables like litigation and boycott risk into account, the gains disappear, he said. Also, \u201cthe definition of vice keeps changing.\u201dPensions and other institutions are asking fund companies for ways to invest that avoid these risks, said Jay Jacobs, the director of research for Global X Funds, which has $4.5 billion under management.Last year, Global X introduced a fund that adheres to the values of the Roman Catholic Church, and it has taken in $87 million in assets, according to Morningstar. The idea came from conversations with clients that invest on behalf of Catholic groups and foundations, which follow the guidelines set out by the church, he said.This week, Inspire Investing, based in Hollister, Calif., introduced the two biblically responsible funds, a small- and medium-size company fund and a large-company fund called Inspire Global Hope Large Cap ETF.The large-company fund tracks an Inspire-created index of 400 companies it screened to match its investment criteria, which follow conservative Christian values, Mr. Netzly said.Shares of Berkshire Hathaway, whose chief executive, Warren E.

(An Apple spokesman said pornography is not permitted.)Companies like Amazon that have publicly supported gay marriage also would not pass muster. \u201cAny company that takes a hard-line approach\u201d to the issue would not pass the test, Mr. Netzly said.On the other hand, shares of Tesla Motors and Under Armour would.Advertisement"}

The United States may be tightening its borders to other countries\u2019 citizens, but for now, at least, their television shows are flooding in unmolested.Netflix has a lot of competition in this area.

There are no phalanxes of black SUVs, just beaten-up vans and rattling cars carrying combatants dressed in T-shirts and sandals and bearing weapons that look like they came from the bargain bin at the gun fair.\u201cFauda\u201d is also a family drama, in a way that American thrillers can\u2019t really duplicate. The opposing sides live in such close quarters, and with so much shared history, that wives, children, cousins and girlfriends get caught up in the danger in believable ways, without the manufactured plot twists American dramas employ to put family members in jeopardy.\u201cNobel\u201d is slicker than \u201cFauda,\u201d more American-style in its production values and editing. But it has a similar seriousness of purpose and a ground-level common sense about family and organizational dynamics that American dramas \u2014 hyped-up and contrived even at their best \u2014 seldom achieve.The title is a reference to the Nobel Peace Prize, which hangs in the background of the story like a guilty conscience. The eight-episode series traces a geopolitical conspiracy that ties together oil interests, humanitarian organizations, the Norwegian government and, centrally, an elite Norwegian special-forces unit whose work in Afghanistan involves it in murder and cover-ups back home.Like \u201cFauda,\u201d \u201cNobel\u201d is about the effects of violence on a society, but from the opposite perspective: the Norwegians, smug about the peacefulness and order of their lives, are shocked by the sudden intrusion of murder and scandal. What distinguishes both shows, for viewers accustomed to American TV, is that they make political violence feel like a sad and dangerous reality rather than a heroic video-game fantasy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018A World of Emotions\u2019 in Greek Art Unmasks the Stony Faces", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewThe first line of one of the oldest poems in Western literature, Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad,\u201d begins with the ancient Greek word for anger, or superanger: wrath. And from that emotion an entire epic driven by hatred, hubris, lust, grief and violence spins out.The poem dates from around 700 B.C., a wild and woolly time, no doubt. Leap ahead four centuries and things have changed in Greece. The calm of reason has descended; emotions are under control. Or so we\u2019re inclined to imagine from looking at the buff Apollos and poised Aphrodites of the Classical Age.The Onassis Cultural Center itself tends to stir an emotion: gratitude. It\u2019s some kind of gift outright. Tucked away below street level in Olympic Tower \u2014 you have to know it\u2019s there to find it \u2014 and charging no admission, it brings in top-shelf art from Greece, supplemented by choice international loans. The current show draws on the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, the Acropolis Museum and Greek regional museums, as well as the Louvre, the British Museum and the Met.The show begins with faces, the most immediate visual gauges of sentiment, though not always reliable ones. From around 540 B.C. comes the image of a young equestrian with chic spit curls and a strenuously confident, for-public-consumption grin. Next to him, dated some two centuries later, is a naturalistic portrait of a beaming toddler, an embodiment of guileless cheerfulness, probably a thank-you gift to a shrine by happy parents.The feelings conveyed in a satyr head from the second to the first centuries B.C. are harder to read, as befits a being half-human, half-beast. With his lazy eyes and wiseguy smirk, he\u2019s like a kid plugged into an iPod, pacified and stimulated. Take away the music though, and he might be trouble.A terra-cotta head of Medusa changes the mood of the lineup. With her wrinkles, fangs and tongue stuck out, she\u2019s a fright, though a potentially protective one. Nobody, ill-intentioned or otherwise, would dare to come near her \u2014 or near you, if you stayed in her vicinity.Basically, you can see versions of all these faces riding the New York City subway every day. And a sense of familiarity across time and cultures may lead you to assume that they have no secrets; that you know what they\u2019re about. But you don\u2019t. Would you guess at a glance, for example, that cool-looking unisex couple, set a little apart from the group and represented by two life-size marble heads, is experiencing irreversible tragedy?One of the two is the Greek hero Achilles; the other is the Amazon warrior-queen Penthesilea. They fought on opposite sides of the Trojan War. And when they encountered each other, fully armed, faces hidden, in combat, Achilles cut her down. As she fell, her helmet came off; their eyes met. Instant love, but too late. Though their side-by-side heads don\u2019t convey that. Instead of pain and regret we see just a stunned swoon. Penthesilea was hurt beyond healing; so was Achilles\u2019s heart.Or so it might appear if you\u2019re looking for melodrama. One of the lessons the show teaches, though, and expands on in its catalog, is how difficult accurate cross-cultural readings of emotion can be. In a quick scan of the gallery, for example, images of everyday domesticity and profound mourning can be hard to tell apart. A relief of a child playing with a dog is a sweet backyard scene until you discover that it\u2019s a tombstone.And, again, searching faces for conventional modern signs of emotions won\u2019t get you far. Despite the occasional laughing or scowling face, most Greek public sculpture before the fourth century B.C., shares a demeanor of grave restraint. Restraint, considered the product of thought-through emotion, had moral value in Greek Classical tradition. As ever-more-remote inheritors of that tradition, we may acknowledge this value historically, without relating to it. In our own age of nonstop noise and cartoon politics, that old restraint is what makes this art feel at once exemplary and alien.But is it really so alien? And, for that matter, is it really so restrained? The exhibition, organized by three scholar-curators \u2014 Angelos Chaniotis of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.; Ioannis Mylonopoulos of Columbia University; and Nikolaos Kaltsas, director emeritus of the National Archaeological Museum in Athens \u2014 argues no.Look at some of the audacious paintings on ceramic pots and what do you find? Moral chaos, operatics, R ratings. In illustrations for the \u201cIliad\u201d alone there are scenes of mutilation, murder, attempted rape, suicide and aborted human sacrifice. The Medea tale, spread over three pots, is a tabloid nightmare: jealous wife poisons rival and knifes two children, her own. In the earthly realm, passions run riot.Not that Olympus was any calmer. Zeus, divinity in chief, is a sexual compulsive, a serial cheater, preying on juveniles, whether male or female didn\u2019t matter. In paintings and sculptures he hops from one conquest to the next: from Io, to Ganymede, to Leda; disguised as a cloud, an eagle, a swan. He didn\u2019t care that these adventures could ruin the lives of his lovers. He was on to the next affair, his wife\u2019s curses sizzling in his ears.In art about emotions, words can be as important as images, maybe more so. Many objects come with annotations: signatures, narrative cues, memorial dedications. The most stirring of all the show\u2019s funerary works is a plain marble stele with no image, just an inscription of a poem about a young woman named Zoe (\u201clife\u201d in Greek), who died in childbirth and whose premature baby died, too, leaving \u201cthe sunlight behind without ever crying.\u201dThe words with the most contemporary ring, though, are inspired by political passions and written on pottery shards called ostraka. In fifth-century Athens, ostraka were used to register a vote of no-confidence against especially despised public figures. The procedure was simple. Citizens scratched the official\u2019s name on a shard, sometimes with a comment. (\u201cKing of the idiots\u201d reads one; in general, a tone of disgust runs high.) If enough votes were collected, banishment followed. This was, in short, impeachment by grass-roots emotion. And it worked.An art review on Friday about the exhibition \u201cA World of Emotions: Ancient Greece, 700 B.C.-200 A.D.,\u201d at the Onassis Cultural Center New York, misstated the academic affiliation of one of its curators, Angelos Chaniotis. He is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., not at Princeton University.Advertisement"}

Yandex has charged that makers of cellphones are obliged to use Google\u2019s services if they want to use the latest version of Android, but that such obligations are unfair because they create an uneven playing field.The regulator, the Turkish Competition Authority, had initially declined to investigate Yandex\u2019s complaint, but it said on Monday that it would look at whether Google\u2019s use of Android to promote its other digital services infringed on the country\u2019s competition rules.

She similarly noted that the family in the White House often affected the culture of the capital.\u201cThe flavor of the city changes with each administration,\u201d Ms. Bennett said. \u201cThere was nothing happening in the fashion and style space until Michelle Obama got there. She sort of made it acceptable for people in politics to talk about fashion and to be interested in it. I hope that trend continues.\u201dIf it does, the best place for many to shop will be CityCenterDC, a more central and accessible alternative to the places Washingtonians have traditionally gone for luxury options: Chevy Chase, a sleepy town in Maryland, or Tysons Corner Center in the Virginia suburbs, about 17 miles from Union Station.Then there is the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, worth $890 million; the Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, who rings in at $621 million; Elaine L. Chao, the transportation secretary, whose assets add up to $25.6 million; and the secretary of state, Rex W.

Washington Convention Center.\u201cA lot of people come to Washington to do business with the government,\u201d said Howard Riker, a managing director at Hines, the developer of CityCenterDC. \u201cWe have taken advantage of that. I think we\u2019ll see more and more of that with the new administration, which has a pretty ambitious agenda, so I think there will be people coming into town to participate.\u201dMs. Bennett thinks it is entirely possible CityCenterDC will have its moment. \u201cA lot of people, whether they\u2019re supportive of the Trump administration or not, are getting engaged in life in Washington in a way they haven\u2019t before,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s more activity, which will improve the economy, which hopefully will trickle into the fashion and retail space.\u201dThe next big events on Washington\u2019s social calendar are the 30th annual Leukemia Ball on Saturday at the convention center (three blocks from CityCenterDC), and the Easter egg roll at the White House on April 17.

The company did not respond to requests for comment.In a statement, Hudson\u2019s Bay said it did not discuss \u201cmarket rumors.\u201d But it added, \u201cGenerally speaking, as we have previously stated, we selectively evaluate opportunities to accelerate the company\u2019s strategic growth while maintaining or enhancing its credit profile.\u201dHudson\u2019s Bay had also been discussing a potential merger with Macy\u2019s, another retailer facing weak sales. The talks with Neiman Marcus, however, appear to be more serious, the person briefed on the discussions said.Neiman Marcus said in its disclosure that it had not set a timetable to evaluate its options.Financial details about a merger were unclear, but any deal sought by Hudson\u2019s Bay would not require it to assume Neiman Marcus\u2019s debt, according to the person with knowledge of the talks. The stock of Hudson\u2019s Bay closed down slightly on Tuesday.Private equity firms have owned Neiman Marcus, the Dallas-based luxury retailer known for its high-end designers and annual catalog of holiday fantasy gifts, since 2005, when a group of investors led by TPG and Warburg Pincus bought it for $5.1 billion.That group held on to the company through the economic downturn. In 2013, the group sold it to Ares Management L.P., another private equity firm, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in a $6 billion leveraged buyout that saddled the company with debt.By that time, Neiman Marcus had largely stopped expanding into new markets and was focused on developing its e-commerce business.But the deal did not do enough to help the company stave off threats from online and low-cost competition. Neiman Marcus abandoned its plans to go public in January, a month before the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded it to a CCC+.Troubles across the industry have forced department stores, including Neiman, to re-evaluate their relationships with their lower-priced affiliates. Not long ago, for example, department stores banished their outlets miles away from their full-priced locations. Now, those same chains rely much more heavily on their discounted cousins, and it is not uncommon to find them within striking distance of each other.Neiman Marcus operates 42 stores in the United States, and two Bergdorf Goodman stores in Manhattan, according to its website. There is one Last Call, Neiman Marcus\u2019s cheaper option, in Brooklyn.The move to lower-cost stores, and lower prices over all through promotions, has eaten into department stores\u2019 bottom lines. E-commerce has been a particular focus of Richard A. Baker, the chief executive of Hudson\u2019s Bay, in recent years. In addition to investing about $1 billion into renovating Hudson\u2019s Bay stores, Mr. Baker has infused money into expanding the company\u2019s online business. In November, the company opened a highly automated warehouse for shipping online orders at a cost of 60 million Canadian dollars, about $45 million.Mr. Baker has had success with the Bay, as it is commonly known in Canada. But the company has been weighed down by a parallel project, which has made the chain a holding company for its assets in the United States, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, as well as European holdings that include Galeria Kaufhof.During the recent holiday season, the company said, its Canadian stores and Lord & Taylor posted a sales increase of 1.2 percent, but Saks sales fell 0.5 percent, and the company\u2019s discount chains had a 5.2 percent drop. European sales were down by 0.6 percent, despite heavy price discounting. Sales at the company\u2019s affiliates in the United States have also been soft.David Soberman, a professor of marketing at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management, said Hudson\u2019s Bay stores in Canada had an advantage not enjoyed by the company\u2019s outlets in Europe and the United States.\u201cThe Canadian market is way less competitive,\u201d Professor Soberman said. \u201cHere there\u2019s basically just the Bay; in their niche, there\u2019s not really anybody else.\u201dHudson\u2019s Bay\u2019s primary competitors, he said, are either discounters like Costco and Walmart, which offer a different experience and different merchandise at the lower end of the market, or Holt Renfrew, a Canadian luxury goods retailer with prices that start where Hudson Bay generally tops out.\u201cIf you want certain things and you don\u2019t want the very best, the Bay is probably a good choice, the only choice,\u201d Professor Soberman said, adding that Nordstrom\u2019s gradual move into Canada might have eroded that prized position, at least among the more affluent Hudson\u2019s Bay shoppers.Evaluating Mr. Baker\u2019s acquisition strategy, Professor Soberman said, is difficult because it appears to be as much about finding cash in real estate holdings as store operations, a process that has led to a complex internal structure at the company, which includes real estate joint ventures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opposing Views on What to Do About the Data We Create", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Data is the new oil, and we humans are the wells. Our digital crude is a rich brew of mundane, everyday activities \u2014 our searches, texts and tweets \u2014 along with the GPS coordinates from our phones, the biometric information we share with fitness devices, even the IP addresses of our connected refrigerators. To the average person, this raw material is undetectable noise. But for organizations that know how to identify signals, there\u2019s immense value in refining what has become an unlimited supply.Understanding what data we create, and how others exploit it, is vitally important. Soon, powerful machine-learning algorithms and artificially intelligent systems will analyze our data to reach decisions about and for us: whether we qualify for a bank loan, whether we\u2019re likely to commit a crime, whether we deserve an organ transplant. And unlike us, machines aren\u2019t burdened with an emotional attachment to privacy.The popular old data-as-oil idea opens Andreas Weigend\u2019s new book, \u201cData for the People,\u201d an exhaustive and insightful look at how data is collected and used, often without our knowledge and almost always without our input. Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon, details the \u201csocial data\u201d that emanates from billions of cameras, sensors and other devices, as well as social networks, online retailers and dating apps. Data refineries \u2014 those companies and people who turn our digital crude into profitable information \u2014 hunt for patterns, then sort us into buckets based on our behavior: what we might buy, what we\u2019ll watch, whom we might fall in love with. As Weigend points out, this exchange benefits everyone: If we let ourselves be mined, we receive personalized recommendations, connections and deals. Yet there\u2019s an imbalance of power. Companies make a lot of money from our data, and we have very little say in how it\u2019s used.Weigend argues persuasively that in this \u201cpost-privacy\u201d world, we should give our data freely, but that we should expect certain protections in return. He advocates a set of rights to increase data refineries\u2019 transparency and to increase our own agency in how information is used. Companies like OkCupid, WeChat and Spotify should perform data safety audits, submit to privacy ratings and calculate a score based on the benefits they provide \u2014 a sort of credit score for the companies that mine our data. Meanwhile, we should have the right to amend, blur and import or export our own data into any system we please.Not everyone believes that our information should be freely available as long as we agree to the terms of use. In \u201cThe Art of Invisibility,\u201d the internet security expert Kevin Mitnick advocates the opposite. Mitnick notes various reasons we may want to hide our data: We\u2019re wary of the government; we don\u2019t want businesses intruding into our lives; we have a mistress; we are the mistress; we\u2019re a criminal. Mitnick, who served five years in prison for hacking into corporate networks and stealing software, offers a sobering reminder of how our raw data \u2014 from email, cars, home Wi-Fi networks and so on \u2014 makes us vulnerable. He describes basic privacy protections (using a strong password, avoiding public computers) along with more advanced techniques (encrypting files on a hard drive, using a VPN and Bitcoin for online purchases). Most will seem familiar and perhaps rudimentary to those with any technical savvy. For everyone else, he offers an uncomfortable view of how data can be exploited.Both books are meant to scare us, and the central theme is privacy: Without intervention, they suggest, we\u2019ll come to regret today\u2019s inaction. I agree, but the authors miss the real horror show on the horizon. The future\u2019s fundamental infrastructure is being built by computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and security experts just like Weigend and Mitnick, who do not recognize their own biases. This encodes an urgent flaw in the foundation itself. The next layer will be just a little off, along with the next one and the one after that, as the problems compound.Right now, humans and machines engage in \u201csupervised learning.\u201d Experts \u201cteach\u201d the system by labeling an initial data set; once the computer reaches basic proficiency, they let it try sorting data on its own. If the system makes an error, the experts correct it. Eventually, this process yields highly sophisticated algorithms capable of refining and using our personal data for a variety of purposes: automatically sorting spam out of your inbox, say, or recommending a show you\u2019ll like on Netflix. Then, building on this foundation of data and algorithms, more teaching and learning takes place.But human bias creeps into computerized algorithms in disconcerting ways. In 2015, Google\u2019s photo app mistook a black software developer for a gorilla in photos he uploaded. In 2016, the Microsoft chatbot Tay went on a homophobic, anti-Semitic rampage after just one day of interactions on Twitter. Months later, reporters at ProPublica uncovered how algorithms in police software discriminate against black people while mislabeling white criminals as \u201clow risk.\u201d Recently when I searched \u201cC.E.O.\u201d on Google Images, the first woman listed was C.E.O. Barbie.Data scientists aren\u2019t inherently racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. But they are human, and they harbor unconscious biases just as we all do. This comes through in both books. In Mitnick\u2019s, women appear primarily in anecdotes and always as unwitting, jealous or angry. Near the end, Mitnick describes trying to enter Canada from Michigan, and wonders if he\u2019s stopped \u201cbecause a Middle Eastern guy with only a green card was driving.\u201d (He might be right, but he doesn\u2019t allow for the possibility that his own criminal record could also be responsible.)Weigend\u2019s book is meticulously researched, yet nearly all the experts he quotes are men. Early on he tells the story of Latanya Sweeney, who in the 1990s produced a now famous study of anonymized public health data in Massachusetts. She proved that the data could be traced back to individuals, including the governor himself. But Sweeney is far better known for something Weigend never mentions: She\u2019s the Harvard professor who discovered that \u2014 because of her black-sounding name \u2014 she was appearing in Google ads for criminal records and background checks. Weigend could have cited her to address bias in the second of his six rights, involving the integrity of a refinery\u2019s social data ecosystem. But he neglects to discuss the well-documented sexism, racism, xenophobia and homophobia in the machine-learning infrastructure.The omission of women and people of color from something as benign as book research illustrates the real challenge of unconscious bias in data and algorithms. Weigend and Mitnick rely only on what\u2019s immediate and familiar \u2014 an unfortunately common practice in the data community. University computer science, math and physics departments lack diversity in staff and coursework. Corporate data science is homogeneous. So are professional and academic conferences, where the future of data is discussed. If the people mining and processing our data are nothing like us, and if the machines learn only from them, our data can yield only warped caricatures, like the zombies you see on TV.As a futurist, I try to figure out how your data will someday power things like artificially intelligent cars, computer-assisted doctors and robot security agents. That\u2019s why I found both books concerning. Think of all the characteristics that make up who you are: how much coffee you drink, how fast you drive, how often you open your refrigerator, your respiratory rate, what slang you use, the random strangers you\u2019ve friended on Facebook. You may look like Weigend and Mitnick and therefore may not have experienced algorithmic discrimination yet. You, too, should be afraid. We\u2019ve only recently struck oil.Amy Webb, chief executive of the Future Today Institute, is the author of \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Camille Paglia, \u2018Free Women, Free Men\u2019 and No Sacred Cows", "Date": "2017-03-23", "News": "Supported byBooks of The Times\u201cOne test of un homme s\u00e9rieux,\u201d Christopher Hitchens wrote, \u201cis that it is possible to learn from him even when one radically disagrees with him.\u201d By this measure, Camille Paglia is une femme s\u00e9rieuse indeed.If you\u2019ve forgotten \u201cSexual Personae,\u201d or have never read it, Paglia helpfully reprints a few chunks of it in her new essay collection, \u201cFree Women, Free Men: Sex, Gender, Feminism.\u201d These chunks are fiercely erudite, freewheeling and sex-drenched. Nothing else in this collection can touch them.One reason Paglia gets under people\u2019s skin is that she has no sacred cows. Reviewing \u201cBreak, Blow, Burn\u201d in The New York Times Book Review, Clive James got at why she made some readers uncomfortable.\u201cThe most threatening thing about her, from the American viewpoint, is that she refuses to treat the arts as an instrument of civil rights,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWithout talent, no entitlement.\u201dIt\u2019s worth recalling how good Paglia can be, because in between major books, she does her best to help you forget. Her essay collections \u2014 \u201cSex, Art, and American Culture\u201d (1992), \u201cVamps & Tramps\u201d (1994) and now this one \u2014 display her worst qualities (we will get to these), which swamp her obvious intellect.The pieces in \u201cFree Women, Free Men\u201d have two primary targets. One is modern feminism, at least the spongy wing of it she considers to be puritanical and man-bashing. Here is the tightest and liveliest summation of her position I can find in this book:\u201cWomen will never know who they are until they let men be men. Let\u2019s get rid of Infirmary Feminism, with its bedlam of bellyachers, anorexics, bulimics, depressives, rape victims and incest survivors. Feminism has become a catchall vegetable drawer where bunches of clingy sob sisters can store their moldy neuroses.\u201dTell us how you really feel, Camille.Her second primary target is groupthink at America\u2019s coddling universities. A free-speech absolutist, she asks, \u201cHow is it possible that today\u2019s academic left has supported rather than protested campus speech codes as well as the grotesque surveillance and overregulation of student life?\u201dIn the wake of their violent treatment of a professor of international politics and of Charles Murray, an author of \u201cThe Bell Curve,\u201d students at Middlebury College, my alma mater, could do worse than invite Paglia to speak while on her book tour.Paglia considers herself, depending upon her mood, a libertarian feminist, a pro-sex feminist or an \u201cAmazon\u201d one. What she is really committed to, she writes in one essay here, is this: \u201cMy mission is to be absolutely as painful as possible in every situation.\u201dPaglia\u2019s arguments are incisive and worth tangling with. The problem, for the reader of \u201cFree Women, Free Men,\u201d is that she repeats the same arguments and anecdotes over and over again. Reading this book is like being stranded in a bar where the jukebox has only two songs, both by Pat Benatar.Paglia\u2019s petitions grow fuzzier with each iteration, as if they were documents smudged from being photocopied 300 times. Her prose can be electric. Yet too often in these pieces, you sense she\u2019s written them while in line at the bodega.For The Wall Street Journal, for example, she composed a piece in praise of football. It\u2019s included here, and it begins: \u201cThis week, after being written off for dead in a monthlong flurry of grumpy magazine articles, the National Football League stormed back and retook center stage.\u201d Three clich\u00e9s! In the first sentence!Paglia\u2019s temperament, in her essay collections, has much in common with that of our commander in chief. Like Trump, Paglia is paranoid and never forgets a slight. She speaks more than once here of \u201ccoordinated\u201d campaigns against her work.Like our leader, she is vainglory on wheels. This book\u2019s introduction is strewed with honeyed nuggets, like \u201cmy signature one-liners\u201d and \u201cmy flamboyant media presence\u201d and \u201cmy cheeky use of slang.\u201d (Readers can weigh a writer\u2019s cheekiness on their own home scales.)Declining an invitation to go on \u201cOprah\u201d with Naomi Wolf, she asks, \u201cWould Caruso appear with Tiny Tim?\u201d She\u2019s striding into Norman Mailer territory here, but this kind of guff dented Mailer\u2019s career as well.Like Trump, with his displays of steaks and Time magazine covers with his face upon them, Paglia also fills this book with her own clippings and glossy magazine covers. She\u2019s a lawyer who wears her diploma around her neck.\u201cI don\u2019t fit in anywhere!\u201d Paglia cries in one of these pieces. \u201cI\u2019m like this wandering being, the Ancient Mariner.\u201d When she bears down and worries about sentences more than poses, she doesn\u2019t wander at all. Then she\u2019s a fearless public intellectual and more necessary than ever.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Case Could Be a Watershed for Women in Tech", "Date": "2017-03-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtStill, the Uber scandal feels different. It feels like a watershed. For gender-diversity advocates in the tech industry, Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations, and the public outcry they have ignited, offer a possibility that something new may be in the offing.What could happen? Something innovative: This could be the start of a deep, long-term and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women \u2014 not just at Uber but across the tech business, too.But precisely for those reasons, Ms. Kapor Klein argued that if Uber mounted an honest investigation into its culture and pledged to transparently remake what ails it, it could become a model for the industry.\u201cThey did ask me, \u2018Has anyone gotten it right in tech?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said not yet. And that means an opportunity for Uber.\u201dUnlike many aggressive start-ups that have come before it \u2014 Amazon and Facebook, for instance, were no pushovers \u2014 Uber is not a natural monopoly. It sells a service that has ready substitutes, and it has well-funded competitors in many of its major markets. Its rivals have put their supposedly friendlier brands at the center of their competitive strategy. They are all waiting for Uber to fail, and every time Uber finds a way to lower its reputation even further, competitors can peel off customers, drivers and engineers.Finally, there\u2019s the Trump factor. Ever since the presidential election, people in the tech industry have been amped up. Employees and customers have learned to take up arms against companies that don\u2019t espouse their values, and companies have started to listen.\u201cLeft-leaning Silicon Valley has been embracing the Women\u2019s March and had this heightened awareness about issues that women face due to misogynistic men,\u201d said Karen Catlin, a former software engineer who is now an advocate for women in the tech industry. Now the same social-media energy aimed at President Trump is being marshaled against Uber, better known on Twitter as #deleteUber.Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, and others at the company appear to understand the gravity of the threat. The company moved swiftly to open an investigation into Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations. Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur who sits on Uber\u2019s board, were among those it appointed to find out what\u2019s going wrong at the company.All of this could be for show. To a lot of people, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s word no longer carries much weight. But you don\u2019t have to just trust him. If Uber is serious about remaking its culture, we can watch for concrete action.Ms. Kapor Klein is looking for several steps. She wants Mr. Holder\u2019s report to detail for the public everything he\u2019s found at the company. She wants to see new policies for how Uber hires people, ones that put more weight on the diversity of its work force. She wants the company to offer more formal and informal ways for employees to report problems to management, including allowing them to do so anonymously in order to avoid retribution. She also wants Uber to offer more training for employees, and better workplace surveys to get a sense of what\u2019s going wrong.Finally, Ms. Kapor Klein said, she would be scrutinizing Mr. Kalanick\u2019s own actions.\u201cYou need unequivocal commitment from the top,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone does something abhorrent, do you fire your best performer? That is the litmus test.\u201dAn Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the outcome of Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation, which is just beginning, but said that all of Ms. Kapor Klein\u2019s recommendations were on the table.Whatever Uber does in the next few weeks will only be a start. People who fight for diversity in the tech industry point out it is a hard problem to solve; it could take years of careful and publicly embarrassing actions for Uber and other companies to become more hospitable to women.\u201cThis stuff is deeply entrenched,\u201d Ms. Kapor Klein said, relaying a story she had recently heard about a group of programmers at a different tech company. \u201cI heard about this engineer who said that what he and his friends do at work for fun is rate women job applicants according to who they wanted to marry, or who they wanted to kill, and there was a third thing.\u201d Suffice it to say the third thing was not the women\u2019s qualifications for the job in question.\u201cThat just goes to show you the backdrop we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d she said. \u201cFixing this will be a marathon, not a sprint.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Amazon\u2019s Cashews and Cacao Point to Cultivation by the Ancients", "Date": "2017-03-03", "News": "Supported byTrilobitesScientists studying the Amazon rain forest are tangled in a debate of nature versus nurture.Now, researchers have found evidence that indigenous people may have domesticated and cultivated Amazonian plants and trees thousands of years ago, further supporting the idea that ancient humans helped shape the forest.He was one of more than a hundred researchers who found that domesticated tree and palm species \u2014 like cacao, cashews, the a\u00e7a\u00ed palm, the Brazil nut and rubber \u2014 were five times more likely to dominate the modern Amazonian forest than nondomesticated plants.One way the team determined that a plant had been domesticated was a look at its fruit. They found, for example, some peach palms that bore fruit weighing 200 grams, or 0.44 pounds, when the fruit grown in the wild matured to about one gram. Several of the domesticated plants they identified are still grown by South Americans.Ms. Levis compared her list of 85 plants to another database of more than 3,000 archaeological sites, including ceramics, dirt mounds and rock paintings, dating back before the Spaniards and Portuguese arrived in the Americas 500 years ago. The domesticated plants flourished near the archaeological sites, far more so than nondomesticated ones.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that we show these correlations between plant species in the forest today and archaeological finds,\u201d she said.The findings suggest that either the ancient civilizations grew and cultivated the plants, or that they purposely settled in areas that had plants they could eat and use. Ms. Levis said she suspected that people were domesticating the plants, although the study did not definitively pinpoint how settlements were chosen. In some plots, more than half of the plant life consisted of domesticated trees and palms.Dr. ter Steege disagreed. The study \u201cchanged my view of the forest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the ecology or the environment that created this forest, but also the people who lived there before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using Sling TV and Secure Texts to Keep on Top of Trump", "Date": "2017-03-15", "News": "Supported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Michael D. Shear, a White House correspondent for The Times, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As a White House reporter, you must be bombarded with news about the Trump administration. What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat?Now, no matter where I am \u2014 at my desk, at a restaurant, or in a van waiting for POTUS to play a round of golf \u2014 I have access to cable news reports and live streams from the White House.What do you like about the setup, and what could be better about it?I like the fact that Sling TV works just about everywhere. There are apps for my iPhone 7 and my iPad Air, as well as my MacBook Pro and the Apple TVs and Rokus I have at home.The apps load quickly and even work behind the firewall at work.I do have a few gripes. For now, you can\u2019t pause most shows on Sling TV, and there\u2019s no recording of shows. (The company has a DVR beta in the works, but I haven't been able to get in.) And there are often hiccups. The audio and video are often, frustratingly, out of sync, especially for MSNBC and NBC. And there are times that the channels say \u201cunavailable\u201d for a few seconds, or a few minutes, with no explanation. Also, because of licensing issues, I can get NBC and Fox, but not ABC or CBS.As a political reporter, how do you keep messages, contacts and phone calls secure from surveillance?I\u2019ve always been pretty careful about electronic security. I have two-factor authentication turned on for all of my accounts \u2014 email, iCloud, etc. And I\u2019m as careful as I can be to avoid being trapped by a phishing scam. I rarely click on any link from an email, and I\u2019m pretty aggressive about sending emails that I don't recognize to spam.How do you keep on top of President Trump\u2019s Twitter?Having covered the White House since the beginning of 2009, I\u2019m definitely having to adjust to a new rhythm. I have about a dozen Twitter accounts set to alert me to every tweet, including the @POTUS and @RealDonaldTrump accounts, as well as the president\u2019s senior staff like @Presssec (Sean Spicer), @KellyannePolls and others. I had to adjust my Do Not Disturb settings on my iPhone so that notifications resume earlier \u2014 at 5:30 a.m. now. (There are overnight editors who can call me if he tweets between midnight and 5:30 a.m.)I also make extensive use of my Apple Watch to keep tabs on the president\u2019s Twitter habit throughout the day. I generally keep the speaker on mute, but the watch\u2019s haptic engine taps my wrist anytime he or his aides tweet.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?So far, I use it as a timer when I cook. I find it much easier to simply say \u201cHey, Google, set a timer for 30 minutes\u201d than to use the old-fashioned timer on my oven.We also have fun using Google Home for our grocery shopping list. Throughout the week, as we notice things we need at the store, any of us can say, \u201cHey Google, add orange juice to the shopping list.\u201d It\u2019s eerily accurate, even on stranger items. The list is automatically compiled in a Google Keep note that all of us have access to. (I will admit that my 14-year-old daughter is having fun putting weird items on the list to surprise me when I go to the grocery.)What could be better about it?The problem with Google Home \u2014 and the reason it often sits, neglected, on the counter \u2014 is that it just doesn\u2019t do that much. It can\u2019t send emails or text (yet). It can do some limited shopping, but isn\u2019t connected (for obvious competitive reasons) to our Amazon shopping account. It can\u2019t (yet) be used as a convenient speakerphone.

If you read a fantastic-sounding allegation in a Facebook post or a tweet, or on a no-name internet site, try to see whether that allegation is also being reported by The Washington Post or Fox News. Go to the fact-checkers at various news organizations.

{"Headline": "SpaceX Launches a Satellite With a Partly Used Rocket", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byA Falcon 9 rocket from SpaceX \u2014 formally Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, based in Hawthorne, Calif. \u2014 lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to deposit the payload, a telecommunications satellite that will service Latin America, in the proper orbit.What was noteworthy was that the first stage, or booster, of the rocket had already flown once before. It could conceivably launch again, since it returned in one piece, landing on a floating platform in the Atlantic.\u201cIt did this mission perfectly,\u201d Mr. Musk said during a SpaceX broadcast of the launch. \u201cIt dropped off the second stage, came back and landed on the drone ship. Right in the bulls-eye.\u201d\u201cIt means you can fly and refly an orbital class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket,\u201d Mr. Musk said.Until now, almost all rockets have been single use. Once the fuel is spent, a rocket stage plummets to Earth, a quick demise to a complex machine that cost tens of millions of dollars to build.Mr. Musk has likened that to scrapping a 747 jet after one flight.After the platform returned to port in Jacksonville, Fla., the booster was refurbished, tested and deemed ready for another flight. SES, the company that owns and operates the satellite launched Thursday, was the first commercial customer for a Falcon 9 in 2013, and it signed up for the first flight with a recycled booster at a discount from the usual $62 million launch price. Neither SES nor SpaceX has publicly said how large the discount was.Mr. Musk has suggested that rocket launches could eventually be much cheaper because the cost of rocket propellants is less than 1 percent of the full price for a launch. So if a rocket could simply be refueled like a jetliner for another flight, the cost of space travel could drop to a fraction of what it is now.How that might play out in practice is still unclear. The same reasoning led NASA to develop space shuttles in the 1970s, but the savings never materialized because of the extensive refurbishment of the orbiters needed between flights. \u201cWe were pushing a lot of technology,\u201d said Daniel Dumbacher, a former NASA official who is now a professor at Purdue University.SpaceX, however, has a better chance. The Falcon 9 was designed from the start to be reusable. Its engines, for example, do not offer cutting-edge performance \u2014 but that means they are simpler and more robust, and thus easier, faster and cheaper to get ready for the next flight.\u201cThey\u2019ve taken the right first steps,\u201d Mr. Dumbacher said. \u201cThis is where you just have to get out and do it.\u201dIn the near term, reusable rockets could lower the cost of launching satellites and thus make space affordable to more companies for more uses. Currently, most satellites are used for telecommunications or for observations of the Earth.For his Mars dreams, Mr. Musk envisions a gargantuan spaceship he calls the Interplanetary Transport System that would someday transport humans. That would be far too expensive to be thrown away, so SpaceX needs to solve the reusability problem.Perhaps an even greater challenge is finding a way to finance the development of such a large rocket. Today, most of SpaceX\u2019s revenue comes from launching satellites for commercial companies and from NASA contracts to take cargo and, soon, astronauts to the International Space Station.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", "Date": "2017-03-09", "News": "\nBy Nitsuh AbebeA strange thing you learn about American popular music, if you look back far enough, is that for a long time it didn\u2019t much have \u201cgenres\u201d \u2014 it had ethnicities. Vaudeville acts, for instance, had tunes for just about every major immigrant group: the Italian number, the Yiddish number, the Irish one, the Chinese. Some were sung in a spirit of abuse; others were written or performed by members of those groups themselves. And of course there were the minstrel shows, in which people with mocking, cork-painted faces sang what they pretended were the songs of Southern former slaves. This was how we reckoned with our melting pot: crudely, obliviously, maybe with a nice tune and a beat you could dance to.Sometime in the 1950s, the mainstream saw its last great gasp of this habit. A nation that considered itself very space-age and worldly enjoyed quaint spins on sentimental Italian music (\u201cThat\u2019s Amore\u201d and its pizza pies) and Trinidadian calypso songs about hard, simple labor (\u201cDay-O\u201d and its bananas). You had your \u201cLatin\u201d numbers, your Hawaiian ones, your \u201cAsian\u201d songs \u2014 light ethnic pastiches laid out cheerily, like an international buffet that serves falafel one day and schnitzel the next, never too bothered about how accurate the recipes are.There was a simple notion behind all this stuff, and it was the belief that music, like food, came from someplace, and from some people. Even when it was played in a condescending ethnic-joke burlesque of who those people actually were \u2014 even when it was pretty aggressively racist \u2014 the notion remained: Different styles sprang from different people. Then all of this changed, and we decided to start thinking of pop music not as a folk tradition but as an art; we started to picture musicians as people who invented sounds and styles, making intellectual decisions about their work.But music is still, pretty obviously, tied to people. How else do you create a situation in which, after decades of hip-hop\u2019s being the main engine of pop music, it can still be a little complicated when nonblack people rap? That vexed thing we call \u201cidentity\u201d leans its considerable weight on all kinds of questions: which sounds comfort us or excite us; where and how we listen to them; how we move our bodies as they play. Watch a mere silhouette of a human being dancing to music, and you can immediately guess things about who they are and where they came from.In 2017, identity is the topic at the absolute center of our conversations about music. There may be times when this fact grates at us, when it feels as though there must be other dimensions of the world to attend to; \u201csurely,\u201d you moan, \u201cthere are songs that speak to basic human emotions in ways that transcend the particulars of who we are!\u201d But if you look through the essays in this magazine, you may notice two things. One is that, unbidden and according to no plan, they find themselves continually reckoning with questions of identity. The other is that they\u2019re doing this because the musicians are, too.A Japanese-American musician writes a song called \u201cYour Best American Girl.\u201d An R.&B. singer titles one \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d \u2014 or, \u201cfor us, by us.\u201d Are you part of her \u201cus\u201d? The house music in Kanye West\u2019s \u201cFade\u201d: Does it make you picture the black Chicagoans who helped invent it or the club-going Europeans who embraced it? How does it work when a queer woman matches the sexual braggadocio of male rappers, when L.G.B.T. activists sing a country song for a restaurant chain that once fired gay employees, when Leonard Cohen revisits his childhood religious inheritance?This is what we talk about now, the music-makers and the music-listeners both. Not the fine details of genre and style \u2014 everyone, allegedly, listens to everything now \u2014 but the networks of identity that float within them. Maybe decades ago you could aim your songs at a mass market, but music does not really have one of those anymore. Artists have to figure out whom they\u2019re speaking to and where they\u2019re speaking from. The rest of us do the same. For better or worse, it\u2019s all identity now. \u2666Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.All I want to do is dance \u2014 but it\u2019s complicated.By Wesley MorrisLoving Adele shouldn\u2019t be that hard. When a chorus brings her voice to its cruising altitude, it\u2019s like you\u2019re up there, flying with it. Down here, on earth, where her third album, \u201c25,\u201d made Adele the top-selling artist of 2015 and 2016, she has that realness we say we value in the people we elevate to stardom; last month, during the Grammys telecast, she cursed as she interrupted a laconic version of George Michael\u2019s \u201cFastlove\u201d in order to get the tempo right.But even Adele knows that loving Adele is complicated. At the Grammys, \u201c25\u201d won album of the year, and a poignant portion of her acceptance speech was a tribute to Beyonc\u00e9, whose album \u201cLemonade\u201d broke the cultural Richter scale \u2014 and didn\u2019t win any of the big awards. The moment was poignant because it was earnest: Adele stood just a few feet in front of the woman she called her \u201cidol\u201d and spoke of how \u201cLemonade\u201d had empowered her and \u201cmy black friends.\u201d This was the sort of candor you usually have to wait for Kanye West to deliver, only with none of West\u2019s biliousness, recrimination and, however myopic, sense of history. Adele didn\u2019t have to acknowledge that history \u2014 of a white industry\u2019s crowning preference for white artists. She was living it.Black people have never been necessary to make black music. But it has become obligatory for white artists who do (and who win prizes for it) to pay a public contrition tax to their black peers, whether it\u2019s Adele to Beyonc\u00e9 or, three years earlier, Macklemore texting (then publicizing) an apology to Kendrick Lamar for having won (with Ryan Lewis) the Grammys in the rap category. That\u2019s the future of music: recognizing, in the present, that you\u2019re permanently indentured to the past.Setting aside its enormous sales, \u201c25\u201d is not the artistically catholic landmark that \u201cLemonade\u201d is but an old-fashioned record, built around the bloom and flare of Adele\u2019s singing. Some of the hooks, though, could catch a whale. And isn\u2019t whaling pop\u2019s whole point?Yes, certain cultural institutions have a habit of setting traps that trigger trauma. But when it\u2019s just me and Adele \u2014 very good Adele, catchy-as-hell Adele \u2014 the triggers lock. \u201cSend My Love (to Your New Lover),\u201d the second track on \u201c25,\u201d makes you mad that we live in a world where what happens at the Grammys can\u2019t not matter. It makes you mad that we put a political price tag on this kind of perfection. I must have danced to this song 200 times, in blocks of repeats. (Why doesn\u2019t this woman make more fast songs?)It starts with her saying, \u201cJust the guitar. O.K., cool.\u201d Then comes the rhythmic plink of a guitar Lindsey Buckingham might have picked. The plink is married to a kick drum\u2019s heartbeat. Then comes The Voice, at a low smolder, the smoke still rising from a crater of disillusionment. By the prechorus, her voice is flanked by other Adeles swooping in, on multiple tracks, to dispel the dismay of having dated someone with cold feet and to wish the best for this person\u2019s next girlfriend. \u201cSend my love to your new lover. Treat her better,\u201d she sings, going up a note and adding an extra, addictive breath to \u201clover.\u201dIs this a black song? It moves in dance-hall time. The swelling repetitions are chillingly churchy. And the voice itself has what can be only called soul. It\u2019s in the pews, the rafters and the aisles. I love this song because it makes me feel strong \u2014 as strong as singing \u201cWe gon\u2019 slay\u201d any time Beyonc\u00e9 does. In other words, \u201cSend My Love\u201d sets out to catch a whale. This song makes me feel ridiculous for reacting to institutional biases that pressure us into calling Adele a trespasser. All I want to do when I hear it is call her Ishmael.\u2666Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.After a long life, he was ready.By Jonathan MahlerIt wasn\u2019t an email from God, but it was close. Leonard Cohen had written to ask if Gideon Zelermyer, the cantor of Congregation Shaar Hashomayim near Montreal \u2014 Cohen\u2019s childhood synagogue \u2014 was interested in recording with him.Zelermyer was soon sitting inside the synagogue\u2019s sanctuary with a few members of Shaar\u2019s all-male choir, playing with different arrangements for \u201cYou Want It Darker,\u201d the title track of Cohen\u2019s 14th and final studio album. Some of the words Cohen had given them to work with were familiar; they were borrowed from two of Judaism\u2019s holiest prayers. One is the Kaddish, recited by mourners after the death of a loved one. The other is the High Holy Days prayer Hineni \u2014 literally, \u201cHere I am\u201d \u2014 a personal entreaty to God, the worshiper asking plaintively for mercy. The choir\u2019s voices are the first sounds you hear on the album, their ethereal harmonics giving way to sparse instrumentation and Cohen\u2019s weary, subterranean growl, then returning to back up the song\u2019s choruses and final movement.This was hardly the first time that Cohen had drawn on his Judaism for his music. Though he had a complicated relationship with his religious inheritance, it provided a natural vocabulary for him; it was what he knew, and its stories of human suffering and, occasionally, redemption suited his poet\u2019s pull toward the existential. But never before have Cohen\u2019s biblical references felt so charged, so dark, so pointed. \u201cMagnified, sanctified, be thy holy name,\u201d he sings. \u201cVilified, crucified, in the human frame. A million candles burning for the help that never came. You want it darker.\u201d Then, echoing the words that Abraham spoke as he answered God\u2019s command to sacrifice his only son: \u201cHineni, I\u2019m ready, my Lord.\u201dYou can\u2019t listen to these words without thinking about the fact that Cohen was dying when he recorded them. It\u2019s one thing to meditate on faith and mortality when death is an abstraction. It is surely another when you can feel it bearing down on you. And yet the choir\u2019s harmonies manage to transform the song, lifting Cohen\u2019s solitary struggle into something universal, even eternal.Cohen once said that he did not think of himself as a religious person, but his life was in many ways an extended spiritual journey. Buddhism, Scientology, kabbalah, Hare Krishna, Hinduism \u2014 Cohen sampled them all. Yet in his final years, he found himself drawn back to the 171-year-old synagogue where he had become a bar mitzvah, where both his grandfather and great-grandfather served as presidents, where a photograph of his Hebrew-school class taken in 1949 still hangs on the wall. Cohen was living in Los Angeles, but a cousin in Montreal sent him a recording of Zelermyer and his choir, reuniting Cohen with sounds that had never stopped echoing in his head. He and the cantor struck up an email correspondence. \u201cMay your voice reach that Place and bring down the blessings,\u201d Cohen wrote Zelermyer in 2008, before the High Holy Days. (\u201cHe can\u2019t write anything normally, can he?\u201d the cantor remembers thinking.) And then several years later came the note, asking for help with a new record. As Cohen put it, \u201cI\u2019m looking for a sound like the Shaar choir and cantor of my youth.\u201dIn October, the record-release event for \u201cYou Want It Darker\u201d was held at the residence of the Canadian consul general in Los Angeles. Zelermyer was seated with the other V.I.P.s in the front row. It was the first time he had met Cohen in person. It would also be the last. Weeks later, Cohen\u2019s coffin was lowered into the earth at Shaar Hashomayim\u2019s cemetery. Zelermyer stood next to Cohen\u2019s family as they recited the Kaddish.\u2666Jonathan Mahler is a staff writer for the magazine.A rap legend bends the present into a hopeful future.By Julianne Escobedo ShepherdWhen Missy Elliott divines the future in her science-fiction-inflected videos, she never envisions dystopia. Even in the oversize jacket bearing the slogan \u201cSave the Humans\u201d that she wears in the video for \u201cI\u2019m Better,\u201d her optimism supersedes the plea. Positivity feels like an intrinsic part of her message and her temperament, and in a climate of uncertainty and fear, \u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d is an alien message of hope, full of sneaky inspiration meant to help us get up in the morning, rise-and-grind style. \u201cIt\u2019s another day, another chance,\u201d the Miami producer Lamb raps, helping Elliott out on the chorus. \u201cI wake up, I wanna dance. So as long as I got my friends ... I\u2019m better, I\u2019m better, I\u2019m better!\u201dReleased in the last week of January, the signature futurism of \u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d was a welcome jolt. The beat is so stark it\u2019s almost jarring, with a tiptoeing synth melody that makes Elliott sound like some kind of gumshoe on the case, tracking down dudes in the act of creeping. Characteristically slick, the video features dancers in headgear that mimics light-therapy acne masks. Elliott gleams in outlandish feathered adornment and lip gloss the color of a vinyl record, delivering cheeky brags about her coterie of admirers, who watch her \u201clike he watchin\u2019 \u2018Scandal\u2019 \u2014 but I\u2019m just here with my girls.\u201dElliott\u2019s approach has always been an antidote to conservatism, both within music and sometimes outside it. She\u2019s unwilling to abide by any perceived rules of language. For years, she has bent rhythmic parameters and willfully warped nouns so that they rhyme, as if to prove that there\u2019s always another, probably far cooler way of going about life and language than the rest of us have recognized. On \u201cI\u2019m Better,\u201d she rhymes the Spanish word for \u201cfire\u201d with an English word for a car \u2014 \u201cHe say I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m so fue-eh-go/Pull up on him in my veh-heh-co.\u201d These tricks carry such uncomplicated joy that they give us permission to celebrate too. \u201cHe say I\u2019m pretty, I\u2019m pretty, you must be from Brazil, I must be from M\u00e9xico,\u201d she concludes, rhyming the Spanish pronunciation \u2014 and giving dap to those of us with origins in the global South, who could use the shout-out these days.\u201cI\u2019m Better\u201d also positions Elliott in the American South, the Virginia of her upbringing, as well as Orlando, Miami, Atlanta. Its sound adheres to current trends in Southern hip-hop \u2014 which is curious, because Elliott sets trends but rarely follows them. Yet by employing the syrupy, stripped-down delivery so many young Southern rappers favor, she establishes a lineage, from her work to theirs: Stylistically, it is difficult to imagine a Migos without a Missy Elliott.For Elliott to position herself within a style that\u2019s popular and yet often derided, usually by Northerners and hip-hop fans over the age of 25 \u2014 for her to sprinkle her flavor on the 2017 iteration of music made for the subwoofers in your Jeep \u2014 does a real service to youth culture. More than most rappers, she seems to bend time to her will. And if she can\u2019t stop it, she will swerve around it.\u2666Julianne Escobedo Shepherd is the culture editor for Jezebel.Party music for the age of opiates.By Amos BarshadOn the first night I found myself at a chicken shop called Nando\u2019s, directly across the street from his overflowing concert venue, rather than backstage as planned. With great envy, I stared at the crowd flowing in as I munched my breast-and-wing combo.Future had just sat down for an interview with the BBC\u2019s Charlie Sloth, who asked him about his relationship with Blac Chyna, the Kardashian-affiliated reality-TV personality with whom he\u2019d possibly been romantically involved. \u201cAre yous two still cool?\u201d Sloth asked, in a punchy London rumble. \u201cWe great,\u201d Future responded, in his trademark flat-affect reserve.Privately, though, the entreaty into his personal life enraged him. He declared an immediate media blackout. I was in line for his concert when I got the call from P.R.: The interview was decisively off. I spent a weekend eating delicious Pakistani food, watching Tottenham play Leicester City, hoping for a change of mind that never came.At that point, Future was roughly two years into a radical public and artistic reimagining. It started in the fall of 2014, not long after his breakup with the R.&B. singer Ciara and the soft landing of his pop-friendly sophomore album, \u201cHonest.\u201d The failure became an important inflection point. Over the next few years, he created a swelling mass of music with a cloaking grandness to it: Take a step inside, and you were entombed. The songs were lean and incessant and almost completely devoid of any other voice but Future\u2019s. And what that voice was intimating to us, from behind the thickest of blackout curtains, was that our man had given up on his conscience and that he was guzzling the prescription cough syrup Promethazine and downing Xanax and that he was having sex with women he did not really care about and that this was neither making him feel good nor bad but rather it was making him feel nothing.And then, the really weird part: Suddenly, rightfully, Future was considered an artist who could not be ignored, our best next hope for rap-star transcendence. Embracing personal destruction took him there. Was it a meltdown or a rise? What were we to make of a man who made party music out of a death rattle? How should I know? I was stuck at Nando\u2019s.Take \u201cMask Off,\u201d a down-tempo track built, by the elite producer Metro Boomin, around a bizarre but lovely woodwind sample. The song hints at a certain kind of violence and ruthlessness, the kind suggested by a criminal setting off into the night and choosing to leave the ski mask at home. And yet it\u2019s the kind of song you would want the D.J. to slip on right when you\u2019ve lost count of your drinks and you\u2019re feeling buzzy and smiley and warm.Historically, M.C.s have treated narcotics as product to be moved; today\u2019s younger, party-happy rappers give drugs a gleeful knucklehead spin. But when Future describes his voluminous intake, he does so with all the zeal of a man popping open a days-of-the-week pill organizer. On the hook to \u201cMask Off,\u201d Future rattles off drugs, unsentimentally: \u201cPercocets/Molly, Percocets.\u201d For him, sometimes the drugs are great; sometimes, not so much. On \u201cMask Off,\u201d amid rhymes about how totally fun and good his life is, he calls Promethazine his \u201cguillotine.\u201dIt feels reductive to try to pin an artist down on the sins of his persona. Hip-hop\u2019s greatest running trick has been blurring the lines of \u201creal life\u201d and art. But with the rate at which Future was rapping about drugs, one question was inevitably posed: Is this an addiction? If so, it was a new spin on a classic trope. The arc of pretty much every drug movie mimics the whiz-bang of the initial high and the eye-blackening horror of the inevitable comedown. Future\u2019s music acknowledged that drug addiction isn\u2019t that cinematically neat: It\u2019s the high and the comedown over and over again.After London, Future\u2019s P.R. staff and I got back into our little dance. Emails, calls, texts, pleadings. Soon, I received word that Future was ready to talk again. It was in Toronto that we actually met, and where it was so cold that the streets had a kind of a permafrost hue. The pavement felt as if it could, at any point, shatter. For a few days, I tagged along with Future and his affable crew. The first order of business was an interview with a TV station on the 19th floor of a high-end hotel.The interviewer, a friendly reporter in all black, was drinking a glass of white wine. She showed Future the tattoos on her arm; I couldn\u2019t quite see them, but they were apparently inspired by his music. \u201cOh!\u201d he said in delight, then waved away Shooter, his ever-present personal photographer. \u201cLet us have this moment.\u201d Apparently emboldened, the reporter shared more. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking \u2019cause I\u2019m nervous,\u201d she told him. She had ended a long-term relationship, she said, because of his music.In person, Future provides no outward signs that you should approach him with confessionals. He\u2019s imposingly tall and more than a little grave. He is also beautiful. (L.A. Reid, chairman of Epic Records, who signed Future, told me of their initial meeting: \u201cUsually I ask people to audition. Future, I didn\u2019t even want him to move. \u2018Let\u2019s get you signed while you\u2019re sitting there looking like that.\u2019\u2009\u201d) But the TV reporter went for it, and it was brave. And almost immediately, Future went back to thumbing through his phone. He either hadn\u2019t heard what she said or he chose to ignore it. After a few beats of silence he finally looked up. \u201cAy, what\u2019s the name of this hotel?\u201dThe next day, I finally had my chance to connect. We were upstairs at a middlebrow bistro with a lot of bare wood, and Future had just finished off an impromptu date. His partner had off-white blond hair tucked under an actually white baseball cap and was wearing a combination bodysuit/tunic (also white). She\u2019d brought him a late Valentine\u2019s Day gift, a nice puffy coat: \u201cIt\u2019s that Chanel swag!\u201d she announced. They ate sushi, chicken wings and steak salad. She told him that when she travels, she likes to stay at Airbnbs because that way you get \u201cimmersed\u201d in local culture.And I know this because during the totality of the date, the team and I were sitting at the adjoining table. Eventually his date left, and Future announced his verdict on the holiday, to grins from the crew: \u201cMan this Valentine\u2019s Day [expletive] a setup.\u201dFinally, we talked. I brought up London. He smiled. I guess you could call it a sheepish smile. I told him it really didn\u2019t seem as if he wanted to do press at all. I asked him why he was going through with it. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do it,\u201d he said, maybe even relieved to say it out loud. \u201cMy publicist like: \u2018Man, why you got a publicist if you don\u2019t wanna do press?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to give you the real me, but they want me to be fake, so I\u2019d rather not even say nothing.\u201dThe conversation rolled on, meandered. It even clicked into gear at a few points. He talked about his itinerant childhood, how he never wanted to have a fixed address so no one with an antagonistic agenda would ever be able to find him. He talked about the love and care of the family members that sorted him out. He remembered the joy of playing \u201cRacks,\u201d an early hit, for the first time and how the D.J. loved it so much he didn\u2019t want to give the CD back. And he said that it all, eventually, changed everything. \u201cBack then, I had no feelings,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started doing music that I started to really have a conscience.\u201dIt was nice, and fleeting. But I never was able to get a hook into him. I never could formulate a question that made him want to really talk. When I called DJ Spinz, one of Future\u2019s regular collaborators, he told me about Future\u2019s work ethic, his remarkable ability to unfurl a whole song after 20 minutes of hearing a beat roll. But nothing he said felt as relevant as when he told me this: \u201cFuture doesn\u2019t speak much.\u201dI was reminded of a moment back in London. I had stuck around after Nando\u2019s long enough to try to finagle my way into the show. My move was to sidle close to the stage door, in the alley, hoping for an opening. It never came. Upon Future\u2019s arrival, his luxury sedan idled until minutes before his set time. Then he exited the back seat and walked directly through the stage door, surrounded by an imposing security detail, with the massive hood of an arctic parka over his head. I never even saw his face.I chased Future through two separate sovereign nations and walked away remembering one thing: I love rappers. They never break character.\u2666Amos Barshad is a senior writer for The Fader magazine.Can choir nerds bring harmony to a divided country?By Amy PhillipsThe third of those Grammys, for Best Country Duo/Group Performance, came in February, for a collaboration with Dolly Parton on a new version of her \u201970s heartbreak classic, \u201cJolene.\u201d The world has Cracker Barrel to thank for this team-up: Both Parton and Pentatonix have partnerships with the chain, which brought them together to record \u201cJolene\u201d as a promotional single. The result sounds like a barbershop quartet singing at an old-timey barn raising. \u201cWe\u2019re both very family-centric and very wholesome,\u201d Kirstin Maldonado, the Pentatonix mezzo-soprano, said in 2015, explaining why the group\u2019s image meshes so well with the brand\u2019s, \u201cand I think our demographics really integrate well.\u201dThis \u201cSesame Street\u201d version of American harmony makes the group\u2019s association with Cracker Barrel \u2014 which has a history of discrimination \u2014 particularly fascinating. Despite looking like a United Colors of Benetton ad styled by the Kardashians, the members of Pentatonix sound like the jukebox at a heavily chaperoned sock hop; through them, Cracker Barrel can dip its toes in the waters of inclusion without fearing any backlash. Indeed, if you\u2019re looking for criticism of Pentatonix, you\u2019re more likely to find it on liberal music websites trashing its \u201cnightmarishly hammy\u201d sound (to quote Rolling Stone) than on conservative sites attacking its politics. Members have appeared on \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d and \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d and nobody batted an eye. Could it be that five choir nerds hold the secret to bridging a divided nation?\u2666Amy Phillips is the news director for Pitchfork.Who makes the protest music?By Greg TateOf course it would be A Tribe Called Quest who gave the nation\u2019s pop body politic its first acidly anthemic counterassault on Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant sentiments. This is, after all, the Golden Age vintage hip-hop band with respective Trinidadian-American and Muslim founders in Phife Dawg and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, one half of the original team; the one that gave dap to the plight of Haitian immigrants on its 1990 debut album, \u201cPeople\u2019s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm\u201d; the group whose very name is a panegyric in praise of the hyphenated American dream. Of course they did it.By February, A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s Grammy performance was sustaining the same Black Panther- and Public Enemy-powered momentum that Beyonc\u00e9 brought to last year\u2019s Super Bowl \u2014 the same kind in Kendrick Lamar\u2019s own fire-breathing, flame-throwing, plantation-to-penitentiary salvo at last year\u2019s Grammys.To the extent that America\u2019s current protest movement has provoked any pop paeans worthy of Bob Dylan or Curtis Mayfield, they have emerged out of Black Lives Matter \u2014 and in remarkably short order. It has been 31 months since \u201cwe the people\u201d of Ferguson, and then Baltimore, inspired not just those cities\u2019 urban commandos but a generation of youthful-and-truthful hip-hop and R.& B. standard-bearers. Whether the white alt-rock left will seize this moment\u2019s baton as frankly or as fruitfully remains to be seen.We need not hold our breath waiting, though. \u201cWe the People ....\u201d is full of ready-to-rumble pushback. Its lyrics name and gather together all the targeted \u2014 Mexicanfolk, Muslimfolk, gayfolk, womenfolk, #BlackLivesMatterfolk \u2014 under one force field. And under one intersectional, Queens-bred guerrilla meal plan:\u201cWe don\u2019t believe you \u2019cause we the peopleAre still here in the rear, ayo, we don\u2019t need youYou in the \u2018killing off good young nigga\u2019 moodWhen we get hungry we eat the same [expletive] foodThe ramen noodle.\u201d\u2666Greg Tate is a writer and musician who lives in Harlem.Rap music fully unmoored from its past.By JAMIE LAUREN KEILESThere are two different ways you can keep up with pop. The first is by drifting along with the current, bobbing immersed in the changing of the charts \u2014 so lost from any point of reference on the shore that minor fluctuations (the downfall of an air horn, the outflow of a sound) hardly register. From there, in the tide, you don\u2019t ask, \u201cHow did pop get here?\u201d because you were with it the whole time. You, most likely, are in high school, or college, or somewhere that music flows like water all around. Pop, in such places, is understood by osmosis.The rest of us \u2014 less lucky \u2014 must accept the second system. Somewhere along the way we get busy with work, or prioritize movies, or decide to have kids and look up to find we\u2019ve lost the thread. We emerge from our hiatus and turn on the radio only to wonder, \u201cHow did pop get here?\u201d We have no idea. It is then that we begin to study pop trends by rote \u2014 by reading reviews and listening to podcasts, by looking up songs on Shazam in the drugstore, by turning to Google to ask it: \u201cWho is Lil Yachty?\u201dBefore I heard Yachty\u2019s music, I heard that he was awful. I heard he had no flow and couldn\u2019t rap, was a meme and a poseur, wasn\u2019t repping the culture. Wiz Khalifa called his style \u201cmumble rap.\u201d His sound, I heard, was dinky. When I finally relented and listened to \u201cOne Night\u201d \u2014 Yachty\u2019s top-charting song of last year \u2014 nothing I heard could dispel what I\u2019d been told. Flow? Clumsy. Lyrics? Bland. The beat on the track was the inverse of a banger \u2014 tinny and thin, compulsively looping, like something churned out with a really cool toy. In a voice that was somehow both droning and singsong, the 19-year-old Atlantan wanly shrugged off commitment. It was an anthem for the player who can\u2019t be tied down, run a thousand times though a Xerox machine. Catchy like a backing track in a commercial, it was sticky for all the texture it lacked. I listened on repeat with car-crash infatuation. It wasn\u2019t good rap by any technical metric \u2014 or at least not by any metric I knew \u2014 but for some unknown reason, I wanted to like it. Like any pop \u00e9migr\u00e9, I started to study.The hip-hop establishment had little to offer. Ebro Darden of Hot 97 took to Twitter to whine about Yachty; \u201990s production legend Pete Rock posted online, \u201cHe sucks mud on a rainy day!\u201d Yachty, meanwhile, seemed to pay little mind to the genre conventions he\u2019d supposedly betrayed. Of hip-hop forefathers Biggie and Tupac, he told Billboard, \u201cI honestly couldn\u2019t name five songs.\u201d Instead, his influences were Fall Out Boy and Coldplay. He signed an endorsement deal with Target, alongside the Canadian pop star Carly Rae Jepsen. In Nautica shirts and plastic-beaded braids, he was an ungraceful hybrid of your grandpa and your niece. In the style of Warhol backstage at WrestleMania \u2014 awkward and quiet, but nonetheless enthused \u2014 he made the rounds, telling press outlets, \u201cI\u2019m not a rapper.\u201d Instead, he claimed he was an artist, a brand. As old-schoolers and gatekeepers scratched their heads and wept, Yachty continued to rise through the ranks, buoyed by fans who had no trouble understanding.The subsequent music video made a mockery of an older generation\u2019s rap-vid fantasies. What begins as Yachty on a yacht with three women quickly descends into maritime madness \u2014 jump-cuts from hammerhead sharks and harpoons, to dress-up in wet suits and other nautical garb, to glitch-art graphics of slow-swimming fish, calling to mind the early days of home computers. It\u2019s a sloppy pastiche of what\u2019s cool right now: a surging nostalgia for the \u201990s, blended with the net-art aesthetic of today, wrapped in the cachet of an Atlanta pedigree. It might all be a gimmick, but it doesn\u2019t feel random. If rap music is founded on a process of layering \u2014 autobiography with references and samples \u2014 then Yachty does the same for the rap career itself, mixing what\u2019s trending with the right group of friends and tying it together with the loose thread of a sound. If it isn\u2019t good rap, then it\u2019s the perfect kind of music for those of us barely treading water in the zeitgeist, who can\u2019t understand new music by ear. Yachty had to do his research, just like the rest of us.\u2666Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer based in Los Angeles.She has found her own corner of R.&B.By JENNA WORTHAMThere were no whoops, claps or even smiles. The audience remained passive. Kelela likes to keep an eye out for the edges of the crowd, where her core fans (\u201cthe queer black and brown weirdos\u201d as she put it to me) usually congregate. But tonight, the scene was homogeneous in a very European way: Women favored striped boatnecks, red lips and messy topknots; the men, zipped-up pullovers and spotless white trainers. Kelela nodded at her D.J., Loric Sih, a sweet-faced boy with bleached blond hair and wire-rimmed Harry Potter glasses, and they dove into her set. True to her word, amid the switchbacks of her feathery falsetto voice, there was no mistaking the roots of classic R.&B. \u2014 all set to spacey electronic beats far outside the traditional canon. The room became a sound installation of Kelela\u2019s reverb-y vocals and synthetic \u201990s-era Miami bass.Kelela\u2019s stage was minimally adorned, but her lighting team is adept at creating James Turrell-like lightscapes that drape her figure in rich reds, purples and blues. At one point, her face and body were illuminated by an electric shade of cyan, while the background remained shaded in dark azure. The effect made Kelela look as ethereal and spectral as the music radiating from the speakers. The handful of times I\u2019d seen her perform in the United States, the audience was rapt for the entire performance \u2014 reverent during her atmospheric songs, breaking into exuberant, feverish dance during her fast-paced ones. (Her music can keep the lovesick company in bed just as easily as it can shepherd a party past sunrise.)But that night the concertgoers remained inscrutable. When she transitioned into a new song \u2014 \u201cBlue Light,\u201d the first single from her long-awaited debut album \u2014 I pulled out my phone and sent the recording to some friends back home. Some 4,000 miles away, they seemed more excited than the people physically present in the concert hall. Finally, about 30 minutes into her set, Sih began playing \u201cRewind,\u201d the closest thing Kelela has to a pop song. The audience, charmed at last, succumbed to the irresistible beat and danced along. The moment was buoyant but short-lived: It was her last number. She thanked the crowd and then bounded offstage.When she was back in her dressing room, the composure Kelela had projected to the audience quickly dissipated. She stood with her hands on her hips, chewing on her lip. Her boyfriend \u2014 a filmmaker named Cieron Magat, with whom she shares an apartment in London \u2014 murmured words of reassurance and handed her a cup of homemade ginger tea. \u201cThat was one of the worst ones,\u201d she said, sighing and taking off her earrings. Magat told her not to worry, but Kelela wanted to deconstruct the performance.\u201cThe thing I\u2019m always looking for are the eyes, or even the face that\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know what this is but I\u2019m into it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I got nothing.\u201d She peeled her clothes off absent-mindedly and paced around her dressing room. \u201cI was this guy\u201d \u2014 she threw her arms up in imitation of the shruggie emoticon \u2014 and sighed again. \u201cBut it\u2019s unrealistic in this context.\u201dIn her dressing room, Kelela folded herself into a pretzel on the couch next to me. A candle burned in the background. She knew it had been an off night, but because she loves performing so much, she was still buzzing from the energy. \u201cThe goal,\u201d she explained, \u201cis just \u2014 how many people can I put on, just so they can name it, even if they don\u2019t know what it is yet?\u201dIn her early to mid 20s, she would go to a Washington bar called 18th Street Lounge for its Sunday-night house sessions. A D.J. named Sam Burns played eclectic soul and deep house music, and after a few drinks, if she heard a bit of music that reminded her of another song, she would jump on the microphone and blend the two in real-time. \u201cI would run to the microphone and figure out a way to sing it. I would create a flip,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is where I live.\u201dHer first boyfriend, Kris Funn, whom she met when she was 19, played the upright bass, and she sat in bars for hours, watching him and his friends play. She joked to me that she was a \u201cjazz wife\u201d but also admitted that she received an unexpected education: She learned to listen to music, to get a feel for it. Eventually the couple broke up, but Funn encouraged Kelela to trust her instincts and not be intimidated by her lack of formal music training.By that time, Kelela was a student at American University, studying international studies and sociology. \u201cI was the only brown girl, all the time, talking about African politics,\u201d she told me. \u201cI thought I was going to be an academic. In my head, I am supposed to be a college graduate. I wanted to finish. But I was not motivated to sit there and do that paper. I had a lot of resistance.\u201d She felt alienated by the program. She dropped out.This was in 2006, and synthpop, epitomized by bands like the Knife, was trending. She began recording in a punk house in Washington, a city with a hard-core lineage that included acts like Fugazi and Bad Brains. She thrived in an environment devoid of rules. \u201cWhat\u2019s so beautiful about punk culture,\u201d Kelela says, \u201cis that the whole idea is that you don\u2019t have to be perfect. Just try. Let\u2019s just try to make it ourselves.\u201d At first she sang over indie rock, but it didn\u2019t feel authentic to her. She wanted to experiment with electronic music \u2014 \u201cnot real instruments,\u201d she says.She spent hours on MySpace, scrolling through pages of music and listening to instrumentals. She recorded herself singing over sounds she liked. Then she would send the artist her sample, along with an invitation to collaborate. Two notable electronic producers agreed, including Daedelus, who featured her on a track. At the same time, a friend introduced her to the electro duo Teengirl Fantasy, and they created a song. Will Boston, a founder of the music label Fade to Mind, heard their collaboration and was impressed by what he described to me as her \u201cwealth of startling honesty, felt through her vocals.\u201dBy then, Kelela was living in Los Angeles, and Boston brought her a thumb drive of sounds from the label and its British counterpart, Night Slugs. Kelela spent the next several days poring over the files, improvising lyrics over the sounds she liked, turning them into songs. She loved the otherworldliness of the instrumentals \u2014 staccato mixes that used sound effects like tinkling glass and guns reloading over drum machines. The music complemented the gossamer scales she likes to sing in. It was \u201cexactly what I\u2019d been looking for,\u201d she says. Two of the songs she produced during this time were on the mixtape she released in 2013. Kelela took care to describe her role in developing the mixtape, to make certain I knew how active she was in it \u2014 perhaps to counter the idea that she isn\u2019t self-made or in charge of her own sound. \u201cThe first thing people want to take away from me is my agency,\u201d she told me.Alex Sushon, an electronic producer who goes by Bok Bok, was one of the artists Kelela met as she was working on her mixtape, and these days, she tends to work mostly with British producers like him, possibly because they\u2019ve been pushing the boundaries of R.&B. more aggressively by blending it with grime, the East London style of dance music. Electronica, Sushon told me, is referential in the same way that R.&B. tends to be. \u201cThat\u2019s how we think about music, inserting small samples from other genres, little shortcuts that are saying something by playing something,\u201d he says. Because of the internet, he explained, musicians can share references more easily than they did in the past. Google, YouTube and SoundCloud make it easy. Sushon compares this dynamic to \u201cmemes, but in musical form.\u201dThe closest analogy is sampling, but it\u2019s more complex than that. I watched Kelela and her D.J. perform this trick onstage, during one of their songs in Strasbourg. While she was singing \u201cThe High,\u201d a fuzzed-out, gritty ode to desire, Sih mixed in a few seconds of a 2002 song by Tweet called \u201cOops (Oh My),\u201d and Kelela segued into its vocals. Here, suddenly, was the thrilling flicker of a decade-old hit that had almost entirely faded from popular culture, tucked into her own noir love song. It was the perfect encapsulation of Kelela\u2019s odd 21st-century gift for taking familiar sounds and repurposing them in a new context, a kind of lyrical d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.The dynamics that bothered Kelela in college didn\u2019t disappear when she became an artist \u2014 if anything, they intensified. As a student, she was introduced to black academics and feminists like Audre Lorde, Bell Hooks and Angela Davis. These women helped her make sense of the racial and sexist forces that shape the world, and she still turns to them to navigate the music industry. She internalized their insistence to not be apologetic for her womanhood or blackness and not be debilitated by exclusion.Sprawled on the bed in the apartment\u2019s master bedroom, Kelela told me that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s loss at the Grammys depressed her and made her question the metrics of success for mainstream musicians. \u201cIf that\u2019s the highest we can achieve in that framework, it doesn\u2019t even make sense to try,\u201d she told me. A notebook was open to a blank page on the night stand, alongside \u201cB Jenkins,\u201d a Fred Moten poetry book that explores the interstitial space among jazz, black aesthetics and politics. Moten\u2019s work concerns itself with the \u201cresistance of the object\u201d and the way that blackness refuses commodification. Kelela is aware of how artists like her get co-opted, morphed into something symbolic that they no longer control, and is determined to avoid it.I had already heard the lengths to which she would go to prevent this from happening. The first night we met, I asked her how she managed expectations as an artist in an age of hyperconsumption. I mostly meant her reserve on social media, despite the disturbingly insistent demands in her Twitter and Instagram mentions for her next release. Instead, she described an encounter with Fendi, the Italian luxury brand, which invited her to perform at its new headquarters in Rome to celebrate the start of a new website aimed at millennials. Researching the headquarters online, she discovered that the Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana, the impressive white marble colosseum that Fendi had taken over, was built to be a propaganda tool under Benito Mussolini. \u201cI\u2019m Ethiopian,\u201d she reminded me: Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935, just before World War II. She didn\u2019t want her body, her blackness, to be used by a brand, even a big fashion label like Fendi, as a proxy for cool in this context. She asked Fendi representatives to agree to release a statement addressing her concerns as a condition of her involvement. \u201cThat flipped the whole damn script,\u201d she said. They\u2019re still negotiating the partnership, but the interaction speaks to how Kelela views her role: \u201cIf an artist says something, people listen,\u201d she told me. She sees herself as someone who can wield her status as a celebrity to catalyze change.As the evening wound down, Kelela invited me to get comfortable and listen to some of her new tracks. She gave me earbuds and left me alone to listen. (When I pressed her about a release date, she made a coquettish face and demurred, saying the songs were still being mixed. In reality, she just signed with Warp Records, which will take over the release of the album.) Earlier in the night, she said that as politically aware as she feels she is, she didn\u2019t make an album that addresses those views. \u201cThere was a period after I finished all the songs, I was nervous because I was like: There\u2019s nothing about my experience as a black woman overtly in this. But I could never not make anything from any other place.\u201d The songs instead deal with the agony of falling out of love and the ecstasy of finding it anew. Her voice is as pretty as ever, rising and crashing like cresting waves over beats that swing from a druggy drone to throbbing bass lines perfect for dance-floor grinding. In their own way, they are a quiet protest: They feel radical in the way a Kerry James Marshall painting or a Ntozake Shange poem expresses the humanity and beauty of black life. \u201cAll of that is happening in a world that does not want me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a safe space for us to feel, and not necessarily for anyone else.\u201d\u2666Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.An earworm that nearly eluded its audience.By LYDIA KIESLINGThe song, \u201cThis Girl,\u201d is a result of the (at the time) 19-year-old French D.J. and producer Valentin Brunel, alias Kungs, trawling YouTube videos in his bedroom and finding an obscure 2009 soul-revival tune by the Australian band Cookin\u2019 on 3 Burners. Brunel remixed the song, speeding it up into what he calls a \u201chappy house track.\u201d With the aid of Spotify, the song soon became a viral hit, topping charts across the globe and leaving no one more surprised than its respective creators.What is it about \u201cThis Girl\u201d? The rich vocals of Kylie Auldist, the singer for Cookin\u2019 on 3 Burners? The retro, cheerful, almost cloying guitar riff? Cynics might say that Kungs left the heavy lifting to Auldist and her bandmates, but this diminishes Kungs\u2019s inspired additions: his trumpets and his house beat, crucial to the ecstatic danciness of the new version. The result is youthful magic, the aural version of dancing until dawn with a boy you just met. Of smoking cigarettes on a rooftop all hot summer night.These days, an enterprising 19-year-old can browse YouTube, find something that catches his fancy, transform it and broadcast it to the world. An algorithm can anticipate my taste so precisely that it serves up the song I\u2019ve been dying to hear. There\u2019s something about the timing: \u201cThis Girl\u201d is upbeat and joyful and nostalgic when the news has been a grim parade. The same year the video\u2019s young lovers frolicked on the Mediterranean, some 5,000 people died trying to cross the same body of water. Our atmosphere is on track to become one long hot summer night. In harrowing times, this earworm asks little and gives a lot. It\u2019s an echo of better times \u2014 and one you can dance to.\u2666Lydia Kiesling is the editor of The Millions.Very good music for very bad feelings.By JOHN DARNIELLESometimes you just want to kill somebody, you know? Really end their life: make mourners of their friends and family, make orphans of their children, leave a hole in the world where a person once was. You don\u2019t feel this way all the time \u2014 you\u2019re not a monster. But sometimes you do. Maybe this didn\u2019t always happen; maybe you can remember a time when you not only didn\u2019t want to kill anybody but also hoped, moreover, to never even know what it felt like to want such an awful thing. But you were a child then, probably, and poets are always making hay about how you can\u2019t get back to that condition in this world. You\u2019re not a kid anymore, and every once in a while \u2014 not every day, except maybe sometimes for several days in a row \u2014 you want to kill somebody.Maybe you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. But if you do, when you do, maybe sometimes it kind of gets away from you, right? Obviously you won\u2019t kill this person, because you can\u2019t kill them, because you\u2019re not that sort of person, and besides, you\u2019d get caught, and you\u2019re pretty sure you couldn\u2019t hack it in prison. Would you cover your tracks? Try to hide the body? Go into hiding and hear about yourself on the news? Walk through the doors of the police station and turn yourself in? You think about these things when you want to kill somebody. You have the occasional dream about them. They\u2019re not pleasant thoughts, and it\u2019s not a pleasant dream.What\u2019s your damage? How did you get like this? Brain chemistry? Trauma? Read too many stories about Ozzy Osbourne biting the heads off bats when you were a kid? It doesn\u2019t matter. Two things matter: First, you\u2019re not going to kill anybody, because you are a decent person who wishes no one any real harm; second, you need to do something a little more creative with your feelings than just pretending they\u2019re not there. For some people, that means hitting the gym. For others, it means a stereo with a volume knob.Heavy metal has been providing people with catharsis for nearly 50 years. There\u2019s more to metal than that, of course, which ought to go without saying \u2014 not every metalhead harbors some hideous inner sadist. When I listen to death metal, it\u2019s not for the splatter-gore violence of its themes but for the breathtaking proficiency and relentless musical curiosity of the musicians who play it: To even get your foot in death metal\u2019s door, you have to be awfully good at your instrument. But Church of Misery doesn\u2019t play death metal; it plays stoner doom (the band itself prefers \u201cdoom,\u201d without the modifier), and I don\u2019t listen to it for the pleasure of immersion in technical wizardry. I listen to it because of how it makes me feel.Who\u2019s Church of Misery? Chiefly, they\u2019re the brainchild of the bassist Tatsu Mikami. They\u2019ve been putting out records since the late 1990s. They have six studio efforts, numerous EPs and a live album to their credit, and every song on every album except one takes, as its theme, a known serial killer. (Their first studio recording was made before they settled on their thematic focus and wasn\u2019t officially released for years.) Songs indicate their subjects parenthetically: \u201cD\u00fcsseldorf Monster (Peter K\u00fcrten),\u201d \u201cShotgun Boogie (James Oliver Huberty),\u201d \u201cRed Ripper Blues (Andrei Chikatilo).\u201d Some of their subjects are widely infamous \u2014 Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, the Heaven\u2019s Gate cult. Others are so obscure that only true crime buffs are likely to recognize their names. Look them up at your peril: These are people whose crimes will give you nightmares.\u201cMake Them Die Slowly\u201d is the second song on the band\u2019s latest album, \u201cAnd Then There Were None ... ,\u201d and it is impossibly heavy. It begins with a thudding kick drum all alone, with the central guitar riff ambling in murderously after two bars \u2014 a figure that lurches methodically through three five-note patterns to resolve on three descending chords that land like boulders being dropped on a house. My iTunes play count shows that I listened to it more than I listened to any song in 2016 except for drafts of songs I was writing myself. Scott Carlson of the legendary Repulsion sings it; the 2016 incarnation of the band was essentially a reboot, with Mikami the only original member. Carlson\u2019s feel for metal forms is instinctive and inerrant; when he sings the initial chorus \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll hang you high and drain your blood/sip on the nectar while your bones reduce to sludge\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s as if all that stuff about Ozzy had been true: Here\u2019s a guy gleefully recounting obscure, unthinkable real-world crimes as if they were fond memories of his time in varsity football. It\u2019s seductive and irresistible. It has a cowbell. You can bang your head and sing along.I have spent a fair bit of idle time over the years wondering what it says about me that I want to indulge this mood at least a few times a week for the rest of my life, occasionally at earsplitting volumes in clubs. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m secretly a murderer; I\u2019m a liberal softy. I can\u2019t even eat animals. When I was young, if I heard something that sounded too celebratory of death, it terrified me. I\u2019ll never forget seeing the clip for \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d on \u201cDon Kirshner\u2019s Rock Concert\u201d when I was very young, maybe 9 years old, up too late. I listened to Freddie Mercury sing the verse about how he\u2019d just killed a man by shooting him point blank in the head \u2014 although I thought he was speaking in the third person rather than the vocative, that it was his \u201cmama\u201d who\u2019d just killed a man \u2014 and, horrified, I turned off the television. Over time, though, that feeling \u2014 the shock, the revulsion \u2014 became an object of interior curiosity: What\u2019s this about? How much time can I spend with it? What part of me is it? What does it look like up close?The cheap answer is something about the cathartic value of transgression, etc., all old hoary stuff I don\u2019t really buy into anymore. The truer answer, for me, is that sometimes you really wanna kill somebody. Naturally, you won\u2019t. You mustn\u2019t. It would be wrong. You try not to do wrong. But if you spend a little time in the presence of a perfect groove contemplating the wrong directly without moralizing about it, you can ride the feeling in safety and go in as deep as you want, emerging later not wanting to kill anybody. When this has become a pattern, it\u2019s an immense release, as addictive as the pellets they would give us every so often if we were rats in labs.\u2666John Darnielle is a musician and the author of \u201cUniversal Harvester.\u201dTwo composers beyond category.By RYAN BRADLEYIt had been a busy year. Levi is also a producer and D.J. who sings and plays guitar, most recently in the pop-art trio Micachu and the Shapes. She has written two movie scores; the second, for the biopic \u201cJackie,\u201d was nominated for an Academy Award. Coates has scored films, too, but is better known for his work as a cellist. He contributed to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cA Moon Shaped Pool,\u201d released last May, and in the same month put out his own \u201cUpstepping,\u201d a very danceable record of house music performed almost entirely on his cello.\u201cRemain Calm\u201d is an odd creation, even by their standards. Its 13 tracks, some less than a minute in length, jump from beat-heavy, densely layered and looped orchestrations to atmospheric and spacey noodlings. Often, Coates\u2019s cello seems to emerge, pure and acoustic, out of a stew of sonic burbles. It is a sketchbook in which every figure gestures toward newer, more exciting ideas to come, outlining musical rules (a key, a beat, a melody) one minute only to abandon them in the next.Before they listened to the record, Coates reached into his backpack and pulled out a coloring book. He showed Levi one of the images he had colored in, a mandala filled with bright blues and greens, thin wisps of gold, bursts of coral pink. Levi leaned in for a closer look, drawing her finger across the page. \u201cBruv, this is nuts,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s what I wish composing was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe form preordained.\u201d Levi nodded in agreement. It was a visual cantus firmus, she said: a fixed melody providing a structure for a limited range of improvisation. They had each studied classical composition: Coates at the Royal Academy of Music, where he received the highest marks in the school\u2019s history, Levi at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where, at 21, she was commissioned to compose a piece for the London Philharmonic.The first song began, Coates playing a solo figure, then Levi\u2019s electronic textures trickling in, like an orchestra tuning up. The pair sat in silence, pleased enough but also distracted. A few tracks later, Coates looked up at Levi, who was looking at his mandala. \u201cI\u2019d like for it to be music,\u201d he said. It seemed like a familiar conversation. Levi massaged her temples, thinking, listening. \u201cYou just get a set of rules,\u201d she said. \u201cEach color could be a different pitch.\u201d Coates frowned. The idea of \u201calgorithmic music\u201d troubled him. Maybe, Levi said, you set up the rules and then find a way to break them; color inside the lines, so to speak, and then scribble a face over the results. Coates liked it. The breaking of the rule, he said, is \u201cwhat makes a moment, musically.\u201dIn fact, he added, his coloring was loaded with mistakes already, but the mistakes were what made the thing come together, in a subtle way. He turned the page, exposing the blots where the pen ink bled through to the other side and the sharp lines of the pattern were barely visible. He said they reminded him of one of Levi\u2019s works.Coates and Levi met almost a decade ago. Coates had come to perform student string quartets for a class Levi was taking, and he was struck by her compositions. They were written so well, he said, \u201cthat you knew immediately what you needed to do to make them come to life.\u201d From then on, the two stayed in touch. Coates sent Levi a video by the electronic producer Daniel Lopatin, also known as Oneohtrix Point Never; Levi sent Coates a mixtape she made with some tracks by Harry Partch, a composer who created new musical scales and built his own instruments.In 2011, Coates was working on a commission for the London Sinfonietta and suggested a collaboration with Micachu and the Shapes, who were already trying to, in Levi\u2019s words, \u201csmudge a whole lot of things together.\u201d For the Sinfonietta collaboration, Levi and her bandmates, following in Partch\u2019s footsteps, deployed a new instrument she had built with a friend called the chopper \u2014 a hollow box with strings on top and a rotating wheel to pluck them, like a turntable that strummed. The live album that resulted, filled with wobbly, off-kilter strings, was called \u201cChopped and Screwed\u201d (a nod to screw music, the Houston hip-hop style). It landed in the hands of the filmmaker Jonathan Glazer, who was looking for someone to score \u201cUnder the Skin,\u201d his film about an alien exploring earth in a woman\u2019s body. He wanted an experienced composer who had never written music for a movie, someone who would come at the task differently. \u201cI think he wanted someone who was, you know, cheap,\u201d Levi said.For 10 months, she worked on almost nothing else, worried that if she listened to anything \u2014 particularly another soundtrack \u2014 she would unintentionally steal from it. She focused instead on the challenge of scoring the emotional development of the film\u2019s unknowable alien, played by Scarlett Johansson. Levi\u2019s stark themes all spring from a dense void, abuzz in discordant strings (including Coates on cello), then synthetic and hollow with muffled drums and distant drones. As the film progresses, though, the music becomes more melodic, reflecting the alien creature\u2019s struggle with humanity, with the untidiness of human emotions. The soundtrack is unsettling, but also strangely empathetic.Levi describes much of her work as mixtapes. For \u201cJackie,\u201d she imagined classy melancholy, loads of strings, the occasional flute, clarinet and piano \u2014 the kind of music that Jacqueline Kennedy might listen to, a mixtape for private mourning made for a woman in the center of so much public chaos. The day Levi and Coates recorded \u201cRemain Calm,\u201d Levi arrived with two CD turntables and thumb drives full of samples and premade digital files \u2014 all of which, in one way or another, had reminded her of Coates. She was thinking of music not in terms of classical or hip-hop or any other genre, but in terms of people. Some music was Oliver Coates music. Some music was Mica Levi music.Listening to \u201cBarok Main,\u201d one of the longest tracks on \u201cRemain Calm,\u201d Coates and Levi agreed that it was also probably the most unified piece. \u201cThis was a nice peaceful moment, just after lunch,\u201d Coates said, recalling the rainy day they recorded it.Levi said: \u201cI was thoughtful of what could fit here. Something that wasn\u2019t too thick, too full of information.\u201dThey listened a bit longer.The track swelled and echoed, and it was hard to know where Coates\u2019s cello stopped and Levi\u2019s sound began. \u201cIt\u2019s just happy music making,\u201d Coates said, and they sat, listening silently, waiting for their track to end.\u2666Ryan Bradley is a writer based in Los Angeles.Putting out fires by day, music by night.By JODY ROSENThere was a time when Ka took a guerrilla approach to promoting his music. In 2007, he had 1,000 CDs made of his debut album, \u201cIron Works.\u201d \u201cI gave them to my cousins, my friends. I still had, like, 990 CDs left. So I started giving them away. I\u2019d drive around the city, and if I heard music coming from the next car at a red light \u2014 boom-boom-boom \u2014 I\u2019d say, \u2018You like hip-hop?\u2019 Then I\u2019d toss a CD in their window.\u201d By 2012, when Ka released his second album, \u201cGrief Pedigree,\u201d he had a sizable-enough following to make an announcement on Twitter and hold a curbside sale in Greenwich Village. This has become a tradition: On the day that Ka drops a new album, he tweets, turns up on a street corner and sells a few dozen records out of the trunk of his car.When music writers use the word \u201cindie,\u201d they generally have a certain kind of recording artist in mind: a white bohemian, with a battered guitar and a tricky haircut, who dwells on the distant outskirts of the pop-industrial complex. Ka, whose given name is Kaseem Ryan, doesn\u2019t quite fit that description, but he may be the platonic ideal of an independent musician in 2017. It would be hard to find a more thoroughgoing D.I.Y. musical enterprise. Ka is the rare rapper who handles both rhymes and beats, writing his lyrics and producing the music that accompanies them. He has directed most of his videos, and he self-releases his music, on his own label. It is not a profitable venture. Ka spends as much as $15,000 per album and has never broken even. \u201cI make music, but I\u2019m not in the music business,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my hobby.\u201dFor Ka to have won even modest recognition is an improbable underdog triumph. He spent much of the 1990s trying to make it as a rapper, quit music altogether and returned a decade later, releasing his solo debut at age 35. Today he is 44. This career trajectory defies one of the seemingly immutable laws of pop, and of hip-hop in particular, a genre in which the cult of youth and novelty is especially pronounced.Then there is the matter of Ka\u2019s day job. He is a captain in the New York City Fire Department. It\u2019s a story that has the ring of folklore: One of the great recording artists of the current decade is a musical moonlighter, a middle-aged man who earns his living as the decorated company commander of Engine 235 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. \u201cI try to keep my job and music separate,\u201d Ka says. \u201cI never wanted be \u2018The Rapping Captain.\u2019 I try to be a good firefighter. And when I come home, I try to make some dope music.\u201dIn fact, Ka\u2019s music bears little resemblance to the \u201cgangsta rap\u201d caricature of tabloid fulminations. In Ka\u2019s songs, crime and violence are omnipresent but deglamorized. It\u2019s here that Ka\u2019s age shows: He raps in the voice of a world-weary O.G., looking back at \u201cthe hustle\u201d with regret and dismay, and reckoning with its spiritual toll. Ka\u2019s lyrics are cinematic, training a grit-caked lens on scenes of poverty and desperation. In \u201cNo Downtime\u201d (2012), he raps: \u201cI admit, not from environment that let a child flourish/In the street, slim physique, wild courage/Five deep, trying to eat, looking malnourished.\u201dThese stories aren\u2019t fictional. Ka grew up poor, in Brownsville. As a teenager, he drifted into the drug trade, dealing crack and selling firearms. It was a \u201cscary and lonely\u201d existence, Ka says, one that left a legacy of trauma and a wealth of material, a burden that\u2019s also a muse. \u201cThis man has experienced so much pain, seen so much death,\u201d says Ka\u2019s wife, Mimi Vald\u00e9s. \u201cIt\u2019s all over his music.\u201dIf Ka is not in the music business, his wife definitively is. Vald\u00e9s is the former editor in chief of Vibe, the music magazine. Today she is chief creative officer for i am OTHER, a multimedia company founded by Pharrell Williams, the superstar rapper-singer-producer. Vald\u00e9s\u2019s professional circle includes some of the world\u2019s most famous musicians. It is conceivable that Ka could trade on his wife\u2019s connections to raise his profile. But a commercial breakthrough is far-fetched, and a prospect for which Ka seems constitutionally ill equipped. He has performed just a few live shows and professes little interest in playing more. He\u2019s a homebody who prefers to sit in a closet-size work space and make records.Those records are, in the best sense, strange. Critics often call Ka a revivalist of rap\u2019s \u201990s golden age. But he is by no means \u201cretro.\u201d He takes the rudiments of \u201990s rap and fashions them into an eccentric other thing. His albums have idiosyncratic conceptual frames: \u201cThe Night\u2019s Gambit\u201d (2013) is full of chess imagery; \u201cDays With Dr. Yen Lo\u201d (2015), a collaboration with the producer Preservation, is an elaborate gloss on the novel \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate.\u201dBut it is the sound, the vibe, that sets Ka\u2019s music apart. His songs are unnervingly quiet and still; they hold a listener in thrall because they hold so much back. Ka\u2019s beats do not boom, they slither and slink and creep. Often the songs discard drums altogether, opening vast spaces that are filled by samples in brooding minor keys. The most arresting sound is Ka\u2019s voice, a guttural rasp that sometimes dips into a whisper. It is an unshakable voice of experience, delivering hard-boiled tales and hard-won wisdom.\u201cMourn at Night,\u201d from the 2016 album \u201cHonor Killed the Samurai,\u201d is a typical Ka mood piece \u2014 a rap-noir, burnished to lustrous dark hue. The song\u2019s title establishes the terms: The mood is elegiac, the setting nocturnal. \u201cMourn at Night\u201d has more of a beat than many Ka songs, which is not to say that it has much of one. A snare drum knocks out a steady pulse, like the sound of an unseen man\u2019s footfalls trailing down a low-lit street, or a time bomb ticking to an explosion. The music is nudged forward by guitar and keyboard arpeggios, which chime and toll behind a somber refrain: \u201cHe gone/We mourn at night.\u201d In the final verse, the action erupts: Gunfire blasts out of the shadows, strafing a street corner crowded with young drug dealers.On the block with the rockUp nights, dribblingTime spent getting bentHard to be upright citizenIt\u2019s more than troublingSame corners are bubblingThe pawns are huddlingThen all of a sudden it\u2019sPop, pop, popKa excels at this kind of writing, brisk storytelling that unfolds in a pileup of rhymes and puns. What you won\u2019t find much of on his records is the meat-and-potatoes of rap: trash talk. \u201cWhat do I have to brag about?\u201d Ka says. \u201cI ain\u2019t winning. I\u2019m a working man, with a blue-collar job. I\u2019m running into burning buildings for a living. So I speak about the things that I did, the things I pray I never have to do again. How do I finish my life in grace? That\u2019s what I rap about.\u201dOn those occasions when Ka does slip in a mild boast, it\u2019s about his skills as an M.C. In \u201cMourn at Night\u201d he permits himself one such moment, the testimony of a bootstrapper who has survived untold trials to ply his trade \u2014 as he would have it, his hobby \u2014 in the soundproof booth of a recording studio. \u201cWe was born in the thorns, few arose,\u201d Ka raps. \u201cOnce in town\u2019s noose/Now in soundproofs/Pursuing goals.\u201d\u2666When gospel goes viral \u2014 with an abundance of pure joy.By GREG HOWARDIt was 29 years ago that the legendary gospel artist Shirley Caesar first recorded the song \u201cHold My Mule.\u201d It was a banger then, and it still is. She has performed it many times, and at least once, 10 years ago, someone filmed her in a church. About midway through the nine-and-a-half-minute video, the band and the organ, which riff all the way through, fall quiet. Caesar hunches over, gazes into the distance and, playing the role of the song\u2019s protagonist, Shouting John \u2014 a farmer who has been reprimanded by the deacons at his local church for celebrating too much, dancing too wildly, speaking too loudly (and sometimes in tongues) \u2014 enumerates the many blessings God has bestowed on him and his farm. She counts each blessing off on her fingers and raps: \u201cI\u2019ve got beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes, lambs, rams, hogs, dogs, chickens, turkeys, rabbits\u201d \u2014 and then she shouts, \u201cyou name it!\u201dThe band kicks in again, and a slew of sonic histrionics, pyrotechnics and acrobatics follows. But that list is the climax, the moment when Caesar basks in the warmth of God\u2019s grace, when she and you both feel closest to him.While taking a gospel sample and warping it into a trap song not about Christ but about the wonders of soy and fake meat scrubs Caesar\u2019s joy of its context, the joy embedded in her voice still translates, is still familiar. I\u2019m not religious. But I grew up going to church, dancing and singing to raucous gospel bands and choirs nearly every Sunday. Once, after a particularly rousing concert, I walked from my seat to the front of the auditorium to be baptized and join the church, only to come to my senses once I got to the altar. I never truly believed in Caesar\u2019s God, but I was swept away as so many nonbelievers can be, in flashes of euphoria ignited by family and tofu and trap and everything else that sustains us.\u2666Greg Howard is a David Carr fellow for The New York Times.He soothes the anxieties of life as a gay man.By ALEXANDER CHEEFor more than a year now, I have listened to little else in my car other than the albums of Rufus Wainwright. This obsession began when my husband and I bought a car for weekend trips: a 2009 AWD Subaru hatchback with what in retrospect seems like an ancient playback machine, a 5-disc CD player. We pulled all our old CD wallets out to the car, loaded the changer and set off for our first drive. And what had been my self-imposed exile from music came to an end that day.Sometime between 2009 and 2015, without ever noticing it was happening, I stopped listening to music regularly. I was alienated, in part, by the new ways of listening: I don\u2019t like streaming music, or \u201csocial\u201d music platforms, my private whims made public. Around the same time, my doctor told me I had mild depression, which would respond to exercise and a change in habits. But this mild depression did not feel mild. I felt trapped at the bottom of a swimming pool, immobilized. Everything I had to do, everything I needed to take care of, was up at the surface, and the soundtrack to this situation was silence.During one of our first drives, we loaded the changer solely with Rufus Wainwright albums, and I still haven\u2019t changed those CDs out. I was always a fan of Wainwright\u2019s, but I\u2019m something more now: His lighthearted way of penetrating my anxieties about gay life became essential. In my year of carbound listening, I played through his songbook over and over. I gained a new appreciation for his extraordinary voice, and the way its nasal timbre humanizes him, as if someone ordinary had been given extraordinary powers, midnote. I am often tricked into trying to sing along, but I\u2019m always outclassed. I never care. Wainwright is a storyteller, and his albums work on my imagination the same way short-story collections do \u2014 poetically, dramatically. Singing along with his secrets became like telling mine to myself, and somehow, this helped me up from the bottom of that pool.A change of habits, then.Joan Didion has written of how the ability to make a note \u201cwhen something came to mind\u201d was the \u201cdifference between being able to write and not being able to write\u201d \u2014 a sign of life. For me, looking for new music from favorite musicians is also a sign of life. This fall, I finally thought to look for a new Wainwright album. What I found was \u201cTake All My Loves,\u201d released early last year. Wainwright adapts nine Shakespearean sonnets into a kind of variety show, with William Shatner; Helena Bonham Carter; Carrie Fisher; Florence Welch; the soprano Anna Prohaska; his sister, Martha Wainwright; the BBC Orchestra; and the Berlin String Section. He is on the cover in full Queen Elizabeth I drag, flowers in his hair. My favorite track is \u201cA Woman\u2019s Face \u2014 Reprise (Sonnet 20),\u201d which Wainwright first interpreted in 2010 on \u201cAll Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu.\u201d That first version is a would-be lover\u2019s complaint, sung softly over slow piano; it\u2019s elliptical, haunting, slight. A new version on \u201cTake All My Loves\u201d is almost a torch song \u2014 teasing, raunchy, openly seductive, as if Wainwright were seated on a piano in a slinky gown and Elizabethan collar, all made up and beckoning.The poem is, famously, the locus of academic debates over Shakespeare\u2019s queerness. His misogyny too. The sonnet is about an impossible love for a young man who the poet claims has all the beauty of a woman, but for the \u201cone thing.\u201d I had read it, but I never really understood it the way I did when I heard Wainwright sing it: It\u2019s a refrain many gay men know from waiting out the passion of a man who doesn\u2019t \u201cthink of himself that way,\u201d despite his feelings for you. \u201cIf only you were a girl\u201d becomes \u201cYou\u2019re better than a girl\u201d before either fear or desire wins.Wainwright knows this territory well. His second album, \u201cPoses,\u201d was dedicated to one of these reluctant, not-quite-queer lovers, stories from when Wainwright was the kind of seductive youth the sonnet describes. Now, for the duration of this song, he is the reluctant lover.As a storyteller, Wainwright has always been more of a memoirist than a novelist. He made his reputation singing wise songs of impossible loves and rejection, turning personal pain into public art. Wainwright is now married to J\u00f6rn Weisbrodt, an arts impresario, and he has a daughter with his friend Lorca Cohen, a photographer and the daughter of Leonard Cohen. Listening to \u201cA Woman\u2019s Face,\u201d I wonder if happiness has made him more private, happier telling fictional stories than true ones. His next project is an opera about the Roman emperor Hadrian, who, out of grief at the death of his lover Antinous, created a religion around him.I intend to be there when it opens, wearing a tuxedo in an opera box \u2014 no Subaru this time. I\u2019ll try not to sing along.\u2666Alexander Chee is the author of the novels \u201cEdinburgh\u201d and \u201cThe Queen of the Night.\u201dThe danger of being a singer-songwriter.By RUTH GRAHAMThe story was a good example of how forces like politics and war can affect regular people\u2019s lives, which is a running theme in McMurtry\u2019s work. McMurtry, who has released 12 albums over a 28-year career, has a reputation in some quarters as a political songwriter, in part because one of his most popular songs is an angry-lefty anthem. That song, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Make It Here Anymore,\u201d laments that minimum wage \u201cwon\u2019t pay for a roof, won\u2019t pay for a drink,\u201d and that the children of the poor are the ones who end up fighting in rich men\u2019s wars. Released shortly before the 2004 election, the song swept through an America hollowed out by departed manufacturing jobs and the middle-class stability that went with them. A few years after its release, the critic Robert Christgau named it the best song of the decade.But McMurtry more often writes about how seemingly distant political concerns nudge his characters\u2019 choices and prod at their psyches: the stretched budget of the Veterans Affairs Department, or the birth of a new national park\u2019s consuming the neighbors\u2019 land through eminent domain. In \u201cSixty Acres,\u201d the narrator laments that when his grandmother died, he inherited a plot of unpromising farmland while his cousin got \u201cthe good land,\u201d zoned commercial: \u201cLooks like a Walmart waiting to happen/I mean to tell you it\u2019s a pot of gold.\u201dMcMurtry\u2019s father is the great Texas novelist Larry McMurtry, and his mother, Jo Scott McMurtry, is a former English professor specializing in Shakespeare. McMurtry calls his parents \u201cfirst-generation-off-the-farm academics.\u201d He was raised in secular urban homes and even attended boarding school for a spell. But he dropped out of the University of Arizona, and he remains fluent in his extended family\u2019s dialect of ranches, oil fields and Jesus Christ. He has been on tour almost constantly since the late 1980s, and he just takes note of what he sees through the windshield, he said, like banners welcoming home soldiers in small towns.At an upscale barbecue restaurant near his hotel in Dallas, where we met before his concert, our talk turned to tribalism and anti-intellectualism. His grandparents wanted their children to go to college to get better jobs, he said, but they didn\u2019t want them to become intellectuals. Later he referred to the broader middle-American \u201chatred of anyone who is perceived to be getting a free ride of any kind\u201d and the racism woven into that ethos: \u201cThe image of the black welfare queen driving the Cadillac while good white folk drove Oldsmobiles was the boogeyman of the \u201980s. Now I suppose it\u2019s Mexican immigrants getting free health care.\u201d Over the course of an hour, he talked about the military-industrial complex, \u201cembedded\u201d war journalism and the role of charisma in electoral politics. I didn\u2019t know whether to believe him when he said he didn\u2019t read many books.McMurtry had ordered black coffee and a plate of fried oysters. In a few hours, he would take the stage alone with his guitar, and in a few weeks, he and his band would leave for a European tour that would carry them from Ireland to Italy, playing 33 nights in a row. McMurtry\u2019s music is usually classified as \u201cAmericana\u201d; it\u2019s at turns jagged and raucous, and at others deliberative and wistful. Other singers have smoother voices. But a movie star\u2019s perfect face can work against his authenticity as an actor, and McMurtry\u2019s unassuming vocal style and stage presence bring to the foreground the voices populating his songs. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger in being a singer-songwriter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re writing a character\u2019s point of view, and you\u2019ve got to sing it yourself. It comes out of your voice, so everybody thinks it\u2019s your opinion.\u201dAlthough I\u2019ve been listening to him for years, I have begun to think of him as interpreter of the places \u201cout here in the middle,\u201d as he puts it one song. He has written about Cheyenne, Wyo.; Tulsa, Okla.; and Wewahitchka, Fla; about crab fishermen, soldiers and Walmart stockers. His songs tap into resentments about things like coastal attitudes of superiority and political correctness. His narrators are often white men who know the Bible, own guns and give their kids a nip of vodka in their Cherry Coke to get through long road trips. A Texan friend of mine likes to say that McMurtry writes as though he has spent time eavesdropping on conversations in every Dairy Queen in America. Stephen King, who owns a classic-rock station in Maine, has written that he \u201cmay be the truest, fiercest songwriter of his generation.\u201dMcMurtry has seen things change in rural America over the last few decades, he said, the curdling of patriotism and self-reliance into something uglier. Gun ownership, for example, has become an identity, or even like a cult. He\u2019s a hunter \u2014 deer, turkey, wild hogs \u2014 and he said gun shows and shops used to be friendly spaces. But now there\u2019s a suspicion in the air if \u201cyou don\u2019t have the right hat or the right haircut.\u201d McMurtry himself has both, but he also has the kind of detachment required for skeptical reportage.\u201cCopper Canteen,\u201d the opening track on his 2015 album, \u201cComplicated Game,\u201d is the song I\u2019ve returned to most since Election Day. The narrator is a hunter, a fisherman and a small-business owner. He doesn\u2019t go to church, but his wife does. Although retirement is in sight, and he has a pension, he hasn\u2019t been able to save as much money as he would like, in part because the store he owns is getting squeezed by \u201cthe big boxes out on the bypass.\u201dBut like most of McMurtry\u2019s best songs, \u201cCopper Canteen\u201d eventually resolves into a portrait of a relationship. The long marriages and old love affairs he favors eschew the hot and cold dramatics of contemporary country music, a world in which you\u2019re either swooning over your one true love or bashing in your ex\u2019s windshield with a baseball bat. The \u201cCopper Canteen\u201d narrator is singing to his wife; they\u2019re grandparents now, reflecting back on what it meant to \u201cgrow up hard\u201d in a life that has moved by in a blur: \u201cThis life that we craved so little we saved between the grandparents\u2019 graves and the grandchildren\u2019s toys.\u201d Like many McMurtry characters, he sounds nostalgic even though he knows that the past was often bad. The song opens with a bang, or the suggestion of one: \u201cHoney, don\u2019t you go yellin\u2019 at me while I\u2019m cleaning my gun,\u201d he drawls. \u201cI\u2019ll wash the blood off the tailgate when deer season\u2019s done.\u201d Defying Chekhov, the gun never goes off, and the song sweetens \u2014 barely \u2014 as it moves along. Though that line about the gun got a big laugh when McMurtry played it in Dallas, I still don\u2019t know whether to hear it as a joke or a threat, and McMurtry has never been one to offer the easy comfort of a straight answer.\u2666Ruth Graham is a contributing writer for Slate.How a song can make its audience feel seen.By ANGELA FLOURNOYA song should not shut a door in a listener\u2019s face. Of course, many songs do drive listeners away \u2014 through objectionable lyrics, a vocalist\u2019s nasal intonation, a grating hook \u2014 but generally not on purpose. Still rarer is a song that identifies its audience in explicit, demographic terms. But in the first line of Solange Knowles\u2019s song \u201cF.U.B.U.,\u201d she welcomes black listeners \u2014 \u201cone for us,\u201d she proclaims \u2014 and she shows white listeners the door.Once this metaphorical point of entry is closed, an important conversation ensues. \u201cAll my niggas in the whole wide world/Made this song to make it all y\u2019all\u2019s turn,\u201d Knowles sings in the opening chorus. The word \u201cnigga\u201d (along with its \u201c-er\u201d counterpart) is so fraught with negative history that the N.A.A.C.P. held a funeral for it in 2007. Not every black person can hear it in a song and feel the exultation that Knowles intends. Still, words take their own sweet time to die, and right now, \u201cnigga\u201d remains a go-to, often-affectionate phrase in many black circles. In \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d Knowles uses it to draw a line in the sand: If you aren\u2019t supposed to say it, then this song isn\u2019t for you. \u201cFor us,\u201d she sings \u2014 \u201cthis [expletive] is for us.\u201dThe song\u2019s title references the clothing line of the same name \u2014 F.U.B.U., For Us By Us. At its height in the late \u201990s, F.U.B.U. was synonymous with black cool: I wore it in high school despite the clothes being impractical for my too-tall, too-thin frame. And the song appears on Knowles\u2019s recent album, \u201cA Seat at the Table,\u201d after an interlude featuring the rapper Master P., whose stories of success as an independent music artist and executive help provide thematic shape to the project. For many of us who were young and black, or young and black and Southern, like Knowles, during the years when he dominated the rap charts, his story has always been inspirational. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand my record, you don\u2019t understand me, so this is not for you,\u201d he says.Songs that can be described as \u201cblack-empowerment music\u201d make up a genre as diverse as that of black music itself. There are the time-tested tracks that focus on pride, like James Brown\u2019s \u201cSay It Loud \u2014 I\u2019m Black and I\u2019m Proud,\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cYoung, Gifted and Black.\u201d There are anthems that speak to struggle and protest, like Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cGet Up Stand Up\u201d and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cAlright.\u201d And there are a plethora of doggedly sunny ditties like Nas\u2019s \u201cI Can\u201d and Jaheim\u2019s \u201cFabulous.\u201d Knowles\u2019s \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d hews closer to the first two categories, and a majority of its messages of pride and protest are nuanced, centering the individual over the collective. She allows that not every black person will relate to the experiences she recounts: \u201cWhen you feeling all alone/And you can\u2019t even be you up in your home/When you even feeling it from your own.\u201d The song pushes past one litmus test for the black-empowerment anthem \u2014 that it present itself as made for black listeners, broadly \u2014 and tries to reach an even more elusive audience: the black listener who maybe hasn\u2019t felt included in such messages before.Art finds who it finds, and the white gaze lands where it lands. The more you try to ignore it, the more it seems keen on dissecting you. Knowles is aware of this. The deliberate rejection of white scrutiny is part of a long tradition of black art-making. In his famous 1926 essay, \u201cThe Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\u201d which would serve as the young poet\u2019s artistic manifesto, Langston Hughes declared that younger black artists should create \u201cwithout fear or shame. If white people are pleased, we are glad. If they are not, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d It\u2019s the sort of thing emerging black writers \u2014 me included \u2014 have to remind themselves when putting pen to paper, lest we succumb to pandering for white attention.In \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d Knowles doesn\u2019t just eschew the white gaze for the sake of creating her art; she performs that rejection in song, to pull her black listeners close. It\u2019s a rhetorical invitation for black folks to grab a chair and settle in for real talk about lives like theirs. To her white listeners (who are listening, after all), she offers a tongue-in-cheek indictment as consolation: \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad if you can\u2019t sing along/Just be glad you got the whole wide world.\u201dThe verses in \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d outline microaggressions, but the song isn\u2019t \u201cabout\u201d microaggression; it\u2019s about recognition. \u201cWhen a nigga tryna board the plane/And they ask you, \u2018What\u2019s your name again?\u2019/\u2019Cause they thinking, Yeah, you\u2019re all the same,\u201d Knowles sings. This is the sonic equivalent of shaking out your hair after long hours of wearing it pulled back and tied down for work, putting on your sweatpants and calling your girlfriend to tell her about the day you had. Between black folks, recounting microaggressions can offer valuable confirmation that you\u2019re not crazy, that someone else sees you. It\u2019s commiseration, but without the misery, because the slights are both hurtful and numbingly commonplace. Knowles isn\u2019t listing racial slights on \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d to educate those who perpetuate them; she does it to foster intimacy with her listeners.I first heard the song at the gym, on a cheap pair of headphones, so the bass on the record wasn\u2019t at the forefront as it should have been. The warbled notes of the piano and organ sounded muffled, as if underwater. On even very good headphones, the song\u2019s dragged-down pace is reminiscent of screw music \u2014 the slow-motion, purposefully warped aesthetic born in Knowles\u2019s native Houston. The featured artists are a nod to R.&B. over the past two decades. The-Dream sings in an airy falsetto, making the line \u201cI didn\u2019t come back down to earth to die\u201d sound resolute instead of bitter. The relative newcomer BJ the Chicago Kid\u2019s delivery \u2014 by turns exuberant and plaintive \u2014 is like that of a soloist during Sunday praise and worship. The backing vocals by Tweet are a special treat for those of us who sometimes shake our fists at the sky, wondering what ever happened to that singer and her hypnotizing voice.For all its angst and exasperation, \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d is a party song, just not one for the nightclub. Its measured cadence and dragging bass are perfect for a spontaneous, low-key house party. You might be able to pull off a drawn-out, stylized two-step to \u201cF.U.B.U.,\u201d but really it\u2019s a rhythm tailored to the simple head-nod \u2014 an appropriate move for a song about recognition. Its boisterous horns call to mind the New Orleans second line, those musical parades marched both for celebration and for mourning.Knowles wrote lyrics for \u201cA Seat at the Table\u201d in New Iberia, La., where her mother\u2019s family hails from. Her mother, Tina Lawson, has said that her family was essentially run out of town following a salt-mine collapse involving her father. In the contentious aftermath, a Molotov cocktail was thrown through the window of their home. They didn\u2019t go far \u2014 less than 300 miles west to Galveston, Tex. Hasty separation leaves a generational longing all the same. It follows that an album created in a town once fled for fear of white violence should include \u201cF.U.B.U.,\u201d a song that creates a space where black listeners might feel prized just for being seen.\u2666Angela Flournoy is the author of \u201cThe Turner House\u201d and a fellow at the New York Public Library\u2019s Cullman Center.Bubble-gum-pop queen turns tongue-in-cheek sex bomb.By HAZEL CILLSWhen a young pop star outgrows the wholesome, teeny-bopper sound that made her career, we tend to watch the results while peeking through our fingers, terrified of what we\u2019ll see. This is how we watched as Christina Aguilera put on her \u201cDirrty\u201d leather chaps, as Britney Spears stepped out of her \u201clittle girl\u201d world on \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U,\u201d as Miley Cyrus awkwardly fraternized with a stripper pole at the Teen Choice Awards. What makes these moments so cringeworthy is their self-seriousness, their declaration that to be adult is to be sexy \u2014 and to be sexy is to be straight-faced, preferably with a well-oiled body, writhing and pining for male approval.Ariana Grande, pop music\u2019s tiny, adorable diva, could easily have found herself in such a position. A former Broadway actress and the former star of the Nickelodeon show \u201cSam & Cat,\u201d she has an unabashed theater-kid spirit and a flair for costume \u2014 you often find her wearing cat ears and thigh-high vinyl boots. Her songs are brassy, retro numbers that deal with gushy PG-13 love, and she has a tendency to oversell them with the zeal of a collegiate a cappella singer, her impressive vocal range pushing against the edges of her bubble-gum hits as if trying to pop them entirely. Grande, still straddling the line between child star and adult hitmaker, is in the prime risk group for hypersexed transition songs.And on \u201cSide to Side,\u201d the biggest single from her excellent third album, \u201cDangerous Woman,\u201d she\u2019s aiming for something grown-and-sexy. \u201cSide to Side\u201d has her tapping the same watered-down dancehall trend that fueled songs like Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cSorry\u201d and Drake\u2019s \u201cControlla,\u201d with lyrics about sleeping with a bad secret boyfriend she keeps hidden from her friends. \u201cI\u2019ve been here all night/I\u2019ve been here all day/And boy got me walking side to side,\u201d she sings. Walking that way, Grande hinted in an interview last year with MTV \u2014 just in case anyone didn\u2019t get it \u2014 is a result of having too much sex, too vigorously.It\u2019s a huge hit. The song, in which Nicki Minaj coolly raps about riding a bicycle as if it were a male member (or vice versa), as if she were starring in some psychosexual Cronenberg horror film, has more than 420 million plays on Spotify. But \u201cSide to Side\u201d isn\u2019t exactly sexy. With its coy innuendo, as well as a video that uses SoulCycle-esque bikes as a metaphor for Grande\u2019s sexual workouts, \u201cSide to Side\u201d plays more like a giggly inside joke.We\u2019re in a golden age for things like this: media made by women, aimed at women, in which sex is explicit, messy and, most important, funny. Listening to \u201cSide to Side,\u201d I\u2019m reminded of Issa Rae\u2019s HBO series \u201cInsecure,\u201d in which Rae\u2019s eyes continually wander to an ex named Daniel, whom her best friend describes as Rae\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel \u2014 except instead of \u201cheel,\u201d she uses a certain nickname for a phallus. On shows like \u201cBroad City\u201d or Amazon\u2019s \u201cFleabag,\u201d female protagonists dig into their worst and raunchiest sexual impulses. Last year, the Swedish pop star Tove Lo named her record \u201cLady Wood,\u201d a goofy, equal-opportunity reinvention of stereotypical male arousal.With its brazenly over-the-top premise, \u201cSide to Side\u201d joins them, beating you to the punch line about Grande\u2019s revamp as Sexy Adult. It doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s designed to stir anyone\u2019s arousal \u2014 only their laughter. Does this song sound ridiculous? Well, that\u2019s the point. In a genre that fetishizes sexual passion that lasts for eternity, Grande\u2019s song happily delivers comic realism, with a surprisingly smart wink.\u2666Hazel Cills is a staff writer for MTV News.What would black music sound like in an alternate universe?By THOMAS CHATTERTON WILLIAMSThe genius of \u201cFade,\u201d the penultimate track on Kanye West\u2019s living work of art, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d is evident from the opening lines, a sample from the white Motown group Rare Earth. But it was a half-minute in, at that first unmistakable rip of bass, that I lost my mind. Like many of West\u2019s songs, \u201cFade\u201d is built around several commingling samples. Its rhythmic backbone is the deceptively simple arrangement from the 1985 classic \u201cMystery of Love,\u201d by Larry Heard, better known as Mr. Fingers. That track, along with a handful of others, marks a seminal moment in the history of deep house \u2014 a rich and criminally neglected chapter in the book of black music.Today it\u2019s easy to forget that in the early and mid-\u201980s there existed a window when New York rap, Chicago house and Detroit techno \u2014 as well as a slew of other fledgling genres and subcultures \u2014 functioned more or less as equals, each as likely as the next to flounder or thrive. New York won the contest handily, and now hip-hop has so thoroughly subsumed mainstream black culture that it often feels as if earlier artistic forms have either been eradicated or retrofitted to its preferences (see: funk, R.&B. and jazz). House music \u2014 much like West himself \u2014 is unabashedly black and Chicago-bred, but somewhere along the line, it grew cozy in Europe and came to be seen as catering to white people. And though it has only ever managed to find significant audiences overseas, this transfixing style of minimal electronic dance music was pioneered by Midwestern D.J.s spinning mainly for black and gay audiences looking to \u201cjack\u201d their bodies at Windy City nightclubs like the Muzic Box and the Warehouse (where, under the stewardship of Frankie Knuckles, the style was birthed and named). While trailblazers like Mr. Fingers \u2014 a virtuosic multi-instrumentalist \u2014 are worshiped in London, Paris and Berlin, they are barely remembered back at home.\u201cFade\u201d sets out to correct this. Onto the wide-open surface \u201cMystery of Love\u201d provides, West spreads out his own sparse raps alongside what grows into an aural smorgasbord of samples, allusions and guest appearances spanning eras and ethnicities \u2014 \u201990s Nuyorican house, the white rapper/singer Post Malone \u2014 a subtle reminder of the outsize influence of black aesthetics on all manner of American and global culture.Which is why, as a radio-friendly hit (with an awe-inspiring video to boot), \u201cFade\u201d feels not only generous but subversive: In the span of a little over three minutes, it gives the lie to simplistic conceptions of musical borders. West has always displayed a rare encyclopedic and intuitive grasp of both mainstream and regional black sounds, from traditional gospel and R.&B. to college-inflected spoken word and even black Greek stepping, not to mention dance, reggae, trap and drill music. He knows that, glimpsed from the proper vantage, these are but facets of the same, constantly shifting whole. I don\u2019t think there is another pop star who could conceive of such a medley, let alone bring it to life in a way that coheres. Yet \u201cFade\u201d doesn\u2019t just cohere; it functions as a sly and infectious meditation on the variety of formal possibilities of black sound \u2014 as invented and interpreted by black people themselves as well as Latinos and white people. It also serves as a bittersweet thought experiment: Things could have been otherwise. Imagine, if you will, a world in which Mr. Fingers got his due.\u2666Thomas Chatterton Williams is a contributing writer for the magazine.The counter-diva who brings a comedian\u2019s timing and sensibility to jazz.By MARGO JEFFERSONShe\u2019s C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant, a 27-year-old with an exhilarating command of the jazz vocal tradition, which has long been dominated by women, many of them black. Salvant\u2019s parents are French-Guadeloupean and Haitian; she grew up in Miami studying classical music, then moved to Paris and added jazz to her studies. In 2010, she won the Thelonious Monk Institute International Jazz Vocals Competition; three albums later, \u201cFor One to Love\u201d won the jazz vocal album of the year at the 2016 Grammy Awards.I said she\u2019s in \u201ccommand of\u201d the jazz tradition. Better to say she\u2019s in communion with it. I like how she listens. I like how she tests herself and learns as she performs. Salvant has a supple, well-trained voice with spot-on pitch. (No vibrato-teases; no meandering warbles passing as melisma.) Her low notes go from husky to full-bodied; her high notes float purely and cleanly. When she scats, it\u2019s not an ego trip but a musical game, where notes and syllables get to shape-shift.Like many young jazz singers, she does the Great American Songbook \u2014 the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart or Hammerstein, Sondheim, Ellington. The risk? Sounding decorous and derivative. Like some other young jazz singers, she does the black vaudeville hits of Bert Williams and Bessie Smith, even some of the exotica that female musicians once tossed out to keep their fans tantalized. Here the risk is archness: the knowing postmodern wink.I wouldn\u2019t be writing about Salvant if she had fallen into either trap. But mainstream success has other traps. And while it has been a long time since jazz was at the center of pop commerce, the star- (or cult-) making machinery still labors to produce familiar types. Especially for women, and even more especially for black women.For black women in pop music, the dominant and preferred model remains the Diva. Here\u2019s my personal theory. The black diva\u2019s obverse is the black matriarch, that forceful mammy, maid or housekeeper, whose mythic reign lasted through a century of film and television. And yes, it\u2019s a long way from mammy to diva, but there\u2019s one constant. Racially and socially, this figure is considered lower and lesser. Theatrically, then \u2014 it\u2019s the law of fantasy compensation \u2014 she must appear greater. In the old days, that meant she was literally bigger, louder, bossier. Now she\u2019s symbolically bigger: more expansive, more intense, more outrageous.Call the roll of the last half-century, from Patti LaBelle to Fantasia, Jennifer Holliday to Jennifer Hudson. My favorites are Aretha Franklin and Tina Turner because of their contradictions. There\u2019s a core reserve, even sadness in Franklin, while Turner channeled her lust-goddess intensity through the dance moves of a gritty pugilist. Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna are the grandest of contemporary divas. Their social, financial and cultural riches are vast; they command global kingdoms. They aren\u2019t prey to traditional diva narratives of abuse or self-destruction; they turn all vulnerabilities into victories. Beyonc\u00e9 is the gracious sovereign, Rihanna the cocky bad girl turned It Girl. But they share a mandate: The Black Diva must flaunt, court and rule.Jazz divas have tended to have alter egos. Billie Holiday was a laconic wit before she was the Lady with the Gardenia; Sarah Vaughan could counter her Divine One with up-tempo Sassy. Dinah (The Queen) Washington was also a salty good-time gal. I hear their traces in Salvant\u2019s singing, and it gives me great pleasure to watch her revise the tropes of black divadom. Don\u2019t misunderstand \u2014 she\u2019s not an anti-diva. I\u2019d call her a counter-diva: the heroine as ebullient comedian.Salvant, like all counter-divas, constructs her look with care. Hers is gamine glam: Her face is round, her hair close-cropped. She wears big, blocky white glasses \u2014 a droll trademark, like Fats Waller\u2019s derby; a red fascinator with feathers that look like insect feelers.The black counter-diva is now making her way into the culture at large. I hear her when the mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran builds a song around nothing but a repeated \u201cShhhh\u201d or arranges to fuse John Dowland\u2019s \u201cFlow My Tears\u201d and Smokey Robinson\u2019s \u201cCruisin\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s in the mischief that snakes through Corinne Bailey Rae\u2019s rueful feathery songs too.I see her when Tracee Ellis Ross goes goofy on \u201cblack-ish.\u201d (It\u2019s as if she has reclaimed the soubrette wit her mother renounced for lofty grandeur.) I like how Rashida Jones uses cheerful slapstick to counter her sweet-girl prettiness in \u201cAngie Tribeca.\u201d As Lucca Quinn, the clever lawyer on \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d Cush Jumbo seems to be letting us in on a private joke; a tiny pause, the hint of a double-take, suggests a quizzical \u201cCan I get away with this?\u201d and a gleeful \u201cOMG, I just did.\u201d And won\u2019t it be fun to watch Lupita Nyong\u2019o in the film version of Chimamanda Adiche\u2019s \u201cAmericanah\u201d? Freed from period dramas that stretch from slavery to the Empire galaxy, she will bring her talents to a here-and-now comedy of morals and manners.John Gielgud once said that style is knowing what play you\u2019re in. It\u2019s true for all performers who work with varied traditions and repertories. And it means that the performer must know what age she is performing in, and why. Along with a merry band of counter-divas, Salvant is thinking hard about what conventions, habits and desires need revising \u2014 in her art, and in her audience.\u2666Margo Jefferson is the author of \u201cNegroland: A Memoir.\u201dA boozy toast to friendship.By BOBBY FINGERThis wasn\u2019t Lady Gaga\u2019s comeback, as many claimed: She never really left us, nor had she abandoned the music that made her famous.Two of Gaga\u2019s early albums, \u201cThe Fame\u201d (2008) and \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011), were bursting at the seams with instantly memorable dance-pop hits. But after her fourth solo album, the both fairly and unfairly maligned \u201cArtpop\u201d (2013), failed to deliver that kind of instant success, Gaga redirected her focus from an ostentatious existence \u2014 she wore a dress of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, after all \u2014 to less-bombastic acts of musical bravura that showcased her virtuosic skills as both a singer and a pianist. Last October, she released her much-anticipated fifth album, the deeply personal and country-tinged \u201cJoanne.\u201dSo when she fell to Earth during last month\u2019s Super Bowl and performed the hits that made her famous, fans who thought \u201cJoanne,\u201d with its stripped-down production and abundance of twang, was yet another sign that she had abandoned her old ways were able to breathe a sigh of relief: Gaga\u2019s verve hadn\u2019t gone anywhere. It\u2019s a message she made clear in \u201cGrigio Girls,\u201d a midtempo acoustic bonus track and the album\u2019s best song.In \u201cGrigio Girls,\u201d Gaga recalls a moment in her early 20s when she was \u201cspiraling out,\u201d only to be saved by the contagious spirit of her 30-something friend Sonja Durham, who was battling breast cancer at the time. \u201cGrigio Girls\u201d is an ode to friendship and singing along to your favorite songs off-key. But through some strange alchemy involving pop-culture references and cheap wine, it manages to do more than just celebrate sisterhood: It\u2019s proof that Gaga is still fundamentally Gaga, whether she\u2019s wrapped in meat or the arm of her recent collaborator, Tony Bennett. Though explicitly about Dunham and the inspirational \u201ctough girl\u201d persona she shared with Joanne Germanotta (Gaga\u2019s aunt, who died in 1974 and for whom the album is named), \u201cGrigio Girls\u201d becomes something more universal once Gaga\u2019s own voice is joined by the backing harmony. \u201cSisters never pack up,\u201d the singers reassure us. \u201cWe always run back.\u201d\u2666Bobby Finger is a staff writer for Jezebel and co-host of \u201cWho? Weekly.\u201dA woman\u2019s unabashed appreciation of women.By HANNAH GIORGISLike some of the best New York rap that preceded it, the track emboldens. M.A told the website Genius that the song wasn\u2019t modeled after fellow Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda\u2019s \u201cHot Nigga,\u201d but the two share similar beats \u2014 and \u201cOOOUUU\u201d lends itself perfectly to the \u201cShmoney Dance\u201d that took over Vine in 2014 and turned Shmurda into a viral star. The city\u2019s rappers took note: Less than a year since its release, the track has been remixed by local heavyweights like Nicki Minaj, French Montana, 50 Cent, Jadakiss and Remy Ma.The original song is full of references to M.A\u2019s own life in Brooklyn, where she\u2019s \u201cin these streets more than Sesame.\u201d While the track\u2019s narrative might span only one day, it feels firmly grounded in the habitual: Young M.A raps what she knows. She\u2019s not only a woman rapping but also a masculine-presenting queer woman in an industry that is dominated by heterosexual men. Queer hip-hop artists are hardly new; rappers like Le1f, Zebra Katz, Mykki Blanco, Cakes Da Killa and many others have been at the forefront of shifting the genre\u2019s landscape in recent years, and rumors of sexual fluidity have always surrounded many of hip-hop\u2019s biggest stars, both despite and because of the industry\u2019s reputation for homophobia. (Queer women in particular must grapple with intersecting axes of misogyny and homophobia.) Still, M.A seems refreshing, and quintessentially New York, in her frankness. She is who she is.The \u201cOOOUUU\u201d punch lines that inspire the most raucous singalongs are those in which she speaks, openly and matter-of-factly, about sex with another woman. Rapping about women is not the entirety of her catalog, nor is it a gimmick; she simply traffics in the same kind of braggadocio the industry\u2019s men are often known for, which is to say she\u2019s your average Bed-Stuy stud. M.A is seductive \u2014 even to women who don\u2019t identify as lesbian, queer or bisexual \u2014 and she knows it. If M.A\u2019s contemporary Remy Ma is conceited, M.A is cocky: \u201cIf that\u2019s your chick, then why she textin\u2019 me?/Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?\u201dThe lines that follow are salacious, but they\u2019re not performative. M.A may be a commanding, bite-her-lip-when-she-looks-in-your-direction queer woman, but her music neither starts nor ends there. What\u2019s more significant than M.A\u2019s queerness is the way she deftly weaves references to sex with women into her music without overstating or explaining them. If you know, you know. And if you don\u2019t, you can still enjoy her music \u2014 but M.A isn\u2019t going to waste her bars enlightening you.\u2666Hannah Giorgis is the special-projects editor for The Ringer.A \u201970s rock star\u2019s troubles, and a 68-year-old soul singer\u2019s.By CHARLES AARONA chord from a Hammond B3 organ quavers, and Charles Bradley\u2019s head snaps up, his eyes locking with the camera. When the woozy accompaniment hits, his deep-creased face wrenches; he shakes his head, places his palms together and gazes Godward. So begins the remarkable video for Bradley\u2019s soul rendition of Black Sabbath\u2019s 1972 gloom-folk lament \u201cChanges\u201d \u2014 no lip-syncing, just the 68-year-old singer in a black turtleneck against a blank backdrop. For six minutes, as his sculpted rasp wails, Bradley uses his face and hands to silently act out a vast grief, one at which the plain-spoken lyrics, originally written about the Sabbath drummer Bill Ward\u2019s breakup with his first wife, only hint. Bradley conceived his version while comforting and reconciling with his dying mother, but even if you didn\u2019t know that, his pantomime would still rip you up.\u201cChanges\u201d was originally the product of rock\u2019s early-\u201970s commercial largess. After three albums spent forging heavy metal in the unglamorous English Midlands, Sabbath was afforded a Bel Air mansion to record its fourth. The house was filled with equipment and enough drugs to get \u201ccoked out of our brains every day,\u201d as the bassist Geezer Butler recalled in \u201cBlack Sabbath: Doom Let Loose,\u201d Martin Popoff\u2019s illustrated history of the band. One debauched night, the guitarist Tony Iommi wandered over to a grand piano in the manse\u2019s ballroom and tapped out the melody of \u201cChanges.\u201d Butler wrote the lyrics, and Ozzy Osbourne, the singer, found some gentle nuance in them, despite being in such a drug-freaked state that he was \u201cdreaming there was, like, a tape machine coming into my room and eating me.\u201dWhen Bradley\u2019s guitarist, Tom Brenneck, raised the idea of covering \u201cChanges,\u201d he had never heard of Black Sabbath. \u201cBut as I was learning the song, my mom was very ill, and she was talking to me a lot, and what she was saying fit the lyrics,\u201d he told me. \u201cBefore that song, I was just trying to forget about her dying. But how can you forget the deepness of your mom finally telling you about her personal life and what she\u2019d gone through?\u201d Osbourne was so impressed by Bradley\u2019s version that he sent an appreciative email.Bradley\u2019s relationship with his mother was deeply fraught. She left her 8-month-old son to move from Gainesville, Fla., to Brooklyn, then sent for him when he was 8. He left at 14, saying she was abusive. Decades later, she begged him to come home to Brooklyn and take care of her. He agreed, reluctantly, but time didn\u2019t soften his resentment. It was only when she finally shared the terror she experienced in the Jim Crow South of the 1930s and \u201940s \u2014 and her struggles as a single mother of three in Bed-Stuy \u2014 that he was able to see his mother clearly.By 2011, when Bradley released the first of three top-shelf albums for the Brooklyn label Daptone, he was 62 and badly scarred by his own misfortunes. Even his ensuing, 11th-hour success has come at a cost: He has been pressured to support family and friends, and because his artistic method demands a deep emotional connection with his material, he has found himself revisiting buried memories of homelessness and violence. Late last year, he underwent a debilitating operation for stomach cancer. When I spoke with him in February, he was making plans to sing again, but his voice was practically a whisper. Still, he eagerly testified about \u201cChanges.\u201d\u201cOh, my God,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I heard the middle of the song, where it\u2019s, \u2018It took so long/To realize/That I can still hear/Her last goodbyes,\u2019 that really touched my soul, truthfully. I used to think my mom was evil, but we were able to find forgiveness at the end of her life. Now I can go out into the world without animosity or anger and show people the love in my soul.\u201d\u2666Charles Aaron is a contributing writer for MTV News.On the boldness and cowardice of love.By JASON PARHAMWhether you have the emotional bandwidth to admit it or not, all of us, at some point in our volatile existence on Earth, want to be acknowledged by another human being \u2014 seen, touched, heard and paid attention to, and not just platonically. Maybe those two lines jolted me because I live in an ebb-and-flow of denial about my own romantic relationships. Of the four semi-serious ones I\u2019ve had, not one has lasted longer than a year. (Once I asked an ex, with whom I\u2019d remained on good terms, to send me a favorite sentence of hers for a collaborative writing project I was working on; maybe half-jokingly, but probably not, she responded with the St. Vincent lyric \u201cYour heart is a strange little orange to peel.\u201d) And if music, like all art, should be an exercise in just how honest you are willing to be with yourself, then here are two truths: One is that I have never once known the texture of love \u2014 its nirvana-inducing high, its valley of heartbreak. The other is the logical, dead-on explanation for this \u2014 I am a coward. I refuse to take my guard down and open up.Cowardice is also something you innately recognize in another. And on \u201cSeigfried,\u201d a moody, astral slow burner from Frank Ocean\u2019s \u201cBlonde,\u201d I see an ideal palette for Ocean to mask cowardice as love. Has self-confliction ever sounded this divine? Over a bed of drowned-out guitar chords, he sings: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a fool/To settle for a place with some nice views/Maybe I should move/And settle down, two kids and a swimming pool/I\u2019m not brave.\u201d But it\u2019s the end of the song that finds Ocean sounding his most tormented. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you,\u201d he croons in the final minute, pausing for a beat and then adding, \u201cin the dark.\u201d He repeats the line five or six times. It\u2019s such a pure exchange, and a beautiful one too. Feelings run up against one another: vulnerability and intimacy, the possibility of love. But there\u2019s also that undercurrent of cowardice. It\u2019s a deep, genuine promise with a built-in provision. I am yours, but only when the lights are low and no one is looking.Perhaps it\u2019s not a surprising admission in a song that borrows from the singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, himself an effigy of melancholia, who died in 2003. But Ocean has always seemed so unafraid to me, both in his personal life and in the way his music emerges from the inside out. I suppose the bravery we see in him is evidenced by his very promise: though cloaked in a haze of emotional discord, it is one offered on his terms (Ocean has insisted on this position of self-authorship and ownership with increasing brazenness ever since the success of his first LP, \u201cChannel Orange\u201d). Maybe he has become more of the man he has always wanted to be in the years since the summer of 2012. I certainly haven\u2019t.The truth is, many of us are still \u201cspinning on blackness\u201d in our day-to-day lives \u2014 at times lost, afraid, uncertain. But tonight, here in the dark and away from everybody else, Ocean\u2019s orchestral psalm is a reminder that you can still be in full control, even if that means retreating to a place you vowed never to return to. It is only with this kind of startling humanness \u2014 wading through life\u2019s moral gray \u2014 that Ocean could deliver such a promise. Because, really, this isn\u2019t about love or lust; it\u2019s about power. Harness it. Hold it close. And don\u2019t let go.\u2666Jason Parham is a senior editor for The Fader magazine.Growing up wondering if the American dream is for you.By JENNY ZHANGSo when the indie musician Mitski Miyawaki titled her fourth studio album \u201cPuberty 2,\u201d I felt an immediate flicker of recognition. I felt another when she released the first single, \u201cYour Best American Girl,\u201d last March. Coming from someone like Mitski, who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an American father, the title alone was powerful enough to reopen a wound that had been rotting inside me ever since I came of age as an Asian girl in America: an old hatred for myself, my culture, the way I looked and the way I was raised.The simple bass line that opens the song should feel familiar to anyone who ever bobbed along with \u201990s indie rock while indulging in self-pity (as I most certainly did). Mitski murmurs and sighs and sings about a lover. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d be your little spoon/And kiss your fingers forever more.\u201d Did it mean something to me to hear another Asian-American woman refer to herself in the diminutive? Of course it did, and even more to hear her sing, \u201cBut big spoon, you have so much to do/And I have nothing ahead of me.\u201d The guitar and drum beat join in, adding bulk, while Mitski\u2019s voice remains at a steady, low ache, elevating him to the status of a god, unable to imagine that anything could be off-limits to him: \u201cYou\u2019re the sun, you\u2019ve never seen the night.\u201d She denigrates herself again: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the moon, I\u2019m not even a star.\u201d Then, after the power chords kick in and the chorus lifts off: \u201cYour mother wouldn\u2019t approve of how my mother raised me/But I do, I think I do.\u201dMothers have always held such symbolic weight in determining a person\u2019s worth. Your mother tongue, your motherland, your mother\u2019s values \u2014 these things can qualify or disqualify you from attaining myriad American dreams: love, fluency, citizenship, legitimacy, acceptance, success, freedom. \u201cYou\u2019re an all-American boy,\u201d Mitski sings. \u201cI guess I couldn\u2019t help trying to be your best American girl.\u201dI wanted to hear Mitski\u2019s story in this song, but I only heard my own. Listening brought me back to the fuzzy \u201990s D.I.Y. scene of my adolescence in the suburbs of Long Island, back when no one much questioned why a subculture that saw itself as rebelling against the establishment was quite so dominated by white men. I grew up in that scene, as far as someone like me could \u2014 a self-hating Asian kid with strict immigrant parents who wouldn\u2019t let me go over to white people\u2019s houses for fear that their values (laziness, selfishness, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity) would infect me. My mother had two unshakable beliefs that she tried to drill into me. The first was that I had to study and work twice as hard as my white peers if I wanted to survive in America, and the second was that it was delusional and dangerous to believe I possessed the same freedom white people had to pursue my dreams.When I told my mother I wanted to be a writer, she reacted as if I had said I wanted to kill myself. She vowed that she would do everything humanly possible to stop me. Compared with how she had behaved as a teenager, I was ungrateful; compared with the white mothers I knew, she was a dictator. At her most cutting, she asked me, \u201cWho\u2019s ever going to read your stories?\u201d I was stumped. I couldn\u2019t say. At that point in my life, kids were still shouting my last name back to me in the hallways as if it were a punch line and asking me if Chinese people really ate dogs. For the first time, it occurred to me that maybe my mother wasn\u2019t trying to stop me so much as she was trying to protect me.There\u2019s a line in the second verse of \u201cYour Best American Girl\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re the one/You\u2019re all I ever wanted/I think I\u2019ll regret this.\u201d It hints at what so many nonwhite Americans have long suspected: that our desire to be loved may be truly masochistic. It goes unquestioned that the non-American girl would want to assimilate into the all-American boy\u2019s world. But she cannot. That world is not for her.Racism thrives when the people being harmed by it blame themselves and one another. As a teenager, I blamed my parents for failing to secure me admission into whiteness, which I was certain was a prerequisite to being loved. I was mad at them, not at the cruelty of the American dream or the ways in which white supremacy had warped each of us. My privileged upbringing and education and linguistic fluency gave me such proximity to whiteness that it stung all the more to still find myself outside of it. My mother, on the other hand, not only accepted that she would always be an outsider in this country but also believed it to be a finer fate and home than any other she could have had.As I grow older, I find myself trying to turn to her more, to ask the questions I never asked when I was too busy feeling sorry for myself: why she came here, what it was like to uproot a life and move across the world, whether it was hard to raise me here. Does Mitski\u2019s narrator really approve of how her mother raised her? It\u2019s unclear, but you can hear in her voice just how much she wants to.\u2666Jenny Zhang is the author of the forthcoming short-story collection \u201cSour Heart.\u201dRaindrop. Drop top. Is rap music the new punk rock?By NAOMI ZEICHNEREver since the election in November, I\u2019ve gone out more and stayed out later. This doesn\u2019t feel glamorous or especially healthy. People who go to clubs regularly are usually there to work \u2014 whether they make or manage or write about music or just labor to look great. You spend more money than you have and try not to think about it, because late at night, positive energy is the most valuable currency. If anything made the hangover the next morning worth the trouble, it was Migos\u2019s \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d which dominated parties of all kinds this freakishly warm winter.The Atlanta rap trio \u2014 made up of the rappers Quavo, Offset and Takeoff \u2014 have been around for years, but \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d represents their most significant foray into the mainstream, and it\u2019s still a slightly awkward fit. For a recent music-video shoot, they wore heavy-metal tees and studded leather; Quavo\u2019s jacket was painted with the skull logo of the Misfits. This is an increasingly common trope in rap these days; many hip-hop artists insist they are rock stars to signal that they are at the center of today\u2019s counterculture \u2014 which is true. The trio records constantly and has worked the live circuit hard. First the rappers conquered Atlanta\u2019s strip-club scene, then the V.I.P. booths of the surrounding states and then the money of corporations. On their recent album \u201cCulture,\u201d Quavo reflects on their lifestyle: \u201cAll this pain, we can live through it. It\u2019s called success.\u201d\u201cCulture\u201d triumphed on the back of \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in January after months of gestation, thanks in part to internet memes that parroted back its most memorable parts. Migos is known for building songs around catchy lines, and \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d is expertly crammed with them, from its opening preamble to its abstract poetic \u201craindrop, drop top\u201d hook and the five ecstatic woos that announce the beginning of Offset\u2019s verse. The song is nearly six minutes long, and these noises are like souvenirs collected by everyone who has traveled through it, a trip that usually happens at the pinnacle of a night out, when the dance floor is packed and the women in the crowd are ready. \u201cYou can just tell,\u201d one D.J. friend said, when I asked how he decides when to play it. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if someone whispers in your ear, \u2018It\u2019s time.\u2019 \u201dWith all its parts to latch onto, \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d draws people together. When its bass shakes, people do, too; you could cut the music off and everyone would still be yelling in unison. Surrounded by that kind of collective precision, you might find it difficult not to feel less alone. If Migos has to pose in punk-rock outfits to be recognized as a voice for its generation, at least it\u2019s an authentic pose: The punks I know love their music deeply. Whether they meant to or not, with \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d Migos created a space of refuge for people who needed a break and were willing to work for it. The song offered a sanctuary: Settle in, stay a while, belong here for as long as you need.\u2666Naomi Zeichner is the editor in chief of The Fader.You play you.By Steven HydenLast November, Metallica did something extraordinary: It put out a new album, \u201cHardwired .\u2009.\u2009. to Self-Destruct,\u201d that actually sounded like Metallica. On paper, a band acting like itself seems normal. But consider Metallica\u2019s output since its megaselling self-titled LP in 1991, better known as \u201cThe Black Album.\u201d There was the \u201calt-rock haircut\u201d phase of \u201cLoad and Re-Load.\u201d The \u201cLet\u2019s stop playing guitar solos\u201d phase of \u201cSt. Anger.\u201d And, most regrettable, the \u201cCollaborate with Lou Reed on a confounding art-rock opus about a 19th-century German femme fatale\u201d phase of \u201cLulu.\u201dContrast those digressions with \u201cSpit Out the Bone,\u201d the kinetic seven-minute closer of \u201cHardwired.\u201d Dueling riffs by the guitarists James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett race forward at a frightening velocity. Lars Ulrich bashes out a martial beat that sounds like a velociraptor trapped inside a washing machine. And Robert Trujillo\u2019s melodically sinister bass snakes below the maelstrom, a demon lurking in the shadows. \u201cSpit Out the Bone\u201d epitomizes the thrash-metal formula that Metallica helped invent in the early \u201980s and then tried to avoid for the past quarter-century. On \u201cHardwired ... to Self-Destruct,\u201d it\u2019s almost as if those 25 years never happened.Not giving the people what they want has been admired as a gesture of artistic fortitude in music, going back at least to Igor Stravinsky, whose premiere of his dissonant masterwork, \u201cThe Rite of Spring,\u201d caused a riot at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris in 1913. More recently, a boxed set collecting every known concert recording from Bob Dylan\u2019s 1966 tour \u2014 36 discs in all \u2014 was released last fall. The exhaustive document chronicles a pivotal period for rock\u2019s poet laureate, who angered folk fans by \u201cgoing electric.\u201d Now it\u2019s possible to hear nearly every instance of an audience jeering loudly as Dylan introduced \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d and other songs into his live repertoire.Metallica once embraced a foundational idea of \u201cprogressive\u201d popular music: Change constantly or become instantly irrelevant, even if those stylistic shifts alienate your fans. But in an age when a plurality of niches has supplanted the mainstream that Metallica once conquered, there\u2019s a new kind of street cred that comes with sticking to what you\u2019re known for. Now it\u2019s listeners who contain multitudes. It\u2019s up to us to create eclectic playlists designed for a variety of moods and situations. For a veteran band like Metallica, that means being rewarded for playing to type. \u201cHardwired ... to Self-Destruct\u201d debuted at No.\u20091 and was the best-selling rock album in years.Is it antithetical to art to suggest that \u201cknow your brand\u201d is the future not just of music, but also all of entertainment? George Lucas sold the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise to Disney in 2012, and now J.\u2009J. Abrams makes the sort of \u201cfun\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies that Lucas was trying to get away from with his little-loved, self-serious prequels. Lucas never recovered after making his versions of \u201cLoad,\u201d \u201cSt. Anger\u201d and \u201cLulu.\u201d Metallica should be grateful that it still gets to make Metallica records.\u2666Steven Hyden is cultural critic for Uproxx.We talk with some of the great writers in this issue about the songs that spoke to them over the past year, and what those songs might tell us about the world right now.Digital Design: Rodrigo de Benito Sanz and Linsey Fields.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Julie Andrews and Henson Puppets", "Date": "2017-03-10", "News": "Supported byOn a wintry morning last month, Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton breezed into the Jim Henson Company\u2019s Creature Shop in Queens, where they warmly greeted puppets hanging limply from a stand.\u201cWhy, hello there!\u201d said Ms. Andrews, 81, hailing the foam and fabric creations as if they were close friends.Ms. Andrews quickly apologized. \u201cI just wanted to lift his feathers up a bit,\u201d she said.The difference now? She helped bring these latest puppets into existence. Besides starring in \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d Ms. Andrews helped create, write and produce the show with Ms. Hamilton and Judy Rothman Rof\u00e9, an Emmy-winning writer on \u201cMadeline\u201d and other kids\u2019 programs. On the show, she plays Ms. Julie, who teaches a performing arts class to five puppet pupils. Over the debut season\u2019s 13 episodes, Ms. Julie and celebrity guests (including Alec Baldwin, Idina Menzel, Josh Groban, Carol Burnett and David Hyde Pierce) inspire the eager young thespians to create and perform an original musical.Both mother and daughter want the show to champion the vital role they see the performing arts play in teaching children critical thinking, empathy, tolerance and communication skills. \u201cIt\u2019s the bridge across all countries,\u201d Ms. Andrews said, referring to drama, dance and music. \u201cThe hardest part for us with the show was not to get preachy but also to make it wildly entertaining.\u201dMs. Andrews is keenly aware that her new show is entering a rapidly changing children\u2019s television world. The traditional major networks and even the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon are losing young viewers to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, which are plumping up their kids\u2019 programming with ever more offerings. Netflix currently streams more than 40 of its own children\u2019s shows, including \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events\u201d and \u201cTrollhunters,\u201d while Amazon offers 15 originals, such as \u201cAnnedroids\u201d and \u201cTumble Leaf.\u201d And HBO, which streams via HBO Go and HBO Now, cut a deal a year ago to air new episodes of \u201cSesame Street\u201d nine months before they appear on PBS.\u201cWhen I was growing up, I watched \u2018The Smurfs\u2019 on Saturday morning,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst specializing in technology and media at BTIG Research, referring to the NBC cartoon show from the 1980s. \u201cThat was the definition of kids\u2019 TV. Kids today don\u2019t even think about turning on the TV networks or cable on Saturday. They want it on demand, and that\u2019s how they\u2019re used to getting it.\u201dFor the streaming services, in particular, their treasure trove of data clearly show what their viewers crave: According to Netflix, more than half of its 93 million members in nearly 200 countries, for example, regularly watch its children\u2019s shows.\u201cChildren\u2019s content is important, because it\u2019s our first opportunity to build brand love for Netflix that we hope will last a lifetime,\u201d said Andy Yeatman, director of global kids content at Netflix.The real targets, of course, are parents who pay the subscription fees. \u201cKids\u2019 content gives the household a reason to subscribe, because kids watch every single day,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said.Following their schmooze with the puppets, Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton discussed the birthing process for their show over scones and coffee in a conference room at the Creature Shop. The women have an easy rapport, built up not only as mother and daughter but also as the co-authors of more than 30 popular children\u2019s books, including the \u201cDumpy the Dump Truck\u201d and \u201cThe Very Fairy Princess\u201d series. (Ms. Andrews has four other children, including two stepchildren, as well as 10 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.)After the Henson Company approached Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton with the show\u2019s concept, the project was shopped to Netflix in late 2015; Mr. Yeatman and his team quickly said yes. \u201cOne of the things that attracted us was not so much that Julie was attached, but that this was a topic she cared a lot about: building a love for the performing arts in kids,\u201d Mr. Yeatman said.Then the real work started. Ms. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton, together with Ms. Rof\u00e9, spent a week last winter mapping out the show\u2019s narrative arc and writing the pilot episode at the actress\u2019s home in Sag Harbor, N.Y. The peripatetic Ms. Andrews, a widow since the death in 2010 of the director Blake Edwards, now considers Sag Harbor, a former whaling village (where Ms. Hamilton also lives), her primary residence.Next came the creation and building of the show\u2019s seven puppet characters (which include a dog and Hugo the duck). Ms. Julie\u2019s five pupils are a true rainbow coalition, including one who is in a wheelchair and another who is seemingly gender neutral. \u201cThat\u2019s Riley; she loves all the technical backstage stuff,\u201d Ms. Andrews said, pointing to an androgynous puppet sporting shortish red hair and round glasses. \u201cShe\u2019s a girl.\u201dMs. Hamilton, 54, an actress turned writer and arts educator, chimed in. \u201cIf pressed, we\u2019d say that she\u2019s a girl, but maybe not forever,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be as diverse as possible.\u201dMs. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton weighed in extensively when the puppets were being designed and built at the Creature Shop. They helped choose hair color and texture, outfits, even nose shapes.\u201cMom, remember the 17 different fabric swatches we went through for Peri\u2019s skirt?\u201d Ms. Hamilton asked, referring to the diva-in-training puppet.\u201cYes!\u201d Ms. Andrews replied. \u201cWe wanted it as icing pink as possible.\u201dThe women also sat in on final casting sessions to pick an actor to play Gus, Ms. Julie\u2019s (human) assistant. Giullian Yao Gioiello (\u201cThe Carrie Diaries\u201d) won the role after strumming his guitar and demonstrating his human-beat-box prowess.\u201cI was a bit in awe when I first walked in,\u201d he said of meeting Ms. Andrews. But after spending six weeks of nearly 15-hour days shooting the series at Grumman Studios in Bethpage, N.Y., he came to regard his energetic co-star as his honorary grandmother. \u201cShe\u2019d share stories and get me her favorite tea, a British brand called PG Tips.\u201d The biggest surprise? \u201cThat Julie Andrews at the end of the day wants a martini.\u201dMs. Andrews and Ms. Hamilton also lined up many of the show\u2019s celebrity guest stars.In the first episode, Ms. Menzel introduces the pupils to Broadway musicals. Ms. Julie informs them that Ms. Menzel was the voice of Elsa in Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen,\u201d a credit sure to impress young viewers more than her Broadway credits from \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cRent.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t say no to Julie Andrews,\u201d Ms. Menzel said.After working with her on \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d Ms. Menzel said, she\u2019s especially impressed by the veteran star\u2019s polite perfectionism. \u201cWe would rewrite things on the spot to make them better. She doesn\u2019t settle. She wanted to get things right, but she did it with grace.\u201dSeveral of the guest stars sing with Ms. Andrews, warbling original songs. Following a botched surgery on her vocal cords 20 years ago, her once four-octave range is now reduced to one. These days, she speak-sings. \u201cI touch what notes I can and say the others,\u201d Ms. Andrews said. \u201cI have about three or four good bass notes left. I could sing you a terrific version of \u2018Old Man River.\u2019\u201dMs. Andrews said she despaired, post-surgery, because her whole identity \u201cwas being able to sing and the joy of it.\u201d She eventually realized \u2014 \u201cIt was a great lifesaver\u201d \u2014 that there were other ways to incorporate music into her life.Ms. Hamilton nodded. \u201cIn this show, Mom was very hands-on with the songs and the underscoring,\u201d she said.Ms. Andrews added, \u201cThe arrangements, the scoring \u2014 it\u2019s something I\u2019m so passionate about.\u201dMs. Julie joins in, picking up a china teacup and rhythmically whacking at it with a spoon.The action was unscripted. \u201cWho better than an English mum to pick up a teacup and start banging away?\u201d Ms. Andrews said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s serendipity.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with an article about the new show \u201cJulie\u2019s Greenroom,\u201d using information from Netflix, misstated the names of several puppets in the show. They are Riley, Spike, and Peri \u2014 not Yomo, Bingo and Nimble.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Streaming Drives U.S. Music Sales Up 11% in 2016", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byFor the last year or so, the music industry has been buzzing with optimism that its fortunes have finally begun to turn around after more than a decade of digital disruption and plunging sales. Now it has proof.On Thursday, the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group that represents the major labels, reported that music sales in the United States generated $7.7 billion in retail revenue in 2016, up 11.4 percent from the year before. That is the industry\u2019s highest sales figure since 2009 and its best percentage gain since 1998.The increase is largely the result of online streaming, which is rapidly eclipsing all other forms of consumption. Streaming contributed $3.9 billion in 2016, up 69 percent from the year before, and now makes up 51 percent of the business \u2014 the first time it has had a majority of sales in the United States.The largest and fastest-growing chunk of the streaming business is in paid subscriptions to services like Spotify and Apple Music. In the United States, services like these attracted an average of 22.6 million subscribers and generated $2.3 billion, nearly doubling their total from the year before. Spotify has said that it has 50 million global subscribers, and Apple Music has more than 20 million.Other kinds of streaming made up the rest of the format\u2019s total, as the business has evolved to offer consumers a diverse menu of free and paid plans. This year, the industry association attributed $220 million to a new category, \u201climited paid-tier subscription,\u201d which includes plans like Amazon Prime that let paying customers pick from a smaller pool of songs.Even with the latest growth spurt, sales revenue in the United States is still about half what the industry enjoyed in 1999. That was the year that represented the peak of its most profitable product, the CD, as well as the start of its long digital disruption through the arrival of Napster.CD sales are now plunging rapidly. Last year, just 99.4 million full-length CDs were sold in the United States, worth $1.2 billion; it was the first time since 1986 that fewer than 100 million were sold. And downloads were down 22 percent last year to $1.8 billion.Free services like YouTube, which let people choose which song to listen to, generated $469 million last year, up 26 percent from the year before. (YouTube also has a paid subscription version.)But Mr. Sherman\u2019s critique is a sign that the industry is still focused on YouTube as an adversary, the way it was on Napster, which in its original form paid nothing in royalties. After years of fighting piracy, the industry is now trying to wring as much money as it can from digital music, and finally seeing growth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Battle for Digital India, Vodafone Teams Up With Idea Cellular", "Date": "2017-03-20", "News": "Supported byIndia is fast becoming the new battleground for global technology and telecommunications giants, as Facebook, Vodafone and others vie to connect the country\u2019s population of 1.2 billion to the internet.The fight took another turn on Monday when Vodafone, a British carrier, announced that it was combining its Indian unit with Idea Cellular, a local operator, in a $23 billion deal that would create one of the world\u2019s largest cellphone providers, with roughly 400 million subscribers in India.The country\u2019s cellphone industry is undergoing a drastic overhaul, as more Indians make the digital leap.In recent years, the use of smartphones, which can be bought for as little as $20, has ballooned, and Indians have rushed to digital services like Google and Facebook. India is already Facebook\u2019s largest market, based on number of users. Local start-ups like Flipkart, a growing e-commerce player, have taken on the likes of Amazon.\u201cWhen I get home, if my kids need help with their homework, they Google it on my phone,\u201d said Sikendar Kumar Jha, 37, a chauffeur in Mumbai whose family lives near the border with Nepal. \u201cMy wife and kids live here with me, but I video chat with my brothers in my village.\u201dThe explosion of internet usage has created cutthroat competition among carriers seeking ever faster mobile networks and cheaper data packages in a country where consumers are particularly sensitive to price. And the dynamic has prompted a flurry of investments and deals.\u201cConsolidation in the Indian market is the name of the game,\u201d said Rishi Tejpal, an analyst in Gurgaon, India, for Gartner, a technology research company. \u201cThe survival of 10 to 12 local operators isn\u2019t a long-term reality.\u201dThe companies said the merger would allow them to invest heavily in faster mobile networks across India. Those networks, called fourth generation, or 4G, are a basic requirement for movie streaming and watching TV programs on smartphones.While many in India already have so-called feature phones \u2014 rudimentary devices with limited, or no, access to the web \u2014 operators are trying to coax people to invest in budget smartphones that can take advantage of mobile data. Such services offer higher returns than carriers\u2019 traditional voice or text message offerings.\u201cWe have responded effectively to the newcomer,\u201d Vittorio Colao, Vodafone\u2019s chief executive, said on Monday, referring to Reliance Industries and its free offerings. \u201cAnyone who gives anything away for free in life has to charge, inevitably.\u201dThe merger is expected to close by late 2018. Vodafone would retain a 45 percent stake in the business, while the Aditya Birla Group, Idea\u2019s majority shareholder, would hold a 26 percent stake. Idea\u2019s other shareholders would own the remaining stock.The promise of India\u2019s large market has caught the attention of some of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest companies, too.Analysts say the main instigator for the latest merger was the entrance of Jio last year. Jio quickly drew about 100 million subscribers, thanks largely to its free voice and data packages for new users.Reliance has invested at least $25 billion to build a fast mobile network across India, and that has forced rivals to cut their prices and to spend big to try to keep pace. Reliance plans to pare back its free offerings by the end of March. Instead, it will encourage users to buy low-cost monthly data plans, in which voice calls are expected to remain free of charge.For Indians, the price war has led to a flurry of mobile data offers, allowing many to connect to the internet at significantly discounted rates. That has allowed subscribers to use digital services, such as those from Google and Uber, that would previously have been prohibitively expensive.Varun Mahtani, 30, a stock trader in Mumbai, signed up with Jio in December, combining the carrier\u2019s free data plans with his existing Vodafone subscription.Mr. Mahtani uses a smartphone with a so-called dual SIM that allows him to toggle back and forth between the two carriers, depending on which one offers him the best rate. That strategy has let him cut his Vodafone cost by 75 percent, to just $6 a month, while increasing his average internet usage.\u201cI use data constantly \u2014 Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube \u2014 in addition to work,\u201d said Mr. Mahtani, adding that if Jio cut back on its free offerings, he would likely switch to another provider. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be a consumer.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from MumbaiAdvertisement"}

She fought against time to write her life story, but she will never see her dream realized.My grandfather, who died before I was born, knew there was something special about her. He wrote a letter to his brother about his wedding day back in 1948, saying, \u201cWhat do you think, folks? I married a gal with a typewriter.\u201dI knew I wanted to be a writer by age 7, and my grandma was my first editor. She raised my uncle and me while running her own business, and instilled in me a love of language from an early age. Critique sessions with her writing buddies were just as common as pulling out the dictionary during dinner to understand the true meaning of a word. When she read aloud to me as a child, I loved the sound of her soothing voice with its slight Boston accent.Later, while I was in community college, she struck through my papers with her unforgiving red pen and magically transformed my lengthy prose into writing that got to the point.I often wrote about my experience as a mixed-race young adult for class, but would keep these essays hidden from all but the instructor and my grandmother. In one of my grandma\u2019s magazines, I discovered the book \u201cBlack, White, Other\u201d \u2014 a seminal text for mixed-race scholars of my generation. It was my first purchase from Amazon, the company my uncle soon left the nest to work for. One cousin was bound for art school, another for music school, and I was bound for nowhere but knew I wanted to write.It would take me years to realize this dream, through a marriage and divorce, undergraduate and grad school \u2014 until, at age 38, I packed my bags and moved to Los Angeles. As my grandma\u2019s mind deteriorated, I felt myself holding on to her by becoming the woman we both wanted to be.I lost my childhood home in 2000 when my grandma sold her house in Santa Cruz, Calif., to move to a retirement community in Washington State. For the first time, there was no home to return to. No desk to sit at and imagine my writing career. No critique sessions around the dining room table.Eventually she moved in with my aunt and uncle, who live in a log house in Washington. I flew out last spring to help take care of her. One morning before dawn, she entered the guest room where I was sleeping. She had no pants on. Soft light filtered in through the open window, and she flicked on the lights to signal what she thought was waking time. Her knees shook beneath her as she stood on unsteady feet. I told her to go back to bed, but she couldn\u2019t make sense of my words without her hearing aids. Instead, she repeated the nonsense phrase she thought she heard: \u201cGo that to said?\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cgame\u201d she and her sisters used to play, only now the game gets played every day.Every now and then during my visit, she sat at her large wooden desk and took out a legal pad. In that space, she seemed to imagine her former self returning, as if a professional atmosphere could reawaken her lost language. I longed to see sentences flow onto the page. But after scribbling two lines in half an hour, she put down her pencil in exhaustion.Sometimes she records nuggets of personal history on these pages, and my aunt hides them away in a file folder in the hall closet, where they wait to be pieced together into a narrative once my grandma is no longer with us.During my visit, I was working on an educators\u2019 guide to accompany an anthology of writing by biracial authors. Once, I noticed her reading the first essay in it. Hours later she was on the same page. I mentioned her unwavering attention to the writer of the essay, who had become a friend. \u201cI\u2019d love to know what she thinks,\u201d she said. So I relayed her message to my grandmother, with just a little bit of hope.\u201cI think I don\u2019t know much,\u201d my grandma answered.\u201cLet me take a look,\u201d she said.As she had with the anthology, my grandmother read lines repeatedly. She gave me advice she didn\u2019t remember. She found a redundant word, and I squealed. In my delight I hoped this brief moment of clarity would continue. It didn\u2019t. My grandmother stared with desperation at the screen before her, trying to conjure up her buried critic. It didn\u2019t come, and I finished the piece without her assistance. I called her from home once it published. She cried. I called her a couple of weeks later to tell her it had been retweeted by someone in the Obama White House. She cried again. Her tears have always been my barometer of success.She had a brief lucid moment on a family camping trip over Labor Day weekend. \u201cWhen you first told me you wanted to be a writer, I thought, \u2018Oh Lord, I don\u2019t wish that insecure fate on my grandchild,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut you really did it.\u201d We squeezed each other\u2019s hands and I didn\u2019t want to let go.Meanwhile, a copy of my educators\u2019 guide, now printed, sat on her lap, never opened. She\u2019s proud of me for writing it, even if she\u2019ll never read it.I wouldn\u2019t be a writer without her. Her words flow through me, creating their own lasting legacy. My grandma\u2019s mind is disappearing, but her force within me is becoming stronger. I carry it with me to fulfill both our destinies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Platform Companies Are Becoming More Powerful \u2014 but What Exactly Do They Want?", "Date": "2017-03-21", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyDuring a February ride in San Francisco, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was recorded arguing with and eventually berating an Uber driver from the back seat of his car. The driver, who had been working with the company since 2011, accused Kalanick of undercutting drivers of high-end cars like his, plunging him into bankruptcy. Kalanick responded with a lecture about the basic economic logic of his company: Soon, the supply of luxury cars on the app would be reduced, causing demand to increase. Besides, he went on, if the company hadn\u2019t added a lower-priced tier, it would have been beaten by competitors. This did not satisfy the driver, which seemed to enrage Kalanick, who erupted into a moralizing tirade. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own [expletive],\u201d he said, before leaving the car.Uber, like so many other successful tech companies in 2017, is a \u201cplatform business,\u201d one built around matchmaking between vendors and customers. If successful, a platform creates its own marketplace; if extremely successful, it ends up controlling something closer to an entire economy. This is intuitive in a case like eBay, which connects buyers and sellers. Airbnb, too, resembles an age-old form of commerce, connecting property owners with short-term lodgers. TaskRabbit and Fiverr connect contractors with people looking to hire them. Some of the largest platforms are less obviously transactional: Facebook and Google connect advertisers with users, users with one another, software developers with users. But while the transactions that happen on their platforms largely take a different form \u2014 taps, shares, ads served and scrolled past \u2014 the principles are essentially the same, as are the benefits. These businesses are asset- and employee-light, low on liability and high on upside. They aspire to monopoly, often unapologetically, and have been instrumental in rehabilitating the concept. (The logic is seductive and often self-evident: Facebook is more useful if everyone is on it, therefore everyone should be on Facebook.)Predictably, platforms have long been intoxicating to investors. They\u2019ve also been the subject of rapturous popular business writing. In their 2016 book \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms,\u201d the economists David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee cast the subject in revolutionary terms, calling for a \u201cnew economics\u201d to account for businesses that are \u201ctransforming economies\u201d around the world, \u201cmaking life easier and better for billions of people\u201d \u2014 the sort of broad and ideological claim previously reserved by economists for capitalism as a whole.Amid the cheerleading, a comprehensive criticism of the platform model has been slow to emerge. Nick Srnicek\u2019s \u201cPlatform Capitalism,\u201d published in December, tries to situate the rise of platforms in a broader history of capitalism and to project those lessons forward. Srnicek recasts a few features of platform businesses as potentially problematic. Among them is their tendency to metastasize from transaction enablers to, with sufficient success, participation gatekeepers. A food-delivery app like Seamless begins its life with promises of liberation, connecting customers with nearby restaurants, taking care of payments and eliminating phone calls. But in the cities where it has been most successful, its customer base becomes too big to ignore, even for restaurants that struggle to afford its steep commissions. In other industries, the stakes are much higher. An insurgent Airbnb feels as if it\u2019s enabling new types of transactions between previously unconnected people. A dominant Airbnb might come to resemble something between a superintendent and a landlord for millions, not to mention a force reshaping cities in its image.Platform companies have themselves hired economists to help conceptualize and manage the economies they\u2019ve created. Google, Airbnb, Uber and Amazon have aggressively recruited professors and researchers to help understand what, exactly, they have on their hands, and how to expand, regulate and exploit it. Within a rigidly structured platform like Uber, for which the company sets prices, the economic problems are somewhat akin to those of a command economy: How low can we push the cost of a ride before drivers stop participating? (Quite low, for now.) How do we deal with sudden increases in demand? (Surge pricing, controversially.) How might new drivers be both induced to join the platform and more deeply compelled to stay? (Through the introduction of vehicle-financing programs and short-term loan services.)Platforms are, in a sense, capitalism distilled to its essence. They are proudly experimental and maximally consequential, prone to creating externalities and especially disinclined to address or even acknowledge what happens beyond their rising walls. And accordingly, platforms are the underlying trend that ties together popular narratives about technology and the economy in general. Platforms provide the substructure for the \u201cgig economy\u201d and the \u201csharing economy\u201d; they\u2019re the economic engine of social media; they\u2019re the architecture of the \u201cattention economy\u201d and the inspiration for claims about the \u201cend of ownership.\u201dBut the tensions that platforms like Uber create with their customers, their workers and the world that surrounds them will soon become harder to ignore as these companies foment economic and social change, the consequences of which will increasingly be thrust into spectacular display. The Kalanick video was a P.R. nightmare not just for Uber but also for the platform economy in general, posing grand questions about the world it promises, or threatens, to create. The zeal for platforms, combined with the technology industry\u2019s internalization of their merits and inevitability, will push them into areas where the tensions they create become starker and the ideologies they carry become more apparent.Nowhere is that ideological dimension more clear than in the Kalanick video from February. Driver and founder sat inches apart, alienated from each other by the system over which one presides and within which the other toils: the founder explaining to the driver how the platform works and must work; the driver appealing to this person for better pay. It resembles nothing more than one man remarking on the rain while the other thinks, \u201cDon\u2019t you control the weather?\u201d Platforms seek total control even as they abdicate responsibility. In other words, they\u2019re perfect.For now, the tensions that platforms can breed have been obscured \u2014 or at least ignored \u2014 in large part because platformized labor has arrived first in sectors where employment was already widely precarious and contract-based, like taxi driving.

The recent history of platforms, however, has been defined by the failure of all but a few smart or lucky people to imagine just how successful and powerful they can be.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Is Trump\u2019s Next Target, Administration Says", "Date": "2017-03-30", "News": "Supported byThe Trump administration served notice on Thursday that its next move to deregulate broadband internet service companies would be to jettison the Obama administration\u2019s net neutrality rules, which were intended to safeguard free expression online.The net neutrality rules, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015, aimed to preserve the open internet and ensure that it could not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.Supporters of net neutrality have insisted the rules are necessary to protect equal access to content on the internet. Opponents said the rules unfairly subjected broadband internet suppliers like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter to utility-style regulation.In a news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, mentioned the net neutrality rules affecting telecommunications and cable internet services, noting that the Obama administration had \u201creclassified them as common carriers.\u201dMr. Spicer said President Trump had \u201cpledged to reverse this overreach.\u201d The Obama-era rules, Mr. Spicer said, were an example of \u201cbureaucrats in Washington\u201d placing restrictions on one kind of company \u2014 internet service suppliers \u2014 and \u201cpicking winners and losers.\u201dTelecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as common-carrier utility services, which are subject to anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules. They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers.Mr. Spicer remarked on the rollback of privacy rules before he spoke more broadly about regulations on broadband internet services. President Trump, he said, will \u201ccontinue to fight Washington red tape that stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth.\u201dExcerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.Mr. Trump earlier this year appointed Ajit Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon and a minority Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, as chairman of the agency. Mr. Pai voted against the net neutrality rules as a commission member in 2015.Since becoming chairman, Mr. Pai has indicated that he plans to either roll back or decline to enforce many consumer protection regulations created during the Obama administration, including those regarding net neutrality.Getting rid of the net neutrality rules, policy experts said, will be more difficult than peeling away the privacy regulations. Congress, in a vote mainly along party lines, and by a narrow margin, overturned the privacy rules enacted last fall, using a streamlined process under the Congressional Review Act.But that faster procedure will not apply to the net neutrality rules, which were approved by the F.C.C. two years ago, beyond the timetable for such reviews.Another path to repeal would be for Mr. Pai, who now leads a Republican-majority commission, to revisit the issue at the F.C.C.Politically, net neutrality might be a bigger challenge as well. When it was weighing the rules in 2014 and 2015, the F.C.C. received more than one million public comments. The vast majority of them endorsed strict nondiscrimination rules that supporters viewed as necessary to preserve the democratic ethos of an open internet.That wave of response influenced the Democratic-majority commission. \u201cNet neutrality could be a volatile and explosive issue,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit consumer group. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the Trump administration appreciates that it addresses nondiscrimination for all kinds of speech, as much for Breitbart and Newsmax as it is for MSNBC and CNN,\u201d referring to news sources that are staunch backers of the Trump administration and ones often seen by Republicans as harsh critics.Opponents of the net neutrality rules say the rules were mainly the result of a very effective lobbying campaign by powerful internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. They have deep pockets and could pay more for fast lanes for their services, they say, but used the net neutrality campaign to avoid that expense.\u201cRegulations result in the allocation of wealth by the government,\u201d said Jeffrey Eisenach, an economist and visiting scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who was also an adviser to the Trump transition team. \u201cThey are often an opportunity for one group of firms to grab an advantage over another group.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "FilmStruck and Warner Archive Instant Are Classic-Movie Troves", "Date": "2017-03-17", "News": "Supported byStreaming\u201cTwo great tastes that taste great together\u201d was how Reese\u2019s once extolled the virtues of its famous peanut butter cups. A similar notion endures when considering the streaming services FilmStruck and Warner Archive. If you are a fanatical lover of classic movies and are moving away from physical media, both sites offer cinematic stimulants and comforts in often complementary ways.FilmStruck \u2014 available as an app and on a website, and on devices such as Amazon Fire, Apple TV and Chromecast (Roku and PlayStation will be adding it this year) \u2014 is a joint endeavor of Turner Classic Movies and the boutique DVD and Blu-ray label the Criterion Collection. Warner Archive Instant, also an app and a site \u2014 also available on Roku and Apple TV \u2014 is an offshoot of the DVD and Blu-ray service Warner Archive, which specializes in the more obscure holdings of the vaults of Warner Bros. and other timeless Hollywood studios.For classic-movie nuts looking for a film noir binge, FilmStruck offers \u201cT-Men\u201d and \u201cRaw Deal,\u201d two late-1940s crime movies directed by Anthony Mann. These pictures are notable for their brutal violence and their remarkable black-and-white imagery, captured by the cinematographer John Alton. Their stylizations are definitively noir but may be lacking for those genre fans who insist that a true noir must contain a potent psychosexual element.For that, FilmStruck has a batch of pictures from Fritz Lang, a godfather of noir. One of them is \u201cScarlet Street\u201d (1945), in which Edward G. Robinson\u2019s milquetoast character falls hard for a heartless streetwalker played by Joan Bennett. The way she and her implied pimp, Dan Duryea, toy with Robinson is still agonizingly cringeworthy today. The shocking tabloid thriller \u201cBeyond a Reasonable Doubt\u201d (1956), the last movie Lang directed in the United States, is a tale of a reporter whose crusade against capital punishment has a perverse twist. It hides its depraved secrets until the very end; in a way, it is Lang\u2019s bitter kiss-off to American cinema.FilmStruck\u2019s subsection the Criterion Channel contains films of a more international bent. This month, for instance, the service adds 10 films directed by the Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman, more than half of them from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s, a period not as well known by American viewers as the films from \u201cThe Seventh Seal\u201d (1957) on. These display Bergman\u2019s mastery of cinematic storytelling; viewers accustomed to him as a forger of tortured mystical allegories might be surprised by, say, \u201cDreams\u201d (1955), a melodrama set in the Swedish fashion world. Indeed, the early pictures here, which also include \u201cThirst,\u201d \u201cPort of Call\u201d and \u201cSecrets of Women,\u201d find Bergman straddling the prerogatives of the conventional Swedish modern drama and an increasing need for self-expression. The push-pull on display is fascinating even as the films\u2019 individual stories work their spells.And lest you come away with the impression that FilmStruck\u2019s mission is strictly highbrow, this month the site hosts all six films in the spectacular \u201cLone Wolf and Cub\u201d series, 1970s \u201cchanbara\u201d (sword-fighting) movies from Japan featuring a wandering warrior and his unlikely accomplice, his infant son in a baby cart.The Warner Archive site is not nearly as stuffed with special features. There\u2019s a \u201cNews\u201d section featuring occasional updates on programming. When the Warner Archive debuted in 2009 as a manufacture-on-demand DVD label, my sense was that its target audience was film nuts who liked to dig, not ones who wanted docents. The relatively bare-bones approach of the streaming site seems to confirm my impression. But any site that can comfortably accommodate Mr. Boorman\u2019s feature debut, from 1965, \u201cHaving a Wild Weekend\u201d (released in England as \u201cCatch Us if You Can\u201d), a rather downbeat \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d variant starring the Dave Clark Five; the over-the-top 1940 James Cagney boxing melodrama, \u201cCity for Conquest\u201d; and John Ford\u2019s intermittently brilliant 1964 epic, \u201cCheyenne Autumn,\u201d is doing several things right in my book.As it happens, the two sites have the same parent company, Time Warner. Given how much fun it is to look for classics on services that retain such distinct personalities, I\u2019m glad that corporate synergy doesn\u2019t always go too far.Advertisement"}
