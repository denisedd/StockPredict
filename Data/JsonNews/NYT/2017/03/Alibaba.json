{"Headline": "Snap Is Said to Have Worked on a Drone", "Date": "2017-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySnap has long been known as the maker of Snapchat, an app that sends disappearing messages, photographs and videos. But over the past few years, the company has repositioned itself as a modern-day camera company.One of the products that Snap has worked on to bolster that direction is a drone, according to three people briefed on the project who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential. A drone could help Snap\u2019s users take overhead videos and photographs, and then feed that visual data to the company.It is unclear when or if Snap\u2019s drone would become available to consumers. Like many technology companies, Snap often works on experiments, many of which are killed or repurposed into other projects. A Snap spokeswoman declined to comment.The drone gives a glimpse into what kind of future products Snap may be considering, which would affect the company\u2019s growth. How the company plans to grow is on the minds of investors as Snap goes public this week. Snap priced its initial public offering on Wednesday and the stock is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, in what is set to be the biggest technology I.P.O. since the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba in 2014.\u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of what cameras can do,\u201d Mr. Spiegel told viewers of the video.When Spectacles appeared, Snap faced questions from critics about why it would enter the realm of hardware products. The product is designed to make taking videos a fun and seamless part of everyday life, which dovetails with the company\u2019s goal of getting users to feed Snapchat a steady stream of images and videos.\u201cWe believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way that people live and communicate,\u201d Snap said in its public offering prospectus. \u201cOur products empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rival Bid for MoneyGram Puts Jack Ma in an Awkward Spot", "Date": "2017-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAnt Financial\u2019s march may be worth slowing down. A $1 billion offer for MoneyGram from Euronet Worldwide improves on the deal it reached earlier this year with the payments affiliate of Jack Ma\u2019s e-commerce colossus Alibaba. The interloper is in the rare position of having a couple of important advantages over the deep-pocketed Chinese entrepreneur.The financial transaction provider Euronet\u2019s offer is 15 percent higher than Ant\u2019s proposal. It\u2019s also 38 percent more than the three-month volume-weighted average of MoneyGram\u2019s stock price before it disclosed the sale plan.Unlike Ant, Euronet, valued at $4.4 billion, can lop off some costs \u2014 about $60 million within two years, Euronet estimates. Once taxed, discounted and capitalized, those savings are worth some $380 million today. That gives Michael J. Brown, chief executive of Euronet, another $100 million or so of firepower before any purely financial argument for the deal starts looking like a stretch.Moreover, the Kansas-based Euronet ought to have an easier regulatory path to closing a deal with MoneyGram, a 77-year-old money transfer firm. Because of the sensitive nature of moving money across borders, Ant, which is based in China, could face a review from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. That opaque process can be long and tedious. The committee\u2019s deal rejections sometimes surprise would-be merger partners.The rival bid puts Mr. Ma in an awkward spot. He wants Ant to get a toehold in the United States, and MoneyGram, based in Dallas, presents a manageable way to do so. MoneyGram\u2019s larger rival, Western Union, probably would cost at least $12 billion, assuming a 20 percent premium. Ant, which recently arranged to borrow $3 billion, may not have the firepower, especially with the Chinese government making it harder to get money out of the country.Leaving empty-handed isn\u2019t exactly Mr. Ma\u2019s style. Ant, however, is planning a much-awaited initial public offering. That would give it additional currency to strike deals. Potential new investors might even admire the patience and financial discipline.Advertisement"}

CEFC gets a ready-made springboard into high finance in the United States.It is the latest example of surging amounts of Chinese investment targeting overseas companies, especially American ones. Chinese firms made 173 deals targeting American businesses in 2016, according to data compiled by the research firm Dealogic, for a total value of $67.8 billion, more than the total for the six previous years.But the strategy is not a sure bet. Previous attempts by Chinese companies to penetrate American financial services have come under regulatory scrutiny or struggled to generate hoped-for financial returns, though Cowen\u2019s chairman, Peter Cohen, said he viewed his deal as \u201cpretty benign\u201d from a regulatory standpoint.The two companies said in a statement that they wanted to use complementary areas of expertise and geographical focus to expand Cowen\u2019s core equity, research and investment banking businesses.Cowen executives said that because the deal involved only a minority stake and was focused on financial services, not normally seen as a sensitive industry, they were confident it would pass muster with American regulators.\u201cWe\u2019re not a defense contractor or technology business or chip maker,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in a telephone interview from Shanghai. He said because CEFC would take a minority stake, the management of Cowen would retain \u201ccomplete autonomy in the day-to-day running of the business.\u201dCEFC has risen rapidly in Chinese energy and finance \u2014 two industries dominated by government interests \u2014 since it was founded in 2002 by Ye Jianming.

{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Leads Marketers Down a Tricky Path", "Date": "2017-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingAs the hype around virtual reality pushes its way into the mainstream, big brands are increasingly looking for ways to incorporate it into their marketing. Yet there are also pitfalls \u2014 from cost to tepid audience reaction \u2014 that make the decision to enter the virtual reality world a bit more complicated than it may first seem.\u201cYou don\u2019t jump at every shiny new object,\u201d said Mike Bloxham, a senior vice president at Frank N. Magid Associates, a market research and consulting firm.Virtual reality videos, which give users a sense of being transported to another place, where they can walk around and interact with that environment, often start at $500,000 each to make, according to Forrester Research. And if a company tries to trim back on some of the niceties with an eye toward the budget, the target audience can quickly take note.\u201cWhy would you do something in V.R. that you could do easier in real life?\u201d asked Stephanie Llamas, a vice president at SuperData, which provides data for the digital gaming industry.The key, marketers and researchers said, is connecting with people emotionally and offering them an experience they wouldn\u2019t normally have in the real world.\u201cIt\u2019s about the adventure,\u201d not pushing products, said Kyle Taylor, a partner at Fact & Fiction, an advertising agency based in Boulder, Colo.It wasn\u2019t about selling beer, said Ari Kuschnir, the founder of M_ss_ng P_eces, the production and entertainment company that produced the video. \u201cIt was about taking you on a journey and making you feel something.\u201dMr. Taylor\u2019s firm created a virtual reality experience for the forthcoming opening of the Evel Knievel Museum in Topeka, Kan., in which people can sit on a Harley Davidson, put on a virtual reality helmet and virtually jump over 18 police cars.\u201cTo give that experience, that jolt of adrenaline\u201d is unique, he said, adding that \u201cnobody in their right mind is ever going to do that\u201d in the real world.Sometimes companies experiment with augmented reality, which drops virtual objects into a viewer\u2019s field of view, and 360-degree videos, which show all angles of a scene but don\u2019t allow interaction, before diving into the more expensive world of virtual reality. A 360 video generally costs between $10,000 and $100,000.\u201cFolks were feeling that nobody really understood what it was like to go through a migraine,\u201d said Scott Yacovino, senior brand manager of Excedrin at GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. \u201cThis video accomplished this in a way that regular ads could not.\u201dExcedrin sales rose 10 percent after the campaign in 2016, Mr. Yacovino said, compared with a 1.5 percent industrywide increase.Certain sectors, like travel and entertainment, have had the most success with virtual reality advertising.Marriott International was an early \u2014 and successful \u2014 adoptee of virtual reality with its Teleporter booths in 2014. Guests, fitted with Oculus Rift headsets, would step into the booth and be virtually transported to far-flung cities \u2014 from a black sand beach in Maui to the top of Tower 42 in London. The booth also featured blasts of wind, heat and mist to deepen the physical experience.\u201cV.R. helped us tell a story and inspired people to travel,\u201d said Karin Timpone, Marriott\u2019s global marketing officer.This summer, Marriott will roll out its latest venture: an \u201cIn the Moment\u201d series of virtual reality videos on social media, which take people on hosted tours of Marriott Properties and its reward program\u2019s \u201cOnce-in-a-Lifetime\u201d events.And then there is the N.B.A., which in September released \u201cFollow My Lead: The Story of the 2016 N.B.A. Finals,\u201d a 25-minute virtual reality documentary. Viewers got so close they could see the sweat on the face of Cleveland Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue.\u201cIt was access that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be available unless you\u2019re LeBron James,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where it becomes extremely powerful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It could also portend a potential stock offering, which Ant Financial is considering.The two companies, along with Tencent, are going head to head in a lucrative market where Chinese internet companies are finding success with payment services and other online financial products that cater to an expanding middle class with increasing digital fluency. Such companies have been able to stake their claims online in a country where state-run banks have been slow to innovate and regulation has been slow to adapt to digital entrants.Along with its core payment platform for consumers and companies, JD Finance is venturing into credit scoring and loans. It has teamed up with China UnionPay, the state-backed financial company, to work on online payments, credit cards and rural financing programs.The spinoff will allow JD Finance to move more aggressively. A separate payments business, with only Chinese investors, can apply for certain financial licenses, enabling JD Finance to offer products that invest in securities and mutual funds.Online finance has been a popular industry for investors.Under the terms of the deal for JD Finance, investors agreed to pay JD.com 14.3 billion renminbi, or about $2.1 billion, for a 28.6 percent stake in JD.com. JD.com, which will lose control of the company, will still have access to 40 percent of future profits.Richard Liu, the chief executive and chairman of JD.com, will buy a 4.3 percent stake in JD Finance and will still have voting rights in the separate company. Josh Gartner, a JD.com spokesman, said the investors were a combination of new and old investors, but the company would not disclose them.JD.com did not say how the proceeds from the sale would be spent. But Mr. Gartner noted that the company had been investing in logistics and technology that support its e-commerce operations.JD.com, on Thursday, reported a net loss of 1.7 billion renminbi, or $240 million, for the fourth quarter of 2016, down from the 7.6 billion renminbi loss it reported for the same period the previous year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s Ride-Hailing Giant, Holds Talks With SoftBank", "Date": "2017-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Didi Chuxing, a company in China that last year bested Uber in that huge ride-sharing market, is in negotiations to get SoftBank of Japan to take part in a multibillion-dollar investment round, according to people familiar with the talks.Still, executives at the company have said that they harbor international ambitions, and it is pushing aggressively to catch up in the development of driverless car technologies. A deal with SoftBank is also intended to increase Didi Chuxing\u2019s value, said one of the people familiar with the talks.The fund-raising efforts by Didi Chuxing show how foreign investors currently value dominance in China, an internet market largely closed to foreign competition that has the largest smartphone-using populace in the world. A new multibillion-dollar round would also put Didi roughly on par with the total funds raised by Uber. It has also raised money at home from the two biggest internet companies in China: Alibaba, an e-commerce giant, and Tencent, a games and social media conglomerate.Didi Chuxing\u2019s longer-term expansion is likely to be closely watched as a touchstone of the prospects of China\u2019s homegrown internet champions. The company has a number of high-profile investors, both Chinese and foreign, and whether it develops important technology for autonomous cars or is able to expand into other markets will become a new barometer for the abilities of companies that have grown large in China\u2019s relatively isolated market.Along with receiving a bigger valuation, analysts said Didi would most likely use the money to invest in next-generation technology, like autonomous vehicles, and potentially also on international expansion, though the company has so far done little outside its domestic market.Yet even as it speeds ahead with technology, Didi has faced a more prosaic challenge at home. New rules in China that have required drivers in some of the country\u2019s biggest cities to have registration documents have pinched the company\u2019s ability to respond to customer demand.Regulations have \u201chad a direct impact on the supply of cars,\u201d said Xue Yu, a senior analyst at IDC, a market research firm.\u201cFor customers, it will be a lot more difficult to order a car than before the new regulations were announced,\u201d Mr. Xue said. \u201cThis has largely raised the operation costs for Didi.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing, and Jonathan Soble contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

Several Taobao shops sell copies of various Vintage Industrial tables, including one with A-shaped legs and another with a glass top and propeller-like base, as well as cabinets and a metal locker.\u201cIt just keeps going and going and going,\u201d Mr. Hankerson, 45, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to pick weeds on a 70-acre farm.\u201dBut Mr. Hankerson wants to know why Alibaba doesn\u2019t do more to defeat counterfeiting, which damages the very same small businesses Mr. Ma says he intends to aid.Mr. Ma \u201cis making himself look like someone you can trust,\u201d Mr. Hankerson said. But, he added, his company is selling counterfeit products.That leaves many businesses, big and small, wondering why it has such a hard time finding fakes on its sites. Its online system for reporting counterfeits, many say, is cumbersome and prone to hiccups. Against one of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms, Mr. Hankerson employs his iMac, $74-a-month image-searching software, his phone and a lot of time \u2014 sometimes, he says, 12 hours a day.Yet if he doesn\u2019t invest the effort, he worries that a flood of cut-rate replicas could undermine the future of his business. Shops on Alibaba \u2014 shops that sometimes sell outside China \u2014 offer their copies at a fraction of Mr. Hankerson\u2019s prices. One Taobao store sold a version of his A-frame table, with a starting price of $5,295, for $24.\u201cIf this gets out of hand, people are going to be able to buy our stuff for next to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be devastating for us.\u201dAlibaba has long faced accusations that its sales platforms are a haven for fakes, and big organizations have been effective at bringing the problem to the fore.In a report submitted to the U.S.T.R. in October, Alibaba boasted about the technology and resources it uses to clean counterfeits from its platforms. The company says its systems are powerful enough to scan 10 million product listings each day. As a result, Alibaba said, it proactively removed 380 million suspect product listings in one 12-month period.\u201cThere are few companies (indeed, none, to our knowledge) that have taken the combination of steps Alibaba has taken, and has concrete plans to take, and certainly none that have put in place measures on the scale of Alibaba\u2019s,\u201d the company told the U.S.T.R.Alibaba also argues that many of the complaints against it are unfair. Counterfeiting and piracy are widespread in the Chinese economy. As private businesspeople, Mr. Ma and his team cannot shut down the culprits producing fake goods.Additionally, Alibaba suggests that it has been made into a scapegoat. In a statement in December, the company protested that the U.S.T.R. decision \u201cleads us to question whether the U.S.T.R. acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate\u201d \u2014 presumably referring to heightened anti-China sentiment amid last year\u2019s United States presidential election.The U.S.T.R. and industry experts contend that there is a lot more Alibaba could and should be doing to tackle fakes.\u201cThey are a leading technology company,\u201d said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, which represents many brands hurt by counterfeiting. \u201cIt is our hope that they use this technology to develop solutions and make sure those solutions are available for everybody.\u201dFor small enterprises, fighting fakes on Alibaba\u2019s sites \u201ccan become expensive, it can become frustrating, it can take time away from your sales, marketing and other creative endeavors,\u201d Mr. Lamar said.An Alibaba spokesman said that suggestions that small businesses do not get its attention are \u201cfalse\u201d and that they can qualify for the streamlined process if their submissions prove reliable. He added that its process for removing suspect listings is in place to address the large number of fraudulent claims the firm receives.\u201cThere are places that our systems can be improved to make them more effective, efficient and user-friendly,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are working hard every day to make these improvements a reality.\u201dMichelle Stennett, 38, a jewelry maker in Suwanee, Ga., found out counterfeiters had stolen her designs during a trip to Yiwu in eastern China in 2012 to buy supplies. Upon returning home, Ms. Stennett scoured Alibaba.com \u2014 an Alibaba platform that sells around the world \u2014 and discovered shop after shop selling copies of her wares.She first tried contacting the stores directly, ordering them to take down the offending goods. Some complied, but others didn\u2019t. Next she filed a couple of complaints to Alibaba, asking the firm to remove the copies. Although those were successful, she quickly realized that the scale of the problem and the paperwork Alibaba required were too much for her to handle as a one-person business.\u201cThere was no way I could go through the process,\u201d she said. There were \u201ctoo many.\u201dDespondent, Ms. Stennett said she stopped making jewelry for nearly a year. \u201cIf someone is going to take my design and mass-produce it, it is hard for me to compete with them,\u201d she said. When she resumed, in 2013, she decided to source her components only from American suppliers, hoping to make it harder for counterfeiters to replicate her products.Now Ms. Stennett rarely checks Alibaba, afraid of what she\u2019ll find. After a quick search of Alibaba.com one day in March, she spotted an image of one of her pendants, which she reported to Alibaba. It is no longer on the platform, but she said she still does not have time to hunt for fakes.\u201cYou\u2019re losing out on money,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause time is money.\u201dAlibaba did not respond to a request for comment on Ms. Stennett\u2019s predicament.Last year, a friend told her that she had found her designs being sold by a store in Australia. Confused, Ms. Long contacted the proprietor, who informed her she had purchased the clothing on Alibaba.com and had no idea the designs were originally from Reignland. Ms. Long looked at the Alibaba shop and was shocked to find a picture of her own son, one of the models in her promotional material, being used to peddle fakes of her clothing.Ms. Long did not know she could ask Alibaba for assistance in removing these counterfeits. Instead, she contacted several shops, which, in some cases, have cooperated and removed the offending products. But Ms. Long blames the spread of copies from Alibaba for the sudden decline in sales of one of her best-selling products, a pair of children\u2019s pants.A few months ago, she had been selling about 30 a week, she said. Now, she moves only five a month.Mr. Hankerson had worked at his father\u2019s financial firm and in I.T. services, building websites, before he began tinkering with furniture.He unexpectedly started Vintage in 2009, when his wife said she wanted a new patio table. Mr. Hankerson hammered one together and posted a picture on a website. He began making more tables and advertising them on the internet, too. \u201cI loved the experience so much that I just wanted to make a better table,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a mad artist.\u201dToday, the Vintage factory is abuzz with the sounds of welding, sawing and hammering. There is one nod to modern automation \u2014 a recently acquired computerized steel-cutting machine \u2014 but much of the manufacturing is done by specially trained employees with woodworking or metalworking skills.While his business was quickly growing, Mr. Hankerson had no idea counterfeiters were profiting off his work as well.He first learned he had a problem in 2014, when he spotted an advertisement on Facebook that included a photo of one of his A-frame tables. He contacted the seller, who said she had bought the merchandise from elsewhere. Intrigued and worried, Mr. Hankerson began searching for images of his designs using Google, and he discovered many of them around the web.\u201cYou would find one image, and you go and look at their catalog on Alibaba, and there\u2019s another and another and another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going down the rabbit hole.\u201dMany shops promote these fakes with pictures lifted from Mr. Hankerson\u2019s own website. One photo bouncing around Taobao features a Vintage console with framed snapshots of Mr. Hankerson and his family still hanging on the wall above it.Some Taobao sellers admit they get their designs from Mr. Hankerson. Liao Xiaoting, a customer service provider at Shang Jie Crafts Company, said her firm\u2019s designers use them as \u201creference\u201d to make their own furniture, with changes, mainly to the materials.Huang Geqing, proprietor of a Taobao shop called Creative Iron Factory, said that he copies Vintage\u2019s designs, manufactures replicas in Fujian province in eastern China, and uses Mr. Hankerson\u2019s photos to promote his own products. He first found Vintage\u2019s designs marketed on other Taobao stores, then traced them back to the original source.Mr. Huang estimates 100 shops may be selling fakes of Mr. Hankerson\u2019s furniture. The style \u201cis quite popular in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can make something exactly like it.\u201dMr. Hankerson said he had no idea how many of these fakes can be found outside of China. Though some of these likely counterfeits have been on Taobao, which has primarily Chinese users, he has also spotted them on the globally focused Alibaba.com.One furniture maker in India, Raja Rani Art Handicrafts, said two pieces of furniture it sells on Alibaba.com are based on Mr. Hankerson\u2019s designs. \u201cThis design is from Vintage Industrial, but we also manufacture the same design in our company,\u201d said Bobby Shukhla, who answered queries from The New York Times.Mr. Hankerson tried contacting sellers directly, asking them to take down his images. Most of them complied. He was also encouraged when Alibaba staff members removed all of the photos he targeted on Alibaba.com through its infringement-fighting process.But then he ran into difficulties. Last year, the website through which he could send Alibaba requests to remove suspect listings stopped working. He tried submitting and resubmitting the required paperwork on the site, even on different computers, only to have it return error messages.An Alibaba spokesman, in written responses, said that in October the company started an improved online system through which companies and people can report possible infringement on any of its platforms. He said that Mr. Hankerson has not tried to use this new system. Mr. Hankerson said he had but could not get it to work.Mr. Hankerson decided to step up his efforts. In August, he sent emails to Alibaba\u2019s investor and public relations departments threatening to raise a public ruckus about fakes on its sites.A manager at Alibaba\u2019s intellectual property protection department reached out. Mr. Hankerson handed over lists of more than 400 suspect images, only some of which were removed. Many of them, Mr. Hankerson was informed, were on a different Alibaba system and had to be removed through a separate process, which has not yet been undertaken.He argued that he shouldn\u2019t have to go to such lengths to get Alibaba to act. Once Alibaba has been made aware of his company\u2019s intellectual property, he said, the firm should proactively prevent additional postings of his photos or clean any suspect products from its platforms. Yet despite Alibaba\u2019s boast to the U.S.T.R., combing the millions of listings could be difficult or expensive.\u201cIt should be click and forget,\u201d he said. \u201cOur products should never be on their site.\u201dAn Alibaba spokesman said the company had tried to work with Mr. Hankerson to remove his images and resolve his technical problems. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the primary responsibility of protecting a brand rests with the brand itself,\u201d the spokesman wrote in an email.Additionally, Alibaba disputes the idea that it tolerates fakes. Intellectual property infringement \u201churts Alibaba\u2019s business and reputation,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether the infringement is against big brands or small companies.\u201dMr. Hankerson remains unmollified. He is talking to lawyers about his options and is trying to rally other small-business owners to the cause.\u201cThey want to have all those counterfeits,\u201d he said, \u201cand they want to make money off of it.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about American small businesses\u2019 fighting counterfeits on Alibaba\u2019s sales platforms misstated the Chinese company\u2019s relationship with a popular online payment system in China. The system, Alipay, is owned by a company controlled by Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman, not by Alibaba itself.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump-SoftBank-Saudi Connection", "Date": "2017-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAs camera lights flashed, President-elect Donald J. Trump strode across the lobby of Trump Tower with Masayoshi Son, the colorful Japanese entrepreneur, in December.The photo op was intended to be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign.This is not a secret to anyone who has been paying even a modicum of attention to the news that has dribbled out about the fund.While Mr. Son has pledged to provide a quarter of the fund himself, hardly any of the money comes from investors in the United States \u2014 with the exception of several nominal $1 billion investments, including from Apple, Qualcomm and Larry Ellison of Oracle.Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Mr. Son, and therefore Saudi Arabia, to take over some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most promising companies and intellectual property could be seen as being at odds with his nationalistic talk.\u201cWould you take money from the Saudis?\u201d Sean Hannity of Fox News asked him last year.\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, without missing a beat.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Riyadh. \u201cCrooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Facebook. \u201cI am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!\u201dThose references were made in the context of politics, but should they also extend to business?This column isn\u2019t taking a position on the politics or the morality of taking money from Saudi Arabia. But it is a conversation that is worth having.Just as the United States has tried to become energy independent from the Middle East for economic and political reasons, we may be on the verge of taking the opposite tack when it comes to our innovative start-ups.While Mr. Trump wants to stimulate foreign investment in the United States, he has also talked tough about the Middle East and terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were citizens of Saudi Arabia.In true Trumpian style, he has made somewhat contradictory statements about Saudi Arabia: \u201cSaudi Arabia \u2014 and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a campaign stop. \u201cThey spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\u201dSaudi Arabia\u2019s laws are antithetical to many Americans and even to Mr. Trump\u2019s most conservative views: Women are not allowed to drive, homosexuality is punishable by stoning to death, and freedom of religion is not permitted.Which makes it all the more surprising that when Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince, came to California last year, a who\u2019s who of technology and venture capital chief executives lined up to meet with him. The tour included meetings with Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and venture capital investors like Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel.Or maybe it is not surprising if you take the view that an influx of cash from Saudi Arabia will most likely lift the valuations of all Silicon Valley companies. Cash is cash.In fairness to Mr. Trump, if he does want to bring huge investment sums to the United States, it is hard do that without involving some countries with which we have had complicated relationships. Some of the largest money is tied up in vast sovereign wealth funds.Not all of the $50 billion investment that Mr. Son pledged to make here is likely to come from SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, the one backed by Saudi Arabia. Some of it may come directly from SoftBank, which owns Sprint and is hoping to merge it with T-Mobile.All that said, can you imagine if Mr. Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower with Prince Mohammed talking about a $50 billion investment in the United States from Saudi Arabia?It\u2019s hard to see \u2014 but then again, we live in strange times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trendy Shanghai District Has Soccer Team With Glitter of Its Own", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The Chinese Super League season kicks off Friday, and ticket scalpers working Shanghai S.I.P.G. matches can\u2019t wait.\u201cThis should be the best season for business yet,\u201d said one of the many scalpers operating under the indifferent eye of security at the club\u2019s Asian Champions League match against Australia\u2019s Western Sydney Wanderers on Tuesday, one fist full of tickets and the other stuffed with renminbi. \u201cMore people are coming every year.\u201dFor a team that did not exist until a dozen years ago, the ability to attract more than 28,000 fans on a cold Tuesday evening in a city that offers plenty of entertainment alternatives was encouraging \u2014 for the team, for Shanghai and for Chinese soccer in general.\u201cI walk around now and the restaurant staff and owners want to ask you about the club and about the games,\u201d said Mads Davidsen, a Dane who joined S.I.P.G.\u2019s coaching staff in 2012. \u201cThat never used to happen. People are getting interested.\u201dDavidsen was sitting in the lobby of the Langham Hotel in the hip Xintiandi district. This part of town is not only home to the site of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921, but also more recently the center of a wave of trendy restaurants, antique stores and coffee shops spreading outward into the city.If a soccer culture can take root here, in China\u2019s cosmopolitan and cool commercial center, hometown of the former N.B.A. star Yao Ming, then it can anywhere in a country that has historically underachieved in the sport.In June, S.I.P.G. paid about $60 million to add the Brazilian striker Hulk from the Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg. In January, the barrel-chested Hulk was joined by his far more silky compatriot Oscar, who cost a similar amount when he was lured from the English powerhouse Chelsea.They will be led by the former Chelsea coach Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, who replaced Sven Goran Eriksson at S.I.P.G. in November and has pledged to deliver either the Chinese Super League title or an Asian Champions League crown.\u201cI\u2019ve promised the president that at the end of the season he would sleep with one trophy,\u201d Villas-Boas told reporters in mid-February. \u201cI hope that me and the players can give this special night to him at the end of the season.\u201dHis club\u2019s city rival, Shanghai Shenhua, could also challenge for silverware. The Blues finished fourth in 2016, a place below S.I.P.G., and bolstered their roster by bringing in the Argentine Carlos Tevez in January, reportedly making him the highest-paid player in the world at around $800,000 a week.\u201cWhat is our target for the season? The championship, every year all the way through to 2020,\u201d said Xu Jiayin, the chairman of Evergrande Group. \u201cThis year, our target is to win four titles: the Asian Champions League, the Chinese Super League, Chinese F.A. Cup and Chinese Super Cup.\u201dThe Chinese Super Cup was secured on Feb. 24, with a victory over last season\u2019s league runner-up, Jiangsu Suning. Based in Nanjing, Jiangsu was bolstered by signing the Brazilian stars Alex Teixeira and Ramires, for a combined total of about $80 million in 2016, and is expected to challenge again.Tianjin Quanjian has spent heavily on the former Brazilian striker Alexandre Pato and the Belgian international midfielder Axel Witsel, while Hebei C.F.F.C. finished seventh in 2016 and, under the former Real Madrid and Manchester City coach Manuel Pellegrini, has spent more than any team in the transfer window that closed this week.Most of the $105 million that Hebei invested went to Chinese players, who have become increasingly expensive as clubs are \u2014 under a rules change announced in January \u2014 restricted to fielding only three foreign players in any one game from a total quota of five.The teams with the best domestic talent, then, have the best long-term future, with Guangzhou Evergrande recently saying it wants a Chinese-only team by 2020. But in the short term, it is the famous foreign stars who make the headlines.That was clear on Tuesday when Hulk and Oscar starred as S.I.P.G. thrashed Western Sydney, 5-1. \u201cWe are now at a completely different level,\u201d Davidsen said.The main responsibilities for stars like Hulk and Oscar in China have not changed, Davidsen added. \u201cThey must improve the team on the pitch, lift the level of the current Chinese players and they must inspire youngsters to kick a ball,\u201d he said.There also might be a fourth: to excite the fans. Ahead of the new season, that is certainly the case in Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Money-Losing Snap Could Be Worth So Much", "Date": "2017-03-02", "News": "Common SenseTesting the upper limits of valuation, Snap\u2019s investors are betting on the kind of rapid growth that few, if any, companies have ever achieved.Supported byBy now, even most of us over 35 \u2014 old age, by Snapchat standards \u2014 are aware of the photo sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial America.Even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that self-destruct, or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow, turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts, you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $34 billion.At that price, Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook \u2014 not to mention such internet stalwarts as Google, Amazon and even Netflix \u2014 look like bargain-basement \u201cvalue\u201d stocks.Snap \u201clooks tremendously overvalued to me,\u201d said Brian Hamilton, a co-founder of Sageworks, a financial analysis and valuation firm.Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Snap as a \u201cfield of dreams.\u201d Even with rosy growth forecasts, \u201cat $22 billion, we\u2019re looking at a stock trading at five to eight times estimated revenues in 2020,\u201d he said before the valuation rose even higher. \u201cThe only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba, and they have massive scale. And both of them are profitable.\u201dMajor I.P.O.s of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992.So let\u2019s be generous and ignore profit. How about revenue? Snap said it generated $404 million in sales in 2016. A valuation of $34 billion is about 84 times revenue.That\u2019s six times as high as Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio, which is 14. It\u2019s 14 times as high as Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which trades at just over six times revenue. Amazon trades at a mere three times. Even high-flying Netflix trades at seven times.Compared with Snap, however, those are mature companies, whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as they\u2019ve aged. As Mr. Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry Gold put it in a recent note to clients: \u201cThere is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all. The sky\u2019s the limit and history is not a guide.\u201dTo justify a valuation of even $25 billion, \u201cyou have to make some very lofty assumptions,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cThey would need to grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent, which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly.\u201d He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the history of American business.But let\u2019s ignore revenue, too. This is social media, after all, where \u201cdaily active users\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d are the coins of the realm.And $1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for Snap. At $34 billion, each of Snap\u2019s daily active users is worth $215, six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for Instagram.As of January, Instagram reported 300 million daily active users. At $215 each, the Instagram app alone would be valued today at $64.5 billion.These are static numbers, and what Snap is selling investors is growth. According to Snap\u2019s prospectus, Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016, about the same as the year before. If it can pull that off again next year, it would reach an impressive 234 million users, though still short of Instagram.The Snapchat story \u201cis all about growth,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about economics.\u201dBut Snapchat\u2019s growth slowed sharply in last year\u2019s fourth quarter \u2014 just about the time Instagram started its own version of Stories, a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos. It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters.By comparison, 150 million Instagram users are now using its Stories feature. That\u2019s already nearly as many as Snapchat\u2019s entire user base.Maybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user, even if its user base doesn\u2019t grow all that much. It\u2019s currently generating an average of $5.83 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebook\u2019s North American average of $12.81, the MoffettNathanson analysis notes, suggesting plenty of room to grow.But even doubling revenue doesn\u2019t get Snap close to a Facebook valuation.There are, of course, superhigh revenue and user-growth assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuation.Still, very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels (and I looked for some). The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as $30 billion. But that\u2019s based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of $3.8 billion in 2018.Mr. Gold said some investors were buying into the I.P.O., but not to hold Snap for the long term. \u201cPeople are saying they\u2019ll wait for a valuation that\u2019s truly astronomical, and then take the other side of the bet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run into trouble over the next few quarters.\u201dDespite many of its somewhat juvenile features, at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate, substituting images for language. \u201cSnapchat has built a better mousetrap,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s engaging, and it\u2019s fun, especially for young people.\u201dThat\u2019s a story that obviously appealed to investors starving for the next hot social media company. Whether they\u2019ll want to cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains to be seen.\u201cThis looks and smells like Twitter to me,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time, if ever, before they see any meaningful appreciation.\u201dAbout the best Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Gold could come up with: Snap\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t \u201cpatently crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Wednesday in Shanghai, Airbnb unveiled a new Chinese name \u2014 Aibiying, which means \u201cwelcome each other with love\u201d \u2014 as well as efforts to increase local hiring and deals to draw visitors to Shanghai with offers such as behind-the-scenes visits to the Chinese opera.\u201cOur mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere,\u201d Brian Chesky, Airbnb\u2019s chief executive, said in Shanghai on Wednesday. \u201cIf we are going to achieve our mission of belonging anywhere, anywhere must include China, and anyone must include Chinese travelers.\u201dBut like other global tech firms with an eye on China, Airbnb faces challenges. Chief among them are domestic versions of the site, including Xiaozhu and another rival, Tujia, that offer more local listings. To counter Airbnb\u2019s advantage with cosmopolitan Chinese who may have used its service in New York, Paris or Tokyo, the competitors are taking big steps to educate other skeptical Chinese about renting out \u2014 and crashing in \u2014 a spare bedroom.The cultural barriers are significant. In a country where a home is for family or for investment and tourism is still relatively new for many, the idea of posting homes online for random guests to rent takes some getting used to.\u201cThere is a manager behind every property,\u201d said Kelvin Chen, the chief executive of Xiaozhu. \u201cWe still need time to educate our users.\u201dCrucially, like LinkedIn, another international hopeful in China, Airbnb complies with Chinese laws requiring it to keep Chinese data only on domestically based Chinese servers. That could expose it to requests from the Chinese surveillance authorities to track any of its users. Last year, Airbnb sent a message to its users in China informing them that data would be stored in the country.For Airbnb, which has only about 80,000 listings in China, its more than three million listings around the world put it in a strong position to cater to the millions of Chinese who travel overseas each year. It also has outreach efforts, like informational events for hosts and occasional promotions offering free photography for hosts with apartments they want to rent out.Natasia Guo, a longtime Airbnb host and entrepreneur in China, said most visitors tended to be younger, while the odd middle-aged guest did not seem to understand how the service was supposed to work. Of one 40-year-old guest, she said: \u201cHe treated my place like a hotel. And the reason I say that is he started smoking in the room.\u201d\u201cI think he was using one of our bowls as an ashtray,\u201d she said.Xiaozhu, which has about 140,000 listings, seeks to reassure hosts against such problems. It also works with the internet censorship department and the public security bureau, which helps weed out users with a criminal record. For the benefit of guests, it offers its own cleaning services as well as training events to teach hosts how to get along with customers and decorate their homes.Tujia, a competitor with more than 420,000 listings, more directly manages many of the apartments it showcases, either itself or through management firms. In some cases, it works with property developers sitting on unsold units. For those it does not manage, it conducts inspections and also maintains a blacklist of problematic guests. Many of Tujia\u2019s users stay for a longer period of time or use the properties for vacation.David Wang, 52, a Beijing resident, said his nephew first suggested renting out the spare room in his mother\u2019s courtyard house in the capital. But Mr. Wang\u2019s 89-year-old mother took some persuading. To assuage her concerns, the family segregated the room from the rest of the house, blocking the door to the courtyard, and created a new entryway from the road. Then they installed a closed circuit television. They listed the room on Xiaozhu, which provided linens, a picture frame, lamps, curtains and a small Ikea table.\u201cNow she is happy because every cent from the rent goes into her account,\u201d Mr. Wang said.The companies are counting on younger Chinese to catch on as both hosts and guests. \u201cChinese millennials are keen to have an authentic experience,\u201d said Jens Thraenhart, president of Digital Innovation Asia, which connects Asian tourism business with digital know-how.Zhu Jiamin, a 28-year-old from Shanghai, said he just started hosting on Airbnb, in part because of the positive experiences he had traveling overseas using the site and other services like Couchsurfing. He said he had no problem having long conversations with guests or sometimes showing them around. Other friends rent out apartments and pull out the stops to attract guests.\u201cThey have photos that are way too fancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe places are decorated with flowers, and some of them even hire models, some beautiful girls, for the photos.\u201dMr. Zhu said that he chose to focus more on having meaningful exchanges with people who stay at his place. \u201cYou just feel that their photos don\u2019t represent the people who live there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a home. It\u2019s a fancy place to take photos.\u201dMr. Sun, who received the pink cushions from Xiaozhu, said he had also come to enjoy the company of his guests and the income he received from them, which totals about $300 to $600 a month. One was a Sichuan cook brimming with gossip about the entertainment business. Another played mah-jongg.\u201cMah-jongg is my hobby,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the guests want to play mah-jongg, I get pretty excited.\u201dCao Li and Zhang Tiantian contributed research from Beijing, and Ailin Tang from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
