But similar strategies will be used as long as we let companies choose the location of their profits.A potential fix would be to allocate the taxable profits made by multinationals proportionally to the amount of sales they make in each country.Such a reform would quash artificial profit-shifting. Corporations may be able to shift around profits, assets, and subsidiaries, but they cannot move all their customers to Bermuda.One advantage of allocating taxable profits as I suggest is that this reform can be adopted unilaterally. There is no need for the United States (or any other nation that wants to cut down on tax avoidance) to obtain permission from anybody.But we\u2019d still face an equally daunting problem, the far more shadowy \u2013 and ultimately illegal \u2013 tax evasion of ultrawealthy individuals, many of them with net worths already bolstered by the proceeds of corporate tax avoidance. Here\u2019s an example.Meet Michael. Michael is the (fictional) chief executive and owner of an American company, Michael & Company. Like many people, he would like to pay as little in taxes as possible. But unlike most people, he can take some steps that will allow him to do just that.Michael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.Cayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsMichael & Co.AmericaAnonymous Shell Co. Inc.BankCyprusCayman IslandsThe transaction generates a paper trail that can appear legitimate at first glance. But the reality is more insidious. By paying for fictitious consulting, Michael fraudulently reduces the taxable profits of Michael & Company, and thus the amount of corporate income tax he pays.And once the money has arrived in Cyprus, it is invested in global financial markets and generates income that the Internal Revenue Service can tax only if Michael reports it or if his  Cypriot bank informs the I.R.S.And meanwhile, in America, if he wants to use any of the money stashed in Cyprus, he can simply go to an ATM and make a withdrawal from his offshore account.We can stop offshore tax evasion by shining some light on darker corners of the global banking industry. The most compelling way to do this would be to create comprehensive registries recording the true individual owners of real estate and financial securities, including equities, bonds and mutual fund shares.One common objection to financial registries is that they would impinge on privacy. Yet countries have maintained property records for land and real estate for decades. These records are public, and epidemics of abuse are hard to come by.The notion that a register of financial wealth would be a radical departure is wrong. And the benefits would be enormous, as comprehensive registries would make it possible to not only reduce tax evasion, but also curb money laundering, monitor international capital flows, fight the financing of terrorism and better measure inequality.The onus here is on the United States and the European Union. Why do we allow criminals, tax evaders and kleptocrats to ultimately use our financial and real estate markets to launder their wealth? Transparency is the first step in making sure the wealthy can\u2019t cheat their way out of contributing to the common good.Produced by Jessia Ma and Taylor AdamsAdvertisement"}

I don\u2019t look that suspicious, do I?Beyond the ads, though, did we learn anything new from the hearings?Anyway, my takeaway: The whole ordeal was mostly orchestrated pageantry \u2014 a way for lawmakers to give tech execs a very public, rather embarrassing dressing down \u2014 with a few new facts and insights scattered throughout. For one, all three companies said the reach of Russia-backed ads stretched much further than they had originally known. Facebook estimated some 150 million people were served the ads across Facebook and Instagram. That\u2019s a lot!But more than that, I found it fruitful that some members of Congress seemed to recognize the more pervasive issue of so-called organic content. That is, the posts that you and I and anyone else can create and post to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Those are much more difficult to track, and we still don\u2019t know the extent to which Russia-linked organic content spread across all of these platforms.I wonder if this contrition will be enough to head off any strong regulation. I suspect it will.Apple gave some outlets \u2014 including TechCrunch, Buzzfeed and Backchannel, which is part of Wired \u2014 a week with the device. But many others, including The Times, were given just a day with the new phones. Meanwhile, Apple also offered review devices to several YouTube stars and some out-of-left-field choices, like the political journalist Mike Allen.That year, Apple provided early review units to big print outlets \u2014 the Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Newsweek. In 2017, Apple has the pick of any outlet it wants; it knows that a review will get a lot of traffic on virtually any site, so it doesn\u2019t really matter whether it chooses an established media brand or some YouTuber with a fan base.Frankly, I agree! I don\u2019t really read traditional consumer reviews anymore, and I suspect the crowd for deep tech and gadgety reviews is growing smaller over time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The iPhone X Is Cool. That Doesn\u2019t Mean You Are Ready for It.", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixThe iPhone X is the best iPhone ever made. Many of you probably aren\u2019t ready for it.Here\u2019s why: Apple\u2019s newest iPhone takes a big leap from past models. It lacks a home button, which makes it less intuitive to use than previous iPhones. The device is also the first iPhone to feature a face scanner for unlocking it. And for many people who have developed 10 years of muscle memory from using iPhones a certain way, these may seem like abrupt changes.So is the iPhone X right for you? I tested the device for two days this week after Apple made it available to The New York Times. This was not an ideal length of time to discover all the pros and cons of the smartphone; in years past, we tested new iPhones for a week or more.Otherwise, there are plenty of cheaper smartphones with excellent features. And the iPhone X isn\u2019t perfect. Losing the home button will make it awkward to use for a while.And although the face scanner for unlocking the device is impressive and creepily accurate, in many situations, it didn\u2019t work as quickly as a fingerprint scanner. It also failed to unlock the phone when I wore a pair of Persol sunglasses.The iPhone X feels ahead of its time, perfect for a target audience of technology enthusiasts and obsessive photographers. Everyone else may want to wait awhile to buy.First, the basics: The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that is larger than the 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 8 Plus and the 4.7-inch screen on the iPhone 8. Yet the iPhone X\u2019s overall body is smaller than that of the iPhone 8 Plus (though a little bit larger than that of the iPhone 8).Apple managed to squeeze a larger screen onto a smaller body by eliminating the iPhone\u2019s bezel, which is the border surrounding the display. The screen takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing the infrared face scanner.In the process of removing the bezel, Apple also eliminated the home button. As a result, controlling the iPhone X mostly involves using touch gestures. When inside an app or unlocking the phone, swiping up from the bottom brings you to the home screen. That\u2019s simple, but other functions are trickier. To open the app switcher, a popular feature, you swipe up from the bottom and hold your finger for a second. Many times, I lifted my thumb too soon before opening this shortcut. (On past iPhones, you would just press the home button twice to open the app switcher.)Apple has included a shortcut on the phone called Reachability, which lowers the top of the screen to make it easier for one-handed users to reach for buttons or apps on the top row with their thumb. To engage it, swipe downward from the bottom of the screen. Yet it often took me multiple attempts to swipe the sweet spot before successfully opening it. It is much easier to use Reachability with other iPhones: you just tap the home button twice.I struggled with the new iPhone controls when I ran into a bug. One morning, the Amazon app was loaded on the screen \u2014 then it froze.I tried swiping up to leave the app, then holding two physical side buttons down to shut down the phone, but to no avail.I fumbled around for at least 10 minutes before I read a guide that revealed that pressing three physical buttons in a sequence would force a restart.These are troubling signs for how less technologically inclined people may respond to the iPhone X. For the last decade, the iPhone has been a computer that anyone can use without reading an instruction manual. With the iPhone X, that is no longer the case.Face ID continues to update this map of your face with more information every time you unlock your smartphone \u2014 whether you are wearing a scarf or a hat or growing facial hair. In addition, Face ID can authorize mobile payments, log in to apps and create animated emojis that mimic your face movements.I put Face ID through dozens of tests and it recognized my face in most situations, including when I wore a beanie, Ray-Ban sunglasses or goggles for my Halloween costume or draped a dog toy over my head. It worked in pitch dark at night and outside on a sunny day.But Face ID worked inconsistently \u2014 or not at all \u2014 when I lay the iPhone X flat on a table or my night stand, wore a gas mask for my Halloween costume, walked around in bright sunlight at a park or wore Persol sunglasses. (According to Apple, these particular sunglasses probably blocked the part of the infrared spectrum used by Face ID.) It also didn\u2019t work when I tried using the face scanner while slurping a bowl of noodles.To be fair, Touch ID sometimes failed to scan my fingerprint on previous iPhones, like when my hands were sweaty, damp or dirty. Over the long term, Face ID is likely to save more time than using Touch ID because Face ID only failed in rare circumstances.Before reviewing the iPhone X, I used an iPhone 8 Plus for two weeks for comparison. Both devices have a similar rear camera system with two lenses. The two cameras work together to show the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. Apple calls this Portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect.The dual-lens camera is extremely compelling, with Portrait mode making photos of even the most mundane things \u2014 like a bowl of ramen \u2014 look artistic and stunning. But the drawback was that the iPhone 8 Plus was so bulky that it was miserable to carry around and using the device with one hand felt impossible.That means the iPhone X\u2019s dual-lens camera and phone size may be a major draw for people. The iPhone X\u2019s camera is slightly better than the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus because one lens has a higher aperture to let in more light. As a result, Portrait mode photos looked better (subjects were even clearer in the foreground), and so did photos taken in low light.In terms of features, the iPhone X is the most impressive smartphone ever made. It\u2019s worth the $999 \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean you should buy it. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the iPhone X to my tech-crazed friends in Silicon Valley, but the iPhone 8 is just as fast while being simpler and more familiar to use.Then again, if you are willing to get up early to line up for a $999 phone, you are probably the target demographic for the iPhone X anyway. Make sure you wear something comfortable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Administration\u2019s Incoherent Stance on Competition", "Date": "2017-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPeter Thiel, Facebook\u2019s first outside investor, once wrote: \u201cCompetition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.\u201d Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice.If only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce.The incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don\u2019t forget that the Obama administration \u2014 at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market \u2014 brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books. That administration did not have a consistent view of media monopoly power that is enforced equally on all parties, and neither does the current one.For instance, internet service providers operate under a totally different set of privacy regulations than the online service providers (like Google and Facebook) that dominate the online advertising market. According to Morgan Stanley, Google and Facebook took an astonishing 85 percent of all new online ad revenue last year. And yet Google spends millions lobbying Congress to prevent any rivals from entering its unique surveillance capitalism business. Essentially, the government is giving a pass to the largest media advertising firms that have no restrictions on consumer privacy, while suing to block potential rival services that operate under strict privacy restrictions.Of course, being buried deep in Google\u2019s search results or being forced to pay Google for prominent placement hurts smaller firms. This is arguably no less harmful to a business than being forced to pay Verizon for good video quality for its streaming site \u2014 the fate that many content producers will meet if net neutrality rules are rolled back under the plan the F.C.C. has hinted at. It is what economists call \u201crent seeking,\u201d and it is a cancer on any open media system in any context, but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t treat it the same in all contexts.Mr. Trump is nothing if not sensitive to a populist uprising, and the net neutrality decision will probably be opposed on both the left and right. It could be that during the F.C.C.\u2019s comment period, the resistance to overturning net neutrality may be too strong and the ruling will be withdrawn.But that leaves the larger questions unanswered. What exactly would a consistent antitrust policy for the media sector look like? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicting signals from the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice?The answer is that regulators must realize where the real market power lies and use this as the basis for their decisions about competition. Time Warner\u2019s market capitalization is $70 billion. Google is worth 10 times as much, at $723 billion. Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner\u2019s largest advertising subsidiary, brought in $1.2 billion in ad revenue in the last quarter, while Google reported $22.5 billion in ad revenue in the same period. It should be noted that AT&T has almost no appreciable ad revenue. So, if there is to be a coherent approach to competition, the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates Google and Facebook, and the F.C.C., which regulates AT&T, must find common ground on the regulation of ad-supported content networks.For the Trump administration to try to block the merger of two relatively small media players while letting Google operate freely with no privacy restrictions is to be fighting the last war. The notion that television is the major media power in America ignores reality. It may be that the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has a decent case that internet service providers and content providers need some sort of separation. But if that is true, then the same rules on neutrality and consumer privacy need to apply to companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and the F.C.C. should keep net neutrality rules in place.The administration can\u2019t have it both ways.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Senators Want Answers on AT&T Negotiations", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood afternoon. Is the Justice Department under President Trump more willing to block mergers than previously thought? It may depend on the kind of transactions we\u2019re talking about. A group of senators sent a letter to the D.O.J. demanding answers as to whether President Trump is influencing the department\u2019s negotiations with AT&T. The latest developments in the tax overhaul remain on our minds, especially since the Senate is proposing delaying a cut to the corporate rate until 2019. More on all that in a moment.The senators continued:\u201cThese outstanding questions are especially concerning in light of yesterday\u2019s news reports. Multiple news sources have reported that the Department told the parties that they would need to divest CNN as a condition of completing the merger\u2026The President\u2019s views about the content of CNN\u2019s press coverage have no place in antitrust law enforcement. Should the Antitrust Division determine that AT&T\u2019s acquisition of CNN \u2013 as well as other Time Warner properties \u2013 raises antitrust concerns, Department enforcement action may be warranted. But political considerations based on the content of CNN\u2019s news coverage should never impact the Department\u2019s decision-making. Political interference in antitrust law enforcement is unacceptable. We hope that you share our views about the importance of maintaining the professionalism and independence of the antitrust enforcement agencies.\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMany, many deal makers believed that a Trump presidency would be good for mergers within the media and telecom industries. Companies felt the need to get bigger, thanks to ever-increasing competition \u2014 and much of the inspiration came from AT&T\u2019s planned $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. That was before this week.Think about how many deals are in the works, or that analysts say should be in the works. Sinclair is in the process of buying Tribune. Disney briefly held talks about buying most of 21st Century Fox. Sprint and T-Mobile are both single and potentially ready to mingle. And so on.Are Fox and Sinclair exempt? President Trump is a self-professed fan of all things Fox and personally close to Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch. We wonder if Fox tried to buy Time Warner again as they tried in 2014, could that deal actually be approved. Sinclair\u2019s news organization has also been quite supportive of President Trump. Does that facilitate a positive outcome to Sinclair\u2019s pending Tribune acquisition?The recent announcements about moderate Islam, the pervasive arrests, and the illusory hypermodern economic projects frame him as a ruthless modernizer, who is struggling to achieve too many things in too little time. But his motive is more about the consolidation of power than about corruption.Don\u2019t count on staying at the Ritz-Carlton anytime soonIn more Saudi newsBut some Republicans quietly say the loss of a few seats might be the price they have to pay for success to satisfy other constituents and business supporters hungry for a tax break.More tax notes____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________Mr. Cohn also committed to staying in the administration, even though he was passed over for Federal Reserve chairman.Thirteen newsmakers joined us at the DealBook conference on Thursday, and many made news. Here\u2019s what they said:Mr. Stephenson made that clear.

Is it, as some Trump critics suggest, an attack on a news outlet that the president has openly criticized? Or is it an attempt to break up a deal that has become a lightning rod for concerns about a rapidly consolidating media industry, perhaps rooted in the administration\u2019s populist tendencies?More food for thoughtMore accusations emerged yesterdayNot everyone is convinced that Wall Street firms will take over China, however, since state-run banks will remain powerful.\u201cGod only knows what it\u2019s doing to our children\u2019s brains.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Honey Nut Cheerios Healthy? We Look Inside the Box", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI had a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios recently. It\u2019d been awhile. Regular Cheerios are more my thing. But sometimes I finish my box faster than my kids do and find myself straying to their side of the cupboard.Honey Nut is America\u2019s best-selling breakfast cereal, and by a comfortable margin. Roughly 151 million boxes and other containers of various sizes were sold over the past year, well ahead of the second best-selling breakfast cereal, Frosted Flakes, according to IRI, a Chicago based market research firm.I had no idea. The only thing I could think about when I ate it again for the first time in years was how incredibly sweet it is. I looked at the back of the box and could see why. Three of the top six ingredients are sweeteners: sugar, brown sugar and honey.I asked General Mills about this, over a period of several days. They did not come to the phone, but responded with a series of communiqu\u00e9s.\u201cYou mentioned that three of the top six ingredients in Honey Nut Cheerios are sugar, brown sugar and honey,\u201d Mike Siemienas, a spokesman for the company, wrote in a statement. \u201cWhat you didn\u2019t mention is that the number one ingredient is oats. To be so singularly focused on one ingredient \u2014 sugar \u2014 is irresponsible and doesn\u2019t help consumers look at the total nutrition offered.\u201d\u201cThe company has capitalized on the good name of the original,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for years that Honey Nut Cheerios has more sugar than honey and more salt than nuts, in fact it\u2019s got no nuts at all, it\u2019s just got almond flavor.\u201dThe serving size of regular Cheerios remains one cup. If Honey Nut Cheerios still had a one cup serving size, the sugar content would be in the double digits.General Mills said little about what had happened, or when.\u201cThere are several reasons that changes in serving size may occur including recipe improvements that may change the density of the cereal or regulation changes,\u201d Mr. Siemienas wrote.Serving sizes are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and can change if a cereal\u2019s density changes. It appears that at some point in the last 10 or 15 years, General Mills tweaked the ingredients of Honey Nut Cheerios in a way that lowered the overall weight per serving, which had the effect of helping lower the stated sugar content. It has not been all smoke and mirrors; the percentage of sugar has decreased slightly as well, though rounding makes it difficult to say by how much.\u201cThey\u2019ve tested and tested and tested to try to find out how much sugar they can take out without it affecting sales,\u201d said Marion Nestle, an emerita professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. \u201cThey must surely be at the cut point.\u201dShe said \u201cyou really want\u201d kids \u201ceating a whole grain, higher fiber cereal.\u201dSpeaking for myself, I eat a lot more cereal than three-quarters of a cup. I poured that amount into a bowl. It looked sad. And small. It was an appetizer\u2019s worth of Cheerios.Don\u2019t worry, General Mills. I\u2019ll continue to eat Cheerios. But I had to have a difficult conversation with a 12-year-old recently. I broke the news that Honey Nut would not be returning to the cupboard.

{"Headline": "A New Phone Comes Out. Yours Slows Down. A Conspiracy? No.", "Date": "2017-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt happens every year: Apple releases new iPhones, and then hordes of people groan about their older iPhones slowing to a crawl.The phenomenon of perceived slowdowns is so widespread that many believe tech companies intentionally cripple smartphones and computers to ensure that people buy new ones every few years. Conspiracy theorists call it planned obsolescence.That\u2019s a myth. While slowdowns happen, they take place for a far less nefarious reason. That reason is a software upgrade.\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive for operating system companies to create planned obsolescence,\u201d said Greg Raiz, a former program manager for Microsoft who worked on Windows XP. \u201cIt\u2019s software, and software has various degrees of production bugs and unintended things that happen.\u201dThe technical process of upgrading from an old operating system to a new one \u2014 migrating your files, apps and settings along the way \u2014 is extremely complicated. So when you install a brand-new operating system on an older device, problems may occur that make everything from opening the camera to browsing the web feel sluggish.The good news is that because tech companies are not intentionally neutering your devices, there are remedies for when you think your three-year-old iPhone or your seven-year-old Windows computer has become slow or short-lived. Here\u2019s a guide to speeding up your troubled gadgets, based on interviews with information technology professionals and operating system experts.Tech companies make it simple to upgrade to a new operating system by pressing an \u201cupdate\u201d button, which seamlessly migrates all your apps and data over. While that\u2019s convenient, it isn\u2019t the best way to ensure that things will continue running smoothly.A better practice is backing up all your data and purging everything from the device before installing the new operating system. This \u201cclean install\u201d works more reliably because the engineers developing operating systems were able to test this condition more easily, Mr. Raiz said.Let\u2019s say, for example, you have an iPhone 6 with 100 apps installed, four email accounts and 2,000 photos. It is more likely that a quality-assurance engineer tested installing a new operating system on a blank iPhone 6, rather than an iPhone 6 with the same setup as yours.Sometimes you can do some light maintenance to speed up your device. Over the long term, an operating system accumulates system files, settings, logs and other data; I.T. experts call this \u201ccruft.\u201d This can bog down your device.Here\u2019s something many people don\u2019t realize: Just because your iPhone or Samsung phone has 64 gigabytes of storage doesn\u2019t mean you should fill it all the way up. The device will generally run faster if more of its storage is available.That\u2019s partly because your device needs space to move data around and download software updates. But it\u2019s also related to how the storage technology works inside smartphones and modern laptops.Smartphones and newer laptops rely on flash storage, which stores data in the cells of semiconductor chips. When data is stored on a flash drive, it is scattered across the drive. So when you are pulling data to open an app or a document, you are retrieving it from multiple parts of the drive. If lots of space is occupied, the data gets crowded and the device may feel sluggish.\u201cIf you fill these things up, it doesn\u2019t get to operate as well,\u201d said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. Mr. Denslow said a good rule of thumb is to buy more storage than you think you will use. If you think you are going to use 64 gigabytes on an iPad, for example, buy the 256-gigabyte model.Your device may seem slower for reasons unrelated to the device. Mr. Denslow, the technician, said many apps relied on an internet connection, so a shoddy Wi-Fi router might be the real bottleneck.\u201cInstead of spending $1,000 on a phone every year, spend $500 on networking,\u201d Mr. Denslow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, but it provides more benefits over a long period of time.\u201dAt the end of the day, there are many reasons your device may feel slow. New operating systems carry more powerful features that were designed to work better on new devices. In addition, developers of third-party apps typically prioritize making software for newer handsets, and sometimes they even discontinue support for old gadgets.

{"Headline": "After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "The Paradise PapersThe tech giant has found a tax haven in the island of Jersey, leaving billions of dollars untouched by the United States, leaked documents reveal.Supported byTim Cook was angry.\u201cWe pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,\u201d Mr. Cook declared at the hearing. \u201cWe don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe don\u2019t stash money on some Caribbean island.\u201dTrue enough. The island Apple would soon rely on was in the English Channel.Five months after Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.The previously undisclosed story of Apple\u2019s search for a new tax haven and its use of Jersey is among the findings emerging from a cache of secret corporate records from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that caters to businesses and the wealthy elite.The documents reveal how big law firms help clients weave their way through the gaps between different countries\u2019 tax rules. Appleby clients have transferred trademarks, patent rights and other valuable assets into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes. The rights to Nike\u2019s Swoosh trademark, Uber\u2019s taxi-hailing app, Allergan\u2019s Botox patents and Facebook\u2019s social media technology have all resided in shell companies that listed as their headquarters Appleby offices in Bermuda and Grand Cayman, the records show.\u201cU.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just U.S. tax collection but the tax collection of most every large economy in the world,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies who is now a law professor at the University of Southern California.Indeed, tax strategies like the ones used by Apple \u2014 as well as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and others \u2014 cost governments around the world as much as $240 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The disclosures come on the heels of last week\u2019s proposals by Republican lawmakers to provide several new tax benefits for multinational companies, including cutting the federal corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. President Trump has said that American businesses are getting a bad deal under current rules.But the documents show how major American companies find creative ways to avoid paying anything close to 35 percent.Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company\u2019s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, declined to answer most questions about the company\u2019s tax strategy. He did say that Apple had told regulators \u2014 in the United States and Ireland and at the European Commission \u2014 about the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries. \u201cThe changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cAt Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system.\u201dIn prepared statements, Allergan, Facebook, Nike and Uber said they complied with tax regulations around the world.Congressional Republicans are also seeking to impose a 10 percent tax on some of the profits that American businesses say are earned offshore \u2014 half the rate they are proposing for profits in the United States. The lawmakers have also proposed another break, permitting multinationals to bring home more than $2.6 trillion stowed offshore at sharply reduced tax rates. Both proposals, critics say, would only create additional incentives for businesses like Apple to shift more profits into island hideaways.Appleby is a member of the global network of lawyers, accountants and bankers who set up or manage offshore companies and accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances a secret from authorities, business partners or even spouses. The firm did not respond to questions from The Times about its work for Apple or other companies.Tax authorities have challenged several of the offshore structures maintained by Appleby and Estera, a spinoff of the law firm\u2019s corporate services business. Nike won a fight over back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service a year ago; a similar dispute between the I.R.S. and Facebook is continuing.European regulators are trying to force countries including Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to collect back taxes from big companies that relied on offshore arrangements. Apple is being pursued for $14.5 billion in back taxes after European regulators ruled that its old tax structure amounted to illegal state aid from the Irish government.Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions \u2014 mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s population.Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.In May 2013, the Senate\u2019s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared \u201ctax residency\u201d nowhere in the world.Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is \u201cmanaged and controlled\u201d abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.\u201cApple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,\u201d then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.Ireland\u2019s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country\u2019s policies: \u201cI do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.\u201d Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.\u201cFor those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,\u201d wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby\u2019s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. \u201cThey also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.\u201dIn building Apple\u2019s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was \u201ca tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.\u201dBaker McKenzie\u2019s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby\u2019s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.\u201cConfirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,\u201d the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: \u201cAre there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?\u201d(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, \u201cAs a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.\u201d)Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby\u2019s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.But the plan to use Jersey faced a potential snag: In mid-2014, again under pressure from other governments, Irish ministers explored ending a tax shelter known as the \u201cdouble Irish,\u201d used by scores of companies, including the Appleby clients Allergan and Facebook, as well as Google, LinkedIn and other businesses.The double Irish allows companies to collect profits through one subsidiary that employs people in Ireland, then route those profits to an Irish mailbox subsidiary that is a tax resident of an offshore haven like Bermuda, Grand Cayman or the Isle of Man.Irish officials explored a ban on Irish companies claiming tax residency in tax havens. Executives at Allergan \u2014 which had used a double Irish for at least a decade, records show \u2014 tried to derail the rule change. Terilea Wielenga, then Allergan\u2019s head of tax, was also international president of the Tax Executives Institute, a trade group. She argued to the Irish finance ministry in July 2014 that any such changes should occur slowly.The campaign seemed to work. \u201cFor existing companies, there will be provision for a transition period until the end of 2020,\u201d Mr. Noonan declared in October 2014. The gradual phase-in would apply not just to existing companies but to any new ones created by December of that year.This gave Apple just enough time. By the end of the year, Jersey had become the new tax home of the Irish companies Apple Sales International and Apple Operations International.But a third Apple subsidiary, Apple Operations Europe, became resident in Ireland.Apple would not say why. But tax experts offer one possible reason. While media attention focused on Ireland\u2019s crackdown on the double Irish, officials announced a new measure: The country expanded its tax deductions for companies that move rights to intellectual property \u2014 like patents and trademarks \u2014 into Ireland. If an Irish company spent $15 billion buying such rights, even from a fellow subsidiary, it could claim a $1 billion tax deduction each year for 15 years.Apple declined to say whether it has availed itself of the new benefit.But J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor and former I.R.S. official who reviewed the Appleby documents, concluded that there was a strong possibility the company moved intellectual property into Ireland to take advantage of the generous tax rules. Based on Apple\u2019s American securities filings, he estimated that the transfer was worth about $200 billion.That would mean that any income that Apple now generates in Ireland could be partially offset by more than $13 billion in tax deductions each year for 15 years.Apple\u2019s hunt for a tax haven is a familiar tale, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, who also reviewed the Appleby documents.\u201cThis is how it usually works: You close one tax shelter, and something else opens up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes on endlessly.\u201dSimon Bowers is a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can You Draw the Starbucks Logo Without Cheating? Probably Not.", "Date": "2017-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Apple logo was green. The symbol for Foot Locker was a sneaker. And Starbucks? The famous siren on every frappuccino and chai latte was not exactly the friendliest-looking sea dweller.When 156 people were recently asked if they could draw some of the world\u2019s most iconic brand logos from memory, some of their recreations were laughably off the mark. But something wasn\u2019t so funny for the companies that have tried to sear their brands into the minds of consumers everywhere: For 10 iconic brands including Wal-Mart, Burger King, and Ikea, the overall percentage of near-perfect drawings was just 16 percent.That means fewer than one-fifth of the participants could remember the correct positioning of the familiar blue-and-red rectangle of Domino\u2019s, or the three black stripes of Adidas. Even Target \u2014 whose emblem involves a simple red bull\u2019s-eye above the brand name \u2014 confused people: 41 percent forgot the number of circles.\u201cPeople spend so much on marketing to get people to recognize and remember their brand,\u201d said Nelson James, co-founder and chief operating officer of the e-commerce site Signs.com, which led the study. \u201cWe just wanted to know \u2014 does it work?\u201dThe answer is that being able to recognize a logo and being able to recreate it appear to be vastly different things. Although participants thought they had a good grasp on the designs, expressing confidence that they could redraw them without seeing them, their actual reproductions proved otherwise.Logos are what companies use to help customers identify the brand, and choices like design, color and font are \u201ccritical,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cHaving these logos where you can\u2019t correctly recall details means something.\u201dIn an age of digital saturation, perhaps many of these carefully constructed logos are not as memorable as we think. A study conducted in 2014 by psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles similarly asked 85 participants if they could draw the familiar Apple logo from memory. More than half the subjects even identified themselves as strictly Apple users. Yet only one could draw the icon perfectly, as scored by a 14-point rubric.Should Apple be worried? Not necessarily. Dr. Alan Castel, a psychology professor who was one of the authors of the study, said that the inability to accurately recall such daily ephemera as a brand logo really might be a beneficial quirk of our memory system.\u201cWe don\u2019t burden our memory with things we don\u2019t need to know,\u201d Dr. Castel said. He referred to a famous study in 1979 by the psychologists Raymond Nickerson and Marilyn Jager Adams, in which participants were asked to draw the face of a penny. Most struggled.\u201cIt\u2019s rare that you really need to recall something from memory,\u201d Dr. Castel said. \u201cYou simply recognize it, you see it on an item or a computer. You like it, you buy it.\u201dStill, in recent years, brands like Uber, YouTube, and Dropbox have redesigned their logos, trying to make them more simple, more intuitive or more easily recognizable. In 2014, Airbnb announced its new logo, which it calls the B\u00e9lo, in a video that noted that the design was easy for customers to draw.Paul Stafford, co-founder of DesignStudio, the agency that led the rebranding effort, said that Airbnb envisioned people renting out their homes and putting their own spin on the B\u00e9lo \u2014 on everything from magazines to bathrobes and shampoo bottles, like a hotel.\u201cWe had to create something that was so simple that everybody could draw it and interpret it themselves,\u201d Mr. Stafford said. \u201cThey also wanted people to be sharing it. Right down to the people tattooing the mark on their arms.\u201dMr. Stafford, however, said that he did not think that being able to draw a logo necessarily indicates how well it resonates.People often see logos so much that they feel like they know it. But they rarely critique it or study it enough to reproduce fine details \u2014 a phenomenon that psychologists like Dr. Castel call \u201cinattentional amnesia.\u201d When something is seen frequently, the information ends up being more easily ignored or forgotten. For instance, Dr. Castel said he would be curious how accurately people could recall the fine details of a stop sign.\u201cWe know it\u2019s red, but the more subtle features \u2014 the exact shape of it, whether there\u2019s a white border around it \u2014 these are things we often miss, even though we\u2019ve seen it millions of times,\u201d he said.Perhaps the most surprising result of the Signs.com study was the company that fared best: Ikea. The Swedish furniture maker with the distinctive blue-and-yellow logo plastered across its giant retail stores was redrawn near-perfectly by 30 percent of the participants.Asa Nordin, who is a senior coordinator of Ikea trademarks at Inter Ikea Systems, said the unique shape, colors, and longevity of the logo \u2014 it has been around since 1983 \u2014 most likely contributed to its memorability.\u201cThe logo is merely the symbol for what the Ikea brand promises and delivers,\u201d Ms. Nordin said in an email. \u201cThe logo shall mirror that \u2018promise\u2019 as near as possible, as well as stand out from its surroundings. To be consistent and unique is clearly a strength of a logo.\u201dThe hardest logo to draw was Starbucks, which was redesigned in 2011. It is also arguably the most complex.\u201cSimplicity is key,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a new concept. But this definitely corroborates that idea.\u201dBut is any logo overwhelmingly memorable? Mr. James is now curious. Initially, he resisted putting an overly straightforward and ubiquitous symbol in his study, like those of McDonald\u2019s or Nike.\u201cWe thought it was too simple,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cBut, I wonder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe tech giants are too big. But what if that\u2019s not so bad?For a year and a half \u2014 and more urgently for much of the last month \u2014 I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.That\u2019s not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo \u2014 and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today\u2019s tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet\u2019s capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades \u2014 from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism \u2014 the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies \u2014 one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs \u2014 it was never conceivable to limit that era\u2019s equivalent of fake news.Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates \u2014 and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.\u201cThis is new stuff everybody is dealing with \u2014 it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful,\u201d a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \u201cSo when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You\u2019ve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\u201dOver the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome \u2014 so why was I including their company in that group?This dynamic \u2014 where each company competes mightily against the others \u2014 suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d with Mr. Atkinson. \u201cAs long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what\u2019s to complain about?\u201dYou can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control \u2014 for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways \u2014 with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.\u201cSo, why pre-emptively say that maybe we\u2019ll be harmed in the future \u2014 that in 2030 they\u2019ll jack up their prices or something?\u201d Mr. Lind asked. \u201cWell, deal with that as it comes.\u201dThe Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects \u2014 where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it \u2014 it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.I don\u2019t mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.As I said, tech is messy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Texas Shooting Could Draw Apple Back Into Security Debate", "Date": "2017-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than a year after Apple battled the F.B.I. over the unlocking of an iPhone, a new skirmish may be brewing between the authorities and the company over privacy and strong encryption on its devices.In a news conference on Tuesday, the F.B.I. said that it had not been able to get into the device owned by the gunman, but it did not specify the type of phone or the operating system.Apple said that it was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the shooting and that it worked with law enforcement every day. \u201cWe offer training to thousands of agents so they understand our devices and how they can quickly request information from Apple,\u201d the company said.Apple devices are some of the most secure on the market, and people typically lock them with passwords. Fingerprints can also be used to unlock the device on a biometric scanner.If a user has enabled an iPhone\u2019s data-erase function, someone trying to break into the device would have 10 attempts at typing in a password. If all of those attempts failed, the iPhone would automatically wipe itself clean as a safeguard for its owner\u2019s privacy.After the F.B.I.\u2019s news conference on Tuesday, Apple said, it immediately reached out to law enforcement. \u201cWe offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us,\u201d Apple said.In that case, a federal judge ordered Apple to help the F.B.I. The judge asked Apple to \u201cbypass or disable\u201d the security feature that wipes a phone clean after 10 incorrect password attempts. Apple argued that creating the technology to bypass its own security would compromise its users\u2019 safety.In the aftermath of the Sutherland Springs shooting, the authorities could have used Mr. Kelley\u2019s fingers for up to 48 hours after he last opened his iPhone to activate the biometric Touch ID function to gain access to the device. It is unclear why officials did not do so. After 48 hours, law enforcement would need a pass code to open the phone.In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. was ultimately able to open the iPhone without help from Apple. It\u2019s unclear what methods law enforcement has tried in the Texas case.Whether or not the government finds evidence on Mr. Kelley\u2019s iPhone, the case could again thrust Apple into the middle of a debate over how we balance the needs of citizens and their right to privacy with the needs of law enforcement working on tough cases.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the circumstances under which an iPhone automatically wipes itself clean. It happens after 10 attempts at typing in a password, but only if the phone\u2019s owner has enabled its data-erase function.Adam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Ways to Share Your Smartphone Photos This Holiday", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixWith the holiday season upon us, families will soon gather for the big annual exchange \u2014 not just gifts, but also memories.For taking photos, smartphones have been a blessing because they include excellent, easy-to-use cameras that people carry everywhere. But the downside is that sharing large batches of digital photos among multiple relatives is hardly straightforward.No family enjoys huddling around and squinting at the small screen on Grandma\u2019s smartphone as she swipes and narrates her vacation in Florida. Even worse is when a sibling bombards you with dozens of text messages of photographs of his baby, burning through your data plan. And let\u2019s not forget the uncle who still carries around a thumb drive.\u201cThere are a few really clever photo sharing tools, but as smart as they are, you might still need to teach family members how they work,\u201d said R. C. Rivera, a professional photographer in San Francisco.So here are some tips for the quickest and most efficient ways to share digital photos, based on my tests and interviews with professional photographers.If you have a modestly sized family, chances are some members use iPhones but others use Androids. The quickest method for everyone to share pics is to rely on a photo storage service that supports both devices.After you sign up for Google Photos, each photo you take is automatically backed up to Google\u2019s cloud. From there, you can create albums for your trip to Spain or your 2-year-old\u2019s birthday party to share with other members of the family with Google accounts. You can also create public albums that anyone can see with a web link.To make sharing more effortless, you can also take advantage of some neat artificial intelligence. Google Photos detects the face of a person and automatically groups all the photos of that person into an album. From there, you can set up Google to automatically share photos of that person with others \u2014 which is great for baby photos.Google Photos is cheap. Google offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images for free. For full-resolution images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs.Unfortunately, this useful feature is difficult to find. In iOS 11, the latest mobile operating system, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hard press in the upper-left corner to open a hidden menu that includes AirDrop. From there, you can set up AirDrop to receive photos from everyone or just people on your contacts list.To share with AirDrop, make sure your relative nearby has AirDrop receiving turned on. On your iPhone, you can select a photo or a group of photos and tap the Share button (a box with an arrow pointing up). Your relative\u2019s device will show up under the AirDrop menu, and you can select the device.

{"Headline": "Mountain of Debt Casts Shadow Over Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe borrowing associated with a deal, if it happens, could be in record amounts and may send ratios of debt-to-Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) uncomfortably high.Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, Hock Tan, is facing two sources of uncertainty. One is whether his counterpart, Steve Mollenkopf, is willing to engage over the deal, which offers a 28 percent premium over Qualcomm\u2019s closing stock price on Thursday, before word of a potential bid began to spread. So far, Qualcomm\u2019s response has been noncommittal.The other problem facing Mr. Tan is Qualcomm\u2019s ongoing $38 billion bid to buy NXP \u2014 which listed shakily in 2010 and bought Freescale in 2015. Mr. Tan said he would take Qualcomm with or without NXP.Then there\u2019s sheer scale. The bid, worth $130 billion including Qualcomm debt, according to Broadcom, would require nearly $90 billion in cash. The private-equity outfit Silver Lake is providing $5 billion in convertible debt, with the rest to be raised by Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. Add in the companies\u2019 existing net debt, and the new group\u2019s total would be over $100 billion, even if more cash accumulates before the deal closes. That\u2019s four or five times the $23 billion in combined Ebitda that Broadcom is expecting, including cost savings.Consolidation among makers of chips for mobile phones, cars and the rest is all the rage, and Mr. Tan is an experienced deal maker with a record of quickly bringing debt down after acquisitions. But it\u2019s still a cyclical industry. The merged company would have to keep big customers like Apple happy, which might mean cutting prices. Meanwhile, $3 billion in annual cost reductions, taxed and capitalized, are worth about the same as the roughly $22 billion premium, so Broadcom isn\u2019t keeping much for its own shareholders.At least one deal hurdle \u2014 Washington\u2019s examination of foreign acquirers \u2014 has been pre-empted. The Singapore-domiciled Broadcom will move to the United States, Mr. Tan said last week in a news conference with President Trump. Investors seem to have caught the good feelings, pushing up the stock of both companies to the tune of more than $20 billion altogether since Thursday.As it happens, both Freescale and NXP survived a turn in the cycle despite excessive leverage. But the distress they went through should give pause for thought.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft to Expand Campus, as Amazon Looks Elsewhere", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetThe project, which Microsoft plans to announce at its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, amounts to a major overhaul of the company\u2019s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Wash., the leafy Seattle suburb that it has called home since 1986.Amazon said it received 238 bids from across North America and is whittling down the list to a group of finalists, with a winner to be announced next year.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company did not intend for its hometown expansion \u2014 which he described as a multibillion-dollar investment \u2014 as a comment on Amazon. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re out to make a statement about what anyone else is doing or not doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is the right decision for us.\u201dStill, Mr. Smith could not resist a slight dig. \u201cWhen it comes to headquarters, one is enough, we feel,\u201d he said.Today Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus has most of the trappings found at the sprawling headquarters of tech giants in Silicon Valley \u2014 the soccer fields, manicured lawns and oceans of parking lots. That will not change on its renovated campus, but Microsoft is taking a different approach in other respects.The new buildings will be clustered closer together. They will also be taller \u2014 four stories instead of the two or three that are common now. There will be a new underground parking facility, a 2-acre open plaza that will serve as a central gathering place and new walking and cycling trails.\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to build a somewhat denser campus and create a somewhat more urban feel,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The company\u2019s decision to stay put at its Redmond campus flies in the face of a trend among technology companies to gravitate closer to cities. The abundance of amenities, night life and public transportation in urban areas has led to thriving tech scenes in San Francisco, New York and other cities.\u201cMy gut reaction is, \u2018Wow, they seem kind of out of touch,\u2019\u201d said Dan Bertolet, a researcher at Sightline Institute, a nonprofit in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cAll the young people I know who work in the tech industry out there want to be in Seattle. They pooh-pooh places like Redmond.\u201dTech companies are also finding that the talent they are after increasingly wants to live in cities, not suburbs. That has led suburban giants like Google, Facebook and Apple to operate large private bus services to ferry workers to their headquarters. Microsoft\u2019s own bus service has more than 94 buses and over 4,000 daily riders.But those buses also frequently sit in soul-crushing traffic. Possible relief for Microsoft\u2019s commuters will come in the form of light-rail that will connect it to Seattle. A light-rail station on Microsoft\u2019s campus is scheduled to open by 2023.Had Microsoft decided to move to Seattle rather than remain in the suburbs, the company would likely have faced severe criticism from affordability advocates, who are worried about lower income residents getting pushed out of the city.Mr. Bertolet said suburban areas outside Seattle tend to restrict the density of housing so they\u2019re not likely to develop an urban atmosphere without significant change. \u201cMaybe in the long term,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s better to have a regional network of bigger cities, but getting there will be rough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Qualcomm Agree to a Deal With Broadcom? Ask Apple", "Date": "2017-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsApple may anoint the winner of Broadcom\u2019s $105 billion bid for Qualcomm. A dispute over iPhone royalties left Qualcomm vulnerable to an opportunistic offer from its acquisitive rival. If Apple settles its dispute, it could preserve Qualcomm\u2019s independence \u2014 but it all depends on whether Apple thinks a bigger Broadcom would be slavishly devoted to its devices, or just surlier.Qualcomm and Apple came to blows over royalties that the chip maker collects on mobile gadgets, most of which use its technologies. The actual payments aren\u2019t disclosed, but analysts generally peg them at about $10 per phone. When Apple sued Qualcomm and told its suppliers to stop paying these fees this year, it helped push Qualcomm\u2019s share price down by $10 per share, in subsequent months, to the $54.84 at which it traded last Thursday, the day before Broadcom\u2019s interest was reported.Settling the lawsuit might make Broadcom\u2019s bid of $70 per share less compelling. Analysts project Apple should sell around 250 million phones next year. If it agreed to a lower royalty payment of, say, $7.50 per phone, with a post-tax margin of 85 percent, that would yield almost $1.6 billion in profit. Put this on a multiple of 10, and that\u2019s worth about $16 billion \u2014 or roughly $11 per share. And that\u2019s before any catch-up payments for previously withheld sums that Qualcomm might be able to claw back.Should Apple play along? It depends on which chip maker it considers the more malleable counterpart. Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, Hock Tan, is said to be open to renegotiating the Qualcomm contract should his company prevail. The promise of $3 billion in annual cost savings from the merger more than defrays the opportunity cost of giving Apple a good deal. Winning the good graces of Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, might also result in additional chip sales to the tech giant.Whatever Mr. Tan says, though, his priority is likely to be maximizing the returns on his new acquisition. A big motivation for acquiring rivals is usually gaining heft over customers, and Broadcom already derives over 10 percent of its revenue from Apple. Furthermore, the lengthy antitrust process for a Broadcom-Qualcomm merger means it might be a year before Mr. Tan could negotiate properly anyway. The iPhone maker may prefer its serfs smaller and more squeezable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Silicon Valley Plans to Conquer the Classroom", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducation DisruptedBALTIMORE COUNTY, Md. \u2014 They call it the \u201cChurch Lane Hug.\u201dThat is how educators at Church Lane Elementary Technology, a public school here, describe the protective two-armed way they teach students to carry their school-issued laptops.And Silicon Valley has embraced the school district right back.Silicon Valley is going all out to own America\u2019s school computer-and-software market, projected to reach $21 billion in sales by 2020. An industry has grown up around courting public-school decision makers, and tech companies are using a sophisticated playbook to reach them, The New York Times has found in a review of thousands of pages of Baltimore County school documents and in interviews with dozens of school officials, researchers, teachers, tech executives and parents.School leaders have become so central to sales that a few private firms will now, for fees that can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, arrange meetings for vendors with school officials, on some occasions paying superintendents as consultants. Tech-backed organizations have also flown superintendents to conferences at resorts. And school leaders have evangelized company products to other districts.Tech companies have not gone as far as drug companies, which have regularly paid doctors to give speeches. But industry practices, like flying school officials to speak at events and taking school leaders to steak and sushi restaurants, merit examination, some experts say.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be paid by Big Pharma, or Big Ed Tech, to be influenced,\u201d Dr. Boyd said. She has raised concerns about the tech initiative at school board meetings.In a district riven by disparities, Dallas Dance, the superintendent from 2012 through this past summer, made an appealing argument for a tech makeover. To help students develop new-economy skills, he said, every school must provide an equitable digital learning environment \u2014 including giving every student the same device.\u201cWhy does a first grader need to have it?\u201d Mr. Dance said in an interview last year. \u201cIn order to break the silos of equity, you\u2019ve got to say that everyone gets it.\u201dThe district wanted a device that would work both for youngsters who couldn\u2019t yet type and for high schoolers. In early 2014, it chose a particularly complex machine, an HP laptop that converts to a tablet. That device ranked third out of four devices the district considered, according to the district\u2019s hardware evaluation forms, which The Times obtained. Over all, the HP device scored 27 on a 46-point scale. A Dell device ranked first at 34.The district's hardware evaluations for HP, Dell, Apple and Lenovo devices. The winning device: HP.Mychael Dickerson, a school district spokesman, said, \u201cThe device chosen was the one that was closely aligned to what was recommended by stakeholders.\u201d Daly did not respond to inquiries.With the laptop deal sealed, Silicon Valley kicked into gear.In September 2014, shortly after the first schools received laptops, HP invited the superintendent to give a keynote speech at a major education conference in New York City. Soon after, Gus Schmedlen, HP\u2019s vice president for worldwide education, described the event at a school board meeting.\u201cWe had to pick one group, one group to present what was the best education technology plan in the world for the last academic year,\u201d Mr. Schmedlen said. \u201cAnd guess whose it was? Baltimore County Public Schools!\u201dAn HP spokesman said the company did not pay for the trip. He said the company does not provide \u201ccompensation, meals, travel or other perks to school administrators or any other public sector officials.\u201dRecently, parents and teachers have reported problems with the HP devices, including batteries falling out and keyboard tiles becoming detached. HP has discontinued the Elitebook Revolve.Mr. Dickerson, the district spokesman, said there was not \u201ca widespread issue with damaged devices.\u201dAn HP spokesman said: \u201cWhile the Revolve is no longer on the market, it would be factually inaccurate to suggest that\u2019s related to product quality.\u201dAsked what device would eventually replace the Revolve in the schools, the district said it was asking vendors for proposals.A Baltimore County school board member, David Uhlfelder, said a representative from the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor had interviewed him in September about Mr. Dance\u2019s relationship with a former school vendor (a company not in the tech industry).The prosecutor\u2019s office declined to confirm or deny its interest in Mr. Dance.Mr. Dance, who discussed the district\u2019s tech initiatives with a Times reporter last year, did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls this week seeking comment.Mr. Dance\u2019s travel schedule sheds light on that world.Between March 2014, when the laptop contract was announced, and April 2017, when he announced his resignation, Mr. Dance took at least 65 out-of-state trips related to the district\u2019s tech initiatives or involving industry-funded groups, according to a Times analysis of travel documents obtained under public records laws \u2014 nearly two trips per month on average. Those trips cost more than $33,000. The Times counted only trips with local receipts, indicating Mr. Dance set foot in the cities.At least $13,000 of Mr. Dance\u2019s airline tickets, hotel bills, meals and other fees were paid for by organizations sponsored by tech companies, some of which were school vendors, The Times found. The $13,000 is an incomplete number, because some groups cover superintendents\u2019 costs directly, which means school records may not include them.Another way tech companies reach superintendents is to pay private businesses that set up conferences or small-group meetings with them. Superintendents nationwide have attended these events.ERDI offered several service levels this year, according to a membership rate card obtained by The Times. A $13,000 fee for Bronze membership entitles a company to one confidential meeting, where executives can meet with five school leaders to discuss products and school needs. Diamond members could pay $66,000 for six such meetings.The Education Research and Development Institute, known as ERDI, charges membership fees to school vendors to arrange small-group meetings with superintendents who can provide product feedback.\u201cBecause we are asking for their time and expertise, we commonly offer to pay the cost of their food, transportation and lodging during their participation,\u201d ERDI\u2019s president, David M. Sundstrom, said in an email.Mr. Dance\u2019s calendar indicated that he had attended at least five ERDI events.Mr. Dance received payment last year as an adviser for ERDI, according to his most recent district financial disclosure. It lists Dulle Enterprises, a company that owned ERDI in the past, as an employer from which he earned income.Last February, at an ERDI conference in New Orleans, Mr. Dance met with Curriculum Associates, which makes reading software, as well as DreamBox Learning, a math platform.A DreamBox spokeswoman said there was no connection between the meeting and its contract. \u201cEven the appearance of impropriety is something we take very seriously and take steps to avoid,\u201d she said.A Curriculum Associates spokeswoman said: \u201cThese panels are not sales presentations, but rather focus-group opportunities to solicit feedback on products under development.\u201dMs. White, the interim superintendent, has been involved with ERDI since 2013, according to Mr. Dickerson. He said Ms. White used vacation time to attend events, where she \u201cprovided guidance to education-related companies on goods, services and products that are in development to benefit student performance.\u201dAsked whether Ms. White had received ERDI payments, Mr. Dickerson said, \u201cParticipation in ERDI is done independently of the school system.\u201d In an email, Ms. White said she found ERDI to be a \u201cbeneficial professional learning experience.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to a question about ERDI compensation.She added, \u201cI do not believe there are any conflicts of interests\u201d related to the district\u2019s tech initiative.Mr. Sundstrom, ERDI\u2019s president, said education companies pay a fee to attend events \u201cnot to meet school leaders or make a sale,\u201d but to get meaningful feedback on their education products from knowledgeable school leaders. He added that school officials do not make purchases at ERDI sessions and that it is their school boards that approve district purchases.Baltimore County\u2019s travel rules say, \u201cNo travel expenses will be paid by those seeking to do business with the Baltimore County Public Schools prior to obtaining a contract.\u201d Mr. Dickerson explained that applied to companies currently bidding for contracts.\u201cYou have these huge contracts, and then you donate all this money, and the foundation puts up a banner advertising your company\u2019s name,\u201d said Michael J. Collins, a former Maryland state senator and former school board member. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think that passed the smell test.\u201dDiscovery Education said it trained employees to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Microsoft said its policies followed government gift and ethics rules. Pearson said its donation had been nominal and vetted to prevent conflict of interest. McGraw-Hill said it was committed to integrity and transparency.When asked if the foundation had policies governing donations from vendors or potential vendors, Ms. Phelps said no. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s not necessarily a policy,\u201d she said. There is also no policy prohibiting foundation board members who are vendors from reviewing grants involving their or competitors\u2019 products, she said.Mr. Dickerson said the focus of Baltimore County Public Schools was on \u201csupporting students, teachers and their learning environments.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are unapologetic for engaging with our Education Foundation, business partners and community stakeholders in an effort to close known achievement gaps.\u201dMr. Reich of Stanford suggested school districts establish clearer rules governing their relationships with vendors, particularly with tech companies racing to win over the gatekeepers to America\u2019s classrooms. Otherwise, parents could lose trust in the system.\u201cSchool leaders should be just as concerned about the perception of corruption as actual corruption,\u201d he said.Lilia Chang contributed reporting from Washington, and Jeremy Merrill from New York.

But Republicans in the Senate have added a wrinkle: repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate at the same time. More on that in a moment.Remember that a White House spokesman previously told the NYT, \u201cThe President did not speak with the Attorney General about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________From a note just published by Alec Phillips, a political economist at the firm:The tax reform debate is moving forward faster than we or most other observers expected. While there are a number of issues that could still slow it down, or stop it altogether, we believe the odds that tax reform will be enacted by early 2018 \u2014 already our base case \u2014 have risen to 80% (from 65% previously).He added that there\u2019s a one-in-three chance of a tax change becoming law by the end of the year, though the House and Senate may need time to reconcile their bills.While Mr. Phillips thinks that Republicans\u2019 tax efforts still face obstacles, including intense lobbying efforts and questions about whether the Senate can pass its bill, he believes that the overall campaign will succeed.Among some of Mr. Phillips\u2019 other predictions:\u2022 The corporate tax rate appears likely to go down to 20 percent, but may need to be phased in.\u2022 Limits on deductions for corporate interest payments should follow the more lenient prescription set out in the House bill.\u2022 Fewer Republicans than expected will ultimately push back against limits on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT in Congressional parlance.\u2014 MichaelSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, had pushed for the mandate to be eliminated as part of the tax bill. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\u201cRepealing the mandate pays for more tax cuts for working families and protects them from being fined by the I.R.S. for not being able to afford insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place.\u201dMr. El-Erian has the qualifications: former C.E.O. of Pimco, currently chief economic adviser at Allianz. But he\u2019s also what some of President Trump\u2019s backers would consider a \u201cglobalist,\u201d from his international upbringing as the son of an Egyptian diplomat to his economic views, which generally mesh well with the departing Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen.President Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve is a very wise decision that will be welcomed by markets. It brings a highly respected, well-informed and experienced professional to the helm of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank.\u2014 MichaelThe S.E.C. filed a total of 62 new enforcement actions against public companies and their subsidiaries in the fiscal year, down from 92 the previous fiscal year.Of the 62 actions, only 17 were brought in the second half of the year.Trian Partners probably wishes you didn\u2019t.At the time Trian published its analysis, G.E. was trading at $25.47. It predicted that by around this time, the conglomerate could get up to $40 to $45 a share. (To be fair, the activist had a laundry list of recommendations that G.E. follow, and the company hasn\u2019t implemented all of them. Who knows whether sticking to Trian\u2019s plan would have avoided this?)As of early this afternoon, the company\u2019s stock price was at $17.50, down 8 percent for the day.\u2014 MichaelSome start-up employees could owe big tax bills without being able to pay, since privately held companies\u2019 shares are generally harder to sell. Bigger unicorns could draw money from outside investors to let employees cash out \u2014 Uber already has \u2014 but younger start-ups have no such recourse.Companies could pay more cash compensation, using up precious cash flow. Or they could go public \u2014 if they make it that far. Tech employees might forgo working at younger companies because they couldn\u2019t pay as much. \u201cWe legitimately can\u2019t figure out how this is going to work,\u201d one start-up adviser told DealBook\u2019s Michael J. de la Merced.\u201cIt would mean that I would have to sell the company,\u201d said Shoaib Makani, founder and chief executive of long-haul trucking start-up KeepTruckin. \u201cI have zero net worth aside from the common stock I hold in the company. It would be impossible. I would be in default.\u201dTying into themes touched on in our conference last week, here are some of the ways businesses are trying to future-proof themselves:Just look at G.E.\u2019s stock performance yesterday, after the company unveiled its big turnaround plan and dividend cut:\u201cIf that is all you were going to say, why did we have to wait from July until November?\u201dCritics\u2019 corner\u201cI think that every major technology company has to be concerned right now. We\u2019ve reached a tipping point,\u201d Kelly Dermody, a lawyer who is working on the cases against Microsoft and Google, told me.In other sexual harassment newsAmazon and other U.S. companies here, including Apple Inc., have faced increased pressure in recent months in the face of the Chinese government\u2019s desire to control cyberspace. In July, Apple said it would begin storing cloud data for its Chinese customers on a server run by a government-owned company, to comply with Chinese law.Think about the implications \u2014 in health, in policy and in business \u2014 of the newly F.D.A.-approved digital pill, which has a sensor that can tell doctors whether, and when, patients take their medicine.The technology could potentially be used to monitor whether post-surgical patients took too much opioid medication or clinical trial participants correctly took drugs being tested.Insurers might eventually give patients incentives to use them, like discounts on co-payments, said Dr. Eric Topol, director of Scripps Translational Science Institute, adding that ethical issues could arise if the technology was \u201cso much incentivized that it\u2019s almost is like coercion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Broadcom Is Said to Weigh Takeover Bid of Qualcomm", "Date": "2017-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQualcomm, a longtime giant of the computer chip industry that has fallen on hard times of late, may find itself a takeover target for a fast-rising upstart.Broadcom, which in just eight years has become a formidable competitor in the semiconductor industry, is weighing a takeover bid for Qualcomm, two people briefed on the matter said on Friday.A spokeswoman for Qualcomm declined to comment, while a representative for Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.A merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm would combine a range of semiconductor, computing and networking technologies. But certainly one rationale, analysts say, would be to increase the combined companies\u2019 real estate on smartphones \u2014 and perhaps a more secure position in that crucial industry.Broadcom, they say, may be betting it could reach a peace with Apple, which is pulling away from Qualcomm as a supplier and fighting in court with it over patents.\u201cIt would certainly increase Broadcom\u2019s exposure to wireless, and maybe the company believes it can develop a better relationship with Apple,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst for Bernstein Research.And Qualcomm has not yet completed its $38.5 billion takeover of another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors, a transaction meant to help diversify its business away from smartphones. What would happen to that planned takeover if Broadcom acquired Qualcomm was not yet clear.While Qualcomm has suffered several misfortunes in the last several years, its potential pursuer has enjoyed far better success of late.Broadcom\u2019s leadership traces itself back to Avago Technologies, a company that went public in 2009. At the time, it was just another small player in the semiconductor industry, worth $3.5 billion. But it has embarked on a breathtaking acquisition spree since then, driven by the soaring ambitions of its chief executive, Hock Tan, and backed by the big investment firm Silver Lake Partners.Two years ago, Avago struck its biggest deal to date by buying Broadcom, whose chips are used in smartphones and networking devices, for $37 billion. Mr. Tan\u2019s company adopted its target\u2019s name \u2014 and did little to hide its desire to hunt even bigger game.Broadcom, which has long maintained a headquarters in Singapore for tax reasons, as well as in San Jose, Calif., said the move was inspired in part by Republicans\u2019 efforts to overhaul the American tax code. The return to the United States, Mr. Tan said, would shift $20 billion in revenue back to America, making it subject to corporate taxes in the United States. The administration\u2019s tax proposal would cut corporate tax rates sharply, to 20 percent, from a nominal 35 percent.The plans led Mr. Trump to praise Broadcom as \u201cone of the really, great, great companies.\u201dBut Broadcom executives stressed that the move was not dependent on the passage of tax legislation.A different policy consideration, analysts say, is the prime motivation.\u201cThis is all about freeing up Broadcom to make acquisitions,\u201d said Romit Shah, an analyst for Nomura Instinet. \u201cAnd Qualcomm has been at the top of Broadcom\u2019s wish list for a long time.\u201dThe hurdle that Broadcom has faced as a foreign-based company is apparent in the trouble it has encountered with its pending purchase of Brocade Communications Systems, announced last November at $5.5 billion.That deal has been delayed three times by issues that cropped up during the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The government body scrutinizes bids by overseas companies to buy American corporations that control technology that may be deemed strategic for either economic or national-security reasons.Broadcom traces its origins back to 1961, as the semiconductor unit of Hewlett-Packard. Its corporate history is largely a chronology of deals. HP spun off its chip and test-equipment business as Agilent Technology in 1999.In 2005, the buyout firms KKR and Silver Lake bought much of Agilent\u2019s operations and named the new unit Avago Technologies. A string of deals followed until Avago bought the much-larger Broadcom in 2015.Qualcomm, founded in 1985, has a heritage of science and engineering. Its founders were led by Irwin M. Jacobs, a professor at the University of California, San Diego. The company, which is based in San Diego, was a pioneer in mobile communications, including satellite-tracking and messaging technology used by long-haul trucking companies.Later, Qualcomm developed the chip sets used for the basic radio communications in mobile phones, and its technology gave Qualcomm a leading position, protected by a thicket of patents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Investigation Has Tech Giants Shying From \u2018Social\u2019 Label", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After years of trying unsuccessfully to build a social network to rival Facebook, Google finally got something out of all of its failures: cover.Tech companies have taken a pounding in the court of public opinion in recent months. In the eyes of their critics, they have become too big, too powerful and too unmindful of their influence. And this week\u2019s congressional hearings cast added and unflattering light on the industry\u2019s growing embarrassment over the Russian election meddling.\u201cWithout sufficient oversight, these companies never imagined hostile intelligence services would misuse their platforms in this way,\u201d said Renee DiResta, an independent security researcher at Data for Democracy. \u201cThe people running it appear to not fully appreciate what they\u2019ve designed.\u201dNot surprisingly, perhaps, a few of the industry\u2019s biggest companies have been happy to say, in essence, don\u2019t blame us.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his company\u2019s technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.With the emergence of Facebook, Twitter and their ilk over the last decade, \u201csocial\u201d became a key Silicon Valley buzzword as companies crammed social network-like features into new products. Even Apple, despite the tens of billions of dollars it has earned making computing devices, has tried its hand at a social network focused on music.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have \u201csocial\u201d label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.\u201cThe mere fact that a tech company is trying to minimize its overall influence is a telling signal of the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Bayer.Google, which operates under the parent company Alphabet, can offer a distinction between its business and how social networks operate \u2014 largely because its attempts to build a social network have not been very successful.The company spent millions of dollars creating Google+, a social site built specifically to take on Facebook. The company tied Google+ into nearly every one of its properties, describing it as the \u201csocial spine\u201d of Google in public statements at the time.There also were short-lived efforts like Google Buzz and Google Wave, or geographically specific sites like Orkut \u2014 popular in Brazil but ignored elsewhere.Google+ continues to exist but it is considered a disappointment. Google said it had found no political posts from state-linked actors on Google+.Google said accounts believed to have ties to the Kremlin had uploaded more than 1,100 videos to YouTube on racial, religious and political topics. Those videos were viewed 309,000 times. Many of those videos had only a small number of views, though they were \u201cfrequently posted to other social media platforms,\u201d Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s senior counsel in law enforcement and information security, told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday.Facebook, to offer a comparison, estimated that 150 million users of Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, had been exposed to 80,000 posts that came from the Russian influence campaign.Twitter said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts that were linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period. Twitter identified an additional 36,000 automated accounts that had posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that same period. The tweets received about 288 million views.\u201cNow you\u2019re seeing all the attention from Congress go to Facebook and Twitter, because they\u2019re the linchpin\u201d of the Russian information operations, said Ms. DiResta, the security researcher.In his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, sought to draw a bright line separating his company\u2019s services from social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which has been an occasional subject of Google acquisition rumors.He also played down what Google knows about its users, a surprising conceit for a company that makes more money than anybody from selling advertising based on the online interests of users.\u201cWe\u2019re somewhat differently positioned because we\u2019re not primarily a social network,\u201d Mr. Walker said in response to a question regarding whether Google should notify users who are exposed to propaganda or divisive content from a foreign government. \u201cMany users are not logged in when they access content, so it\u2019s difficult to know who sees what.\u201dStill, social media remains a compelling proposition for internet companies, even Google, because it keeps people coming back and creates a place for them to spend their time, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology data firm Jackdaw Research.\u201cIf you gave Google the choice of having a social network, even with everything that\u2019s happened,\u201d said Mr. Dawson. \u201cI think it would still like to have one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Self-Driving Cars Go to Learn", "Date": "2017-11-11", "News": "Arizona\u2019s promise to keep the driverless car industry free of regulations has attracted dozens of companies, including Uber, Waymo and Lyft.Supported byIt was January 2015 and the Phoenix area was about to host the Super Bowl. Mr. Ducey learned that a local regulator was planning a sting on Lyft and Uber drivers to shut down the ride-hailing services for operating illegally. Mr. Ducey, a Republican who was the former chief executive of the ice cream chain Cold Stone Creamery, was furious.\u201cIt was the exact opposite message we should have been sending,\u201d Mr. Ducey said in an interview. \u201cWe needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas.\u201d If the state had a slogan, he added, it would include the words \u201copen for business.\u201dArizona has since built upon the governor\u2019s action to become a favored partner for the tech industry, turning itself into a live laboratory for self-driving vehicles. Over the past two years, Arizona deliberately cultivated a rules-free environment for driverless cars, unlike dozens of other states that have enacted autonomous vehicle regulations over safety, taxes and insurance.The payoff for Arizona has been a tech boom, with dozens of autonomous vehicle companies flocking here to set up operations. Every day, Waymo, the driverless car business owned by Google\u2019s corporate parent Alphabet, as well as Uber, Lyft, General Motors and Intel now deploy hundreds of cars that drive themselves on the streets of Phoenix, a sprawling metropolis of 1.4 million people.But Arizona\u2019s permissiveness has drawn criticism from safety advocates who said the companies have too much freedom to conduct their trials on public roads. They said car companies and state officials have not solved questions about the privacy of passengers, the prevention of cyberattacks on autonomous cars, and how to insure vehicles that don\u2019t have a driver.Arizona officials said the public is essentially protected by basic rules that require a licensed driver somewhere in the driverless car. They added that they planned to take a back seat to the experts when it comes to rule-making. The state insurance regulator, for example, said he would wait for the insurance industry to guide regulators on liability policies for driverless cars, amid questions about who is responsible in a crash if the car isn\u2019t driven by a human.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be getting in the way by prescribing regulations when we really don\u2019t know how the equipment will perform,\u201d said John Halikowski, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation.The state\u2019s hands-off approach has already been tested. In March, Arizona experienced its first crash involving a driverless car, when a human-driven vehicle collided with a self-driving Uber in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. The case was quickly resolved because police said Uber\u2019s car was not at fault, but some Arizona officials acknowledged they have not thought through all the legal scenarios with autonomous car accidents.\u201cWe embrace innovation,\u201d said Mark Mitchell, the mayor of Tempe. \u201cBut there are some things we\u2019ll have to look at moving forward.\u201d\u201cWe can beat California in every metric; lower taxes, less regulations, cost of living, quality of life,\u201d he said several months after he became governor.In early 2015, Mr. Ducey\u2019s shutdown of the sting operation that would have hit Uber and Lyft had an immediate effect. Days after his decision, which the companies were made aware of by his staff, Lyft and Uber executives called the governor to thank him.By August 2015, Mr. Ducey was taking his first steps into driverless vehicles. That month, he signed an executive order supporting autonomous cars. Under that order, any driverless car could be on Arizona roads as long as a passenger had a license and the car had a basic liability insurance plan.Mr. Ducey also set up a \u201cSelf-Driving Vehicle Oversight Committee\u201d comprised of transportation, public safety, insurance and other regulators to advise \u201chow best to advance the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles on public roads.\u201d The group was not intended to create any new rules.And Mr. Ducey became a pitchman.Early last year at a global economic forum on the Georgia coast, Mr. Ducey said he approached Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, with a business card and talking points on the state\u2019s embrace of self-driving automakers. Shortly thereafter, Waymo scoped out Chandler to begin autonomous car tests.Chandler\u2019s officials sealed the deal with further promises to stay out of the way. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s our role to be engaged in regulation,\u201d said Micah Miranda, Chandler\u2019s director of economic development.Waymo opened operations in Chandler in August 2016, hiring dozens of local test drivers. The company hosted a grand opening with Mr. Ducey and Chandler\u2019s mayor, and held several community events to win over the public.\u201cThe enthusiasm for new tech from the public and Governor Ducey makes Arizona a place where innovation can thrive and companies like ours can set up roots,\u201d said Waymo.Mr. Ducey also traveled to Silicon Valley to visit driverless car companies and investors. In late 2016, he stopped by Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that has invested in companies including Lyft, which is working on self-driving technology. There, Mr. Ducey found an inquisitive audience about the state\u2019s regulation-free policy for self-driving cars.\u201cAlthough Washington gets much of the attention, a lot of the real action on tech policy is taking place at the state and local level,\u201d said Ted Ullyot, an Andreessen Horowitz partner who attended the meeting. \u201cGovernor Ducey is a key pro-innovation leader, making Arizona a highly welcoming environment for autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies.\u201dIn California, Google, Uber, GM, and Ford have fought lawmakers on self-driving rules. One rule required carmakers to report on the number of times a driverless car switched from autonomous mode to human-driven mode, which irked automakers who said those statistics give a misleading impression of safety.Uber\u2019s executives called Mr. Ducey.\u201cWe responded by saying we weren\u2019t going to hassle them,\u201d Mr. Ducey said of Uber. \u201cI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t thank my partner in growing the Arizona economy, Jerry Brown,\u201d the Democratic governor of California.\u201cGovernor Ducey\u2019s prioritization of the sharing economy has made the Grand Canyon State an ideal environment for our self-driving pilot,\u201d Uber said.Under Mr. Ducey, driverless car experiments in Arizona have multiplied over the last year.Uber\u2019s self-driving Volvo SUVs now pick up customers around Tempe on a daily basis. Waymo has dispatched more than 100 Chrysler self-driving minivans to chauffeur select families and other residents as part of a closely guarded trial; the company plans to expand to 600 vehicles by the end of the year, with the majority in Chandler. And dozens of vehicles for GM, Ford, Intel, and Lyft are also covering thousands of miles a day on the flat and sun-drenched roads around Phoenix.Some residents are ambivalent. Groups representing the blind are enthusiastic supporters of driverless cars, which could give their members more independence. Others like the idea of tech-related jobs coming to the state. But some are cautious.\u201cI\u2019m on the fence,\u201d said Jake Guadarrama, 22, a Phoenix area resident. \u201cWhat if the battery died on the car and it goes out of control? And will it take way from the work force?\u201dThose questions are not just academic. Already, the incorporation of driverless cars into human-driven traffic has run into problems.Around dusk on March 24, for example, Alexandra Cole, a Tempe resident, inched her 2008 Honda CRV into a busy suburban intersection in the city. With five seconds left on the pedestrian crossing signal and no cars coming toward her in the two closest lanes, she began a left turn.She did not see Uber\u2019s self-driving Volvo SUV darting through the yellow light in the furthest lane toward her. The cars collided. Uber\u2019s vehicle flipped onto its side and crashed into two more cars waiting in traffic.But what happened after the accident revealed a system that was unprepared for computer-operated vehicles. Mr. Ducey, Tempe officials and state transportation regulators did not get briefed on the collision. The self-driving task force set up by the governor, which has met twice in two years, also did not review the incident.Uber sent its wrecked vehicle to its Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle center, which the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration officials visited to investigate. N.H.T.S.A. said it could not comment because its investigation is still in progress. Ms. Cole and her insurance company declined to comment.Insurance would also have been a question, with debate over who takes responsibility in a driverless car crash \u2014 the company or the third-party software or parts makers or the passenger with a license \u2014 since there is no driver.\u201cThe insurance companies need to figure out how they will insure this,\u201d said Stephen Briggs, a spokesman for Arizona\u2019s Department of Insurance. Arizona hasn\u2019t changed its minimum insurance liability rules for self-driving car trials. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have the resources to do this.\u201dAngel Carbajal, Tempe\u2019s assistant chief of police, acknowledged there are many unknowns. \u201cThis is new, so there isn\u2019t a lot of legislation yet that explains how to respond to motor vehicle collisions involving autonomous vehicles,\u201d he said.For Mr. Ducey, none of this is a problem. He said the crash was handled properly and that even if driverless technology is not fully ready, the state\u2019s bet on autonomous vehicles will continue.\u201cThese are cultural opportunities for Arizona to be seen as a place to live, work and play,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skype Vanishes From App Stores in China, Including Apple\u2019s", "Date": "2017-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 One of the last foreign-run tools for online communication in China appears to be in trouble with the authorities here.For almost a month, Skype, the internet phone call and messaging service, has been unavailable on a number of sites where apps are downloaded in China, including Apple\u2019s app store in the country.\u201cWe have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law. Therefore these apps have been removed from the app store in China,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said Tuesday in an emailed statement responding to questions about Skype\u2019s disappearance from the app store. \u201cThese apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.\u201dThe removal led to a volley of complaints from Chinese users on internet message boards who were no longer able to pay for Skype\u2019s services through Apple. The users said that the disruption began in late October.Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, still functions in China, and its fate in the country is not yet clear. But its removal from the app stores is the most recent example of a decades-long push by China\u2019s government to control and monitor the flow of information online.While China has long wielded the most sophisticated and comprehensive internet controls in the world, under President Xi Jinping it has upped the ante, squelching most major foreign social networks and messaging apps one at a time.Beijing appears to have disabled these apps because they generally feature encryption options that make messages harder for the government to monitor. Such products also often run afoul of government rules that require the use of real-name identification for each and every account.A Microsoft spokesman said that Skype had been \u201ctemporarily removed\u201d from Apple\u2019s store and that the company was \u201cworking to reinstate the app as soon as possible.\u201d But the spokesman did not address Skype\u2019s absence from a variety of major third-party Android app stores. Because Google\u2019s services are largely blocked in China, Android users revert to alternate stores for downloads, and Skype\u2019s main app was not available on popular ones run by Chinese tech giants like Huawei and Xiaomi.But a key Chinese Communist Party meeting had already ended when Skype disappeared from the app stores \u2014 an indication that the cybersecurity law was the reason, and that the law, which began to take effect in June, is likely to have a deep and long-lasting impact on how the internet works in China. While the rules do not specifically ban foreign messaging apps, they do include general language that could be used to justify crackdowns.\u201cA broad reading of provisions in the law could be taken to mean that there is no longer support for allowing unfettered access to foreign communications tools such as Skype, WhatsApp, Signal and others that are outside the direct control of Chinese authorities,\u201d said Paul Triolo, the head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\u201cHence these also come under pressure, and are increasingly being throttled or blocked,\u201d he said.In that case, as in this one, it said that the apps violated Chinese rules and that it had taken them down to comply. Apple said this year that it planned to open a data center in China, also in response to China\u2019s new internet laws, which require that such centers be within the country\u2019s borders.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Dangerous Sprint Into the Future", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "To hear its executives tell it, Tesla is misunderstood because it is still perceived as a car manufacturer, when its goals are more complex and far-reaching. But at least some people have bought into these grand ambitions. This summer, Tesla\u2019s stock-market valuation at times rose above those of Ford and General Motors, and its worth exceeded $60 billion. It did not seem to matter to investors that the company had never made an annual profit, had missed its production targets repeatedly and had become enmeshed in controversy over its self-driving \u201cautopilot\u201d technologies, or that Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, had conceded that the value of his company, of which he owns about 22 percent, was \u201chigher than we have the right to deserve.\u201d Tesla was a headlong bet on the future, a huge wager on the idea of a better world. And its secretive Gigafactory was the arsenal for a full-fledged attack on the incumbent powers of the car and fossil-fuel industries. The factory would help validate Musk and his company\u2019s seriousness about leading humanity\u2019s turn to greener technologies, with a vision now encompassing solar roofing tiles and battery packs for home and industry. Most crucial, it involved producing millions of Tesla cars and trucks, all of which would be sleek, electric and self-driving.If ambitions were all it took, Tesla would be crowned the colossus of the global car industry. But rapidly accelerating new technologies have brought uncertainty as well. Automakers are encountering three destabilizing forces all at once: automation, electrification and sharing. And sizing up which companies will be the winners and losers in their wakes is in no way obvious. In terms of self-driving cars, it seems likely that long-established companies \u2014 General Motors and Ford, as well as BMW and Audi \u2014 will benefit from their substantial reserves of cash and deep manufacturing experience. Because these automakers can invest deeply in research (and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy start-ups), they can remain competitive with companies less inherently cautious, like Tesla and Waymo, the spinoff of Google\u2019s self-driving projects.Tesla\u2019s goal has always been focused on going green, rather than creating the driverless future. (Its mission is emblazoned on its factory walls: \u201cTo accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\u201d) Yet as the automobile industry settles on the consensus that self-driving cars are coming \u2014 their promise to improve safety and to help ride-sharing replace car ownership for many Americans propels their inevitability \u2014 Tesla finds itself in the midst of a contest to do both. This set of challenges should be enough for any company, especially one led by a chief executive whose time is compromised by other business commitments as a founder of a rocket company (SpaceX), a new tunneling operation (the Boring Company), a company planning a human-computer interface (Neuralink) and a nonprofit focused on the dangers of artificial intelligence (OpenAI). But Tesla has given itself a few others too. One is to essentially reinvent modern manufacturing processes at the Gigafactory. Yet another is to create the first mass-market electric car ever. In the meantime, a company that has never made much profit needs to somehow figure out how to do so \u2014 that is, to put itself in the black before financial losses and missed deadlines curdle any hope that Tesla inspires, among customers or stockholders, into skepticism.Still, the Gigafactory is considerably more than a battery factory: It\u2019s the physical embodiment of various technological breakthroughs the company \u2014 which just manufactured its 250,000th car \u2014 is trying to bring to its cars and energy-storage systems. Tesla makes motors here for its new Model 3 car, for instance, which are then trucked to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 240 miles away. When we went inside, after a labyrinthine walk through offices and up and down stairways, we reached a rapidly moving automated factory line, where batteries were being installed into Powerwalls and Powerpacks \u2014 the residential and industrial units that store energy collected from solar panels (or any electrical generator). Later in the month, devices like these would make their way to Puerto Rico, where Tesla rebuilt the power infrastructure for a children\u2019s hospital, and southern Australia, where the company is involved in a vast public project to shore up the country\u2019s electrical grid. \u201cWe think of this building as a product, because it is a product,\u201d my guide told me as we walked alongside a production line. Every machine had been scrutinized, every inch mapped out, every efficiency contemplated. Tesla had taken the highly unusual step of setting up a separate entity to take full control of the building\u2019s design, engineering and construction, reflecting Tesla\u2019s D.I.Y. ethos to achieve levels of vertical ownership and quality control that its executives believe are unreachable otherwise. The company had even concocted its own Tesla blend of coffee to serve near its cafeterias. \u201cIf we cannot get exactly what we want from the world,\u201d one executive told me, \u201cthen we have to go do it ourselves.\u201dTesla\u2019s grand plans in many respects depend on how much innovation the company can bring to the process of battery making. If the Gigafactory succeeds in reducing costs \u2014 one battery-industry analyst, Sam Jaffe, the director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told me he thinks the company should be able to drive down the price of its cells by 30 percent \u2014 multiple dividends will accrue to Tesla. Cheaper batteries mean more than cheaper cars. They mean Tesla can put larger battery packs into cars for the same cost, increasing the vehicles\u2019 range, power and appeal compared with the competition. At the same time, they could make its home energy-storage systems more efficient. Tesla could also gain an advantage in the race to produce autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s. The electric vehicles, or E.V.s, that Tesla wants to make autonomous have zero emissions. If self-driving cars go on rotation, say, in Uber and Lyft fleets, they could run 24-7, possibly leading to more cars on the road. \u201cOne of the concerns about automation is that it\u2019s going to drastically increase the miles we drive,\u201d Stephen Zoepf, the executive director at the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, told me. \u201cSo if we expect as a society that we\u2019re going to be driving a lot more, we obviously want to mitigate the environmental impact.\u201dAt the Gigafactory, J.B. Straubel, a Tesla founder and the company\u2019s chief technology officer, recounted the plant\u2019s origin story. In 2012, he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and realized that if Tesla were to sell something on the order of 500,000 cars a year, it would require the world\u2019s entire output of lithium-ion batteries at the time. \u201cWe realized, holy crap, this means we need a huge factory,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there was no way to do this just by putting in an order with some cell company and have them ship a few more.\u201d His projections were not far off. When we met in September, orders for the Model 3, which began production in midyear and has been billed as the company\u2019s first mass-market car, were around 455,000 through July, suggesting that the demand for E.V.s is far larger than any of the traditional automakers ever imagined. In the future, Straubel told me, Tesla plans to put up many more Gigafactories around the world, \u201cones that are actually quite a lot bigger than this one\u201d \u2014 and it would construct those itself too. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a big building that\u2019s full of equipment,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea here of the machine that builds the machine, and it\u2019s really true. This place is the embodiment of that.\u201dThe impression he wanted me to have, I think, was that Tesla, once it gets this prodigious machine humming, will become robotically unstoppable at cranking out smaller machines, a great big clean-energy perpetual-motion device. At the same time, the company\u2019s executives, from Straubel and Musk on down, were urging potential customers not to view each Tesla product in isolation but as parts of an ecosystem. The Tesla customer could soon use Tesla solar roof tiles during the day to charge up a Tesla Powerwall unit, filled with Gigafactory-made batteries \u2014 at night the Powerwall could in turn recharge the Tesla sedan. Perhaps the customer very much liked to drive? In that case, he or she might occasionally stop at one of the hundreds of Tesla \u201csupercharger\u201d stations in cities or along highways. Or maybe the owner didn\u2019t like to drive at all and preferred to be driven automatically. Tesla would soon straddle our peculiar moment, the transitional era where humans begin to take their hands off their machines. \u201cEvery car made since October of last year,\u201d Musk promised in early August, \u201cis capable of full autonomy, we believe.\u201dField quickly showed me the controls. There weren\u2019t many except for a few dials on the steering wheel. The screen to its right served as the car\u2019s dashboard. \u201cThis looks forward to an era of autonomy,\u201d Field explained, \u201cbut it\u2019s also simpler and easier to manufacture.\u201d That meant cheaper too, which was crucial: Tesla had concluded that every dollar saved on the cost of making the car would mean 100 more families could buy it in a year. As we drove through Palo Alto, the car was nimble and responsive, with the same kind of leaping acceleration that characterizes the Model S. But it took some time to get used to checking the screen to my right for my speed and autopilot settings. Field told me his team had concluded that it would be natural and intuitive for a younger generation. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when you put young people in the car,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the way all kids navigate technology.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that the kids might do more navigating, or giving the car orders, than driving. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla\u2019s design chief, later told me that in creating the car\u2019s interior, he faced the question of making a car that was affordable and stylish but also relevant for a future era. There was vigorous debate within the company about what to do if the Model 3 became truly autonomous. As time went on, von Holzhausen\u2019s group reasoned, this car would be driven less and would be driving more. Thus the decision to jettison dials and controls made sense, because the need for driver information would be reduced, and the central screen could mark routes and arrival times and double as an entertainment center. Those would be the essential tools. Or, as von Holzhausen put it, \u201cThe screen then became the hero of the vehicle.\u201dAll of Tesla\u2019s cars, including the Model 3, come with cameras and sensors; the sensors are small radar and ultrasonic devices situated around the car\u2019s exterior that could enable it, presuming the right software is eventually developed, to become self-driving. Because each Tesla car maintains a cellular connection, over-the-air improvements dispensed by the company are a regular feature \u2014 tweaking acceleration or braking capabilities through uploaded instructions, for instance. Sometimes the extent to which the company can improve or alter its cars\u2019 performance, even years after they left the factory, can be startling or unsettling, as was the case when Tesla temporarily extended the battery range for some drivers fleeing Hurricane Irma in Florida this summer. Self-driving, which Field assured me would ultimately come to pass with the right software and which Musk has repeatedly promoted to investors and customers, would allow Teslas to become something much more than they are. In the parlance of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which has quantified the capabilities a car must have to be considered self-driving, the vehicles will have nearly attained Level 5. This level denotes a safe and fully autonomous car that can operate in any place, and any conditions, without a driver.At the moment, Teslas are at Level 2. Their cameras, sensors and software support a more modest capability known as \u201cenhanced autopilot,\u201d which costs an additional $5,000 in a new Model S or Model 3. In certain road and weather conditions, the cars can regulate speed and braking in traffic, steer automatically, change lanes and parallel park autonomously. By some industry rankings, these features now help make Teslas among the safest cars on the road. But following the deadly crash of a Model S driver who was using autopilot in Florida in May 2016, the company reconfigured what the cars permit. When I tried the automated steering on my Model S during the drive from Reno to Palo Alto, for instance, the car chimed frequently in distress and warned me through a dashboard notice when I took my hands off the wheel for a few seconds. I\u2019d been informed that if this happened three times, the car would slow down, stop and rescind my autopilot privileges altogether. I didn\u2019t push it. Clearly, the car \u2014 and Tesla, too \u2014 still needed its driver.In the summer of 2016, Musk updated his vision for the company \u2014 \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux.\u201d In the decade since Part 1, the acceptance of electric vehicles had grown to the point where some traditional carmakers, in a surprising turn, were beginning to speak of an inevitable transition to an era when all models were battery-powered. Entire countries (like China) and enormous markets (like California) were also considering eventual bans on internal-combustion engines. As E.V. technology seemed ascendant, a variety of factors outside the auto industry were creating real potential for self-driving vehicles: great gains in computer-processing power, cheaper hardware sensors, better mobile connectivity, advances in artificial intelligence and enhanced mapping software. In his updated master plan, Musk stated that every Tesla would now have self-driving capabilities and that the application of \u201cfleet learning\u201d \u2014 a variation on machine learning \u2014 would help the company someday deliver a car that was 10 times safer in self-driving mode than when controlled by a human.Musk also explained a new fundamental goal of the company. Tesla, he said, wanted to \u201cenable your car to make money for you when you aren\u2019t using it.\u201d In other words, any new Tesla could in due time be part of a sharing network, able to taxi strangers around while its owner worked, slept or did whatever. Most Americans\u2019 cars stay parked about 95 percent of the time. A Tesla would not. In the same way that Tesla\u2019s electric drive train made the American car more efficient, the Tesla network would make the total utilization of the vehicle more efficient, too.App-based sharing networks for cars already exist: These companies \u2014 Turo and Getaround, for instance \u2014 are different from, say, Zipcar, because they depend on peer-to-peer communications to arrange for rentals. In essence, they function like mobile Airbnbs, and in some cases have drawn the ire of users in the wake of driver crashes and insurance issues. A Tesla network would push this concept much further, involving perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of cars, all of them already connected to the internet. Yet such a business network, one Tesla executive told me, most likely wouldn\u2019t succeed unless Tesla\u2019s cars were fully autonomous. Any concerns about insurance and lending a car to a risky driver would disappear, he argued, if autonomous driving proves to be much safer than manual driving. Just as important, autonomy makes irrelevant the problem of getting the car to where it\u2019s needed next \u2014 it can be sent wherever it needs to go via mobile app. What\u2019s crucial here is that the Tesla network, if it becomes functional, can defray the cost of an electric car like the Model 3, which is billed as Tesla\u2019s affordable car but can easily surpass $50,000 with various options. If your car is making money for you when you\u2019re not using it, it effectively becomes a tool that uses the virtues of A.V.s to promote the market adoption of E.V.s.Over the course of several months, I often asked people at Tesla, as well as those working on autonomous technologies elsewhere, how far away the self-driving future might be. There was no solid consensus beyond somewhere between two and five years. I tended to believe that the timeline might extend much further and would depend on how tightly we regulate such vehicles and how we agree to define autonomy. Does it mean interstate driving on a sunny day? Or driving within a dedicated area on city streets? Is it a Level 5 overnight trip through heavy rain from Boston to Washington? A driverless taxi pickup on a crowded street under partial construction \u2014 orange cones, backhoes, chaos \u2014 as a nightclub lets out? Part of the debate concerns hardware and whether the collection of sensors that automotive engineers now build into their A.V.s can collect enough data to create a fully autonomous car. These sensors generally include radar, cameras and Lidar, the expensive laser-based technology that Tesla has so far declined to use. Many other A.V. researchers consider it essential. Lidar uses light waves, rather than radio waves, to map and \u201cread\u201d a car\u2019s environs.Musk has promised that before the end of this year, a Tesla vehicle will drive itself coast to coast completely on autopilot. A number of competitors \u2014 especially Waymo and General Motors \u2014 seem to be closing in on similarly ambitious goals. But it\u2019s worth noting that no Level 5 car has ever been publicly deployed, and it\u2019s doubtful one even exists; the coast-to-coast trip on autopilot, Musk suggested, wouldn\u2019t yet be an instance where a driver could, say, go to sleep at the wheel. What\u2019s more, no Level 4 car, where the vehicle is self-driving under certain weather and geographical conditions, has been put in regular service, either. In fact, while driver-assistance tools like autopilot can greatly reduce crash rates, no company or researcher has ever demonstrated that a robotic automobile can consistently operate in the everyday world more safely than a car with a human driver.An executive close to Musk told me that his boss believes that creating a true A.V. is a \u201csolvable\u201d problem, one probably less difficult than others he has encountered in various business endeavors \u2014 for instance, creating cheap, reusable rockets for SpaceX, his other major company, or pushing Tesla\u2019s Model S to such unlikely success. This may indeed prove true. But unlike other tech innovations, the development of driverless cars cannot count on something like Moore\u2019s Law, which has projected a doubling of computing power at regular intervals and has allowed Silicon Valley entrepreneurs a clear window into the future. Based on conversations with engineers on the A.V. front lines, the most difficult problem is rigging cars with sensors and software that can take a rich, clear, picture of every element in the surrounding environment \u2014 people, bikes, signs, obstacles \u2014 and then algorithmically choreograph the future.This challenge is as arduous for Tesla as it is for engineers everywhere working to solve it. And yet the exigencies of Tesla\u2019s business model add an additional layer of complexity. To reach its sustainability goals and become profitable, the company must make lots of cars that are electric and sporty and increasingly affordable; meanwhile, to prepare for the future, Tesla has to build cars that eventually won\u2019t need us. Some of the most experienced researchers working on A.V.s believe that these are two separate and possibly irreconcilable ambitions and that it makes more sense to focus on a pure driverless car, even if it proves to be a very expensive proposition at first, rather than follow Tesla\u2019s incrementalist policy, which would involve rolling out software on a regular basis until the driver does less and less and finally nothing at all. With the second approach, one Silicon Valley engineer said, \u201cthe market pressures that are going to be applied to those technologies mean that you\u2019re not going to climb up the safety and reliability curve\u201d to build a true A.V. Keeping the vehicle affordable is in constant tension with making the vehicle autonomous. Musk\u2019s optimism alone can\u2019t change that.Musk declined my interview requests over the course of several months. By early November, the number of Model 3 cars coming out of the factory had fallen far short of what Musk had promised, the company\u2019s stock price had taken a nose-dive and there appeared to be serious software and robotic glitches at the Gigafactory. Musk was said to be too busy to talk, which did not always square with his social-media postings: jokes, poems, photos of tunnels he was digging, links to stories about the dangers of artificial intelligence and, in one instance, footage of a camping excursion on the roof of the Gigafactory.The company\u2019s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail. One Tesla engineer I spoke with, who works on autopilot systems, maintained that the company\u2019s camera and sensory hardware will prove good enough to get his team where it wants to go, which as a near-term goal means cars with a self-driving capability that is twice as good as a human driver (rather than 10 times as good, per the second master plan). By November, Musk was telling investors that the actual goal was to get the system simply on a par with a human driver and that that might require a more powerful computer in the cars, which Tesla would swap in free if necessary. Some customers have already paid $3,000 for a Tesla \u201cself-driving\u201d package (on top of the $5,000 for \u201cenhanced autopilot\u201d), based on Musk\u2019s assurances that the new cars have all the hardware necessary and will be autonomous once regulations and functional software are worked out.There\u2019s no clear indication of whether these efforts are on track, and in the past year, several engineers who ran Tesla\u2019s autopilot unit have left the company. In early October, Scott Miller, an executive involved with General Motors\u2019 self-driving efforts, charged publicly that Musk was \u201cfull of crap\u201d for claiming that his cars could offer self-driving capabilities with their current hardware. His assertions echo those of some other Tesla critics I spoke with: Without Lidar, or a more expensive hardware approach, Musk\u2019s cars may be at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, several people familiar with the company\u2019s A.V. work viewed its self-driving approach as a perilous one, given that there is no definitive way to predict how long it could take Tesla to satisfy the promises made to customers. In the best case, if A.I. and software breakthroughs ultimately transform cars like the Model 3 into self-driving vehicles, Musk will have pulled off something that perhaps seems impossible today. In the worst case, hundreds of thousands of owners will have cars that won\u2019t achieve the status of true A.V.s and can only hope that the sharing network of the master plan will someday become a reality.Tesla\u2019s setbacks, Musk noted in November, shouldn\u2019t eclipse the fact that the company has already grown faster by some measures than Ford when it rolled out the Model T in the early 1900s. He takes a longer view of his business than Wall Street analysts. In a recent TED interview, while discussing his plans for cities on Mars, he argued that it\u2019s a mistake to assume that technology gets better as time goes on. \u201cIt does not automatically improve,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade.\u201d He cited the Egyptian pyramids and Roman aqueducts and how the knowledge to build them was lost for hundreds, or even thousands, of years afterward. The relevance is striking in a time when the federal government would rather subsidize the growth of the coal and fossil-fuel industries than renewable energy and electric cars.Long before anyone saw Tesla as a legitimate player in the auto industry, Musk also appears to have understood that in taking chances that no established carmaker would, Tesla could be an innovative force to quicken our slow, plodding progress in transportation. Imagine Tesla didn\u2019t exist, Steve Jurvetson told me. \u201cWhat would the world look like? I have this sinking suspicion it wouldn\u2019t look that different than 10 years ago. A bunch of hybrid cars. A bunch of noise about hydrogen vehicles. You know, I don\u2019t think the world would look anything like today \u2014 where entire nations are saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop making gas cars.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe company\u2019s impact, real and potential, is all the more surprising considering that Musk has staked Tesla\u2019s success on the industrial equivalent of a shoestring, lacking the resources of established carmakers. He has used customer revenue, his own wealth, venture capital, bank and government loans, investments by other automakers and the American stock and debt markets to effectively fund a multibillion-dollar research-and-development project. In that way, he has led the industry to the start of a new era. And now his company, hindered by debilitating manufacturing bottlenecks and its extravagant promises of self-driving, is poised to find out whether, in laying the groundwork for an electric and autonomous future, he took one risk too many.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Andy Rubin, Android Creator, Steps Away From Firm Amid Misconduct Report", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former Google executive who is widely credited with creating Android smartphone software has taken a leave of absence from the start-up he now runs, the company said on Wednesday \u2014 a day after a report that he was involved in an inappropriate relationship with a female subordinate while he was at Google.The executive, Andy Rubin, was the subject of an internal Google investigation in 2014 after the female employee complained about the relationship, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were confidential. The inquiry found that the relationship was inappropriate because the woman worked on the Android team while Mr. Rubin was leading it, this person said.Mr. Rubin, who runs the smartphone hardware start-up Essential, asked to take a leave of absence this month to address personal matters, Shari Doherty, an Essential spokeswoman said. Essential did not specify when exactly the leave started or when employees had been told of Mr. Rubin\u2019s absence.A spokesman for Mr. Rubin disputed the idea that Mr. Rubin had been involved in inappropriate behavior during his time at Google.\u201cAny relationship that Mr. Rubin had while at Google was consensual and did not involve any person who reported to him,\u201d Michael Sitrick, the spokesman, said. \u201cMr. Rubin was never told by Google that he engaged in any misconduct while at Google and he did not, either while Google or since.\u201dGoogle declined to comment on Wednesday on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Rubin\u2019s departure. The company\u2019s policies do not prohibit co-workers from having romantic relationships, but its code of conduct states that such relationships can create actual or apparent conflicts of interest. If that happens, the code of conduct says, \u201cIt may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved.\u201dMr. Rubin helped popularize the use of keyboards on phones by introducing the Sidekick device in 2002. He went on to develop Android, which was acquired by Google in 2005. Android software now runs on about 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones.Mr. Rubin\u2019s departure from Google surprised many industry watchers because he had started to build a robotics unit at the company, going on a buying spree that led to the acquisition of at least eight robotics companies in what appeared to be part of a long-term project to commercialize robotics technology. Google transferred oversight of the Android group to Sundar Pichai, who is now Google\u2019s chief executive, in 2013.After leaving Google, Mr. Rubin started Playground, which is part venture capital firm and part technology-hardware incubator. Google is among its investors.Mr. Rubin founded Essential and released the company\u2019s first product, a premium smartphone running Android software, this year. He positioned the phone as having high-end features and materials like Apple\u2019s iPhone but without closed proprietary software like Apple\u2019s iOS operating system. Even before shipping a single product, Essential was valued at more than $1 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Report Expects New iPhones to Jump-Start Growth", "Date": "2017-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Apple reported revenue and profit increases that beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, the company said it was also seeing strong demand for the iPhone X, as well as for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which it unveiled in September.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said during the earnings call that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had been the most popular iPhones every week since they went on sale. And in an interview, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that iPhone X production was going well and that the company \u201ccould not provide such strong revenue guidance if we didn\u2019t have strong iPhone X demand.\u201dStrong demand for the devices could give a shot in the arm to Apple, which could become the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market value but has faced more questions about its growth in recent quarters. While the iPhone once fueled Apple\u2019s growth \u2014 its popularity underpinning other offerings like sales of services and software \u2014 more people around the world now own smartphones, and iPhone sales growth has flattened. New products, including the Apple Watch, have not been as widely adopted as the iPhone.\u201cThe iPhone X is so important to Apple because \u2014 for now at least \u2014 it seems to be siphoning demand from the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research.And while Wall Street had worried that Apple production issues, especially for the iPhone X, would constrain sales, \u201cthe reality is that over the coming months Apple will be able to meet demand for all of its models,\u201d Mr. Dawson said.Apple\u2019s revenue for the quarter that ended in late September totaled $52.6 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier and beating Wall Street estimates of $50.7 billion. Net income was $10.7 billion, up 19 percent from $9 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share were $2.07, compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.87.Apple said it had sold 46.7 million iPhones in the quarter, which is typically a lull period before the new devices come out. That was in line with Wall Street predictions of 46 million units and about the same as last year. Sales of iPad tablets rose 11 percent by units, while Macs also sold briskly, up 10 percent from a year earlier.As has been typical for some time, international purchases accounted for the majority of Apple\u2019s sales, with double-digit growth in markets including Europe and China.That growth is set to continue with the new iPhones. There are long lines \u201cin all retail stores across Asia\u201d for the new phones, Mr. Maestri said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Evil Is Tech?", "Date": "2017-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long ago, tech was the coolest industry. Everybody wanted to work at Google, Facebook and Apple. But over the past year the mood has shifted.Some now believe tech is like the tobacco industry \u2014 corporations that make billions of dollars peddling a destructive addiction. Some believe it is like the N.F.L. \u2014 something millions of people love, but which everybody knows leaves a trail of human wreckage in its wake.Surely the people in tech \u2014 who generally want to make the world a better place \u2014 don\u2019t want to go down this road. It will be interesting to see if they can take the actions necessary to prevent their companies from becoming social pariahs.There are three main critiques of big tech.The first is that it is destroying the young. Social media promises an end to loneliness but actually produces an increase in solitude and an intense awareness of social exclusion. Texting and other technologies give you more control over your social interactions but also lead to thinner interactions and less real engagement with the world.Eighth graders who spend 10 or more hours a week on social media are 56 percent more likely to say they are unhappy than those who spend less time. Eighth graders who are heavy users of social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent. Teens who spend three or more hours a day on electronic devices are 35 percent more likely to have a risk factor for suicide, like making a plan for how to do it. Girls, especially hard hit, have experienced a 50 percent rise in depressive symptoms.Snapchat has Snapstreak, which rewards friends who snap each other every single day, thus encouraging addictive behavior. News feeds are structured as \u201cbottomless bowls\u201d so that one page view leads down to another and another and so on forever. Most social media sites create irregularly timed rewards; you have to check your device compulsively because you never know when a burst of social affirmation from a Facebook like may come.The third critique is that Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are near monopolies that use their market power to invade the private lives of their users and impose unfair conditions on content creators and smaller competitors. The political assault on this front is gaining steam. The left is attacking tech companies because they are mammoth corporations; the right is attacking them because they are culturally progressive. Tech will have few defenders on the national scene.Obviously, the smart play would be for the tech industry to get out in front and clean up its own pollution. There are activists like Tristan Harris of Time Well Spent, who is trying to move the tech world in the right directions. There are even some good engineering responses. I use an app called Moment to track and control my phone usage.The big breakthrough will come when tech executives clearly acknowledge the central truth: Their technologies are extremely useful for the tasks and pleasures that require shallower forms of consciousness, but they often crowd out and destroy the deeper forms of consciousness people need to thrive.Online is a place for human contact but not intimacy. Online is a place for information but not reflection. It gives you the first stereotypical thought about a person or a situation, but it\u2019s hard to carve out time and space for the third, 15th and 43rd thought.Online is a place for exploration but discourages cohesion. It grabs control of your attention and scatters it across a vast range of diverting things. But we are happiest when we have brought our lives to a point, when we have focused attention and will on one thing, wholeheartedly with all our might.Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote that we take a break from the distractions of the world not as a rest to give us more strength to dive back in, but as the climax of living. \u201cThe seventh day is a palace in time which we build. It is made of soul, joy and reticence,\u201d he said. By cutting off work and technology we enter a different state of consciousness, a different dimension of time and a different atmosphere, a \u201cmine where the spirit\u2019s precious metal can be found.\u201dImagine if instead of claiming to offer us the best things in life, tech merely saw itself as providing efficiency devices. Its innovations can save us time on lower-level tasks so we can get offline and there experience the best things in life.Imagine if tech pitched itself that way. That would be an amazing show of realism and, especially, humility, which these days is the ultimate and most disruptive technology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Two Contrasting Views of Silicon Valley\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2017-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe pervasive influence of Silicon Valley on our economy, culture and politics is a subject worthy of close study. Two important new books released this week offer startlingly different approaches and conclusions on these complex issues. The contrasting epigraphs that begin the works perfectly reflect their respective perspectives.To be fair, the conflict in visions is less stark than it seems because the two authors are focused on different time periods. \u201cTroublemakers\u201d covers \u201cthe generational handoff\u201d that happened between the late 1960s and the early \u201980s \u201cas pioneers of the semiconductor industry passed the baton to younger up-and-comers.\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s ire primarily targets those \u201cwho helped nurture the World Wide Web to prosperity in the 1990s before turning to investing.\u201dOne does not have to be sympathetic to a more benign view of the technology industry to appreciate Ms. Berlin\u2019s deeply researched and dramatic narrative of Silicon Valley\u2019s early years in \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d To tell this story, she selects seven lesser-known but influential figures to follow closely throughout that period. These include the first woman to take a technology company public, the first chairman of Apple, and a man who played critical roles in government to create the internet and in industry to commercialize it through the personal computer. Their names will most likely be unfamiliar, but their meticulously told stories permit the reader to gain a nuanced understanding of the emergence of the broader technology ecosystem that has enabled Silicon Valley to thrive.Nuance is not a word that comes to mind in reading Mr. Cohen\u2019s attack on Silicon Valley\u2019s powers that be. The first two chapters are devoted to key figures in the history of Stanford\u2019s administration and computer science department, emphasizing both the university\u2019s willingness to trade off academic rigor for financial gain and its institutional sympathy for eugenics in the early 1900s and, more recently, extreme libertarianism. These underlying themes, in Mr. Cohen\u2019s view, underpin \u201cthe Stanford model of integrating the hacker and the entrepreneur.\u201d This model is reflected in staking William Hewlett and David Packard in the 1930s, establishing the Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950s and obtaining a $336 million payout from Google stock in return for granting the exclusive PageRank license.It is this unholy alliance between hacker and entrepreneur values that Mr. Cohen rails against for the balance of the book. Although he pauses for a handful of pages to speak about Microsoft \u2014 \u201cIf the Know-It-Alls\u2019 values represent a merger of a hacker\u2019s radical individualism and an entrepreneur\u2019s greed, then only one man can be considered their forefather: Bill Gates\u201d \u2014 he believes that the negative ramifications \u201conly fully flourished with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web starting in the late 1990s.\u201d And so beginning with Marc Andreessen, who developed the first commercialized web browser, Netscape Navigator, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d proceeds to attack the character of just about every boldfaced name among tech billionaires. All are found guilty of either always promoting the insidious tech dogma that places no constraints on their ability to disrupt the status quo for their own financial gain or \u2014 as in the case of the once idealistic founders of Google and Facebook \u2014 having along the way been \u201cseduced by the power and money offered by venture capitalists.\u201dThe history that underpins that overarching thesis feels both selective and less than rigorous. Niels Reimers, the founder of Stanford\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and one of the seven key industry figures profiled in detail in \u201cTroublemakers,\u201d is not even mentioned in \u201cThe-Know-It-Alls.\u201d Given the complex negotiations required to secure university approval, this seems like a significant oversight for a book whose thesis hinges in part on Stanford\u2019s supposed unthinking commercialism. And statements like computer science was \u201cstill something of an obscure discipline in the late 1980s\u201d just don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. By 1990, there were almost 800 computer science degree programs offered at colleges and universities, enrolling tens of thousands of students.Although Mr. Cohen has identified legitimately disturbing aspects of the tech culture, he becomes repetitive, and his tone is unnecessarily conspiratorial. He also ignores when the facts contradict his assertions. Mr. Cohen complains about the \u201cPayPal mafia,\u201d former employees who \u201cprovided each other with cash, counsel and contacts.\u201d Mr. Cohen finds \u201csomething jarring about a group of self-styled survival of the fittest free marketeers committing to a strategy of collective risk and mutual support.\u201dWhen the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is profiled as a contrast to the libertarian fanaticism and raw commercialism of the Know-It-Alls, his inability to raise funding is used to reinforce this point: \u201cWales and his partners had no rich friends to lean on in tough times.\u201d The narrative makes clear, however, that his problem was a flawed business model, not his lack of access to the PayPal mafia or other venture investors. Similarly, Mr. Cohen does not directly confront the irony that the story of Wikipedia\u2019s ultimate success was made possible only by its free-riding on Google\u2019s powerful \u2014 but in his view morally suspect \u2014 search engine.The tech industry has earned a takedown book that documents its self-interested justifications for any number of policies that are clearly not in the public interest. Its track record on matters including cybersecurity, gender equality and privacy is shameful. The brief profiles of \u201cThe Know-It Alls,\u201d sprinkled with gratuitous ad hominem observations (for example, Mr. Cohen writes that PayPal is responsible for \u201creleasing into the wild a self-satisfied Peter Thiel, a one-man wrecking crew who has been sowing chaos through American society up to this very day\u201d), do not get the job done.Given the profound impact on our lives of the technology industry and the apparent flaws in its current culture, both books leave the reader wondering where to go from here. \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d suggests that \u201cEurope provides a model\u201d relying on extensive regulation but, given the absence of any European tech giants of note, this seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Although the compelling history in \u201cTroublemakers\u201d provides a number of tantalizing clues as to where things got off track, this is not the focus of the book. Ms. Berlin does not whitewash the aspects of even the valley\u2019s early years that foreshadow the more profound cultural issues to emerge in the industry\u2019s middle age, writing, \u201cIt takes a certain kind of audacity to think you can launch a company, much less invent an industry \u2014 and audacity often veers into arrogance.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to explore their implications, either.When the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor is discussed, William Shockley is mentioned in passing, but Ms. Berlin notes that he \u201chad not yet fully descended into the paranoia and eugenic fervor that would later mar his reputation.\u201d In fact, his paranoia and abusiveness at least were already well known and, given that these qualities have been recurring contemporary industry themes, would have been worth examining.Similarly, when it\u2019s noted that a key to the venture capitalist Don Valentine\u2019s success was his willingness to overlook \u201cdeviant\u201d behavior, some discussion of the downside of letting the hacker culture run wild might have made sense.Silicon Valley\u2019s history is still being written. Both of these books are important reminders that whether or not it is ultimately a story with a happy ending will be a function of our collective willingness to closely examine the sector\u2019s origins to better understand not only the sources of innovation but how the most destructive aspects of the culture were allowed to fester for so long.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Broadcom Targets Qualcomm in Largest-Ever Tech Deal", "Date": "2017-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Hock Tan studiously avoided the limelight, even as he built a onetime division of Hewlett-Packard into what is now Broadcom, a semiconductor maker whose chips help power the newest iPhone.On Monday, another reason for the move became apparent. Mr. Tan announced that his company had offered to buy another major chip maker, Qualcomm, for $105 billion, in what would be the biggest takeover in the history of the technology industry. The combined company\u2019s products would touch nearly every smartphone in the world.It is a deal that may be more likely to receive regulatory approval with Broadcom based in the United States \u2014 and with the president on Mr. Tan\u2019s side.But Broadcom\u2019s takeover bid comes as big technology companies are facing ever more political scrutiny. Politicians have been voicing concerns about the influence of technology companies, while President Trump has taken a dim view of foreign acquisitions.Mr. Tan has long been known as a savvy deal maker who led consolidation in the chip industry. If he pulls this deal off, his political maneuvering could be used as a sort of template for other executives.Complications are already adding up. Qualcomm is expected to reject the bid as opportunistic and too cheap. And analysts and investors have raised the prospect that a merger of the two companies might be blocked by government regulators, either on antitrust grounds or because Broadcom could still be considered a foreign company buying sensitive technology.But Mr. Tan and his team have already made moves to address some of those issues. Publicly, Broadcom said the plan to move its legal headquarters to the United States was tied to Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code, including the cutting of corporate tax rates. But getting on the good side of the Trump administration \u2014 which will have a say in takeovers like the Qualcomm bid \u2014 was another factor, according to a person briefed on the matter.In an interview, Mr. Tan, 65, played down any connection between his headquarters announcement at the White House and the Qualcomm bid, asserting that the timing had been coincidental.\u201cWe think very long term,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we perceive is that the business environment has steadily improved. As we want to grow our business in the long term, that makes it easier to choose to redomicile in the U.S. to sustain our growth trends.\u201dThat Mr. Tan is in the driver\u2019s seat for consolidation in the chip industry reflects his unlikely rise in the technology world. At the White House last Thursday, he recounted being \u201can 18-year-old skinny kid\u201d from Malaysia who had been able to attend M.I.T. only because he won a scholarship.He eventually jumped into the chip business, showing off a mastery of operations and an eye for high finance and deal making. Mr. Tan ended up at Broadcom\u2019s predecessor, Avago Technologies, in 2006, soon after the investment firms Silver Lake and KKR bought the company. Avago\u2019s corporate history can be traced back to Hewlett-Packard.Much of Mr. Tan\u2019s tenure since then has been spent thinking about the long-term future of the semiconductor business. He has long been a proponent of consolidation, buying established chip franchises with healthy profit margins and selling off the parts that are not financially successful.Mr. Tan\u2019s deal-making streak began in earnest in 2013, when Avago bought LSI, a maker of networking chips, for $6.6 billion. Two years later, Avago bought Emulex for $606 million, and then the much-bigger Broadcom for $37 billion. The deal for Qualcomm would be $130 billion including debt.Mr. Tan has for years pushed growth by acquisition. Underpinning the strategy is a recognition that the semiconductor business has largely matured. The rate of revolutionary change has slowed, and chip companies have focused more on price competition, leading to lower profit margins. His approach has been to gain scale by buying market leaders and then running those companies more efficiently \u2014 while also investing in technologies that customers like Apple want.\u201cHock\u2019s competitive advantage comes from understanding customer needs and market shifts in the chip space better than anyone in the world,\u201d Kenneth Hao, a managing partner at Silver Lake who helped bring Mr. Tan to Avago, said in a statement.But consolidation has led to concerns that the chip industry could become concentrated in the hands of just a few big players. Qualcomm itself is in the midst of acquiring NXP Semiconductor for $38.5 billion, while Broadcom is still awaiting national security approval for its $5.5 billion takeover of Brocade Communications.Some analysts have wondered whether Broadcom, with Singapore as its legal headquarters, could face issues with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government group that examines takeovers for threats to national security. But while a deal could face such a review, neither company believes that it would be the main obstacle to a transaction getting done, according to several people briefed on the bid. Broadcom\u2019s operations are largely in the United States, and its legal base is in Singapore primarily because of that country\u2019s low tax rate.The biggest issue may simply be that Qualcomm believes the current offer, worth about $70 a share, is too low. Qualcomm\u2019s trove of patents \u2014 among the most formidable in the world of wireless networking \u2014 remains a hugely valuable asset. And the company could also believe that closing the NXP acquisition and reaching either a victory over or a settlement with Apple would lift its stock price.But Qualcomm, the longtime leader in cellphone chip technology, has been grappling with a sagging stock price and investor wariness that the Apple fight will continue for some time.On Monday, Qualcomm said that its board was weighing Broadcom\u2019s offer.Mr. Tan said in the interview that he believed that, should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, he could make peace with Apple.But to win over Qualcomm, Broadcom may need to do something it hasn\u2019t done before: wage a hostile takeover, including by replacing at least part of its quarry\u2019s board. Although Mr. Tan professed a desire to reach a consensual deal, he suggested that he was prepared to take whatever steps necessary to win.\u201cWe really know what our options are, and we haven\u2019t really eliminated them,\u201d he said.Ana Swanson, Cecilia Kang and Don Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kremlin Cash Behind Billionaire\u2019s Twitter and Facebook Investments", "Date": "2017-11-05", "News": "The Paradise PapersLeaked files show that a state-controlled bank in Moscow helped to fuel Yuri Milner\u2019s ascent in Silicon Valley, where the Russia investigation has put tech companies under scrutiny.Supported byNow, leaked documents examined by The New York Times offer a partial answer: Behind Mr. Milner\u2019s investments in Facebook and Twitter were hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin.Obscured by a maze of offshore shell companies, the Twitter investment was backed by VTB, a Russian state-controlled bank often used for politically strategic deals.Ultimately, Mr. Milner\u2019s companies came to own more than 8 percent of Facebook and 5 percent of Twitter, helping earn him a place on various lists of the world\u2019s most powerful business people. His companies sold those holdings several years ago, but he retains investments in several other large technology companies and continues to make new deals. Among Mr. Milner\u2019s current investments is a real estate venture founded and partly owned by Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser.Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have become a major focus of federal investigations into Kremlin interference in the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators are examining how Russians linked to the Kremlin turned the sites into garden hoses of bogus news stories and divisive political ads, and whether they coordinated with the Trump campaign.No one has suggested that Mr. Milner or his companies had any connection to the propaganda operation. For his part, Mr. Milner said in a pair of recent interviews that the Russian government money was no different from the financing he had received from his many other investors around the world.Even so, his use of the state-directed apparatus employed by so many Russian oligarchs to enrich themselves shows how the Kremlin has extended its long financial arm not only to his company but to some of America\u2019s technology giants.\u201cKremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind \u2014 not just commercial interests but state interests as well,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. \u201cThey go hand in hand.\u201dMr. Carpenter added, \u201cOligarchs who receive significant amounts of financial support from Russian banks like VTB or Sberbank or Gazprombank have to pass above a political threshold, meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia\u2019s crony capitalist system.\u201dThere is nothing illegal about foreign state-owned institutions investing in American companies. VTB and Gazprom said the transactions were both sound investments, not motivated by political considerations.As Mr. Milner sees it, the story is similarly simple \u2014 \u201cnothing more than business,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are getting money, and we are putting them in Facebook and Twitter. We are making money for our limited partners, and we are giving money back to them. For me, it\u2019s a commercial arrangement.\u201dMr. Milner, 55, studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University before moving to the United States, where he attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and then worked for the World Bank in Washington.Mr. Milner eventually teamed with Alisher Usmanov \u2014 an Uzbek-Russian oligarch close to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev \u2014 and a former Goldman Sachs executive to build a large stake in Mail.ru, a Russian internet company that now trades on the London Stock Exchange.Mr. Milner\u2019s initial American investments came as he served on an innovation commission set up in 2009 by Mr. Medvedev, who was Russia\u2019s president at the time and is something of a tech enthusiast, famously touring Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with Steve Jobs.In May 2009, Facebook announced an investment of roughly $200 million by Mr. Milner\u2019s company, Digital Sky Technologies, and said the company planned to spend at least $100 million buying additional stock. Eventually, Mr. Milner\u2019s new venture capital firm, DST Global, also amassed a significant stake in Facebook.\u201cA number of firms approached us, but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.The documents reviewed by The Times reveal that DST brought something else as well: a connection \u2014 through a succession of shell companies \u2014 to the Kremlin.In those years, as part of its diplomatic \u201creset\u201d with Moscow, the Obama administration was encouraging Russia to learn from the American technology industry. Importing tech knowledge, the theory went, would ease Russia\u2019s dependence on exporting oil and gas.For the Facebook deal, it was Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas giant, that became the bridge. The company, a vital component of the Putin government, has employed its financial subsidiary, Gazprom Investholding, to reclaim assets privatized during the 1990s.Gazprom Investholding is \u201cused for politically important and strategically important deals for the Kremlin,\u201d said Ilya Zaslavskiy, a contributor to the Kleptocracy Initiative, a project of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Both VTB and Gazprom Investholding\u2019s parent, Gazprom, are under United States sanctions stemming from Russia\u2019s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.Kanton, based in the British Virgin Islands, had numerous ties to Mr. Milner\u2019s backer, Mr. Usmanov.Kanton was owned by a longtime Usmanov business associate, and was controlled by Matthias Bolliger, a director of numerous subsidiaries of Mr. Usmanov\u2019s main holding company, USM Holdings, according to an Appleby memo and the Panama Papers. And an email sent by a trust company on the Isle of Man used by Mr. Usmanov referred to Kanton as a \u201cprivate investment company, (facebook and twitter).\u201dIn the interviews, Mr. Milner said his investors\u2019 identities were not generally public information. And he sought to distance his company from Mr. Usmanov. \u201cI had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us,\u201d he said. What\u2019s more, he said, Mr. Usmanov had many potential sources of financing, making it impossible to know whether money from Gazprom Investholding was even used to finance his stake in Facebook.To demonstrate this, Mr. Milner set out a series of clear plastic cups with labels like \u201cAlleged Russian government funds,\u201d \u201cMr. Usmanov\u201d and \u201cFacebook.\u201d He pulled out a large bag of green M&M\u2019s, filled several cups and proceeded to shift the M&M\u2019s from one cup to another. \u201cMoney is fungible,\u201d he explained, adding, \u201cYou can\u2019t just say that this specific dollar went all the way to Facebook.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Usmanov, Rollo Head, did not address specific questions. But in a statement, he insisted that there are clear streams of money that do not mingle. Mr. Usmanov, he said, \u201cdid not borrow from or use state or quasi-state funds to make investments in Facebook.\u201dThe Facebook deal was a case study in the way Russia\u2019s oligarchs have mixed public and private roles for their own, and their government\u2019s, benefit: Even as he was investing in Facebook, Mr. Usmanov was general director of Gazprom Investholding.In fact, Mr. Usmanov had often intertwined his government position with his personal deals, according to a report by the global investigations and security firm Kroll. Kroll described those arrangements as \u201csynergies.\u201dThe Kroll report \u2014 a \u201creputation audit\u201d \u2014 had been commissioned by Mr. Usmanov as he set out to burnish his image a year before his deal with Mr. Milner to invest in Facebook. Kroll investigators, relying on public records and interviews, detailed a long and colorful history: time in prison in Uzbekistan (he was later exonerated) and past associations with alleged Russian organized crime figures, according to a draft copy of the report reviewed by The Times.The investigators also recounted a dizzying number of deals \u2014 involving mining, media and technology companies, often with the assistance of the Kremlin and Mr. Medvedev. \u201cUsmanov looks set to end the Putin era as the \u2018most improved\u2019 oligarch over the past eight years,\u201d one source told Kroll.Kroll investigators found that, for some investments, Mr. Usmanov turned to Kanton, the company that would be a part of Mr. Milner\u2019s Facebook investment.A Facebook spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, declined to answer specific questions about the deal with DST, calling it a \u201cpassive investor\u201d and noting that the company had invested and cashed out several years ago.Gazprom Investholding called the loans \u201cprudent,\u201d saying they were \u201cprovided for general corporate purposes\u201d at above-market rates. The company did not answer a question about what role, if any, Mr. Usmanov played in the loans, except to say that as its general director, he \u201coperated in accordance\u201d with the company\u2019s charter.To complete the Facebook deal, DST used a pair of lawyers based in Cyprus and Britain who have also set up offshore entities for Russian oligarchs close to Mr. Putin, according to the Panama Papers, United States securities filings and records from Appleby. DST did not answer questions about how it came to use the two lawyers.After the Facebook deal, Mr. Milner became a fixture in Silicon Valley, spending about $100 million on a 25,000-square-foot house in Los Altos Hills and investing $7 billion in more than 30 companies, including Spotify, Airbnb and Groupon.In interviews, he has referred to his close relationship to management at the companies in which he invests. Mr. Milner and Mr. Zuckerberg became friends and met monthly. Still, despite his company\u2019s sizable stake, Mr. Milner did not take a board seat or voting rights.At the 2010 technology conference in San Francisco, Mr. Milner was asked if he provided management with advice along with his cash. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually the opposite,\u201d he replied. \u201cI sometimes get informal advice from them.\u201dMr. Milner\u2019s roughly $380 million investment in Twitter was directly backed by another instrument of Kremlin power: Russia\u2019s second-largest bank, VTB.Sixty-one percent of the bank is owned by the Russian government. VTB\u2019s president, Andrey L. Kostin, is a former Soviet diplomat; Matthias Warnig, on the bank\u2019s supervisory council, is a former East German spy who served in Dresden while Mr. Putin was stationed there with the K.G.B.Last year, the Panama Papers revealed that a Cyprus bank owned by VTB was used to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to accounts connected to Sergei Roldugin, a cellist and close friend of Mr. Putin. It was unknown what the money was for, but some speculated that he was working as a frontman for Kremlin insiders.Mr. Roldugin did not respond to messages for this article, but said at the time that his wealth came through donations from rich businessmen for the purchase of musical instruments. VTB called the account in the Panama Papers \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d\u201cVTB is really a slush fund for Putin,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, and an early economic adviser to the post-Soviet Russian government. The bank, he added, is \u201cthe black cashier of the Putin crowd.\u201dMr. Milner\u2019s Twitter deal is a complex web of share transfers and offshore financial entities. But its details may offer clues that there was a strategic motive behind VTB\u2019s involvement.In July 2011, VTB invested at least $191 million in exchange for shares of an Isle of Man company called DST Investments 3, corporate records show. That offshore vehicle was used to buy roughly half of DST Global\u2019s stake in Twitter that month. DST Investments 3 also issued shares to Kanton, the company linked to Mr. Usmanov that was at the center of the Facebook deal.The Twitter deal had a notable feature: VTB put virtually all of the cash into DST Investments 3, filings show. Kanton contributed almost none. It is highly unusual for investors in DST funds to get stakes without contributing cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.On May 7, 2014 \u2014 six months after Twitter\u2019s initial public offering, when insiders were first permitted to sell their shares \u2014 VTB transferred the bulk of its stake in DST Investments 3 to Kanton. DST also cashed out its Twitter investment.DST had one other investment from VTB, which Mr. Milner compared to a sovereign wealth fund. VTB was an investor in the Chinese internet company JD.com as recently as February 2015, when it transferred its stake to Kanton, Isle of Man records show.In a statement, VTB said its involvement with Twitter was \u201csolely a financial investment,\u201d sold for a profit, one of several successful deals in the high-tech industry in that period.

{"Headline": "Why the AT&T-Time Warner Merger Makes Sense", "Date": "2017-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCombining AT&T, which distributes digital content over its wireless networks, with a news and entertainment provider like Time Warner is what economists and antitrust experts consider a classic vertical merger. Because the companies don\u2019t compete, their combining would not alter the competitive landscape in either the telecommunications or entertainment industries.For more than 40 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the courts have not blocked a vertical integration like this one.Typically more problematic for the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division are horizontal mergers, where two competitors in the same industry seek to combine. But this past summer the Trump administration waved through the horizontal merger of the giant retailer Amazon, already active in food sales, with a leading upscale grocer, Whole Foods. To now block a vertical integration of AT&T and Time Warner would indicate an inexcusably scattershot approach to antitrust decisions that would create enormous uncertainties for the broader business community and shake public confidence in the rule of law that underpins our democracy.Businesses seek to integrate vertically because such mergers tend to create efficiencies and synergies \u2014 benefiting both companies without posing major risks to their competitors or, more crucially, to consumers. With all the options available to consumers for receiving video programming these days \u2014 including cable, satellite, internet broadband and smartphones \u2014 the market is vibrantly, almost chaotically, competitive and innovative. When viewed in light of this creative turmoil, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction does not pose a competitive threat. If anything, it would create an attractive set of new options for the viewing public.To appreciate the dynamism of the video and television space, consider that Apple, a relatively new entrant, recently ordered two full seasons of Reese Witherspoon\u2019s latest television show without so much as seeing a pilot. It underscored the competitive new dynamics of the marketplace: Companies are throwing around cash like never before to attract viewers already happily distracted by an array of programming and viewing alternatives in this new golden age of television.Rather than Time Warner holding anything resembling a dominant position in the entertainment industry, it finds itself competing with emerging video powerhouses like Netflix and Amazon. And consumers are increasingly cutting the cable because they have numerous, often cheaper streaming options for getting content they want.How do we know? One need only look at perhaps the closest comparison to the AT&T-Time Warner merger \u2014 the marriage of the nation\u2019s largest cable and internet broadband provider, Comcast, to NBC Universal, which the Justice Department blessed in 2011. Despite the arguments of opponents at the time, there has been no negative impact to consumers or competitors. Quite the opposite \u2014 the competitive and creative forces that continue to change the industry have only accelerated since the Comcast-NBC merger.If the Justice Department cannot cite persuasive antitrust grounds for blocking the AT&T-Time Warner merger, the public will be left wondering whether political motives were involved or that the department\u2019s thinking was muddied by vague opposition to media consolidation. Neither of those reasons would likely stand up in federal court.By any objective analysis, the real power in the information industry these days is not in the wireless or entertainment industries. It is in companies like Google and Facebook, which possess the power to influence our national elections and redefine basic human interactions. In this brave new digital world, blocking the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would only undermine public confidence in the ability of antitrust enforcers to recognize reality.Instead, the Justice Department should approve the merger and get to work policing the real threats to competition and consumer welfare.Michael J. Santorelli is the director of the Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute at New York Law School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Qualcomm Became Vulnerable to a Takeover Bid", "Date": "2017-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySteven Mollenkopf, the chief executive of the chip maker Qualcomm, views the company\u2019s recent patent dispute with Apple and antitrust scrutiny from regulators worldwide as elaborate price negotiations.When asked about the bitter conflict with Apple, which has battered Qualcomm\u2019s profits, Mr. Mollenkopf said his company\u2019s position was simple: There is a contract in place.\u201cThat contract has been in existence for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really anything new going on.\u201dBut a lot about the cellphone industry has changed since that contract was signed nearly a decade ago. Those shifts, including the companies that dominate the industry, help explain the challenges Qualcomm faces from big customers like Apple and Samsung and antitrust watchdogs around the globe.Several forces are working against Qualcomm, including the rise of China as both the dominant smartphone manufacturer and a huge consumer market, and the growing clout of the Apple and Samsung brands.But perhaps as much as anything, the smartphone inventions that attract consumers today are not provided by Qualcomm.In earlier generations of products, faster wireless connections sold new phones. Today, people walk into stores looking for an Apple iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, and ask about features like the size of the screen, the camera, and its memory and storage capacity.\u201cAll these technologies have little or nothing to do with Qualcomm,\u201d said Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet. \u201cThe landscape, the environment has changed.\u201dThese technologies have enriched the smartphone experience and driven up the price, especially for top-of-the-line iPhones and Galaxy models.But what has generally not changed is Qualcomm\u2019s licensing formula \u2014 typically charging fees of about 5 percent of the wholesale price of a phone, analysts say, even though its technology accounts for less of the value of many smartphone models.That position has increasingly irritated big customers like Apple and Samsung and contract manufacturers like Foxconn, which is Apple\u2019s major supplier. (The contract manufacturers are usually the ones that directly pay fees to Qualcomm, and receive pass-through payments from Apple and others.)The other Qualcomm practice that has prompted scrutiny from various antitrust investigators is charging smartphone makers license fees whether or not they use Qualcomm chips, because of the strength of its patents.As part of the settlement, Qualcomm agreed to license some of its patents to Chinese handset makers at lower rates. Analysts estimate that Qualcomm\u2019s overall royalty rates in China were cut by as much as half, to about 2.5 percent.The settlement allowed Qualcomm to keep operating in the vast Chinese market and smoothed relations with government officials there. This week, Mr. Mollenkopf is traveling with President Trump in China.In other antitrust cases, Qualcomm paid South Korea $853 million in December and Taiwan $773 million last month.In the United States, an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission is underway. Shortly after the commission\u2019s move in January, Apple sued Qualcomm, claiming unfair patent-licensing practices.Apple declined to comment on its chip plans or how a Broadcom acquisition might affect its patent suit against Qualcomm. Analysts say Apple has already been exploring whether to work with other chip makers, or design its own chips.Already, though, Apple is not making pass-through payments to its contract manufacturers for Qualcomm royalty payments. In turn, those payments \u2014 an estimated $2.5 billion a year \u2014 are not made to Qualcomm. Qualcomm has said another major company, which it has not named, has stopped paying license fees of $1 billion a year.In the fiscal year ended in September, the company reported net income of $2.5 billion, less than half of the $5.7 billion in the previous year.\u201cThings went off the cliff pretty quickly, mainly because of Apple,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research.Mr. Mollenkopf, 48, has worked at Qualcomm for more than two decades, starting as a bench engineer. He is the first chief executive of Qualcomm who was not part of the founding family. Irwin Jacobs co-founded Qualcomm in 1985 and headed the company until 2005, when his son Paul became chief executive. Paul Jacobs is executive chairman today.Mr. Mollenkopf was elevated to the top job in 2014, after his name surfaced as a candidate to succeed Steven Ballmer as chief executive of Microsoft. Analysts say he has been a champion of Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to build a third large business alongside patent licensing and chips.\u201cHe really understands that Qualcomm\u2019s future depends on its ability to diversify beyond its core smartphone heartland,\u201d said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, a technology research firm.Past efforts faltered. For example, Qualcomm invested hundreds of millions of dollars in a unit called MediaFlo, which tried to develop a content delivery service for smartphones. It folded that business, but did sell much of the unit\u2019s assets and technology to AT&T for $1.9 billion in 2010.Qualcomm\u2019s big bet for the future is 5G technology. The next generation of wireless communications technology holds the potential to connect billions of devices to the internet, from cars to sensor-filled clothes.A pending $39 billion purchase of NXP, whose specialized chips with beefed-up security are used in some cars and mobile payment systems, would be a big step toward that hoped-for third leg. The deal has been slowed by regulatory reviews.In a conference call with analysts last week, Mr. Mollenkopf pointed to the 5G future, declaring that Qualcomm was \u201cleading the industry.\u201dThe 5G story is likely to play a prominent role in Qualcomm\u2019s effort to stay independent or at least drive up the price Broadcom eventually pays.\u201cIts strongest hand is the promise of 5G and that its leadership position will lead to an explosion of demand for its technology,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, who has written case studies on Qualcomm.Still, 5G devices are not expected to reach the market in volume until 2019 \u2014 and the patience of Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders is uncertain.Don Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Unveils Its Driverless Cars, Aiming to Lead the Pack", "Date": "2017-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For more than a year, General Motors has tantalized investors with plans to build its future around self-driving cars.It has regularly announced big investments and progress reports, but the company has kept its prototype vehicles largely under wraps \u2014 until now.On Thursday, G.M. will demonstrate its growing fleet of computer-operated, battery-powered Chevrolet Bolts in San Francisco to dozens of investment analysts, who are eager to evaluate the automaker\u2019s advanced test vehicles.The event represents a critical step for G.M. as it seeks to establish leadership in the hotly contested race to bring driverless cars to market.And although G.M. has been reluctant to show off the cars it has developed through a subsidiary, Cruise Automation, the company now wants to prove that self-driving models are getting closer to general use.\u201cEverything we are doing is geared to speed,\u201d G.M.\u2019s president, Daniel Ammann, told journalists at an event showcasing the cars on Tuesday.To emphasize the company\u2019s progress, Mr. Ammann said the cars would be ready for consumer applications in \u201cquarters, not years.\u201dMeeting that goal would probably give G.M., the nation\u2019s largest automaker, a jump on other companies developing self-driving models.Industry analysts say autonomous vehicles could generate billions of dollars in additional revenue and profit for automakers and technology companies, primarily by selling or leasing them to ride-hailing services, taxi fleets and delivery companies.For G.M., the self-driving program is a cornerstone to long-term growth that is not dependent on simply selling vehicles to individual drivers.\u201cG.M. has changed the narrative of the company\u2019s future,\u201d Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a research report on Tuesday.Other automakers, such as Ford Motor, Volkswagen and Toyota, are pushing to accelerate their own electric and autonomous-vehicle programs.The field is also crowded with competitors from Silicon Valley, such as Google, Apple, Uber and the electric-car maker Tesla.G.M. has a blend of financial resources, automotive experience and management resolve that position it strongly to compete with other automakers and big tech companies. But it also has a legacy of failures to overcome \u2014 none bigger than its collapse into bankruptcy in 2009.The scandal slowed G.M.\u2019s comeback, but it also galvanized its executives to focus on making its cars safer, and ultimately to pursue development of fully autonomous vehicles.\u201cG.M. is a much more entrepreneurial company now than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said David E. Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cThat has happened since the bankruptcy \u2014 the fact they are no longer wedded to doing things the way they did in the past.\u201dIn the summer of 2015, Ms. Barra and other senior G.M. executives began a series of visits to California, to study advances in self-driving cars and to scout potential partners in developing autonomous models.In addition to observing how companies like Google were developing driverless technology, the executives became acquainted with work being done by Cruise Automation, a tiny start-up working out of a San Francisco warehouse.By February of last year, officials decided that if G.M. was serious about the race to build the car of the future, it had to move quickly \u2014 or risk falling further behind.\u201cWe had to be very honest with ourselves,\u201d Mr. Ammann recalled recently. \u201cThere were some capabilities we did not have and that we needed to have if we really wanted to pursue this.\u201dAnd it was up to Mr. Ammann \u2014 an industry outsider born in New Zealand who worked as a Wall Street investment banker before joining G.M. \u2014 to deliver the crucial piece.He concluded that the perfect match was Cruise, which had fewer than 40 employees but was moving quickly to retrofit basic cars with its self-driving equipment.\u201cWhat they brought us was exactly what we were missing,\u201d Mr. Ammann said.Kyle Vogt, Cruise\u2019s co-founder and software guru, said that he had been intrigued by G.M.\u2019s interest, but hesitant to rush into a partnership with a huge, century-old automaker from Detroit.But after several one-on-one meetings with Mr. Ammann, he became convinced that G.M.\u2019s manufacturing expertise could greatly advance Cruise\u2019s mission.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cDan said to me, \u2018You want to take the chaos off the roads by introducing this great technology \u2014 can you really deny that we would get there much faster working together?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Vogt said.Mr. Vogt had learned the pitfalls of trying to adapt mainstream cars with expensive cameras, sensors and electronic equipment for use on public roadways. Converting a handful of such vehicles was a challenge. Producing fleets of them seemed beyond Cruise\u2019s abilities.\u201cYou don\u2019t see any start-ups building iPhones,\u201d he said.While Cruise began expanding its San Francisco operation to what is now nearly 400 employees, G.M. set up a team of hundreds of engineers at its technical center in Warren, Mich., to support the self-driving program.A G.M. vice president, Doug Parks, was assigned to work daily with Mr. Vogt and his California team. Together, they designed self-driving Bolts to the safety and quality standards that G.M. applied to its regular cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles.\u201cWe are working fast and furiously,\u201d said Mr. Parks, an engineer who has worked for G.M. for 33 years. \u201cIt is super exciting, and I love what the company is becoming.\u201dMr. Vogt is keen to prove that self-driving models can navigate complex urban environments such as downtown San Francisco, rather than just highways and suburban streets.On Tuesday, journalists from news organizations including The New York Times were given rides in the demonstration models.For 20 minutes, the self-driving Bolts traversed the hilly, narrow and congested streets of the city\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood \u2014 stopping for pedestrians, slowing to pass double-parked vehicles, navigating gently away from bicycles.A Cruise employee was behind the steering wheel, ready to assume control of the car if it misjudged traffic or was headed for a collision. But during a reporter\u2019s ride, no driver intervention was required.The car traveled more slowly than driver-operated vehicles on the road, and seemed to exercise extreme caution rounding corners or avoiding obstacles. Yet it covered more than two miles without a hitch, despite encountering what its onboard computer said were 265 people, 49 bicycles and 489 cars.Mr. Ammann beamed when details of the test ride were shared, declaring, \u201cThis technology is coming along faster than anyone thinks.\u201dAdvertisement"}
